mega assembly elections in Karnataka the
election commission of India has now
released a report highlighting the
increase of seizures ahead of polling
the reporters recorded a significant 4.5
times increase in seizures in the state
compared to the 2018 assembly elections
we have the report with us we'll put it
out on our screens for our viewers what
is it the election commission has said
in its report
in this press note the election
commission of India has noted 4.5 times
increase in seizures marks increased
focus on expenditure monitoring in pole
going state of Karnataka seizures
totaling more than rupees 3700
375 crores pardon me recorded so far in
the ongoing Karnataka assembly elections
enforcement directory detaches assets
worth 288 crores after the imposition of
the MCC 146 expenditure observers
reputed in the state for stricter Visual
and monitoring 81 AC is marked as
expenditure sensitive constituencies
this is the report that has been
released by the election commission
which further states that the election
commission of India thrust on inducement
free elections from the past few
elections is continued and led to
sustained efforts for election
expenditure monitoring in the poll going
state of Karnataka the recorded seizures
in the state Market significant 4.5
times increases compared to assembly
elections of 2018 strict visual
extensive monitoring coordination with
neighboring states and into agency con
coordination has led to checking flow
and distribution of inducements in
Karnataka this time the details of the
seizure are as follows so we're looking
at
right here
147.46 crores worth of cash viewers has
been seized as can be seen as the figure
given here
96.60 crores worth of precious metals
have been seized this election season
24.21 crores worth of freebies have been
seized
83.66 crores worth of liquor has been
seized and
23.67 crores worth of drugs have been
seized in this election season so this
is these are the quantities and the
values that have been put out by the
election commission has pointed out
earlier 147 crores worth of cash but the
rest
big numbers come from liquor
distribution drugs distribution
distribution of precious metals and
freebies as well the quantity in fact of
Liquors goes into almost wow that's 22
lakh liters of liquor worth
83.66 crores has been seized from the
state of Karnataka by the election
commission drugs worth 23.67 crores and
value have also been seized as mentioned
above precious metals worth 96.60 crores
have also been seized and freebies worth
24.21 crores the total seizure then
comes to
375.61 crores as on 8th May 2023 so this
is these are just figures from yesterday
and the total seizures in the assembly
elections in 2018 were in fact just
83.93 crores so this is as the election
commission pointed out a significant
increase
of the BJP with us on the broadcast Mrs
sutadri uh of course this is uh slightly
disappointing news that comes ahead of
the elections the fact that uh there's a
four and a half times increase in terms
of freebies and cash and other gifts
liquor and drugs that have been seized
by the election commission this time
around as compared to last time sir
yeah basically
one positive thing here is the
play of money and other things to induce
voters towards them
has been talked by the
election commission's uh decision to
ride on various I mean various income
tax rights and other things which have
taken
and it is a good thing that
these items precious tones precious
metals or cash should the player should
not play a role in deciding the
majority of a candidate from the
constituency which means the Democracy
should be like if this activity
increases
the more and more features occur we know
things are changing and we are moving
towards a positive democracy where the
people choose the
team to rule them based on the
government's capability and also their
functional abilities
otherwise all these abilities and this
one will be covered by cash and money
which is not good for the country on a
long term basis
see I mean nobody can buy the positions
in this country in the democracy and to
make it these kind of Rights will have
to take place because this is the time
that the money will come out in the form
of cash and other things and also kind
of in the form of gold or silver or any
precious metals so this is something
that which is absolutely uh good from
the government of India that they are
doing this in the positive way
thank you so much so for joining us on
the broadcast I am calling madhu with me
also madhu a very important report
released by the election commission they
say that uh from last time around 2018
the total seizures in the Assembly
election was just uh at 83.93 crores of
course that figure in itself seems
extremely large but when you compare it
to this time around of uh
375.61 crores worth of seizures madhu
then it is quite a shocking figure this
time around of the cash and the liquor
and the drugs that have been seized
absolutely absolutely shocking figures
that the ECI you know has we were
revealed today and you know the ECA
infected in a statement that cash liquor
drugs and freebies meant for
distribution in Karnataka has increased
to 4.5 times compared to that during uh
2018 assembly polls it is said uh it
said that you know seizures was 375 Pros
have been recorded so far as opposed to
83.93 crores into 2018 and a total of
147.46 crores in cash liquor worth of
rupees not less than 83.66 close and
drugs worth you know more than 23.67
crores and also you know not to forget
the precious metals were also you know
seized by the election commission uh
worth rupees 90 96.60 crores and on the
previous worth the 24.21 crores have
been also received by a properties due
collections you know the Ed has attached
assets towards rupees 228 288 closed
since the imposition of model
and the details were also given as such
a driver you know the results are
increasing with Karnataka commissioner
features of 375.61 closed and you know
notable Halls includes the station of
4.04 crores cash in uh bangarapet AC uh
District
Hyderabad by intelligence gathered and
you know sales mapping or done by
lcbs in several areas is what the
election commission has said so far all
right madhu stay on with us with
sanagraj of the Congress also joining us
on the broadcaster troubling report
they're coming in by the election
commission which states that from last
time around there's a four and a half
times increase in terms of or all the
cash liquor drugs precious metals and
freebies there have been seized it's a
sizable chunk of money
375.61 crores worth of items have been
seized This Time Around by the election
commission in
why is it that we're not able to move on
from this sort of politics in our nation
yes so as I said the troubling report by
the election commission why are we not
being able to move forward from this
sort of politics wherein we have to pay
people to come and cast their vote
now you arrange the right issue if you
want to sustain the Democracy in a good
fashion as to the Norms of the
Constitution any government which is in
power should take the moral
responsibility of this kind of activity
what is going going on in the country
whether it's Karnataka or anywhere else
today you've seen hundreds of crores
office cash has been caught when
demonetization happen what did the
people say they said that nobody is
allowed to keep the cash in the houses
how the cash has been been found in
houses and latest houses or whichever
party they belong to is it fair is is
the Departments are doing it rightly or
not and also a mortgages
I found your gold items were found and
money was found what is going on if the
ruling parties don't set an example what
moral rights they have to talk about the
operation parties today everybody should
join hands to sustain the democracy and
it should be in such a way that the
democracy is not taken for granted an
election should happen free and paid and
definitely election Mission we have to
complement them they are doing good job
but they have been very selective they
are only targeting the opposition
leaders campaign Arena why are they not
uh catching over to the people of the
ruling party which they're doing which
are supposed to be called as the 40
percent sarkar and they should know that
all these families and Ministers of BJP
are definitely made money in the form of
cash and they're spending it now why are
they not catching all of them why are
they not taking action against them
whether it is Congress BJP or JDS it
doesn't matter they should not do such
kind of thing which is not acceptable to
Congress at all
and it should not have indicative at all
you'll see the democracy has been set in
not order and Election Commission
autonomous body and they should have
gone against the ruling governments
because there is a huge allocation of
corruption against the pdfp
okay so are you saying that only knowing
that knowing that they have not uh gone
and seen the places where visit we can
get what they're doing they're spending
money like anything just when giving
gold they're giving silver the impacted
some candidate factories where drugs
democracy is conducted
are you saying that this is only related
to the BJP that all of this cash liquor
drugs Etc have only been distributed by
the BJP I don't know maybe I I don't
want to do a hypocritical statement I
condemn anybody has done it anybody has
taken law into the hand anybody has done
corruption and trying to buy up the
water I am against it Congress is
against it no doubt about it we are
fighting against the BJP to can stop the
terminal uh polarization instead of
Karnataka and stop corruption huge
allocation against the previous
candidates are 40 position corruption
because those people are doing it I will
understand what they are doing they want
to retain power nothing else
what was he doing
the money has come
you have to go to the root of the
problem and they have to eradicate
whichever party it belongs to but

external affairs minister SJ Shankar in
Delhi he's of course on a three-day
visit to India at this point I'm being
joined by Foreign Affairs expert Sanjeev
srivastav joining us in the broadcaster
thank you for joining us sir uh earlier
of course we saw that Eli Cohen had with
gajendra singhawat science free mous
with India of course boosting trade ties
now we're seeing of course he's met with
the external affairs minister SJ Shankar
what can we expect from this particular
meeting and what sectors can we see more
cooperation on when it comes to trade
water in agriculture have been on the
cards do you think on green energy and
hydrogen green hydrogen can be some of
the areas where we can see more
cooperations of
certainly I think uh these are the key
areas as you mentioned that agriculture
water green hydrogen could be another
potential areas area where both the
countries can collaborate and it's a
it's a it's a huge you know
a big area and also with regard to
fighting to fight against climate change
both the countries are committed to
contribute their best so in that regard
the both the countries are committed to
you know enhance their you know uh
collaboration uh in the green hydrogen
sectors and obviously other than that uh
India and Israel both are very a robust
defense partner uh Partners too so I
think uh there are these are the key
areas uh defense uh counter-terrorism
water agriculture uh also green hydrogen
so these are the key areas where India
and Israel are going to be collaborating
with each other this partnership is
continuously growing deepening and as we
have been discussing since morning that
uh this partnership also is becoming
aesthetically very very significant uh I
too you too like initiatives are being
promoted and uh now after the signing
off of the Abraham records the
relationship uh between the UAE Saudi
Arabia and Israel have improved and uh
and in that relationship also uh India
has been giving is being given enormous
importance and that is why I too U2
initiative uh is very much a progressing
also uh what we have seen that uh the
widget of our national security advisors
and the kind of a meeting he has had
with the UAE uh NSA and also uh Saudi
Arabia uh security establishment and
understand also Jack Sullivan uh NSA of
the United States of America so this
shows the growing strategic importance
of India in the Middle Eastern you know
uh politics Middle Eastern situations
and uh and the bit we got to ensuring
our own interest I think India would
proactively engage with the countries of
the Middle East and Industry but our
collaboration with Israel is again very
significant so bilaterally and as well
as the multilaterally I think this
partnership is going to be very very
significant it is it is of enormous
significance and uh and that is why in
my view the widget of uh uh Israeli
foreign minister uh is very significant
it's unfortunate that because of certain
development inside Israel uh Israel's
Palestine issue he is going to cut short
his widget uh but uh what we have seen
is that there are series of widgets has
happened economy and trade Minister was
here and before that speaker of the
Israeli Parliament was here and now uh
Mr uh foreign minister of Israel is here
so I think this partnership is going to
grow in times ahead uh and India will
look forward to welcome uh prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu the sooner
he comes the better and I think the
relationship between the Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and our prime
minister SRI Narendra and the kind of
you know friendship they are have they
are having yeah I am very confident uh
that under the leadership of the both
respected leaders of our Nations this
partnership uh is going to be deepening
in times ahead right and sanjivastava
then what would you say are the areas
where we we don't already have enough
cooperation when it comes to Israel and
India and the focus must be put on that
more uh would you say in terms of making
trade uh in rupees uh a key Focus area
would you say that is some of the areas
that could be now focused on more
well uh aarti your wife is slightly
breaking could you repeat your question
please now right my question sir was do
you think uh the areas that could should
be focused on more uh are also there now
we've of course listed the focus that
India has been having with Israel when
it comes to trade talks do you think now
trading or or conducting trade in Indian
rupees now is which is being a focus
with other nations as well should
continue with Israel
yeah you know uh yeah these
possibilities are uh uh certainly there
and uh the entire you know world is uh
you know looking at uh and moving
towards the multilateral arrangements
and then in that regard and we have seen
already the kind of uh you know straight
ties we are having with uh Russia we are
trading with them uh in rugel too uh but
uh with regard to is our trade ties with
Israel I think there's no no such issues
involved and uh obviously we are having
a trade in dollar terms uh but yes uh in
future as we move more towards
multilateralism I think uh and the
future you know uh transaction mechanism
as and when it is evolving I mean there
is a possibility of having uh Israeli
our trade with Israel in in the Israeli
currency and Indian currency so I think
uh those possibilities are very much
there but if you look at the Israel's
relationship uh with the Western world
uh with the dollar dominated economies
obviously it's very good it's very deep
and obviously our relationship uh with
those countries the Western countries
United States of America European
countries it's a robust relationship and
uh I I think uh uh in in the foreseeable
future in my view that our trade with
Israel will continue in in dollar terms
only uh but yes as and when we move
towards the multilateralism uh those
possibilities of having uh trade in our
currencies is very much there right for

disgusting And discussing a bilateral

as
we're seeing an increase in cooperation
on trade between Israel and India now
our three mous have been signed between
India and Israel this course comes under
the presence of vajendra Singh shikawat
and of course the Israeli foreign
minister who's on a three-day visit to
India
all right I have joining us on the
broadcast Foreign Affairs expert Sanjay
Kapoor sir thank you for joining us for
seeing that uh more trade cooperation
happening between India and Israel uh we
have three mous that have been signed
between both countries sir as Israeli
foreign minister is in India for three
days
yes India in Israel have been close to
each other ever since Mr Modi came to
Palm in fact even before that and there
have been the areas of cooperation
between the two governments have readily
increased whether it is in the area of
Agriculture because
the agriculture Minister there has been
a great admiration for sprinkler
technology which has the profound its
way to many parts of the Agricultural
India and there are many more
Technologies as
has been offering to India because there
is admiration for the system that it
represents but at the same time the flip
side is that Israel is in a deep mess at
the moment there is a public
demonstration which is going on about
how the democracy has been endangered by
the attempt of the government to bring
in judicial reforms there is also the
bombings which are taking place in Gaza
Strip against the jihadis and there is a
certain kind of turmoil which keeps on
ratcheting up as uh in that in that
country besides that there is also the
presence of from the minister Jake
Sullivan from here U.S in Riyadh which
turned out to be an attempt by the U.S
government to bring Saudi Arabia close
to Israel and that is why our national
security advisor had gone there it was a
meeting between UAE India Saudi Arabia
and the US
I'm not very sure whether these rallies
were there or not but it as Israel is at
the center of that so India's engagement
with Israel takes place at different
levels in different geographies and that
is where I think we need to keep our
very close watch on that
take us through now the importance of
economic cooperation and trade between
India and Israel earlier as well we've
seen the economic Minister come to India
from Israel and we're seeing a lot of
mou sign of course we'll get more
details on what exactly are these mus
that have been signed between Israel and
India in this particular meeting but we
have seen for the past a few months more
cooperation in terms of water
agriculture
cooperation as well Israel of course we
know is is widely renowned for its water
conservation do you think now that is
something that we can pursue
yeah as I stated earlier there has been
a great admiration for
isn't to grow grass in very desert-like
environment India has large Parts which
are desert-like and they have been using
the technology with uh that you uh
Israel has to offer and not just that I
mean an area of defense there is a great
amount of cooperation we bought the
Bharat missile we have even Saturday
Cooperative cooperation in the satellite
area but what came under the Arc of
attack was what we really bought was the
surveillance technology we bought the
Pegasus which was uh in a certain way
condemned by the United States of
America and many other Democratic
countries as to how it used to include
into
yeah for the private spaces of many
people and that came under criticism uh
Pegasus is there there are other
surveillance technology that Israel
offers and I think there is one that is
likely to come India as very very soon
so there is as I said the cooperation at
different levels because I think
Israel uh come pushed together
intermediate technology which was both
with what emanation on at least maybe
that from the uh so uh
Russia or from the U.S so it works very
well with India for more such videos

is saying that I wonder if the matter is
subjudiced how can such a statement be
made this is of course the news of a
tracking for you at this point I have my
colleague Jeff still with us on the
broadcast Jai prakash take us to now
these developments that are coming in on
the broadcast uh that the Muslim
reservation issue in Karnataka has
reached the Supreme Court and we're
seeing that a senior Advocate has said
the the home minister has been making a
statement uh that the reservation will
be withdrawn
well that's right the last cabinet of
basaras Burma government saw uh uh
ratification by the cabinet that four
person reservation for Muslim which was
given in Category 2 and 2B was crap and
the Muslim reservation was moved in the
economically reconstruction category
whole of 10 now this four percent which
left was divided between the lingards
and uh the vocaligas and this was seen
as a tactical move on one hand you
appease the lingards and vocaligas on
the other hand you know pushed the
minorities to the economic section and
this in fact uh prompted many of uh the
Muslim minority people to approach the
Supreme Court there was a petition which
was filed and the case was uh heard now
initial stages the Supreme Court made
some very strong observations that you
cannot push the minorities or one
particular sales sect without a due
diligence or thought process and this
should have been done under
section 9 of a schedule line of the
Indian constitution now uh subsequently
the Supreme Court also had a put off the
hearing to nine which was today when the
matter came for hearing today uh I would
make uh I would just read out the
verbatim submissions which was made for
the councils for the minorities the
senior Advocate dushan Dave said the
statement may be extended till the next
date of hearing the home minister is
making statement that reservations for
Muslims has been withdrawn which means
that certain political statements which
was made during the public rallies
during the selections by Amit Shah one
such statement coming from here in
Karnataka the other one in Hyderabad
last week where he said that Muslim
reservation under category 2 and 2B was
unconstitutional because reservations is
predominantly done on caste basis and
not on religious basis and that his
government both at the center and the
state would see to it that it is removed
now when the case or the matter is
between is before the court such
statements is a matter of subsidies this
is the submission or rather this is the
observation made by Justice who was
hearing the case he said I wonder if the
matter is subjugates how can such
statements be made so the matter has now
been adjourned for further hearing of to
25th July but then this is also one of
the important factors the selection in

multiple gunshot wounds and some remain
in the hospital after the Fateful Texas
shooting now this particular crime is
still being investigated as more
information becomes known about the
people who died at the Allen Premium
Outlets mall we're learning that
Aishwarya tatikonda an Indian engineer
who lived in Dallas suburb of McKinney
was among those who were killed on that
fateful day now according to a family
representative vataticona was 27 and was
at the Island mall with a friend when
the shooting took place her friend was
wounded in the shooting and her family
is now planning to repatriate her
remains to India with the help of the
Telugu Association of North America
let me open in fact uh group Captain UK
devnar joining us in the broadcast as
the defense expert sir now it has become
quite uh the normal occurrence in the
United States at this point you know we
were discussing this earlier as well and
it is not a one-off incident or it is
not an incident that happens uh in a day
or two this is an epidemic in the
America now everyone owns a gun it is a
part of their rights but regulation is
something that they've clearly failed
sir
uh America is an adult rooms there is a
huge amount of confusion in U.S just now
what to do about gun lobbying till the
time the gun lobbying in America these
lobbies remain powerful America will not
find a solution only way to get out of
this solution is Americans to realize
that sale of gun is though it goes for
the commercial and Technical uh benefit
of their gun lobbying industrialists but
in the long run it is causing a huge
amount of social mental Agony to
American society they must overcome the
powerful lobbyists who work on behalf of
American Rifle Association these people
will go to any extent to give a
distorted
interpretation of
American costume they will quote uh you
know various Constitutional Amendments
which permit every American citizens uh
right to self-defense but being a
military person I will tell you there is
a difference between weapons which are
to be used for self-defense and weapons
which are to be used for offensive
purpose if I for example if India if I
apply for a weapon license uh I am
allowed to purchase a small caliber
weapon with less powerful which can just
fire up to a small distance so because
I'll be using it for self-defense only
and similarly my weapon will be able to
just fire a few rounds uh one at a time
whereas in USA their Rifle Association
has ensured that law is interpreted in
such a manner that any U.S citizen can
walk into any weapon store gun store and
purchase just on produce of some nominal
documents something like they produce
and he can buy every happen not very no
police verification note right
and these weapons are very highly
powerful that is what is alarming uh
they can fire up to Great distance they
can fire multiple shots they can fire
like a small machine gun uh at a time 10
20 30 rounds like a machine gun
what required for self-defense yes right
absolutely sir and the West seems to you
know be mocking at certain instances the
fact that India's population is so large
uh but the fact that India successfully
managed to uh control a gun violence to
ensure like you said each bullet is
being taken into account in India is
something that the world needs to learn
from perhaps Ambassador now talking
about this particular incident sir uh
all right I'm being told that Robin the
search Dave is with us Global strategist
sir my question to you is we're learning
from information from local reports that
the person who had shot these people at
the mall was very wearing a right-wing
death squad um a patch on his shoulder
when he was shooting them uh so what was
the issue do you think that's happening
in America is it an issue of
radicalization is it an issue of hate
crimes or is it an issue of uh over the
years we've seen reports of how uh
inflation and the lack of jobs or
unemployment and homelessness sometimes
tends to create a mental disturbance
among the people and that happens over
the years through generations do you
think that is sort of the reason for
this epidemic that's happening in
America
thank you lucky I think it's a mix of
the it's a mix of the factors you listed
remember when Biden took office in 2020
January in his inauguration speech he
said that the number one problem facing
America is white racism he plain simple
said it that the biggest challenge for
America right now is white racism Nazism
knew whatever Etc so that is one
component out there uh the other
component as you rightly also pointed
out is definitely you know mental stress
or whatever you know that whole bucket
you know personal issues personal issues
whichever way be so these seem to be two
big buckets due to which people are kind
of uh you know picking up the guns and
doing what they do a couple of points as
group Captain very rightly said you see
it's the lobby but I would take it a bit
Step Ahead the lobby is not only the
suited booted guys in Washington DC of
the NRA you know lobbying that you know
allow the guns a vast number of
Americans want this okay a good number
of Americans want to keep guns and
therefore the lobby represents them okay
okay so there is a there is a
substantial base of folks who want now
why they want and what will happen in
the future
I think as America gets more divided
uh as there is more there are more
uncertainties and such as the
immigration issues in America keep on
you know growing
this constituency this segment of people
you know who believe that you know the
government is out to get them by the way
you know there's a large number of
people they want to keep guns for
protection they say that you know
someday the American government will
come and take away my home I need
Minecon I love hunting I need my gun I
need self-defense my gun right so these
folks are broadly speaking that's one
category also the white racist is
another category also right who is
picking the guns who's filled with
hatred so uh in the coming uh how many
times unfortunately all of these revives
in America are growing will keep growing
so therefore we will see more and more
of these incidents really unfortunate
now as far as what can be done yeah I
mean there's a tinkering going on you
know
shootings happen in a school what to do
okay throw more money and technology
that is put metal detectors on school
put CCTV cameras in schools in fact to
the extent some people also say that
give teachers guns to defend themselves
right so the idea in the U.S is that you
throw money and you throw technology and
the problem can be solved unfortunately
not all problems can be solved by three
money and Technology it's only half of
this problem the other half of this
problem is in the mind absolutely and in
the in the regulation which bans the
sales of the assault rifles the kind of
which group Captain is mentioning right
so these few things can be done but it's
a long term it's it's a long-term Hall
and U.S will continue to see this
tragedy unfolding every day virtually

single iota of proof against them yet
these attacks continue
many uh you cannot say that Congress is
a silent spectator for a kind
information you would like to know tell
you that this matter has been raised by

president Kumar has first he was the
first person who finally complained
against uh this liquor policy before the

Mr sharba the back and forth between the
ahmadni party continues Mr anujatre is
insisting that the Congress is not a
silent spectator they also want the
ahmadmi party to be taken to task for

things they do not answer they do not
talk why they are in English from two
percent to twelve percent nobody
understands
10 percent huge implement
in the same business we are even within

Witch Hunt the BJP is scared of the

by the very definition
of the language I am here speaking and I
have said this repeatedly and will
perhaps for my entire lifetime repeat
this because it is the truth
of my existence
I am a product
of Lord McCauley's minute
I have an Indian flag on my
breast
but I am
dressed in a suit and tie
speaking the English language
on an English language broadcaster
I've had the privilege
of an English language English medium we
call it education
schooling in the United Kingdom
and therefore
represent 80 years after Indian
independence
a part
of an anglicized
Indian
that is the truth
of my existence
quit essentially then
there is imbibed into Indian modern
Indian Republic of India tradition in
law
in practice in understanding in ethics
and in democracy a quintessential
British representation
of how systems work
from our civil Administration
to our jurisprudence to the basic tenets
of English common law they are enshined
they are respected and they utilized and
perhaps finished
by us
that is also the truth
of our existence
but
in this satyagraha which a Modern Nation
like India
rising in the global Community must do
we must also pay heed
that perhaps
the systems that we have been
articulated are the emblems the paragons
of the faith
that we would do well
to mimic name
to Aspire to achieve
or perhaps not as wholesome
as they have been described to us
and I use the word described with a
bit of caution shoved down our throats
could also apply
that perhaps they have flaws
every 48 hours we are reporting to you
news of shootings
that are taking place
in the United States is that what we
aspire
so therefore
perhaps the same complications of
inconsistencies and hypocrisies exist
in the United Kingdom which
the definition of
anglicized Indians
who are nevertheless
very proud of their country
it's history its culture and its
representation of a better world order
must
call out
now I want you to look back
in your mind's eye
to
to a propaganda program organized
in Trafalgar Square the square in the
heart of London
that celebrates the victory at Trafalgar
with Nelson's column
for
an event
that was created existed subsisted with
one agenda
which was the breakup
of the Republic of India
conveniently couched under a very
self-effacing
almost NGO sounding righteous sounding
seeks for justice
and we were told by the British
authorities by the Metropolitan Police
by the mayor
at the foreign office
by the home office
that in
the home counties of the United Kingdom
and the capital city of London there
exists the right
to free speech
and peaceful protest
and because that was so basic to the
tenet
of their identity
that any attempt
to propagate a malified intent
need to break up a different country
was not only tolerated I would scare say
maybe even encouraged
now I want you to juxtapose that with
what you are seeing on your screens
these yellow shirted people
are anti-monarchy
protesters 54 of whom
were arrested in the run-up
to the crowning of King Charles the
Third
they were committing no acts of violence
in fact their protest had not even begun
they were arrested on Route while they
were walking towards the protest site
and their crime was simply that their
van had placards
which said not my king
and they were wearing these yellow
shirts which I'm assuming says the same
thing
Now ladies and gentlemen
the British police
the Metropolitan Police
has said
that the reason for the arrest was
because this was a rare once in a
generation event
and they had to factor that in
while arresting people for public order
before
they even began their protest
so peaceful protest which had not even
yet begun by people who held a different
point of view
in the United Kingdom
was not tolerated there was Zero
Tolerance
for even an attempt as such
now what does that say
that says
that Democratic systems have
complications
that there are pools and pressures free
speech
cannot necessarily be absolute
that there are reasons and
responsibilities that apply by law
in Democratic countries like in the UK
as in hours
but as long as it was committing the act
and under the definition of the laws of
treason and the laws of treason have
originated in English common law and the
word reason itself
is purpose definitive of actions against
the crown which is where we get it from
in English nomenclature and semantics
in India it would be reasonable to argue
that propagating
the breakup of this country would
qualify as an act of treason
in the UK it is mandated by law
that questioning the line of succession
of the British crown
therefore saying this is now my king
is high treason
it is Akin
to plotting the assassination of the
monarch
now these protesters have not been
charged with high treason they were
arrested detained
few of them
later released
once in a generation attempt event is
what the police say which is why they
exercised their powers
for public order arrests
now let me open up this conversation
joining us on the broadcast Professor
Madam nalapath the editorial director of
the Sunday Guardian
Mukherjee is with us aditari is with us
on the broadcast as well gurjinder Singh
sidhu Is With Us on the broadcast as
well let me start with Professor now
commensurate response
Fair action there is a grand coronation
happening
of the head of state of a country
and there are citizens of that country
who want to stand wearing t-shirts
objecting to that coronation
and they're arrested by the British
police
perfectly Fair
I'm glad that you have pointed out the
hypocrisy the double standard and I
would like to ask the Metropolitan
Police which incidentally functions from
the control of the mayor the Lord mayor
of London if supposing you had groups of
people calling for the overthrow of the
monarchy not just that by violent Force
calling for the breakup of Britain by
violent force and calling for various
acts of sabotage and terrorism
within Britain would the Metropolitan
Police have just stood by and said well
this is Free Speech the individuals that
you have been talking about the groups
that you have been talking about which
are supported by the Sino Pakistan
Alliance financially and otherwise this
is precisely what they are openly
calling for in so many
platforms across the world of violent
overthrow of the Indian present Indian
government the break cup of India the
instigation of violence against the
Republic of India and its citizens and
all this is considered to be free speech
well source for the goose is obviously
not source for the gander and in that
sense frankly you have been your very
right to point out this extreme
hypocrisy not really hypocrisy they are
for them actually the crown is important
their country is important India is not
important
remember
the people the people who have the
people electing a leadership thus
they're not important India can go to to
the dogs it doesn't matter and if people
openly say we want violence we want to
destroy India well that's fine they
should be allowed to say it after all
it's Free Speech but free speech stops
where it affects themselves what so the
point is they still regard India frankly
as an inferior type of Country and this
is an example of that it's absolutely an
example of double standard okay remember
remember the 5th of November gunpowder
treason and plot I see no reason why
gunpowder treason should ever be
forgotten uh Guy Fawkes Knight is a bit
of a party if you're a student in
England as I was and I remember the
nursery rhyme and I repeat to you this
is a nursery rhyme this is what is
taught to the kids okay treason
right now I repeat these individuals to
the best of my knowledge as of this
telecast date have not been charged with
treason they've been held on charges of
public order and later released
now a master password Mukherjee
in the two places where the biggest
efforts
for the breaking up of the Republic of
India as it exists are being made in
England and in Canada
in Canada we've seen
emergency imposed
there have been unprecedented
historically unprecedented censorship
laws that have just been brought into
force in the past few days
in Canada
as we speak these arrests have been made
in London of these anti-monarchies this
is not the first set of anti-monarchists
who've been arrested in the run-up to
this hundreds of and we've had this
conversation before
what have you just witnessed on the
Streets of London yesterday man
first of all rishabh I'd like to say
that
it was an Englishman who said yesterday
while the coronation was going on that
United Kingdom is not now either a great
power
or a great trading nation and he added
and nobody likes us anymore I think that
is a fair and Frank admission of the
present status of the United Kingdom in
the International Community
that the Brits have never been able to
swallow uh arising India with a GDP much
higher than theirs with a much better
International future than this is not
surprising
their hypocrisy is surprising
considering that it was Mill who said
that my Liberty and where it infringes
on the liberty of my neighbor
unlike urisha I had my education
strictly in India my English was taught
to me by Indian
um I I did not celebrate guy Folk's day
and yet I speak to you with a completely
English education behind me but with one
big difference that English education in
India spoke to me as it did in millions
of my countrymen and women in the
national movement strong Sentiments of
nationalism because we have to thank the
Brits for bringing to us
what they consider to be only fit for a
superior colonial power because they
thought they were only fit to be ruled
and they were there to rule us forever
and that English language helped us to
master their trade and to defeat them at
their own game now what are they trying
to do they are trying on one hand to
have to encourage sedition against the
Republic of India but do they not know
that they are staring at the end of the
recognition of the monarchy outside
United Kingdom that for instance in the
Caribbean the Barbados was a lot the
last one to say that they've had enough
of the monarchy who represent slavery
and colonialism and as more and more
former British ruled state get rid of
the monarchy as indeed India was the
first to do when we became independent
you are also looking at the end of the
Commonwealth as we see it because it was
one thing to have Queen Elizabeth as
head of the Commonwealth and it's quite
an honor to see this this old man uh and
his even older spouse wearing those
ridiculous crowns and gowns uh and and
carrying uh orders kept us stolen from
foreign lands including ours it only
makes you feel that it's such a pathetic
spectacle that I feel sorry that it's
coming on National Television on our
television Yes actually
we have to forget the Bliss and move on
it's not worth wasting time on unnatural
no we we would we would but there is
there is there is a reason we don't
because as you mentioned it was it was a
bit of a spectacle and it's designed to
be a spectacle the one thing the Brits
were good at for 200 years was was
pageantry okay I would say us Indians
are very good at pageantry if you never
attended an Indian wedding uh you should
maybe you'll understand a bit of
pageantry if you're British but uh
it was telecast right here I was sitting
and I I sort of foresaw this that we did
a watch along ladies and gentlemen
yesterday for about four hours on all
sorts of issues and and subjects uh but
there were many news channels who were
just cutting live and and watching it
and describing it as it as it happened
uh not uh several of them most of them I
would I would I would rather say uh for
those editors to make those decisions I
am here to make a simple point the
simple point is there are understanding
of where the threat comes from we
discussed Pakistan and we discussed
China
having completely forgotten that gilgit
baldistan and Pok was not overtaken by
the pakistanis it was handed over by the
British that the subverting influences
uh whether the economic ones in the
British overseas territories that still
control the tax Havens across the world
how The Empire the financial Empire
still exists whether we like it or not
and do they provide sanctuary and Haven
for such elements they do which is why
they've been called out now
in the past three days we've had more
than a dozen
people discussing here
uh Scottish nationalism and Scottish
independence and Irish nationalism Welsh
nationalism
I see no reason why we should not take
equal concern
on what is taking place in the divisions
offered United Kingdom which was also
United per force asked
if I'm not mistaken one of the ancestors
of this King Charles III uh
King Edward Long Shanks when they found
his coffin on it was emblazoned
eduardus Cottage primaris primorum
malleus hickest here lies Edward the
Hammer of the Scots
okay so forgive the Scots if they take
Umbridge at such a at such a history so
now let me get
Adit into this conversation
as we speak
uh
Britain is a constitutional monarchy
they don't have a constitution per se
but the head of state is a monarch okay
now let us say that there was the
swearing-in of the Indian president
who's our head of state taking place
and there were a bunch of people saying
no that India should not be a republic
we challenged the constitution of India
and we're going to wear t-shirts and
placards
okay
because we challenged the very Nation
the description the Constitutional
description of the structure of the
state which is what these people are
doing because that's what the structure
of their state is
what would have happened in the BBC Al
Jazeera New York Times Washington Post
had we arrested those individuals
I can tell you for sure that the British
MPS would have been crying out uh and
would have been crying out for sanctions
to be imposed on the government of India
had such incidents played out in India
and the protesters were you know
arrested the Press would have been uh
you know they already painting a very
negative image of India and that this
would have given them more reason to
sort of uh propagate and amplify that
negativity that they that they so often
play uh on India and the people in
Britain would have been calling Modi a
fascist they would have been calling uh
the BJP and the artist's a uh you know a
fascist organization uh you know
imposing a totalitarian regime and that
would have been the scenes which have
which root has essentially played which
would have been played out now having
said that you know the the double
standards and the duplicity which has
been exposed as of yesterday I prayed
that the Indian place the Indian press
in the Indian media latches on to this
and they start telling the people
especially that corner that cabal of
India which sort of still looks at the
West for some sort of acknowledgment for
some sort of a surety uh that you know
the West's duplicity is far beyond
anything that we have ever seen you know
right from Justin Trudeau how he clamped
down on the truckers protest while he
was calling the the the the farm
anti-farm Bill protesters you know
calling them rightful protesters Etc
right to the anti-monarchy protesters uh
you know the 52 of them that were that
were essentially clamped down on the
pretext of preventive uh uh law in order
functioning uh it's it's remarkable that
you know our press the Indian president
the Indian uh polity hasn't latched on
to that particular issue I think that
needs to be latched on and more
importantly I think the Indian
politicians need to come out strongly
and condemn this this chilling incident
which has taken place on Saturday and
they need to be calling for sanction
sanctions to be placed against United
Kingdom
yeah but we are not right
okay okay so let me get Mr Gill into
this conversation
sir
I'm finding it rather strange some would
find it equally strained some not so but
sidhuji
if you carry yellow flags in London
demanding kalistan
you're a free citizen
in a democracy
but if you carry the same color yellow
flags
demanding an end to the monarchy
you go to jail how does that make sense
I'm not well today very well but this
British people meets governments you
know they had been working always divide
and Rule like this thing now uh if they
if the their people have raised some
human cry against them they are put in
jails now if they have done anything for
Indian Soul or any other country because
we have a life example in they have
divided India very badly and you know
they have put poison in the minds of
Indians very badly you know in Hindustan
Pakistan is their creation so they they
are always playing double standard games
uh I have nothing much to say they are
there it's not a very new thing which
happened on their soul
joining us on the Telecaster at least at
least have your voice heard so let me
get back to Professor okay
now
I can cite a hundred different examples
I've already mentioned the Canadian
example I find it rather strange that
you know Vijay maldia was very home in
High Society in London
when a European Bank wants to clear its
debts so that they don't take away his
house he's able to fly to a
British territory or his son is able to
go there and suddenly millions of pounds
are coughed up and those debts are
cleared some 250 crore rupees suddenly
pops up out of nowhere uh you know and
the European bank's debts are cleared
and his London lease is paid for and is
very comfortable it's it's odd rather
coincidental
but in a very specific course
why is this
not a concern for us why why do here our
academicians are parliamentarians not
consider this we are also Democrats and
we are also perhaps larger stakeholders
in the larger cause of global democracy
than the current United Kingdom why are
we not aggrieved with what's happening
in Canada
which of course Rihanna and Greta
thunberg and a lot of people here even
within this country some lyricists
filmmakers they're not aggrieved at all
why why is that
well the fact is Richard the question is
very simple and the question is do you
have self-respect as a citizen of India
do you have the right knowledge and
appreciation of if I may say so the
wonder that that is India uh you know
paraphrasing A.L Basham and if you don't
you basically don't even respect
yourself and when you don't respect
yourself what do you do you go around
for example with a 40 lakh rupee handbag
you go around for example with a two
crore watch you go around for example
sporting clothes none of which are Made
in India I might be essentially they're
made in China but with the European
label because you don't have confidence
in yourself and that is the problem now
we're not talking about these people
being against the established order in
Britain these protesters did not protest
against democracy he never did that they
are for democracy they are vigorously
for democracy the protesters against
India protested against democracy they
protested against duly elected
governments and very poisonously they
sought to say that people of different
faiths are actually different countries
is the British government prepared to
say as you know you have the mayor of
London sanctioning March after March
after March and not only London Bradford
and various other places in Britain of
these individuals who basically say oh
different religions need different
countries well are you going to say that
people of different religions in Britain
should break off into different
countries of course not and this is the
extreme hypocrisy of these people and to
cover that up they've got a compliant
media that fails to basically say that
we are talking about two three four
Nation Theory we're talking about saying
people of different religions belong to
different countries they shouldn't be
together we are talking about the death
of democracy and they cover that up by
us okay um
I'll end with ambassador
I I just wanted to make a short
interjection you know I I completely
second everything that uh Professor
nalapath has just articulated but the
one thing that you know we've we failed
to call out in this particular debate
that we're having you know the public
order bill which is this preventive uh
uh bill that was passed in early January
where the police is given these extra
powers to clamp down on protesters which
will essentially be viewed as uh you
know blocking arterial roads or or
causing civil unrest within within
communities
why did they fail to execute this when
when the kalistani protesters were were
clamping down on the on the Indian High
Commission in March exactly that is the
question that is the question that all
of us need to be asking them where was
the security apparatus at that point of
time when the car when the rabbit
khalistani protested that climbed up on
the Indian High commission had and had
taken down the India what troubles me
more is what if the situation was was
reversed what if there were group of
group of anti-monarchists protesting in
Delhi and they welcome to we are also
free Country a lot of democracy here as
well okay Free Speech here and they went
to the British High commission which is
not on the street it's on behind a lot
of walls but it does have a flag and
they climbed the flagpole and they
ripped the flag or tried to rip the flag
down what would that have been
interpreted is is an open question how
would the BBC would have looked at that
as a charitable gesture or free speech
yeah it's you know that would have been
transgression against uh the the Union
Jack that would have been transgression
against uh uh Britain and that is how
they would have viewed it it's
surprising that you know there are many
voices even within whether the United
Kingdom you know uh within the
conservative party within the academic
Circle which did not take that view when
the Indian flag was essentially brought
down in the manner that it was
essentially brought down okay I have a
couple of thoughts I want to cover so
ma'am is it reasonable to argue
Ambassador Mukherjee that given what
we've seen happening in Canada
where an emergency was imposed
where censorship laws have already been
brought into Force
that the real threats to what we
understand is free seats and democracy
are not emanating as Rihanna and data
tunberg might be mistakenly advised to
that their real problems are in Canada
maybe in the UK
absolutely uh rishabh there is no doubt
about it uh I'd like to uh tell other
others that we have removed the
barricades from outside the British High
commission that were there for 40 years
uh as as a gesture of uh this treasure
and the manner in which our high
commission was allowed to be attacked in
this manner uh so the next time uh there
are protesters uh they would have equal
freedom in clambering up and trying to
bring down the Union Jack uh we would
deal with them in exactly the same way
as they did with our high Commission in
London uh I I would just like to add
rishabh that there's only one way in
dealing with these Brits witches what we
call in this in the Foreign Service
sovereign
whatever they do we should give it back
to them in same in equal measure or more
that is the only way to make them
understand that they may have
partitioned us once in 47.
so-called partition on the basis of
religion which was demonstrated to be
false when Bangladesh was created in 71
that was one Muslim Nation breaking into
two and now if they think that India
will be partitioned into little rum
States uh emanating depending upon their
religious Origins they should themselves
ponder their own okay and and then we
should remind them from time to time
Bishop about how the United Kingdom was
formed how can us are there is this
Union and how easy it is yeah you know
in fact ma'am I'm going to call out I
think for the first time in my career
I'm going to call out professional sir
you very much yes
Ireland split away from uh Britain
because of religion Catholic and
Protestant it is still I'm pretty sure
this is correct I I'll somebody check me
correct me fact check me if I'm wrong
that being a Catholic priest is also
still considered high treason and the
issue in Northern Ireland is between
Protestant Union Israelis and and
Catholic Irish Republicans so yes they
are very much divided on religion which
is why they thought they could be but I
have a last question I'm a great
believer in reciprocity as well and I
would be uh first to come up and
interview the anti-monar case because
for show King Charles the Third is not
my king
uh damn sure about that as we speak
professor nalapath
why not
why not show the reciprocity why not
turn the tables
look I would only like to say that we
should do you know do unto others as
they do unto you I think that is a very
if I may say so a very correct stand and
I think the ambassadors articulated that
I would only like to point out rishabh
that in Northern Ireland and I there was
frankly a discrimination if I may say so
in some respects which is now of course
over and therefore there was a
perception of that but it's a Syrian
religion it is Christianity whether
you're Catholic or Protestant and there
are many Catholics living throughout
Britain and then if you start you know
if you start saying that Catholics and
Protestants are different you may have
two two countries in the same house and
that is what the British have been
trying to do and what the mayor of
London by by basically supporting
palestinis is trying to do in India have
two countries people of two countries
staying in the same house because they
have different religions so I'd only
like to say leadership this is a
complete double standard and it's good
that you're calling it out because I
quite agree with you rather than call it
out I'm afraid we just go along with the
flow the pompan pageantry is basically
because Britain is on the ropes it is
bankrupt it needs tourism it needs a
boost in its image and they're desperate
that this will give them that boost I
agree with the Ambassador I doubt very
much that this coronation is going to
give any sort of boost okay so uh
it is so shockingly absurd
that British representatives in India
are unable to communicate to its foreign
office and their government
the sheer exasperation
at what is grossly ludicrous
as a Act of policy by their government
and then Wonder
why in the future their revenues from
students their revenues from tourism
their revenues from all other financial
matters will not suffer
and why it would suddenly be a shock
that for the first time in history of
Indian television
members
who are
against the conceptualization of a
United Kingdom be their Scots Irish
or Welsh
are now welcome guests and frequent
guests on Indian television speaking to
an Indian audience mark my words don't
be shocked
if this happens now on the streets of
Delhi

when we have to do great fundamentally
different things
there comes a point
a point where the transition happens
rapidly from one state to the other this
is true in the laws of physics you
start warming up water heating up water
it raises in temperature raises in
temperature raises in temperature until
it hits a point
that it changes
into steam
this aspect applies
to strategic policy as well
if our clear and stated intent both
for the preservation of our territorial
Integrity as defined
in the country that was created in 1947
with the various instruments of
accession signed
so both on matters of propriety natural
Justice
and on matters of strategy knowing full
well that the reason the British
disambiguated and there's no denying it
it's not the pakistanis who took away
the Sun
it is the British
who gave them away and these histories
we have discussed on this channel very
often
that the moment that they are
reintegrated India then has a land
border with Afghanistan it has direct
access to Tajikistan and Central
Asia
it is a game changer
in geostrategy now
until that point comes that might come
next year it might come five years from
now it might come 10 years from now
there are various complications
obviously easier said than done which we
will be just discussing but until that
point comes what are the steps that we
can take that we have taken it to the
point
where kinetic action becomes desirable I
can run you through them number one
article 370 which the external affairs
minister now says is ancient history
special status for what is already
Indian Territory or under Indian
Administration
is
taken away
number two we have to do the development
of what is already
under Indian Administration under the
Indian laws
number three we need an organic either
in situ or In Absentia leadership within
Pok and its people
some in Exile willing to come back
who provide the fulcrum of leadership
for an integrated
state which means we have to identify
them
then
we have to ensure
that we have a plan in place for when it
happens
now we have discussed for the past three
years and I'm happy to say some progress
is being made
that the leadership of those in Exile of
room 6 lakh Plus live here in India and
many more across the world let's
identify the leaders one such is again
sitting on the broadcast with me today
and give them representation in the
future State Assembly in Srinagar and in
Parliament here we've had several hours
of conversations on these over now
better part of three years it's a
logical step I have presented to you
another logical step which is playing
out on your screens
extend that conversation how do we
extend it
let us appoint
the district magistrates the district
collectors
let them start creating development
plans for these areas
for an eventual Handover when the
Andover happens
in whatever circumstances happen What
will be the Civil Administration will be
created after or will we have created it
before and it simply Moves In
so let us create the Civil
Administration let us create the
jurisprudence which means that if you
are an Indian as we say this is Indian
soil
you should have access
to preserve your civil rights
under the jurisdiction of the high court
of Srinagar and the Supreme Court of
India as guaranteed by the tenets of
India's Constitution which means that
the people of Pok should have be given
granted justicable rights
that they should be able to move the
Supreme Court of India against
violations to their life in Liberty
which are taking place in Pok
step by step by step do everything until
you reach the point of inflection let me
open up this conversation joining us on
the broadcast Sumit peer is staying with
on with us General Ashwini sivaj is
joining us on the broadcast I also have
radi who is the chairman of SOS
International and he is one such future
leader for sure Rajan Khanna who has
done extensive work both academic and
research and act and activism on these
issues is joining us on the broadcast as
well Sumit let me take the conversation
forward okay we've been discussing the
various geostrategic complications the
presence of China what will the
pakistanis do but we have a clear stated
goal
now if we have the clear stated goal at
least the stuff that we can do
we should start doing
people like Rajiv chunni who are poke
displaced persons should be either in
the assembly in Srinagar or be in
Parliament representing the voice of Pok
there should be a district collector
there should be a Civic Administration
we should be making infrastructure plans
what highway will be built what roadway
will be built and these should be well
known
to the public in Pok or what will come
their way once they reintegrate why what
is stopping us from getting started
Bishop the only thing is that now the uh
Dr Jay Shankar Amit shaji rajna City
have clearly stated that we'll get back
pojk which is a work in progress we'll
choose the time of our choosing couple
of things what we need to do there are
the 18 or 24 seats in gnk assembly which
need to be filled there are people like
Rajiv ji which are here and more we can
identify who should have a plug and play
government in Exile so if you know when
Once the transition happens we take out
this module we put that module which
means a government structure a district
administrator saw for these all in a
development plan should be one who
should have the representation in the
jnk assembly and in the parliament of
India and we should also declare to the
people like un and you and ungc what are
our plans of development and also let
them known to the people of pojk because
their degrees are not recognized in
Pakistan the number two highest missing
people after Balochistan is pojk
Pakistan is trying to you know do the
DNA engineering by getting old retired
Punjabi 4G is there and trying to change
the population mix so we have to tell
them what does India have to offer we
have these people Plug and Play so
whenever the time push comes to show we
must have everything up and ready so
that we just roll it out and with the
plan projection what we are going to do
so it let it be at the jnk assembly let
it in Parliament of India and let it be
at the forums like unga and you know you
and the United Nations and all so that
Our intention and intentions intent and
intentions is clear to all including of
pojk and it means that we are really on
the business as far as a kinetic action
a diplomatic action is concerned at the
time of our Underpants the place or
something we can do okay okay so okay
let me take it a step forward General
okay
it is but obvious that there has going
to be some sort of military role I
really know ideally we we hope that the
Pakistani armed forces and their and
their Chinese
compatriates overseers all simply walk
away it could happen
but there will be role for the Indian
Armed Forces at some point of time
whether it's going to be a policing role
or otherwise we'll have to see
but eventually
they will have to be a Civic
Administration which means we will lead
leaders who are going back to their old
houses with their fathers or mothers and
grandfathers and grandmothers left
people like Raju chunni and I've seen
radhundi change
from being simply a person who was a you
know part journalist part activist to
become a seasoned leader of a community
of people we read more like him for sure
we will need the police constables the
shos the the dgps the the the the the
the commissioner of police says you lead
the district magistrates you lead the
district judges you'll have to have
district courts you'll have to have an
administrative setup as we recognize in
modern day India and its districts
recreated there
we will have to give them a just a
justiceable model the writ of India's
laws in India's Constitution will then
apply to these territories as you should
apply now what is stopping us from
creating a master plan I can take it
further have a development plan District
development plan infrastructure upgrade
plan that this is the illegal activity
construction that the Chinese are doing
what we will intend to do what dam we
will build what highway we will build
how we will connect to Afghanistan what
is stopping us from creating this master
plans
no doubt or aim is very clear
now we must make a road map which ensure
that this comes in a stipulated time no
uh action which you have told there are
few actions which are already told but
there are many other actions need to be
done in a systematic pattern one is very
rightly we have to also diplomatically
handle to the world and explain to them
that the PO check is a part of India it
has been indicately occupied after the
instrument of an accident
you're missing my point we're going to
do that anyway that's the conversation
I'm just having gonna do that anyway
now that is easier said than done
because we are hoping that the British
and Americans and the Chinese will agree
they may they may not but in the interim
we could we could take an action on
article 370 what are the other actions
we can take while we are waiting for all
of this to happen yeah that's what I so
what I'm saying is the other truth
reaction which we need to take is that
generate a descent within the pojk
people must come on this deed and they
must challenge The Authority which is
there that is very important and the the
ultimate action will be that the Indian
army has to go in you will find that the
Pakistan is not likely to give it on
play remember that the China involved
China Pakistani Corridor is coming
through
evening occupied by Pakistan so the
point which is there is all said and
done all action need to be done kinetic
action has to be the or no so the
ultimate answer will be the kinetic
action but my question is after the
connected obviously the Indian army has
to go in you will have to create new
contoon well not contourments anywhere
but new regimental centers new
headquarters new operational commands
all of these will have to be drawn up
and I can safely say ladies and
gentlemen that the Indian army is
perhaps best placed to have this plan of
action I don't want to say whether it
actually exists or not I have not seen
it and already exists
yeah I can say that if the Indian army
were to move in okay to what would
become the new border the international
border
that we already are in a good place to
have a plan of action on where the
regimental headquarters will will be
there what extra troops will be required
for now protecting a new international
border that's the part we've actually
probably got gamed out and I'm saying
probably because I have to leave it
vague obviously but now I want to get Mr
Khanna in because when I'll have a
larger conversation with Mr Tunney Rajan
Khanna
at this point of time
we want to create a situation an ideal
situation where whoever the residents in
a few years from now in pojk the Exiles
who return
they welcome the Indian Armed Forces
with garlands as liberators which they
will serve as heartbringers of a better
future for this to happen
we will have to have an identification
program of those who have been smuggled
in by The pakistanis Who are the genuine
authentic Exiles who need to be returned
we will have to have a plan of action
for the Civic Administration the police
force the administrative Force the
jurisprudence Force I mentioned the
courts the DC's the DMs
what is stopping us that the next time
the upsc interviews are conducted and
the new batch of cardboard is released
and sent for training we say okay here
is the guy from zafarabad here is the
guy from mirpur in interim In Absentia
you sit here and make plans for what
will happen once the integration takes
place what is stopping us from doing
this
this is the lack of narrative first of
all we have to create a narrative I'll
give you one example the role of mother
of which goes to Sharda Village wherever
Sharma Temple is existing there is no
Road it is a completely dirt track you
know people who want to visit that area
they have to go through that uh you know
full of potholes a completely you know
lack of infrastructure and uh conversely
you see our road till tits wall where we
are we have this recently inaugurated
one Temple dedicated to baby this why
can't we showcase this to the people
across the border now they know what you
know they I'm in touch with many people
over there they say uh Indian government
they they is not properly communicating
with them there is a lack of
communication that is once and secondly
there is a as far as a medical
infrastructure is there is completely
lacking there there is no education in
uh
the maximum number of uh missing people
are from pojk so all these things we
have to basically highlight it's it they
have to be highlighted diplomatically
also across the world because uh
Pakistan they have their uh you know
Kashmir centers throughout their uh
embassies and Hike missions through the
world we are not eat let me let me give
you an assumption yeah okay okay I'm
just giving you one one hypothetical
unitary example okay yeah that we allow
the electron process for which is not as
complicated the entire rules of
electioneering in India will have to be
changed for this to make an exception
for this
but let's give me an hypothetic let's
say that Rajiv chunni gets elected as
MLA or perhaps even Member of Parliament
representing his home districts okay
then we asked Mr chunni along with his
other fellow members of parliament and
mlas to do a world tour
go to the U.S Congress go to London go
to Brussels meet with other fellow
members of parliament and tell them what
you represent and who you are
second
anecdotal example small example that we
say okay
that anybody
who is resident in Pok can go to the
Jammu and Kashmir State Human Rights
Commission against the Pakistani
military and army
and seek directions from them
that they can file cases in the Indian
Supreme Court
at least give them the ability
to recognize their rights under the
Indian constitution let them exercise it
and let the pakistanis deal with it that
20 000 applications against the
Pakistani army have come to jamun
Kashmir human rights board let us start
the process what is stopping us from
appointing the district collector from
appointing the Sho it's an
administrative process which is going to
cost us an x amount in salaries which is
money well spent
see we have to first of all fill up 24
seeds which are falling vacant and
belonging to pojk and representatives
all these assembly constituencies they
have to take care of their respective
constituency and anybody coming from
there for for example for Medical Aid
they should be instrumental uh you know
in getting some treatment in hospitals
they should get the admission for the
students from there in the various Civic
problems they have to address that is
some that is something that politically
they have to do besides that as far as
the Diplomatic uh answer to Pakistan's
uh no no I'm not having a diplomatic
conversation the Diplomatic conversation
is separate con I am saying what can we
do internally what steps can we take
there is no diplomacy required to fill
the seats we don't have to convince the
Chinese we want to convince the
Pakistani that we can do ourselves we
have to fill the seats we have to
appoint District magistrates we have to
appoint collectors we have to create the
entire infrastructure mechanism okay
okay so let me then let me put let me
put Chutney on the spot let me put him
on the spot I've been sitting with him
for several years now four or five years
now we've been having these
conversations I've seen him mature as a
leader of his peoples Rajiv chunni
abscess specifically
get up
home District say s
parliamentary standings
foreign
foreign
foreign
foreign
okay so let me take it one at a time
okay one at a time I I don't have
infinite time but I have infinite time
for however long I'm in this in this in
this profession to take on practical
pragmatic pioneering and Visionary steps
we are capable of doing it I am just
shoving it in that direction the people
sitting with me are the people over this
stakeholders doing it first general say
about Sumit also wants to come into
first generation another pragmatic
suggestion has been given it is very
well known in military circles to have
locals who know the area to serve in the
front line combat units who can serve
multiple purposes as guides is mentioned
as which we've had the same conversation
on the on at once upon a time when it
came to the border with Bangladesh to
have the people who speak the particular
Bengali dialect and can be and identify
and and understand it so why not set up
the musafirabad
Scouts
that there is
to be militarily taken they the road
back to that but as far as this point
there let us say uh there's Scouts are
already there territorial
had been raised from this area of the
local people but we need to go further I
agree with you and let me tell you one
thing yes the moon president
now the president is shifted from
Kashmir Valley because the point is that
is the area where the Hindi there's the
poorer and there is a chances of going
towards airport and coming this side we
need to change strategy fully agree we
need to do surgical strike number two we
must go inside Pakistan we must pay them
back on the same point
okay okay okay so that's a separate
conversation for a separate point of
conversation we are talking about
practical doable ideas immediately this
the further strategic strike or surgical
strike is a point of conversation
diplomacy is a point of conversation
China Pakistan Army loc ceasefire I am
trying to focus the conversation on
doables
Scouts are Parliamentary organization
that is reporting to the Pakistani army
there should be a parallel gilgil
battles on couch that can be raised by
the Indian army as a parametry
organization we have done this before
certainly when it came uh to Tibet and
other areas so submit wants to make a
small interjection I'm short of time so
with you take it then I'll leave the
last word
I have one point you see in Jammu it is
going to get heated up because we have
found lithium also 420 billion dollars
is the worth excavation is going on in
18 areas we must be prepared that
Pakistan will intervene and try to
disrupt us Victoria Newland is in
Bangladesh during the whole area and I
want to make one point yesterday
Pakistan Army veterans
he has got some
also he was in kargil war he did a press
conference in UK he said I am raising a
new breed of jihadis to disrupt G20 in
Kashmir so Jammu is going to be the
focus they are talking of disrupting G20
into Kashmir so we have to really get
our
just mention this in the in the five
days in the run-up to the SEO meeting
okay in Goa you had an attack in Jammu
and Kashmir uh a naxal attack in in
dantevara and you've had two northeast
states uh in which you are seeing arson
writing and people being killed Rajan
Khanna I know there are lots of
coronaries to this but you have a
practical suggestion you have a Rajiv
chunni raise the scouts I have mentioned
several times appoint the DMS bring it
under jurisprudence why don't we set up
a committee of people in the parliament
to real examine these things make the
recommendations and knock them off I
know it's an election year but certainly
a lot of these will be Visionary things
that that go across politics
you see whatever suggestions uh my
co-pandalists have emoted they all are
very you know practical they are
tangible and kinetic action has to be
taken that is one thing secondly uh as
earlier also I had said can we have to
go for narrative making we you know
unfortunately always lag behind
as far as the negative position is
concerned uh you know people out there
they have a very strong you know the
Islamic uh leaning uh one one message
but we have to put internationally
around 20 crores of Muslims are living
in India they are equally beneficiary
for all the government scheme they have
got all the constitutional rights if
another 40 50 lakhs people from across
the border they get assimilated to the
territory of India they are going to
enjoy equal rights so there is not at
all going to be any religious
discrimination that one message has to
be very strongly uh disseminated second
thing is our economic power
we are not just only going to be the
third largest economic power in the
world we are going to be Democratic
economic power China China maybe right
now number two economic power in the
world but totalitarian regime there are
no civil rights over there in China here
here we are going to have their cake and
eat it too okay okay people people in
India you know yes okay okay but okay so
I'm going to make a request because like
I said we just I just came out from a
discussion on China okay and what what
then happens and prevents us from
focused action sometimes is because the
issue is so large and so complicated we
now need to sit with something called
ladies and gentlemen Occam's razor in
science
reduce it down
to digestible chunks
in what we can do right now what we must
do what is larger picture what will
happen slowly India will grow will be
our stronger next year will be stronger
10 years from now we'll be able to do
more then
but my point of principle is that I'm
going to make an appeal to all my fellow
panelists who are sitting with me okay
and have sat with me now for years and
years and who are Ardent Patriots
thinkers and have contributed to the
community I have a lot of personal
conversations every single person
sitting here General sivach is a is a
passionate Indian whether a reply or not
he sends me a text with ideas every day
on on how to take the country forward
so I would request you and for people
watching this broadcast okay
we're going to publish this list of
ideas I'm going to add to the list for
Rajiv tuni has said regarding the gilgit
batistan Scouts Scouts these are
practical ideas we don't have to wait
for diplomacy we want to wait for some
military action
but if the end goal is that the
population not just the territory the
population which has been ravaged
through demographic infiltration by the
pakistanis
is to be represented by India which is a
very difficult challenge leaders
Administration civil infrastructure all
of this has to be developed
now if the Charles de Gaulle government
could be operating in exile for an
entire country out of London waiting for
the Nazi occupation to end if the Vichy
government which is operating under the
Nazis in southern France was absorbed
into it because a plan was put into
place a similar holistic plan will be
required I appeal to all of you to work
it out and then
the sheer weight of the logic of action
which applied in the in the abrogation
of special theaters the sheer weight of
the logic of abrogation of action will
take us the rest of the way for more

QAK_sFtx8z0,Farmers &amp; Wrestlers At Dharna Capital | What&#39;s Just &amp; What&#39;s Joust?  | NewsX,Farmers & Wrestlers At Dharna Capital | What's Just & What's Joust? | NewsX Wrestlers have been protesting at Jantar Mantar for ...,2023-05-07T13:22:16Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QAK_sFtx8z0/hqdefault.jpg,"we are in a very complicated situation
and it is snowballing
happening in the heart of the national
capital here in Delhi for the past two
weeks
medal winning famous
wrestlers on whom movies have been made
and some of them are household names
are on protest
they are saying
that the wrestling organization that
represents them
is being led by an individual whom they
accuse of malpractice to the tune of
sexual harassment
by the law of this country the word of a
woman
carries eminent weight
when it comes to charges
of sexual math practice assault
or harassment there is a reason
there is a reason for that
and which is well digested and well
understood by everyone
so what has happened now
now we have seen that a directive has
been issued
by leaders of Kappa panchayats
and cup panchayats
many of whom
serve an important societal
administrative role in this country
nothing else
so I will Define it as societal
administrative role
with a very checkered record
when it comes to
Sexual Man practice honor killing
misogyny
their leaders have decided
that their primary flock of farmers
from Rajasthan up and haryana are now
going to march to Delhi
to join the protest of the wrestlers
there is a fair chance that this March
could be stopped guess where
at the Delhi border
and we all known what's happened there
in the past that of course creates a
secondary unhappy situation
the trade Commerce travel to and fro
from Delhi gets chopped as it has in the
past
so in this Quagmire we are now here let
me make an notable attempt to unravel it
it is not going to be easy
there is a prima facie issue a prima
facie protest it is now being snowballed
in such a manner Sunita kodara joining
us she is also a household name an
athlete who is a
Champion Middle East
major Mohammed Alisha is with us Ellen
Rao's for being the former DCP of
special cell in Delhi police joining us
and lokmata the editorial director of
India news is with us as well alok ji
let me now try to understand from you
because it's a complicated matter
complicated matter is that if a woman
athlete comes and says that a certain
coach or person who's Heading an
organization has conducted malpractice
sexual assault sexual harassment of me
we have to take her prima facie at face
value that's what the law says should
happen
we are struggling to do that
and we have been told we are struggling
to do that because we are
having strong doubts on the veracity of
these charges even though NFR has been
fired and the strong stench or stink
of politicization
how do we respect the gravitas of these
charges while we dis ambiguate all the
other paraphernalia which might be
surrounding them
first supreme court already working on
it they have instructed the Delhi police
to do the fir and investigation already
on
I have been told that the reports are
there that seven or eight uh already
they have recorded these statements so
apart from the legal process certainly
everybody from Media or all over India
people have sympathy for those girls who
are alleging this issue but the same
time you mentioned about the kha
panchayat or other political leaders
also went there so I feel very bad about
it you remember that's why you also
mentioned all the films also Sultan and
Amir Khan and Salman Khan the most
popular figures they made film all uh
wrestlers and we were talking if the
panchayat nowadays they we have the gram
panchayat everywhere they'll be proud
for it and then same thing the real
panchayat are the corporations are the
political parties if they support all
players they want more facilities
they'll never talk about in the
parliament have you heard anything about
it saying was the Member of Parliament
but again number of people who are from
Sports Authorities but instead of
talking there just going to make a
politicalize this is a damaging the
cause of the basic crime if there is a
crime then certainly law will take
action remember from media also there
were two cases the very major senior
journalists were there B2 issue and
other issues also so they had they face
these problems and they were legal
problem was there and they suffered also
a lot okay so certainly for a member of
parliament or anybody so the reason this
is highly complex is because we should
at face value take a charge
from a woman let alone an award-winning
any ordinary person in this country
and the reason the laws have been
designed in such a way that's the simply
the word of the woman carries a lot of
weight in law is because
how do you prove it six years later
seven years later what evidence will you
show
that's the reason the laws are designed
in a stringent way if there was no or
very little sexual harassment misogyny
malpractice sexual assault we won't need
stringent laws but they are there for a
particular reason so without
undermining the need for that at the
same time
not doing any victim shaming Sunita
godara how do we now seriously address
this issue because
obviously it's difficult to understand
what the cup panchayats are going to the
farmers are going to do there at a
Restless protest but they'll argue that
Injustice is being served and they're
being Good Samaritans what do we make of
this mess now see the thing is when they
started that time they were not inviting
any political party they were not
allowing anyone to be there that that
was the time when the sports Ministry
the government the iOS Indian Olympic
Association they should have opened up
ethics commission which is a rule by
Olympic Charter they have all signed the
Olympic Charter the sports Ministry and
ioa that they have to have an Ethics
commission ethical committee is not
there they put one oversight committee
which was out always out of uh site and
uh what happened in that committee now
it is coming through media we are also
getting to know what all happened so it
was not justified for the at least now
these wrestlers they have no faith in
police
uh the Supreme Court or what they asked
to Supreme Court maybe that was the
legal team's fault that they only asked
for Fir and supreme court has given that
order so now Supreme Court is asking
them to go to the lower court and their
legal team is not going to the lower
court why can't see I have written a
letter to sports minister to open a
ethics commission now this is on 4th of
May when I saw these wrestlers they are
now getting into all these political
parties are overpowering them they are
very innocent and obviously they have
emotional harassment they have mental
harassment and of course there is sexual
harassment also and not only in this
wrestling it happens everywhere in
others Arenas also but in sports I have
seen myself these things happening last
30 years I've been watching this and
sometimes I am protecting also girls
that is in a nice patiala also so it is
what they are saying is true but when
they are seeing that there's no no one
to help them and now they these parties
are overpowering the best thing best
solution is ethics commission life okay
that seems practical it would not be
yeah it will be it will be same yeah
okay so now ladies and gentlemen if
you've been following the News
International you would know that this
in the past few months a massive Scandal
has hit gymnastics in the United States
where physiotherapists coaches have been
accused of aiding and abetting one
particular individual who had been
molesting and sexually assaulting young
girls 10 11 12 year old girls for
decades
so when Sunita ghodara says this is
commonplace that this happens
she's saying it from experience
so for us to sit here and say no nobody
ever spoke about it so we know what
happens well we have to assume that
these things happen and we need to do
something about them now that comes to
the Merit of the argument so let me get
Mr Rao
when prima facie a case of
sexual harassment is alleged by an
individual a woman
why does it have to go to court
for redressal I am assuming the police
understand the law and the gravitas of
this and they themselves can take action
it does not require Court mandate or
Direction
management
then these offenses write this
molestation and then 509 IPC rape and
all these category of offenses were made
compulsarily to be registered when there
is a complaint written complaint from
someone then the police cannot refuse
that fir in this case I don't know when
the complaint was there or not but
definitely there was no need of going to
Supreme Court and getting a order from
Supreme Court for registration over Fair
should have been registered at the very
beginning stage when the complaint was
there that was I think that was a
mistake at the on the on the part of
Delhi police I think so but under what
circumstances they did not do that okay
so let me ask you a corollary to the
question so clearly this should have
been done
and clearly some reasonable perhaps more
alacritous action is now required to
address the core of the issue okay now
what happens with time and two weeks are
now elap Mr Robin you will be well aware
of it from your 30 40 years in uniform
is
that there are a group of people
protesting who think that they have a
genuine cause
then
there are a whole bunch of people who
would want to come out in their support
who think that they are not being done
right by the system
along with them come the lump and
elements the motivated elements the
politically charged elements and we've
seen it too often in the past they
hijack the emotional distress of the
original protesters
for their own motivations and intents
now a group of farmers from a cup
panchayat and I've pointed out several
times cup panchayats not a specific cup
panchayat but in general don't have the
best record when it comes to
things like dishonor killings and
matrimonial issues and intercast issues
etc etc we know that their track record
is is a bit dodgy these guys want to
show up at what point of time does this
become a free for ulcer where the actual
wrestlers and their original causes
forgotten and everybody and their Uncle
have shown up to protest
yes Lisa and you have rightly used that
word that highly at least initial
movement of these paral ones that has
been arrested that has been hijacked by
these people and this cup and said they
have their own laws and their own
Notions then when they are supporting
them that I don't know what is their
selfish motive or selfish motive some
others also who are indulging in this
with this sport of these wrestlers but
um maybe some other
ulterior motives of the car Punjab
people and other also others who are
joining them but definitely that the
core question is that that the matter
should have been resolved and then what
if there is something truth in their
allegations
I have some idea of the backstory I
don't know the full backstory for sure
but this issue had been raised several
weeks ago
there was some resolution at that point
of time I don't know what the resolution
was but clearly it wasn't enough
for the aggrieve parties that they have
decided that they wanted to come back
and protest because whatever either
promises had been made to them or
assurances had been made when they last
raised the shoe clearly they felt were
not kept but here we are
to the culmination
of this major Shah
so two weeks this protest has been
festering
we have not been able to resolve it
either because it's become intractable
there are egos involved there are some
Stakes involved some compulsions about I
don't know but now we have kappanchayats
farmers and I mentioned everybody and
their uncle and aunty who now want to
leverage this because the cameras are
there the eyeballs are there this seems
like a Cause
and let's not kid ourselves we are
heading into an election year so there
will be people who leverage it some
people major Shah would welcome it that
it is the job of politicians to come and
stand with people who are aggrieved some
would be more cynical on this but we are
headed for another
Delhi dharna another border blockade
Anything could happen at this point of
time which certainly would be
unpalatable to those who live in Delhi
what do we now do
we'll get a job you know brother I feel
protesting is our Democratic and
fundamental right as long as it doesn't
get violent it doesn't uh you don't
cause inconvenience to anyone you are at
Liberty to protest but having said that
again you know a protest would start
with a legitimate cause with a genuine
reason and slowly as you rightly said as
even raos have agreed that it leads it
gets hijacked by political parties who
use it to their advantage later on that
is why it's very important for the
government any government of the day
it's not about bjb Congress we have a
government they were ruling parties
there whenever protests happen to nip it
in the bud to address those issues and
how does one do that
no I will tell you by communicating when
you open the channel of communication
with them with the people who are
protesting and you tell them I have seen
uh several Vice chancellors in fact they
come they fall under protest just today
I was speaking to a former students
union leader of a university who stays
in our colony and here there was a lot
of issue of garbage picking and water
problem at the things
for example I'm giving you so people
write in the group that oh God is not
picked up from someone so water's not
coming so and so is that enough then
someone said the only way the media will
listen to you nobody listened to you the
only way is go and block the roads now
people protested on that no that's not
the way that's not the right way to go
and draw the roads you should not do
take law in your hands no one has a
right to take law on your hands so the
these people are agreed they're so
agitated
no one is listening to them so now do
you know they asked
orop the Wonder
it's been years but they don't they
don't need any damage any harm they just
want to communicate a point and mere
General saying in fact he hasn't got an
appointment to the topographers yet
unfortunately he's been a war veteran so
it is not about being a war veteran
being an award winner be a Medal winner
it's about a common citizen any common
citizen when the channels of
communications are open as you well know
the channel of communication
come Cuts both ways okay
in a conversation which is
of great great seriousness
there is no really room for compromise
you can't do halfway house you can't
come to a deal over this right it's a
it's a very serious charge either the
charge is accurate for which has to be
tried before court and investigation has
to happen or the charge is inaccurate
and we have to be very careful
for great reason
that when a woman comes and says
something we have to prime a face he
take it seriously as authentic why
should we not okay so now let me get a
Lok method back into this now Lok Mehta
whether we like it or not whether the
wrestlers themselves the protesters want
it or not this is now becoming into a
free-for-all okay and let's not kid
ourselves
what happens in a free-for-all
there will be people who show up who are
showing up uninvited none of the
wrestlers would have called them up and
said please you know bring a thousand
Farmers from Rajasthan and join us but
they'll show up anyway
and then they will make it about
themselves
how do we prevent a complete confusion
from taking place
at this point of time
the problem is somebody behind this
curtain also were Frankly Speaking you
know there were political forces and
there you are also mentioned about it he
there will be election year also so
problem is what Sunita ji suggested okay
there should be his commission there
should be a press commission there
should be some other commissions but
what they will do then again they will
say no no we don't believe because we
don't want this commission the member is
Sunita is
no no they are not eligible so the
problem is the government says something
then they will not accept because
somebody is behind this also so not the
player the wrestlers but the other
political forces who are supporting this
kind of vegetation against the body
government or this is Union government
and registration thing because of the
some election in the up us
bigger number of wrestlers are there
nobody is coming for supporting them
that is is the main reason that's why
I'm saying that there should be some
Channel means
even the court will also say Okay
discuss and come well we can just say
Okay do the fast investigation should be
very fast and the time being or even
okay but again the onion here is you
well know is that if several years ago
an individual
is touching somebody inappropriately or
making some sort of Illusions or
innuendo or comment passing which is
making somebody feel uncomfortable
perhaps worse and that's what the
allegation is at this point of time the
allegation stands that this individual
at least with two of the wrestlers
who've spoken out came and said that he
came and he grabbed our breasts he
grabbed our stomachs in a clearly
provocative
manner which had nothing to do with any
sort of a physical testing which
generally a doctor would do and not
certainly a head of a a sporting body
but that's the charge okay it's not a
charge of rape it's not a charge of of
sexual assault but it is a charge of
sexual harassment this is where it
stands it tomorrow could revolve to us
further more serious I don't know but
this is where they stand right now so
Nida kedara it's a very difficult
problem ma'am because some cynics would
say that this is politics that these
people have been put out as as a front
that what is bajrang punya doing there
at this point of time he might get a
ticket from a political party tomorrow
what do we do with the cynics okay if
you are saying this ticket and all these
are Olympic medalists Commonwealth
medalist otherwise also they would have
got ticket so that that's not the matter
thing is government of the day can sort
out this problem nobody questioned nada
see everybody is questioning that
oversight committee but nobody can
question NADA same way I'm talking of
sports law I'm talking of ioc rule I'm
talking of Olympic Charter they have
they have not formed any ethics
commission which is empowered like a
small Court like a tribunal court and
there you know the rule is any
misconduct any professional misconduct
by any official is live band from sport
any misconduct by athlete also can be
taken care of by giving punishment NADA
is you do you know anyone coming out
there no because it is a powerful body
same way anti-doping panel
that they have to have ethics commission
which is empowered codified notified by
the government and it is a rule they
have signed the charter okay
they have on they are all following
International Olympic Committee rules
and regulations okay so I'm talking
about sports okay all right okay okay
so let me distill this some place to
raise their voice too okay so let me let
me let me distill this from what she is
saying which is not sounding illogical
at all okay
that there needs to be an existing body
because now we have to look at some
points of logic
the points of logic are are we seriously
believing that women sports persons in
this country
have never faced sexual exploitation
harassment or worse
that would be a very very
perverse assumption to make so there is
exists a possibility that this things
happen that they happen often maybe less
now maybe more earlier maybe more in the
future we don't know but to say it's
never happened
is a bit much
are we accusing these
medal winning
wrestlers
of Simply concocting a serious charge
lying
let's be very careful before we do
something like that
so we have to take what they are saying
at face value as the law demands
there has to be a mechanism for their
voices to be heard
there has to be an acceptance of the
reasonableness of that mechanism from
both sides
but there also has to be an acute
understanding that once the hijack
happens and the hijack is underway
then the actual nub of the charge
nobody remembers it's forgotten
the actual victims as they might
themselves be
are subsumed by the people who will play
Politics on them now it's very confusing
genuinely confusing
that why
kappanchayat Farmers from Rajasthan
would want to come and join this protest
genuinely confusing other sports person
joining even political parties going up
and showing empathy and sympathy
perfectly legitimate this is where it
becomes a slippery slope so clearly we
have not handled this well we can do
better
communication is a better idea figuring
it on what is required before the
agendas take over and the agendas take
over another Siege in Delhi another
protest in Delhi and everybody would
have forgotten what the cause is let's
hope we can solve this before it becomes
worse certainly a solution is available
certainly the commission is a logical
solution which everybody can buy into
people who are then investigating it yes
the investigations are challenged the
defending party will also Challenge and
have the right to do so that's how the
Judas Prudence in this country Works
let's get it going and let's make it
work but not by having a few thousand
Farmers from Rajasthan up show up
claiming that they're coming for the
wrestlers

been told that a total of 23 000
civilians have been rescued by the Army
from the
troubled areas now
this is difficult news because at one
time if you are trying to remove
civilians who are caught between two
warning sides or taking Law and Order
into their own hands while you're trying
to preserve their life and Liberty at
the same time
we are
using the terminology that we're
rescuing Indians from where from India
this is not South Sudan that we are
rescuing Indians from so it's a very
very unhappy situation now we have been
being told that these these civilians
are being moved to operating military
garrisons right now to make sure that
they have food and housing available
meanwhile the Army has significantly
enhanced its surveillance efforts
this is through aerial surveillance
which means uavs are being put Army
patrols of helicopters are being
conducted all of this is happening
within the imfal valley this of course
comes with the state has been plagued by
violence over the last few days now my
colleague Vijay is joining us on the
broadcast
foreign
everybody
foreign
[Music]
Ty of the locals
and if the only temporary solution we
are finding is to actually put several
of the well several thousand people into
Army garrisons where their security can
be guaranteed by the Indian army that's
an important effort that the Indian army
is clearly making because the first
priority again has to be to preserve
life and Liberty
but this is not a happy situation nor is
it a happy solution
we don't want to create internet
displaced people we want these people to
be able to safely go home and carry on
with their lives as soon as possible
which means that we have to address
a larger crisis
a part of that solution has to be in to
ensure that the people
genuinely agreed parties get a chance to
be heard and have their grievances
redressed in the most efficacious manner
as possible lumpen elements and those
who prey on genuine aggravation
and then create a hostile violent
situation need to be dealt with
differently
we have to be both empathetic
a lacritic interaction and symbol
simultaneously make sure
that people who are just innocent
civilians there don't caught up and lose
their lives too many lives have been
lost already I think quicker action is
required some action is being taken
clearly an unhappy situation and
obviously on this the politics has
started it is perfectly reasonable for
the opposition wherever they might be to
highlight this issue and urgently
request not only government of the state
but at the center which is going to have
to play a large large role in solving
this very rapidly you've had Congress
leaders reach out and now I'm being told
the chattisgarh chief minister has
spoken out on this listening
foreign
foreign

leaders including Prime Minister Modi

course campaigning right now in
Karnataka last day of campaigning is

become about Manipur has raised it

broadcast Vijay why is this become an
issue in Karnataka

hello and welcome to we women want this
is a show that you've been watching
every week this is a show where we raise
women's issues issues pertaining to body
shaming to domestic violence to laws
that help women and laws some laws that
don't help women we take up women's
rights women's issues but today I have a
show with a slight difference as you
know everything is not black and white
women are not always a victim we've also
seen some women taking advantage of laws
that are actually supposed to help women
but using these to Target men and spouse
their own individual cause So today
we're going to be delving into that gray
area and I asked the question are all
women always victims as you know nothing
is black and white and today to add some
color in the conversation I have a panel
of very feisty women women who dare to
think out of the box joining me on the
show is me she's a familiar face on TV
debates but she's also someone who's
spoken a lot on gender issues she's
worked a lot on the triple talak issues
she was is an activist doing the Nirvana
Island she took to the street during the
rape case and of course someone who is
not scared of speaking her mind also
joining me Deepika bhardwaja she's a
documentary filmmaker she's also an
activist who's been doing a lot of work
on causes where you know she's been
taking causes I think where men are
being unjustly Accused by women
especially in rape cases in Dowry cases
so she's someone who is very active and
outspoken and of course al-qashri dhar
she is the managing partner at the law
offices of India someone who knows the
law someone who's articulate and someone
as I said who can make a stand and of
course also doesn't see things in black
and white despite the outfits that she's
wearing so Shazia really you know as I
said it's not true that all women are
always victims you know there are I mean
I'm there is a case for taking a women's
rights and women's issues but there is
that gray area also where women some
women take advantage of absolutely Priya
and I would like to discuss that I grew
up in kanpur
where there was women were the Lesser
models there was actually a difference
in terms of the education they could get
or the access they had and in terms of
the social status women were
so to speak the
um the the sole desire was to
find a find a husband let's say and keep
a family and he has to reproduce
cookwell that was the mark of Womanhood
and that's what it's built that's what
it was all about but having going
further in my journey uh as an activist
as a journalist as a television news
anchor yeah as a politician as somebody
who interacts with men and women and all
genders because some people will take to
it I'm realizing this whole identity of
being a woman or being a you know having
an identity based on gender
religion
caste region
can actually be a huge disabler and
takes away from the very purpose of
equity
for instance women are not victims uh
and survivors at all times women are
perpetrators but in the because there
has been such a it has been a
feudalistic mindset and uh thankfully a
Judiciary has risen to the occasion and
and we've and so as a parliament and
made fantastic laws ensuring that there
is no bias but we do see that a lot of
women misuse the very laws which are
meant to protect them but they use it to
oppress subjugate and yes you didn't
blame the men we see look at the Dowry
laws
sexual harassment rape laws so the
presumption that a woman is always right
and who she accuses is is the aggressor
is wrong I think I think it's patently
I've had fantastic women leaders and
I've had fantastic men leaders I've had
more problems with women versus at my
place of work uh then I've had with my
main bosses the repository of power
can be of any gender but if the if if
the if power dynamics of patriarchy as a
belief women also subscribe to the same
belief how are they different from Men
so the fight is against the system of
patriarchy and not against men per se
because women can be uh the the
repository of the same beliefs okay
that's a very uh thing I articulate in a
strong statement but Deepika you've also
been I remember cases for instance like
when we were you know debating that uh
whether the murder murder case I think
when she was hacked into pieces and put
in a fridge you were sending me uh
instances where women when their boy
lovers were hacking the husbands and you
know so it's works both ways we can't
just say that women are always a victim
that's the case you've been making for
long I think absolutely Priya as we sit
here right now I'm sure none of the news
channels would be showing this but in
ghaziabad there's a woman who hacked her
husband to death uh cut his uh chopped
his head off along with her lover and
the reason behind that only was because
the husband was not willing to write off
the property in her name and uh I did a
research on such cases in 2022 about 218
murders where husbands were killed by
their wives along with their lovers so
to say that women are always victims and
men are always perpetrators I personally
see exactly the opposite of it every
single day just because of course my
work there's no denial that there are a
lot of women who are subjected to
domestic violence who are subjected to
sexual abuse but that doesn't mean that
only women are victims and men are not
another thing which is specific I think
about India is even though we are
calling uh we are progressing and you
know trying to get bring equality in
every space but if you look at the laws
of India the entire gender-based
Provisions uh consider only women as a
victim I get cases every single day
where men are battered by their wives
where there are boyfriends abused by
their living Partners girlfriends there
are false accusations there are men who
was suicidal in who commits suicide
writing in this you side notes that a
female was an aggressor and an abuser
and they cannot take it anymore but
sadly the laws and the provisions that
we have do not really see a man as a
perpetrator and even when he is the
victim uh there is so much of fear in
men right now to go and Report because
the police tells them very openly
tomorrow
so they cannot even go and complain the
law is where you come in Alka really and
you know is the law really slanted in
favor of women and how often do you see
it being misused see we have to call us
pay this paid first let's get to the
ground reality the ground reality is
that let's go by the statistics and the
surveys done there was this National
family had surveyed on in which it was
found that around 86 percent of the
women you know they took in the abuse of
the husbands and they thought it was
justified in 2022 two years back again a
survey by the national family service
because they go from household to
household and they come and they get us
this data which tells us exactly what is
happening on the ground what's the
ground reality
eighty percent of them again said you
know they deserved it and if the husband
was abusing them it was okay women are
saying it's okay to be abused yes they
Justified it in a certain way
so then it brings us to the fact that is
there something called uh the victim
syndrome it's interesting is this
I mean the women they themselves believe
that it's okay if they get abused by the
husband so that is the ground reality
and that is why because of this abuse
and even on This Global Gender Gap
report India was 135 out of 148
countries in which the equality between
men and women was so minimal you know
the first of course would be the
Scandinavian country but we were 135 so
that is the ground reality the ground
reality is that women do get victimized
and they don't have much of a say and
that is why looking on this that's the
Parliament and the legislation then we
made the DV act the domestic violence
act
etc etc in which if you see the a grief
person is who it's just the women I mean
it can be uh incontrovertibly say that
in a marriage the husband doesn't get
traumatized he doesn't get arrested of
course they do of course they do but
there is no law enacted for them right
DV acts data we say that then you have
this 498a of Indian
again that has that is also Draconian
law no doubt about it and there's been a
plethora of cases by the Supreme Court
in which the Supreme Courts so many
Priti Gupta so many the Supreme Court
has
again and again said that 498 a IPC is
been misused and yes it has been misused
it has been in fact there was another
case in which a pil was filed in the
Supreme Court by one sushil Kumar in
which he went to the Supreme Court
saying that 498 a should be held as
unconstitutional and to be held down but
then again the Supreme Court said just
because it's been misused in some of the
cases that doesn't mean that it needs to
be struck down but the point is the fact
reality is that 490 a yes again was
misused I know as a lawyer that it was I
just want to come in and just add to a
preview allow me
um I do agree with most of what you say
and it's it's something I've seen I
remember my my cousin sister
um actually saying it and as she got
married at a very young age so much so
that I wanted to report it as a I was 16
she was about 17 they were getting her
married off to somebody far away and I
actually called up the cops being young
and I said this is wrong because I read
below 18 it's not but I don't know the
cops also laughed at me
whatever and he says
but that girl later on when I met her my
cousin I don't can't name her I asked
her why did you get married if I didn't
say anything and how does your husband
treat you and she said it's actually
very good I said I hope he doesn't treat
you because I I grew up like that you
see I saw this all this around me and
she said he's very nice he does beat me
but not so much
and I just couldn't believe it this was
her fate yes
but you know I want to ask now today
that this conversation is what we're
having but can you we have other
conversations too that women can also
cause
um
insufferable grief and in terrible
cruelty to to the opposite sex it's a
it's an it's a gender it's not always a
gender Dynamics a male female Dynamics
but the individuals in question two like
the question of the lady who hacked uh
the woman who hacked her husband to to
bits so it's talk I'm talking about that
whole power thing it's a power thing I
was gonna use the right word it is which
brings me to me too that was a real
power game really also we saw a lot of
cases you know uh something I think the
most beautiful thing that you said I
think sums it up Shazia it's the power
and anybody can have the power when
you're talking about female bosses today
there are women who have all who have
been brought up very very equally with
their male uh brothers or you know have
been brought up in an environment which
is where they've got everything that a
you know boy of our average family would
get so they're also aggressive they're
also abusive they also would not take
anything and instead would sometimes and
a lot of times in the cases that I feel
feel it's okay for them to abuse the man
and uh another thing which I see really
really rising up is if he doesn't do
what I say then that is something which
is not right because I am a woman uh he
needs to treat me in a certain way even
if I am being the oppressive one or I am
asking him to do something which he
doesn't want to do it's okay you know so
consciously women are now very very
aware of their rights but I think
somewhere uh that empathy factor is also
losing out another thing that I wanted
to add to uh alka's point is National
Family Health survey is a beautiful data
but again there is a very biased data
when the while they ask a woman if it is
okay for her to be beaten up by her
husband
they do not ask a husband if he gets
beaten up by advice his wife so we do
not have data on how many men are beaten
up by their wives on the other hand
National Family Health survey has asked
women if they beat up their husband and
there's a substantial number that said
yes we have beaten up our husband yes
yes no exactly so that I'm going further
than that the victim syndrome that I was
talking about then again there was a
survey it's not only in India just to
understand how it works in Arizona State
University again uh survey was done in
which they uh spoke to the married
couples and the perception was if the
husband beats up the woman this was done
by skarduzia and she's very well known
and when they said uh I mean across the
board they said a husband beating up a
woman is bad but when they found cases
of the women beating up the husband the
reaction was no the husband must have
done something to provoke her she must
be acting in self defense I mean but
they couldn't bring themselves to it so
that she could also be violent and
abusive towards the husband so it's very
interesting that how the entire thing
not only in India but across the world
that how they look at a woman it's a
mentality that how they look at how the
religions and that Dynamics between the
husband and the wife anywhere across the
world
domestic violence is gender neutral
there's overwhelming percentage of men
also being the victims unfortunately in
India right now we have absolutely no
law or no provision that would even look
at men as the victims even when there
are a lot the only thing that we have is
the suicide statistics and the number of
men who commit suicide every year is
almost three times the number of women
but can we then safely say that women
are more of a victim I mean I I mean we
have to I have absolutely no doubts even
though men's issues the number of women
who suffer is overwhelmingly
thought it's a very poignant thought
we're going to take a break and come
back and keep the conversation going and
also how much of this is really to do
with who holds the economic power you
know and in traditionally it's the men
who go earn so they have a stronger hold
over the women so to say in terms of you
know the one who's the provider of the
household does that give them leave it
to you know act against the women more
when women are not usually the provider
don't take a break can look at this
question but after a quick break
[Applause]
hello and welcome to we women want
taking a look at well a very interesting
question are women always a victim and
is it because you know their conditions
the other factors that one takes into
account like economic issues like social
issues or you know if there is a loop or
whether women gets the upper hand does
she then turn into a predator it's also
shaja you will know a lot of the social
issues you know women are brought up in
a certain way to it's a patriarchal
society yes the men as Swami while the
while the Marxist would have us believe
that it is there is an economic basis to
everything and that culture that decides
everything but exactly but in terms of
social conditioning and the way our
societies are structured uh there is one
not just a victimhood syndrome but the
fact of the matter is it almost every
domestic helper that I've had in Mumbai
when I was staying there and here is
earning the money she is going out there
and actually
um providing for the young ones in
terribly she has a husband who's an
alcohol problem so while she is also the
economic provider but she also but she's
also a victim of uh abuse she's also a
Survivor because she's taken it all and
has become the provider but the social
conditioning is such there would still
need to have the husband by her side
so that we can't go away from that but
also let me tell you in my in the
offices the various offices that I've
been to I was a Topper from a films
films School a prominent one and I know
that one was totally judged by the way
one looked and um there were so there
were men who would look at you in a
certain way
and not expect anything serious from you
but you have to fight your way but there
were equal number of women who took
advantage of the fact that they were
women and that a a male boss had a glad
eye for them and used it to get ahead so
it made it it just muddied the waters
for other women who wanted to use their
intellectual faculties and mental
abilities to get ahead and not being a
woman or a body and it also took away a
lot from other men whose only fault was
that they were not women so I biology
call out while nitu movement and I'm all
for it to calling out of such men
because this is a global movement
against sexual abuse I also must I think
we must also call out those women who
use this to the advantage because they
because of them there are other women
who suffer and because they are not
ready to they're not available in a
space they don't want to play the woman
card in office because you know that's
not what offices are for who want to be
colleagues and and partners and
collaborators and equals and fellow
journalists and fellow anchors and not
women you see so that also is held
against them okay so I speak I think we
should call out some of those women too
who take advantage of this women against
women is in a whole new equation I don't
think it's a woman against women thing
just like good men should be against bad
men who do wrong to women uh good women
should be absolutely against bad women
who do wrong to men I think that's what
makes a healthy Society anybody can be
wrong man or a woman the important thing
is to stand up against the perpetrator
whoever it is and another thing that I
wanted to bring when we are talking
about power Priya is socially there is
no doubt absolutely whether it's
economical or you know it's social the
power is of course held by men but
what's happened off late is because of
the laws that we have and because of the
belief system especially that we need to
really do something for women uh We've
sort of come to a point where whatever
woman says at least you know when she's
going out and making an allegation it's
like whatever the woman says is to be
treated as gospel truth that is that
that is something which is extremely
problematic just two days back there's a
guy who's suffering a third K third
stage blood cancer in Lucknow I
highlighted that case that man was had
just come out of chemotherapy and he has
fallen out with a friend of uh he's who
they had been friends for a long time
She's accused him of molestation and
absolutely false charges and while his
family is right now dealing with the
trauma of a blood cancer they have to
now fight a molestation case right now I
am
investigating and bringing out cases
from across India where there's one
woman who has gone on filing multiple
rape cases seven rape cases eight rape
cases nine rape cases saying this guy
promised marriage to me and then rape me
on Falls promise of marriage you know
the fir under a serious crime like rape
getting registered merely on what the
woman said
and you know subjecting that man to
First jail his job goes away his entire
family
there is no investigation at all
the crime of rape yes and and the and
the actual uh uh victims and survivors
of rape yeah and when you're talking
about victims in perpetrator I think
create is very important to analyze the
laws that were brought that were to
protect women now there are women who
have misused the law so much that there
are more and more judgments coming
what's that gonna do earlier it happened
with 498 the people just stop believing
those cases now it's happening with
something as serious as rape I think
that's very very going forward on what
you're saying because you're absolutely
correct and that's exactly like you
rightly said uh that 498 happened so the
recourse to that of course I mean
without going into I mean like I said
before it's a complex thing but the
recourse to that would be to go to to
the court like for example for 98 was
misused so much that again when people
went to the court the court the Supreme
Court laids down the guidelines it was
in our Niche Kumar yeah exactly the
Supreme Court says that you can't
because earlier under 4 1980 the husband
and the relatives would get arrested
straight away but in that case the court
said no you can't you have to follow
section 41
etc etc so the recourse is there so and
the Judiciary is the recourse that we
have to go to but that shouldn't take
away from it why not at the police
station level itself if a woman has
filed seven cases against seven
different men on the same excuse
noon you are absolutely right but it
takes I know it's taking far too long
for it to trickle down to the grassroot
levels the police station themselves
would not be aware of what arnish Kumar
is but then those guidelines are not
applicable applicable to rape cases no
no I'm talking about four nine years but
you know but when there is something
like the your friends like when he I
mean he has a request to go to the court
see I have a lot of uh I mean I think
the recourse is going to the Judiciary
that is the backbone of our society if
something goes wrong that's where we go
in
foreignty I think sometimes it's an over
correction let's see there has been
absolutely correction as a solution that
over that over correction brings is also
very close to that what is the recourse
I'm or I've always been and I'm all
there for
gay rights and most many of my friends
are but I cannot apologize for being
heterosexual
but wokeness and political correctness
that you know I'm sorry but I am at
protection but that was my point I'm
ashamed but but that proves the point
every man can't be shamed for being a
man but that proves myself
again foreign
police officers as possible at the IG
level DGP level what they say is the
laws are like that what should we do
there's nothing for the man we have to
do everything for the woman that is
something which is problematic again for
377 now the recourse was where it's the
Supreme Court so ultimately it is the
core okay just moving on from the
thoughts I just want to go on the social
uh yeah
on the social part uh like hijab bearing
hijab people are saying it's a matter of
choice some women also want to wear a
hijab would you agree that no I don't
see I come from a family where my mother
so for a for a young girl who's 13 or 14
when she sees all the women in her
household wearing bruhas and when she
knows that if she were to defy it she
doesn't have a chance she would be
called a bad girl and if her parents
were to allowed they would have to
suffer social ridicule and boycott and
ostracism it is not a choice
so I don't think uh burkha is ever and I
think these are pro-choice and all of
them they're very cool words the
semantics lovely tags that I've been
there and also they use politically and
I really feel there's some areas like
these which should be where these
politics should not enter if a rape is a
rape is a rape it does not matter if the
rape happens in a state which is bgp
ruled or congress ruled but then
everything becomes a politicization so
because hijab and if I were to talk
about it it becomes about which party is
saying it and why but some things are
beyond that all I'm saying is issues
such as this crimes against women they
they they're at the core of a being as a
society at least politicization by
activists men and women uh should be uh
no I want to just do the society part
because we are right to choose that's
the point I wanted to make that because
we are conditioned in such a way you may
say I'm giving you the choice but
actually you're not giving them a choice
because if a woman goes out in a Muslim
neighborhood without a job she will
immediately be labeled as you know very
fast very loose very non-conformative so
this is the pressure of society that one
has also do you know that's absolutely
right Priya there is no doubt that women
have so much of Expectations by the
society on what they wear where they go
out who they go out and all of that is
there but let me also say that you know
it's not necessary that traditionalism
is always evil or you know modernism or
westernization is always good I think as
women we have to make a choice in fact
make a wiser choice on what is it that
is right and what is it that is wrong a
simple understanding of that if I'm
going to a temple I should be dressed
well and if I'm going to a club I can
rest the way I want if somebody is
asking you to go to a temple or any
religious place in a normal in a decent
attire I don't think that is operations
so the choices are not a burqa or a
bikini yeah because either way you're
either concealing or revealing but it's
only
about the body I think women are much
more than their bodies right and if they
want that that to Prevail it has to be
about the personhood and not just the
body exactly and emancipation is not the
right to wear a bikini but more than
this emancipation is when a woman has
the right to choose whatever she wants
to wear be it a bikini or a burqa yeah
what you want to say is I think this
whole uh victim narrative or you know
saying that women have been oppressed
for centuries eventually needs to go if
you're talking about equality you have
to talk about taking equal rights and
equal responsibilities you cannot just
act as victim at your convenience I
personally really
some of the social this thing so like
over correction is always a problem for
me like what we're seeing now similarly
that's a small point I want to make
similarly when they came out with when
you want to shame men who efts or if it
is just a term that has been used as a
Victorian term I don't agree with it who
quickly sexually harassed uh when they
when when you come up with something
like [ __ ] walk and you think that's cool
I don't think it appeals to me either so
that is not the answer
but on that note uh thank you all for
this conversation at least we're opening
uh you know looking at things from a
different point of view which is what
this show is all about as I said earlier
you know everything is not just one
Conformity there are loopholes there are
people who take advantage some people
who are victims but at the end of the
way let's look at the whole picture to
get actually what is happening the
ground reality on the ground thank you
all for this conversation thank you
thank you so much

raked up the jnk issue in a joint
statement following a meeting between
Chinese foreign minister Kim gang and
his Pakistan counterpart
belovedari in the statement they
reiterated their position that the
Kashmir issue should be properly and
peacefully resolved in accordance with
the United Nations Charter relevant
Security Council resolutions and
bilateral agreements they have also
opposed any unilateral action that could
complicate the already volatile
situation I have with me on the
broadcast Ambassador Suresh Kumar goyal
who is a former Diplomat sir what do you
make of this development
these are really traditional positions
of Pakistan and China will support it
simply because uh China needs Pakistan
for its success into the Arabian Sea and
also for its cpec etc etc China needs
Pakistan as Pakistani China so I really
wouldn't worry too much about that as
Ian said earlier uh they need to wake up
and face the reality history has changed
they do not have that kind of a control
over the developments in Jamul Kashmir
uh
uh anymore so while they keep on
reiterating and also the fact that they
were together in Delhi but in Delhi they
did not dare say anything at all they
didn't have the uh or maybe they were
wise enough not to put this position in
New Delhi while uh we here was here and
they had to really wait to go back to

foreign
as the United Kingdom gets a new King in
the form of Charles news X takes a
moment to remember those who lost their
lives on 13th April 1919. I am talking
about the mass killings at the
jallianwalabag
hundreds were gathered in this ground in
Amritsar on best sake the Harvest
Festival
it was a peaceful silent protest against
the ban on public assembly by the
British authorities
the people gathered in the ground could
have never imagined the Bloodshed and
the Carnage that would follow on the
orders of one man
the man was General Reginald Dyer
General Dyer entered the jallianwala
bagh not to disperse the peaceful crowd
but with entirely evil intentions
with nearly a hundred soldiers and two
armored vehicles Daya blocked the single
entry to the jallianwala bagh the next
10 minutes witnessed one of the most
gruesome mass murders in Indian history
General Dias troops opened fire on the
peaceful Gathering
the bullet marks of Dyer's Carnage
continue to be preserved at the
jallianwala bagh till date
a British inquiry claims that less than
400 people were killed but Indian
authorities know that over a thousand
peaceful protesters were killed on the
13th of April 1919 at the hands of
General Reginald Dyer
visuals of this are on your screens
six months after the massacre on October
14 1919 a committee was constituted by
Secretary of State for India Edwin
montago to investigate the incident
which was led by William Hunter this
committee's report confirmed that dire
never wanted to Simply disperse the
protesters the report States and I quote
without giving the crowd any warning to
disperse which he considered unnecessary
as they were in breach of his
Proclamation he ordered his troops to
Fire and the firing continued for about
10 minutes the report confirms that Dyer
never had the intention to disperse the
crowd he admitted to the committee
saying and I'm quoting her I had made up
in my mind I was only wondering whether
I should do it or not the situation was
very very serious I had made up my mind
that I would suit all men to death if
they were going to continue the meeting
they are accepted that the crowd may
have even dispersed without the firing
but he wanted to make a wide impression
he told the committee they had come to
fight if they defied me I was going to
give them a lesson I was going to punish
them my idea from the military point of
view was to make a wide impression
to make a wide impression General
Reginald Dyer opened fire on over a
thousand peaceful protesters and
murdered them
the same general Dyer should have
ideally been sent back to Britain
disgraced Instead This is what the Edwin
Montague
committee had to say about Daya
I'm quoting here once again Brigadier
General diet displayed honesty of
purpose and unflinching adherence to his
conception of his duty that cannot for a
moment be questioned
so this is what the committee had to say
about Daya in any other world General
Daya would have been tried for his crime
against humanity instead he was shipped
back to the UK where he received a
hero's welcome
we will put on our screens an article in
a British newspaper called The Morning
Post there it is on your screens viewers
this was published in July of 1920. it
is an appreciation fund for General Dyer
you can clearly read it on your screens
dire appreciation fund and appeal for
funds to present to General dye the
article says for General dire the man
who saved India this article read and
once again I quote on General Dyer's
Judgment at his judgment alone the
future of Punjab and it may well be of
India was placed and he fearlessly did
his duty his worst enemies cannot say
that the result of his action was a
revolution on the contrary Revolution
gaining ground on every side was crushed
this is what the article read and in the
first 12 hours
the newspaper actually managed to
collect
584 pounds eventually raising a hefty
sum of 26 000 pounds for General Dyer
among the many who contributed to this
fund were the most renowned names was
Nobel Laureate Rudyard Kipling the same
Rudyard Kipling whose stories we have
all grown up reading the same Rudyard
Kipling who also wrote the infamous
quote-unquote White Man's Burden
for centuries the white man felt that
They Carried the burden to civilize us
the Savages but today as the UK gets its
new king the roles have reversed it is
now our burden to perhaps teach the West
some empathy your Must Be Wondering Why
We are discussing
today the question I'd like to pose is
why not the United Kingdom has had over
seven decades to apologize for the
jaliamala bagh massacre they may have
forgotten but we have not so we take
this moment and this day to remind
ourselves of what happened
and to do this I have with me very
special guests joining us on the
broadcast with my colleague pankaj Mali
who's joining us from jaliamala bagh he
also has with him Sunil Kapoor he's a
grandson of Lala vasumal Kapoor who died
in jaliamala bagh Massacre
he also has with him s purushottam the
head of the
Mahabharata trust and a senior
journalist and we also have with us Dr
surinder kanwal president for punjabi
Heritage Foundation and a writer
pankaj
you're standing at the jaliamwala bark
today as we begin this telecast a lot of
visuals have already started coming in
of the king's coronation that's
currently taking place in the United
Kingdom
if you can take this moment pankaj to
take our viewers
through what exactly happened on the
13th of April 1919
over to you pankaj
explain to our viewers the entire
sequence of events with the special
guests that we have with us joining us

it's a it's a very important
conversation that we are trying to have
and I'm really grateful to the guests
that have joined us today to take us
through this conversation because like I
said in the beginning
the British may have forgotten but we
have not joining me on the broadcast is
also Mr harinder sikka msika thank you
so much sir for joining us today
as we have this very difficult
conversation
we've spoken to three people sir live
from jaliambag
they all have the same complaint they
say that of course an apology will not
bring the dead back it will not make the
suffering of the family subsequently any
lesser
but an apology is an important part of a
healing process
of the British crown and the British
Empire and the British government
accepting the role that they played in
keeping silent in trying to brush the
entire incident under the carpet that
not enough was done against General Dyer
why do you think Mr sikka Nobody from
the British crown or the Empire wants to
actually apologize do you feel that it
perhaps in their minds they feel that
this will open up a can of worms because
what all
will the British Empire have to then
apologize for
I'll like to take you a little back it
is important without which this entire
debate is of no utility use in my
opinion
uh take a little
uh push it a little back
we were slaves
first by mukuls than by britishers and
then and then by gandhis
we have steadfastly insured that these
facts are not brought out
I had the opportunity to go to uh
kalapani during my Navy days
and I realized that that all the all the
all these spaces all the places over
there were filled with those slates were
filled with Martyrs names we sarvakar
was one of them the Bengali so they have
the Sikhs are there
we don't remember it we don't want to
remember it we have not been allowed to
remember it
now I had an opportunity to go to Poland
where is Riley Children Are brought to
gas Chambers which are now museums they
went before they enter they have in a
funny mood in a happy mood and they are
celebrating the picnic and so on so
forth but when they enter the chambers
they realize what their forefathers went
through
they come out and are two hours later
they're crying
because they can remember or they can
recall their forefathers grandfathers
and great grandfathers who suffered that
what have we done in return nothing
we do not allow these facts to come out
in public domain
we do not allow our books to talk about
the the brutality that mughals did on us
we do not allow the the books to talk
about the brutality that that britishers
did on us so why we why should we blame
britishers
they find that we are we are happily
playing ball with them have we ever
demanded the Kohinoor back no we have
not we don't want it or keep it with you
your majesty I'll give you another
example I was invited to Windsor Palace
for to play golf there and the evening
party it said that the dress is
compulsorily compulsorily necktie
I said I'm sorry I'm not going to wear
necktie black tie
a black tie means you you put a bow and
and that British style of black jacket
and trousers and what have you I said no
this is not my National Dress I'm I'll
go back I'll not wear it so then they
said okay what where your National dress
so I went and won the last so
and I to my great surprise and shock
I was the only one who had who was
wearing a a
bandagala over there everybody was
meticulously dressed in a in a
black tie why
who's to wake us up why are we
questioning them when you climb the
Windsor Palace right from the first step
to that beautiful Hall every thing that
was showcased was a loot from India
displayed on the stairs displayed inside
the Halls we eat Maharaja Ranjit Singh's
The Golden Throne everything over there
on display why can't we demand it oh we
are not demanding it
but
the slave factor of the shekels of
slaves slavery we were pushed down our
throat please explain me somebody
what did Madam Indira Gandhi do
or after death be given a huge track of
land to be buried over there or burnt
whatever she was done
what did Rajiv Gandhi do to be given
that then Sanjay Gandhi was also given a
track of land after death
why
so
it's it's just that that
was the britishers of us the mughals and
the why should we have a aurangzeb road
or Akbar Road or chahaki Road yes right
so beautiful prose for them it has to
come out from our system
that we demand we are not requesting
this apology
we need to demand that apology
and what Prime Minister Modi did I dare
say
it was the first and first time in 75
years that a prime minister decided that
Raj Marg has to be changed
nobody thought about it
why
why did in the in in the in the in
2013-12-13 the British logo was put back
the cross on the Indian Navy and sign
we want to remain in that slavery mode
because that is how it is it is it is it
is put in our mind that we were ruled
then we are going to be ruled today
yes
slavery absolutely and we are not
willing to come out of this slavery
unfortunately because we are not allowed
I'll ask you another question you ask
anyone any child today even even who was
a Raja Guru
yes when did when was jhansi Ki Rani
film made
who stopped this film to come out in the
public domain
Congress
which was this Congress the British idea
or a or or or nehru idea
we got to break the slavery
unless and until we break these shackles
we will remain under one or the other
link or chain or a block
absolutely and at the same time Mr sikka
you know I also began uh the
introduction to this show by saying that
a lot of people today would be wondering
that why have we chosen today on the day
of the coronation when several people
are in fact very much interested in
watching King Charles become be anointed
as the king of England why is it that we
are focusing on jallianwala bhag and the
question really then arises why not why
are we so afraid of talking about our
own history and things that pain us
something that we have not had a healing
process for an apology a simple apology
would perhaps lead to the healing of
several families who for Generations
were disrupted by what happened at
jallianwala bagh Mr sikka
so it took us 75 years to make a film
and that also was a half-hearted work
it took us it took us
decades to write a book on a story on
Kashmir files
these things are are very very
intentional this is a plan under 40.
there are very very methodical way to
step and to press it down to keep it
keep it under the under the carpet
you know this why are we not asking
talking about
after all why are we not talking about
uttam Singh who did this brave brave Act
why we are not demanding
not requesting that you apologize Mr
Charles
you are no longer the Lord that used to
be there was a time when all the when
the Sun never set on British Empire
all roads red to led to Rome
or USSR was the ultimate
the Timeless cycle has changed
no Road leads to Rome these days
the sun set a long time ago on British
Empire
we are the rising country today
we are the superpower in the making
it's time that we demanded
it's time that we demanded an apology
the Kohinoor should come back with honor
and request a respect all the wealth
that you have collected over there the
loot that you have kept it over there as
if it is a private property must return
must be returned
absolutely at least started demanding
for God's sake we go into them with the
folded hands
ome
or
the one party which was responsible one
family which was responsible they did it
methodically
I used to read in my college days
stories
must have been a great grand leader of
mughals no
it was a killer
and so what's guilty
but to date to date
the nalanda station is called
bhaktiarpur station
in the name of the killer nalanda of
nalanda University
why are we doing this
why are we not willing to
put our spine up together
and say that this is not on we demand an
apology
at the same time you know if you can
just explain to our viewers that's once
again we've spoken like I said to
several guests who joined us from
jaliambag but why don't you also share
what is it that your family has over
Generations told you about that fateful
day
Mr sikka can you hear me
yeah yeah sorry yeah yes I thought you
were asking somebody else yes yes so no
no my question is to you we we had
several people join us earlier live from
jaliambag who have taken us uh through
some of the stories and what exactly
happened but I also want to understand
from you what is it that your family has
told you over Generations about 13th of
April 1919.
when I was born I was taken to
arimandasa where my naming ceremony was
done and thereafter every year my
parents would take me to arimander Saab
and jallianwalabad I grew up learning
what the British has did to us and what
general Dyer did to us
so in my opinion
you want why why Israeli students are
I've spent a lot of time in Tel Aviv and
Jerusalem
why are they so brave
they are shown their past
how these how their families have
suffered
they are not
we want to remember only one Family
Trust Me
we we make jokes of we saw worker
it's shameful
so unless and until you allow your
future generation or the upcoming
generation
to see to see for themselves with naked
eye what happened
the brutality of britishers
was Way Beyond
that you can you can express it
if you all the students one by one they
should be given discounted tickets go
and see kalapani go and see
put your feet in those shoes how
how they were fired upon
for no rival reason
a peaceful death is not even a protest
you know we it is not British as fault
once again I'm telling you
you go to Bank of England all the
lockers are filled with artifacts
belonging to India
you know if they go and selling it left
right and Center
it is it is a loot as per the
international laws is required to be
returned
right there were paintings that were
stolen from India by the way and and
satis was supposed to be there's a book
which is called The Poetry office uh
portray of a secret by Mr tarun
Maharishi just now released
two beautiful paintings were stolen and
so please was selling it auctioning it
and the government of India objected to
that that this belongs to our country
they must be returned and they were
returned
the stolen paintings are returned they
were about 10 million pounds each those
two paintings and and many of the other
artifacts Mr sikkar also on display
during this coronation ceremony several
of the parties uh there was an entire
room that was set up and it was said
that uh many artifacts that are very
precious to King Charles himself he's
chosen them in their own display for
people to come and see a lot of people
don't realize that all of this has a
very dark history to it and something
that the British have ran away for a
very long time from when we talk about
the luxury or the Grandeur of the
British Empire of the British crown of
England as a nation where did all of
this come from where are the money to
support all of this come from
that's five trillion dollars
the British looted
45 trillion dollars make it 43 or 45 one
of the two figures
all right
no that's obscene kind of money in those
times
they're looted and looted with with
entitlement as if it was their
Birthright
I'm saying is that you know
we are forgetting that every cycle
has an ending
as I said there was a time when the Sun
never set on British Empire
and and now the British prime minister
is a poodle to the the American
president
you will say yes if the president wants
him to say yes those times have changed
no roads lead to Rome yes you know the
USSR is no longer the mighty Force I'm
nothing remains permanent forever
and the British must understand
that we and why should British
understand I'm sorry I take that word
back
why are we part of Commonwealth
absolutely your majesty and your his
majesty
you know when you're meeting the queen
or the or the king you're supposed to
kneel a little bit why
absolutely
pertinent questions you leave us with
and some of them we will answer through
the course of the rest of the day
viewers as you can see flashing at the
bottom of our screens several special
telecasts have been lined up today

Mighty community and the cookie tribe
well problems in Manipur continue to
flare up there have been a number of
incidences in the past where
many people have been killed and of
course the state government as well as
the central government is absolutely
worried about this violence that is
transpiring in Manipur
the rapid action force had also been
flown in earlier on and
a few days ago the Manipur government
had issued shoot at site orders as
violence in the state had spread to its
capital in Fall as well
this order was of course signed by the
manipul Manipur governor
and that empowered the state's
magistrates to shoot at sight
and persuasion warning reasonable Force
Etc had all been exhausted it is what
the government the state government had
said
and around 500 Personnel of the
reproduction Force
which is a right controlled police of
course had been flown into him fall they
joined the army the Assam rifles the
centralizer of police force and the

safe homes another 2000 people have been
shifted into the imfal valley group
Captain UK devnath still with us on the
broadcast group Captain devnath what do
you make of what's happening in Manipur
obviously the situation is far from over
and the situation situation is far away
from dense
uh very very unfortunate uh incidents or
accidents or um whatever is happening is
to be condemned by all civilized people
of India India is a democratic country
and every uh minority or major every
Group which feels that it has been sign
line sideline there is a way of
progressing the gravians
um Manipur uh in fact all the Seven
Sisters in Northeast have got a very
peculiar difficulty problem uh the the
population everywhere is always a mix of
tribal people and people who are living
close to the capital close to The
Valleys which are relatively fertile
what happens that tribal peoples
invariably live in remote areas in
jungles and Hills they feel deprived
they feel that they are not getting any
jobs they feel that they are not getting
any amenities in this incidence what
happened that one particular uh a group
of people maybe who are the dominant
people in Manipur uh they consumed
almost 60 to 70 percent of population of
uh Manipur especially in area around
um
the area in the valley portion which is
uh where people are a little more Rich a
little more capable a little more
learned a little more ahead of tribal
people tribal people feel that these uh
people who are staying next to the I
will not take the name of the tribe they
feel that these people who are staying
in the Valley area in the fertile area
are taking away their rights
opportunities jobs and their resources
uh plus what has happened after the
recent election majority of the uh mlas
in the State Assembly are from a
particular Community a particular party
now there is a strong feeling that this
particular party they are trying to
convert their uh tribe their group of
ethnic ethnic people from OBC to SG
people feel that the moment B is the
majority people if they are also given
status equal to St then the job
opportunities or whatever little bit um
uh facilities are given to uh tribals
the original tribals who are staying on
top of mountains and remote areas that
also will be snatched away in pinched or
gobbled Away by uh this majority people
uh both the communities they normally
live in harmony only thing is recently
due to certain local reasons uh the
animosity between both the groups have
increased it has to be said that
government of India especially
especially central government must take
immediate uh just hold on to their

extended the cancellation of all its
flights until May the 12th the airline
has filed a plea for voluntary
insolvency resolution proceedings before
the nclt which reserved its order on
Thursday the airline said in a tweet
that it would issue a full refund to the
original mode of payment for the
canceled flights it had initially
suspended flights for three days
starting from the 3rd of May but later
extended the suspension till the 9th of
May and now the 12th of May
Aviation expert and Mr Whipple saxena is
joining us on the broadcast to talk more
about this Mr saxena a very good morning
to you well it seems that what started
out as a brief Hiatus for go first is
turning out to be a longer one
yeah
you're right it seems to be a a longer
one
and I don't think
the recovery is going to be too too
early too quickly it will take long time
because ultimately wake up cannot fly
without the engine my engine is not
there
how does one think of you know executing
Flight Plan
so I think considering that it's not
going to be so easy
to resume the full operations
they've got of other engines or other
manufacturers that will decide what size
of operation they can do it whether
that's the financially viable for the
company or not however they will be able
to meet the passenger requirement and
this is vehicle requirements or not so
there are there are so many questions
which we're going to raise now uh before
something really happens
Mr saxena you know there's always uh
been this claim by go first that it's
because of the engine delivery uh
inadequacies that they've landed into
this trouble and later on you know
Lufthansa has blamed rat and Whitney for
uh you know grounding a few aircrafts
how much would you attribute that
problem to this uh emergency if we can
call it for go first
I I fully agree with the the stand taken
by goair what the reason they have given
only thing is that
this battle probably they did not think
that it go go along for about two years
they've uh you know had this battle with
me uh in the court and despite uh what I
am aware of this uh sport has gone in
favor of uh go air and there are other
red lines to supply the engine but I
think Britain with me as a manufacturer
is not in a position to supply those
number of engines as such as what notice

of yes kamry which is the whale's
largest Independence Movement yes kamri
is a movement dedicated to the goal of
an independent whales when uh it would
be interesting to understand from you
the perspective
on the eve of the coronation of King
Charles and how do you see the tradition
of the stone of scone or the stone of
Destiny being brought into Westminster
Abbey every single time there's a
coronation to express takes place what
does it signify what does it symbolize
well I mean that that's just a symbol of
English dominance isn't it it's amongst
many many other things uh what's really
interesting listening to both your
previous contributors is
but even even within all of this there's
an inevitability isn't there
um well I also have to correct you you
mentioned the Union flag Wales is not
represented in the Union flag and never
has been and that's you know that's
indicative of the subservient way in
which England and the union perceives
Wales uh but in terms of inevitability I
mean if we look at the monarchy the the
English Monarch is recognized in fewer
and fewer countries progressively
um I think Jamaica at the moment are
considering whether they're going to
become a republic
um and that's been the trend for 100
years for 100 years people have been
ditching the monarchy so
um it's clear that that will continue
and Independence is is also a trend that
will continue and there's an
inevitability to Scottish and Welsh
Independence and there's an
inevitability to Irish unification the
question is when will these things
happen uh and how will will these things
happen here in Wales support for
Independence has gone from uh only five
percent nine years ago to over 30
percent today so that's a six-fold
increase in nine years
um I I would argue to my Scottish
friends here that they would do well to
really support Welsh Independence now
because we haven't had our first
referendum and that precedent has been
set and if Wales leaves the United
Kingdom the United Kingdom is done that
is it it's all over okay
um why why has it taken so far so long
for the people of Wales or the people of
Scotland or Ireland Northern Ireland to
be able to stand up through their
decision that they do not want to be
part of United Kingdom they not do not
want to be subservient to United Kingdom
and be their own Sovereign Nations
keeping in mind that you have been uh
being been ruled over by the United
Kingdom for a really long time perhaps
the longest that it has been ruled
across across the world any of the
colonies that have been ruled by the
United Kingdom
ah but that but that's exactly why isn't
it you you know Wales was wales's last
the last true Prince of Wales was killed
in 1282
um o England's rebellion was crushed in
the early 15th century
this is a long time
during that long time all of the levers
of power all of the establishment all of
the education all of the language or all
all that you're being taught
given to you by a dominant power and
you're being told relentlessly the
status quo is the way it should be and
it takes quite a long time for people to
understand that there are better and
newer and different ways of doing things
but what's really interesting about
where we are now you know we're at the
start of the 21st century or at the end
of the Industrial Age and the start of
the digital age much is in flux globally
internationally we can have this program
I can be on a video on a video call with
you the other side of the world talking
about this I couldn't have done that
just 25 years ago yes and that's game
changing and and the thing is I don't
think the United Kingdom government I
don't think the United Kingdom
establishment I don't think the monarchy
I don't think any of these things in the
UK have caught up with that and they've
been left behind you know it it it's the
end of Empire and they just haven't got
it you know the penny hasn't dropped so
we have to lead that process and we we
have to be those voices and just as
Lorna said it has to be a grounds
a ground Grassroots Groundswell
yeah thinking that conversation having
that conversation because we have no
media voices because the media is in the
hands of the establishment and supports
the establishment
um and and if I can go back to something
you said earlier you know in terms of
getting international support broad
international support for this yes
absolutely you know all nations that are
already independent and uh are already
free if it's
small nation like Iceland with 350 000
or a massive place like India with 1.4
billion yes absolutely come and land
your voice and insist that we are given
our independence and self-determination
I'm also interested in knowing what the
attitude of the people living in Wales
are living in Scotland or Northern
Ireland is when uh this huge display of
pageantry absence happens during the
coronation of of the king
I mean what is the sentiment that people
have I I mean is is it a sentiment of
everybody wanting to go to the nearest
pubs grab a beer and watch it on a large
scale are you celebrating it or does it
also then signify a moment when this is
uh slavery that has been uh brought
forth in Colony after Colony including
in Scotland or in Wales
so so I'm quite happy to say that Wales
has the lowest number of uh coronation
parties of any of the the Nations
um and I can also say that there isn't a
fantastic amount of enthusiasm but I
think what that speaks to is is not only
you know that inevitable decline of
monarchy and constitutional monarchy in
in the Modern Age you know there is
something that doesn't strike a chord in
in modern cultural sensibility when
you're talking about someone being born
with privilege and born with authority
you know it just just makes no sense
um and there is that and then the other
thing of course is they're spending 250
million pounds yes on a single day on a
circus for a day and I'm sure it's
similar in Scotland but here in Wales we
have 90 000 children in absolute poverty
you know not relative poverty absolute
poverty from 70 000 children were in
receipt of food bank food Parcels this
year in Wales and yet you're spending
quarter of a billion pounds on Pomp and
Foolery it doesn't sit well and it
doesn't sit right
ah
when also the current circumstances uh
in which United Kingdoms find itself
when it comes to brexit which has caused
a lot of upheaval when it comes to the
kovid and the aftermath that it has to
Bear when it comes to uh economic crisis
that the United Kingdom at this point is
facing does do these do these matters do
these points also help in putting out
the cause of the Welsh people to get
their independence from United Kingdom
and faster so because UK at this time of
this time
finds itself to be surrounded with a lot
of problems a lot of issues
yeah all of this speaks to the Decay and
decline of the United Kingdom as a state
you know 100 years ago the United
Kingdom the British Empire were a global
superpower and uh today it is of no
consequence whatsoever and is rapidly
becoming a declining state in terms of
wealth in terms of capacity and
certainly in terms of the quality of
leadership and all of that is is evident
to go back to something else that I I I
think
um Lorna mentioned
yeah as the Santa declines
the United Kingdom becomes poorer
that that pillaging that has always been
a part of Empire that taking from the
periphery is going to continue and if
anything accelerates so that they can
preserve the wealth of the center
and uh the green energy one is really
interesting and water both of those
again are things that
um the UK government centrally not only
takes from Scotland but um is taking
from Wales as we speak there's something
called the crown Estates in Wales it's
not devolved in Wales it's generating
hundreds of millions of pounds a year
for the treasury the UK treasury none of
the money comes to Wales at the moment
within five to ten Years it'll be
generating billions of pounds a year in
Wales with Welsh resources and none of
that will be coming to Wales it'll be
going to the UK Treasury and in a
to
you have to empathize or understand the
position from Westminster you you know
that that money for them is useful for
them to spend as they like but from a
Welsh perspective it is ours it should
be ours yeah and we should be
independent and we should be allowed to
spend it in whatever way we saw fit in
our own terms and and according to our
own priorities so all of those things
feed into a stronger and constantly
strengthening case for Independence for
all the parts of the United Kingdom and
a weakening of any justification or any
strong Arguments for the preservation of
the United Kingdom and it is incredibly
hard to find the unionist with a strong
argument I have to say
it's also surprising uh to know that it
has taken this long for more and more
people to vote in large percentages for
their independence in you spoke about
how from nine percent to 30 that's a
staggering threefold increase but why
has it taken so long for years and years
perhaps even decades for you to be able
to realize it and increase you know

W5RGQNus4j4,How &#39;Fake Activism&#39; Damaged India | India Needs Renewed Activism? | NewsX,"How 'Fake Activism' Damaged India | India Needs Renewed Activism? | NewsX To Subscribe our YouTube channel ""NewsX"" click ...",2023-05-05T13:23:25Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W5RGQNus4j4/hqdefault.jpg,"fake activists in our country and
internationally cause detrimental issues
to the economic development and the
stability of the country from the
anti-nuclear strikes in Tamil Nadu from
2011 to the tutikorian violence in 2018
from the opposition of the
environmentalists on widening the
chardham roads to stabilize the line of
actual control
deployment of our soldiers and resources
to spreading fake news about vaccination
these fake activists need to be named
and shamed and those vested interests
funding that comes from to spread this
propaganda against a particular country
and in this specific context against
India need to be brought out and their
affiliations and their associations with
who these industrialists or who these
funders are which are these political
parties who are these ngos they all need
to be be brought and condemned and
exposed let's start off this discussion
rishabh this is a very interesting
article written by a Congress ideologue
that has seen punawala and he's given
certain of these examples and we are
going to add more and more of them
because these examples are not contained
within the domestic periphery of our
country but also the international
backlash that comes against our country
whether it is about Kashmir the
kalistanis so on and so forth and there
are these agendas that are then
entrenched to ensure that there's harm
that is put against our country okay let
me just sort of encapsulate this we all
know who the scene is I mean I've of
course known him for years he's been a
political commentator for a long period
of time and he he sits on this channel
many other channels he's a familiar face
uh this is about what the issue is okay
and we find it very difficult in this
country to address the issue there are
certain Basics now we need to
fundamentally understand
I'll give you a very simple example
which is you mentioned and it's
mentioned on your screen as well
now there are protests going on in Tamil
Nadu against a company called sterlite
there are people saying that this copper
plant is
leading to discharge which is polluting
the atmosphere polluting the environment
polluting the water bodies
a campaign starts against her light
the cops show up
and for whatever intents and purposes
and lack of application of mind and and
protocol an incident takes place they
start firing people die
families
get destroyed lives get lost
and for the next several years
40 percent of India's copper production
capacity disappears we go from being a
copper exporter to a copper importer
damage takes place to those people
and to the Indian economy you mentioned
this
petition filed in the courts now listen
you can't expand and build these border
roads because it will do damage to the
environment uttarakhand what will happen
if the Chinese occupy those Heights what
respect for the environment will the
Chinese be showing
it becomes almost ludicrous
sometimes and I think and I'm sure
you'll be speaking with essene very
shortly and he will explain what he was
writing about
but we now need to understand
the difference between
those people who are out there having
conversations who want to have
conversation and should have
conversation on what is going wrong what
do we need to do to solve it so yes
should a copper manufacturing plant be
more responsible about its chemical
outlays yes should a major corporation
be more in tune with corporate
governance and with The Regulators yes
should we be taker greater care in our
defense deals but should we then not buy
the defile aircraft at all
this is where we lose the plot I'll give
you a small example before you move on
Mega you know I've been an activist okay
I have been I was associated with the
the ncpcri which was the national
campaign for the people's right to
information that fought for the right to
information law
uh I was campaigning against uh
now in famous but long time political
leader who as hrd Minister decided that
he's going to change the quota regime in
this country what are the lessons I
learned
write to information on paper is such a
sound thing but when it was implemented
most of the cases became about
government officers settling scores
against other government offices or
trying to deny each other promotions it
became a right mess we need in this
country to have a better conversation on
transparency and this concept of the
right to information which now is almost
defunct but we need to be able to engage
in this conversation knowing full well
what went wrong similarly
quotas are important imagine
in a country where a particular group of
people have been oppressed not for a few
Dozen Years for hundreds of years it
will take time so there is a role that
quota serve in our society that's an
important role but the solution is not
that we take 100 seats in University and
divide them up further the solution is
200 seats so when we were mapping Lati
charge and water cannon when I was
younger before I became a journalist so
what was the what was the end goal the
end goal was in central universities 50
seats were increased
that was worth fighting for more seats
available the infrastructure is now
caught up today we have more iits more
ions more aims so this conceptualization
of what is activism and I'll make this
make this call a foreign research firm
comes and says listen what the heck
here is an Indian company that is
everything is wrong with it
no proof but we say it's everything
wrong with it we have a profit motive in
saying so but within India people will
believe it will buy into it in fact they
will turn this into their main political
campaign as opposition so opposition for
the sake of opposition
but we also in this country have to
recognize that we celebrate Bill Gates
who incidentally also runs an NGO that
funds a lot of activities in India we
celebrate Elon Musk we also celebrate
jamshedji Tata you needed big
conglomerates big companies that go and
buy the ports outside India they buy the
companies that are going to build the
next generation of batteries they buy
the companies that are going to build 6G
they buy the companies that are going to
bring in Quantum Computing there are
going to be strategic assets that
they'll have to build which are worth
tens of thousands of crores exactly how
Jam shadeji Tata built jamshedpur and
made the largest steel founder in Asia
at that point of time when the British
told us if you Indians can make steel we
will eat it you needed this to happen as
well so in this concept of activism for
the sake of activism whether it is
funded or motivated we don't know from
where the ability to distinguish between
real conversations which we need to have
and how to have them we have to have
some introspection and I think this is
what roughly the scene was alluding to
Mega yeah let's also get in the scene on
The Telecast methazine uh that's a very
insightful article that you've written
on an opinion piece of fake activism
you've gone about giving examples
whether it was about the nuclear plant
by back in 2018 2011 we're talking about
the the steel plant that was obviously
uh back about in the the copper plant
that was into ticorin and also if I can
give some recent examples uh rishabh
mentioned about this adaniku that was
initiated by Hindenburg we talk about
how there is this entire clamor
internationally how Kashmir is not a
place to fit to be living there are
these human rights violations there are
these issues that have to be resolved uh
do they don't they all come into one
pile of this fake activism that is being
driven against India to make it less
economically stable
so you're right Nina thank you so much
for having me on the show and thank you
that you guys did appreciate my article
there are two very pertinent points
number one as Richard writing said we
must must fight for human rights I mean
India is known for human rights India is
known for her democracy her bad news so
those are things we need to stand up for
but there is a vested interest no doubt
in my mind in our neighborhood to not
see India succeed all you have to look
is a Western and your eastern border you
have China and Pakistan and both of
these countries would have a vested
interest in seeing India fail and across
the world today India is the fifth
largest economy in the world it is on
track to be the third largest economy in
the world nobody can stop that but our
aim isn't to be the third largest or
second largest economy in the world our
English to increase the per capita
income of our citizens that's when we'll
be truly a powerful country and how will
that happen that can only happen with
development and growth money does not
grow on trees so unless you don't create
more uh Industries how will you create
more jobs
so ultimately there will always be a
conflict between a between creating jobs
and protecting for example in this case
the environment and we've got to put a
balance I'm not saying you've got to
ignoring environment the parents of that
are far too great but unless we don't
create a safe environment for our
industry to grow how else will we employ
our young we're the youngest country in
the world or amongst the youngest
country we need to reap the demographic
dividend it shouldn't become a
demographic disaster for us so I think
that is very important to see
okay uh you know I'm going to also get
uh
okay okay again uh taking on to the
point that you've spoken about how
industry needs to be uh given the
impetus it needs to be encouraged to
create these jobs but uh going on a
different tangent here with more of
these specific examples and if you could
elaborate on them and that how they
become these propaganda for these ngos
of these environmentalists of these
activists who call themselves as the
harbingers who call themselves
themselves as the people or who the
Crusaders of everything right is
everything righteousness but at the end
of the day they are being lobbied they
are being paid they are being funded by
these bunch of they may be politicians
they may be industrialists they may be
entrepreneurs because they have vested
interests so that India does not grow
I'm giving examples particularly when it
came to the toolkits that had been
created whether it is about the
kalistanis whether it is about
uh the adani toolkit was that it was
created the farmer toolkits and then
very recently you know the Free Press
index and when you put in Pakistan ahead
of India in Free Press index well it
goes about me questioning what is the
basis on which this Free Press index is
being quit and then the NGO and the
activists that are behind building this
Free Press index what are their
intentions towards my country testing
no no I completely agree with you in
fact I tweeted that yesterday I'm
politically opposed to the present Union
government very a postal but
are you joking that you tell me that
India's India's press is uh less freed
in Pakistan and Afghanistan I mean
that's ridiculous and again in this
particular index they didn't even look
at the regional media Regional media in
India vernacular media is so strong and
powerful digital media in India are so
powerful so you may have a case perhaps
a little bit of national media which I
do believe does tend to have favored a
union government but media by and large
in India is free and fair it's not under
pressure like Pakistan or Afghanistan
where you could lose your life right and
digital media in India is extremely fair
I mean if you look at just digital media
India is thriving in digital media but
let me come to a larger issue which
because we're discussing industry look
growth will only come from industry
these left loonies and I call them left
loonies are the curse to our country
they don't want development they will
not allow development to happen we must
respect entrepreneurs entrepreneurship
is what will take India even I'm saying
in the case of say
I understand there are certain
allegations on Mr adani but overall he's
created jobs so all of these people are
job creators we have to we have to I am
against crony capitalism as Joe Biden
said crony capitalism will lead to
extortion that shouldn't happen but job
creators must be respected and
celebrated with billas the kiloskas the
garvaris
we have to celebrate job creation unless
we don't create jobs how will our future
survive please understand as we grow
into web 3.0 as AI comes into being we
are not having this conversation as a
country we're not having a serious
conversation as we get into blockchain
jobs are gonna people are going to lose
jobs I was just in a restaurant before I
came to your uh before I came to your
wonderful show and I was telling
somebody and this is the restaurant I
was involved with till the next five
years I will not have and we have just
one manager because Robert robots will
take over so where will the next
generation of jobs come we have to
encourage industrialization
manufacturing that's where jobs will
come specialization AI technology people
who are investing in that we will have
to encourage it so unless and until we
don't do that we don't have serious
conversation just abusing people because
they are businessmen that is not the
solution if somebody's done wrong the
law of the country must Supply there
must be an investigation look at them
but don't abuse people don't call them
memes I am not in favor of that okay we
have to celebrate how do we stop this
agenda because I'm giving particularly
example of Hindenburg and with the kind
of report it came out against the stocks
fell and and and our politicians also
pick this up uh unwittingly how do we
end a certain example about the farmer's
toolkit that was spread you know the
likes of Rihanna's and Greta thonburgs
came about uh bad naming India and so on
and so forth about the human rights of
the farmers uh how how do we ensure that
these International media houses or
activists or uh you know ngos go about
uh talking ill things about India and
then locally over a year nationally in
our country these issues are picked up
simply because it would help polarize
people it would help gain brownie points
for political parties without actually
in even investigating into the matter
that who this NGO is who this activist
is who is being funded by this this
organization who are the people who are
wanting effects to roll out whether
against an adani whether it against
against India whether it against about
about the 370 abrogation and so on and
so forth
not a very good question a fabulous
question let's let's just let's just uh
look at the farmer's protest for one
because you mentioned it now here I'm
going to blame the union government
despite me being anti-depth this farmers
uh these laws these three laws that they
passed in Parliament who asked them to
pass it through the voice Court in rajya
Sabha they could have allowed for
division of vote when they did that
people were obviously upset when people
were upset people came on the field
that's a democratic right to protest
India as a democracy you stopped then
you didn't allow them to come to Delhi
all right then you had your MPS going
about abusing them calling them
kalistanis calling them until the
honorable defense minister to step in
and ask all BJP to stop it then there
was a protest you believe that these
laws were good for India so why did you
withdraw it I'm even going to ask a
question barring my head before The
Honorable Supreme Court whether these
laws are good or bad Supreme Court's
Duty was not to get into it they could
have stuck it down seeing its Ultra wise
of the Constitution or they could have
said look it's good if you want to
protest you put it Supreme Court put the
laws on hell but due respect to the
Supreme Court before his majesty all of
us buy who's uh who asked this how how
can the Supreme Court stay along you can
strike it down it has the power or you
can say no the law is perfect with the
Constitution God protests how does the
Supreme Court steer law what is their
law temporary there's no provision in
Constitution so everyone just does their
own thing anything the government wants
to be honorable Supreme Court to get a
chip from the NYU and government quick
to Supreme Court or any courts can't be
run in this country so we have so many
issues that are entangled not a 97 year
old or 90 year old George Soros believe
me and I'm a guy who understands
business I'm right of the center
economically who was George saw this 99
of the people didn't know three Union
ministers are coming and giving up press
conference against them why do you want
to give somebody who's 90 year old
importance okay he's tweeted something
why do you want to give him importance
you give him importance then you get
upset even in that uh BBC documentary
you know when a documentary came out and
it came on a lot of WhatsApp chats most
people who are against the government
who are friends because I am against the
government again putting that out we
said yeah Supreme Court has given that
but the government came with a heavy and
tried to ban it but you've tried to ban
it in Supreme Court instead we've not
banned it in Supreme Court you say is
not bad so what I'm saying is this
government doesn't know know how to deal
with people or how to deal with issues
there is a fundamental problem there
that's one second thing just quickly in
we may have any political opposition
between each other but that's
outside world will be jealous of India's
success they were jealous during the
nuclear deal also see the one to three
agreement the nuclear deal India got an
exception from the NSG now I'm talking
about a then opposition and present
government they got cash inside
Parliament they tried to stall the deal
with the left Goonies the BJP so in
National interest progress in BJP should
come together that's my advice okay
certain things should be national
interests both parties should not divide
on that now it was just 10 seconds walk
I'll just go back to the nuclear deal
phenomenal deal for India George Bush
got us a great deal and what were you
doing getting cash inside Parliament
going with the left party saying no no
we're not allowed to immediately today
we realize it's importance today the
opposition is doing this okay
yes you you mark them in your in your
opinion pieces well I'm going to quickly
get in Savio Rodriguez on The Telecast
with me so uh you've heard they've seen
uh there is at this point in time a neat
and immediate one is that to do away
with fake activism how do we do away
with it
in India
but not every activism is is fake
activism so let me give you an example
to one of the activisms in Bombay that I
was involved in as as an advisor how to
get out of the problem
when we did the kind of research in the
study that we did we realized that
almost 80 percent of the people who
raised the objection towards
environmental damage were genuine people
who cared about the advice
but the government at that point of time
was not to adapt enough to
how important it was
for the environment and what were the
what were the standards that the that
the government employed to ensure that
the environmental degradation did happen
as was projected by certain section of
the activism but 20 of those activists
that were there were actually vested
interest activists that wanted to deal
with the project and the project did
remain derailed until the change of the
government happened so you will have
this activism happening in most parts of
India and the reason they do that is
because when there is sustainable
development happening when there's this
industry when there is business that is
growing that is when people are having
an economic advantage and economic
advantages brings in a certain amount of
stability in people's homes in people's
lives that they don't have time for
other such uh now trunkies as I would
call it which involves in getting down
on the road and having getting into
activism I come from a state of War
where every single project at any point
of time reaches some point of activity
Hospitality projects which are good
Hospitality projects to reach uh reach
into court and get delayed for three
years of time because certain sections
of the society don't agree with it
not every project is an environmental
degradation because if every project is
an environmental degradation then you
should be all living in huts and not be
living inside our homes so when when
there was activism against the project
in in Maharashtra
the people who raised the activism were
certain sections of Bollywood okay and
these are the same people who roam
around in in their fancy cars and and uh
you know use a lot of the fuel instead
of driving around in the cycle so I in
fact told somebody I said you know it's
very interesting that you raise such an
issue why don't you travel around in the
Bullock and that would help the
environment much more right or live in a
heart if that's where we all lived in
before so you have to have a balance
agree not everybody who's making an
issue on the environment is wrong
because governments in certain parts of
this country have gone overboard as far
as environmental uh
degradation is concerned there are many
trees that are being chopped that
okay I'm going to I'm going to have to
quickly uh interrupt you sorry we are
not able to hear you we'll try to fix
that audio connection with you but also
quickly getting in Dr p s v r octopus
what's your opinion and obviously how do
we make the people more aware that what
are the antecedents of these individuals
or the organizations or the activists or
the ngos from where this is
misinformation or misguided information
is coming from so that people are aware
of what is happening and then they can
make a judgment on their own that will
allow them to know what is the truth and
not fall prey to these narratives that
are gonna that go about being built
whether it is BBC whether it is about
the toolkits that were created whether
it is domestic activism that takes place
in the name of activism fake activism
that takes place
thank you for having me on this
discussion uh Mega then you can't find
an enemy face on you fight by Gorilla
tactics so this fake
activities are a way of gorilla bosphere
you take Polio I see we have managed to
eradicate smallpox from the world but
why have we not been able to eliminate
polio because in Pakistan there was a
fake news that the polio vaccine will
cause infertility and this is the reason
why polio still persists in Pakistan and
Afghanistan and there is this risk of
polio spreading to the rest of the world
we saw during covert times the the
amount of anti-vaccine and even to this
date there's a lot of anti-vaccine
um activism going on yeah and already
various other developmental projects
which were blocked have been already
discussed by the my fellow panelists and
you take environment way back in 1975 I
ran a big tree Plantation uh program and
this was before the government of India
started it and I did it over karapland
but I see many development projects
being objected just because trees are to
be felt yes we need development we need
people to progress new plant trees
elsewhere and you would reduce the
amount of fossil fuel and the amount of
trees being cut for paper that is that
you can do without blocking development
okay this all leads to problems for
economically health is wealth but you
are attacking both health and wealth
okay thank you okay uh quickly now uh
particularly about the economic impact
due to these misinformation narratives
that are played uh the very example we
again mentioned about the adani toolkit
by way of the Hindenburg report it was a
propaganda that had been created to
bring the adani stocks down which it did
for a certain period of time but because
of the Natural Market forces they again
climbed up uh how detrimental does it
become for the Indian domestic Market to
regain from the debacle that is faces
because of these kind of hijabs uh how
can we refrain from doing so or
believing things that come up in the in
the in in the international media
can be severe they could be from mild to
very very severe I mean if you refer to
the the Hindenburg case you know you
know the parliament was stalled for so
many uh for so many days I mean no
business could happen in the parliament
the economic cost I mean it can I mean
no bills were passed such important
issues of the country did not happen
because because the parliament was
taught so I think the I think the focus
need to be on how to refrain as you
rightly said there are two kinds of
actualism Omega one is the you know the
physical activism where you know you do
a dharna pradasan or you set up your
tense there and you know something we
are witnessing at Jantar Mantra or you
know a physical demonstration what is
the virtual one like the Hindenburg you
know what happened digitally and on a
report was released digitally and we
reacted I think the country needs to
enact a law that wherever there is an
activism which is detrimental to the
interest or which is in favor of
protecting the people at large I think
that is acceptable let's say for for
example corruption for example any
malpractices which are going on that is
acceptable but otherwise every activism
should be put on the scrutiny there
should be a government committee form
which it should include Supreme Court
judges when every time there is an
activism related uh noise that you hear
the committee should immediately sit
down without any delay before you know
it gets deep into the whole system it
should immediately set up and declare
that activism Act of activism legal or
illegal okay this is declared as
illegitimate I think action should be
taken and it should be nipped in the bud
as they say in English if it is allowed
to go on you gather it gathers momentum
a lot of public opinion is formed and
then come The Economic Consequences Mega
yeah so the best way is have a committee
the very next day the committee sits
down take such decision this is
legitimate or illegitimate if it is a
legitimate just nip it in the body it
should be closed there and then that's
the only solution okay okay obvious
money I'm going to get a response from
you as well before I wrap this
discussion up uh how do we then contain
these narratives fake narratives that
are built by way of these activists and
ngos offer that matter certain companies
or agencies when there are international
media houses that are also supporting
the cause of uh bring bringing a bad
name came to India particularly
specifically or to any country I talk
about again I give the example of of the
Hindenburg reporter nathania for that
matter the BBC propaganda that peace
that came against prime minister
Narendra Modi over the rights uh how
when when International media is
hell-bent on showing you and your
country in a bad light and taking on
these answers and responses and reports
and putting them in their media media
pieces or Internet on the internet on
television screens etc etc how do we how
do we ensure this does not get spread
like wildfire
very important point on the nuclear deal
of 2008. see the opposition
and the and they are the treasury were
at Crossroads even at that time and when
the boot was on the other leg they had
changed it so this type of adversarial
political climate between the opposition
and the and the treasury should change
the idea is not to embrace India these
type of mischievous reports are coming
because there are takers
so this type of that
only enables the foreign other element
to our activist groups and others to
come out these type of activism disabled
report say Farmers protest yes indeed
there was a vacuum communication back
home the government of India did not
take the take the communication route to
the last least common denominator but
that vacuum was filled in by mischievous
communication processor adversarial
processes and there's a lot of
miscommunication was bred into the
entire law the stakeholders at the
lowest level and that is really the
entire form of issue snowball they it
was never told them that it is for your
own benefit okay it was said that
issues yeah
that should change both all the parties
are equally responsible for this and
that is the reason whether it is
Hindenburg whether it is whether it is
and a lot of NGO funding thousand crores
came to for NGO funding in 2000 for this
this type of organization like green
peas and other in 2017-18 fcrf funds

Manipur has been brought under control
through coordinated actions by all
stakeholders the iaf has undertaken
continuous sorties from two airfields in
Assam and deploying three deploying c17
Globe master and an-32 aircraft
induction commenced on the night of 4th
of May that was yesterday and additional
columns commenced domination with effect
from the V hours of fifth May
domination and evacuation of civilians
of all communities from the affected
areas has continued throughout the night
flag March in
and other sensitive areas of Manipur are
underway still
well Manipur has been facing these
violence in arson for the past few days
there has been in fact internet
suspended in several districts of
Manipur the trains have been halted that
are entering into Manipur are getting
out of Manipur there have been strong
actions that have been taken by the
government of Manipur by Chief Minister
bhiran Singh there have also been
discussions that are being held by the
Union home minister amitsha and the
chief minister Biden Singh now this all
started out with the high court
recommendation to the government of
Manipur to include the mighty Community
from Manipur to be part of the scheduled
tribe
I'm going to start off this conversation
over the very complex matter that
Manipur at this point of time is facing
but it is causing a lot of distress to
the government of Manipur because the
people the Innocents are being hurt
there has been awesome there has been to
test their petrol pumps that are being
burnt internet completely suspended
there is the capf the army that have
been deployed in the area to ensure that
is calm and peace and there have been
these stray incidents of violence that
have also been reported
yeah yes Mega is very unfortunate that
even in the Northeast the flare-up is
taking place but this aspect of flare-up
in the Northeast is pretty old and this
problem also of methay and other tribal
uh confrontation is also old the it is a
social economic problem basically but it
is now spilling over and it is getting
Amalgamated with the border security
problem because the other forces from
outside whether it is a threat Chinese
friendly manamari's forces which are
going infiltrating along with the help
of Chinese and the Chinese are funding
the entire operation they are selling in
arms so this aspect is absolutely clear
that somebody is taking advantage of the
fire which is going on in the country
but the question is this aspect which is
there between the tribes and midday this
is a very old problem which has to be
sorted out it was a very firm
Administration negative end this is a
social problem which has to be done
because the price because the resources
are limited and the tribals don't want
it to share it with mithai that is the
main thing because of the whole thing is
and other elements are taking advantage
of it this the forces with the
parability forces and security forces
sometimes have not been proved up to the
mark in fact the state forces have
fought with each other they had gun
battles out there so all this aspect
thrown in together it requires the
earlier days control which that we had
of the central forces air is a must
because the monomery's border is alive
the rohingya problem has not died down
the Chinese problem that con and
arunachal Chinese are getting very
active they will spill over in this area
so we have to be very careful this is
not just a small problem of Manipur this
is a very large problem whereas at the
moment the Anvil the the screen is small
for us so we only have only seeing a
small portion of it this is a serious
problem I personally feel that home
minister probably is going to take great
amount of Interest out here as you can
see from the stages of programs okay all
right
now uh
it's an in okay I'm getting to know that
I am also being joined by Vijay Sharma
Vijay uh give me details at this point
of Time how has the situation continued
in Manipur is there is there now peace
being disturbed there were these random
acts of vandalism and violence in arson

there and are shooting at a school in
Northwestern Pakistan on Thursday and
apparent retaliation to an early attack
in which another teacher was short dead
it said the motive behind the killings
remained unclear and that the teachers
killed in both incidents belonged to the
country's Shiite Muslim minority the
tribal District contains a majority
Shiite population were often attacked by
Sunni militant groups as part of the
local Taliban movement local police say
they were gathering more information and
investigating the incident
disturbing news coming in once again
from Pakistan
you know such incidents have become very
regular and almost one major incident a
week is happening since 31st December
last year when tarike Taliban Pakistan
declared its rule over khyberpunk well
this is all the results of the seeds
which was shown by Pakistan for
themselves were when they tried to
become the epicent of terrorism where
they try to launch a proxy award on
India through terrorism it is these
snakes which are bite in Pakistan until
nonetheless Pakistan cannot change its
faulty policies and fundamentals these
attacks will continue and uh and the
time is not far when khyberpak tuna will
declare itself totally independent from
Pakistan Pakistan as it is on the is on
the verge of an inclusion where it can
break into four smaller Nations
yes do you also believe Colonel sorry
that this is uh you know this is the
handiwork of the Taliban uh do you
believe there is a uh and you know there
is an angle that these teachers were
from the Shiite community
yes definitely because Taliban has been
always anti-shiites and they have uh
left no opportunity to humiliate them or
to kill them and this is definitely the
handwork of tarika Taliban Pakistan
though till now they're not actually
come out with a statement but I'm I'm
sure they will come up with a statement
very soon because
you know major terrorist attacks in the
last about four or five months after
Taliban Pakistan declared His official
rule over uh uh you know so definitely
it is
Taliban Pakistan and as they are
draining uh gaining more ground in

behind the attack with America
um straight away refuses yes America is
in a position to refuse whether America
is involved or not that the
investigation will tell but at the
moment from the face of America is in a

6ivoyLjBxRc,P&amp;W Behind The Go-Air Crisis | Who Will Blame Pratt &amp; Whitney?,The collapse of India's third-largest airline will majorly impact its thousands of employees and passengers. Due to the airline's ...,2023-05-03T14:25:58Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6ivoyLjBxRc/hqdefault.jpg,"now there has been a massive crisis in
the domestic airline industry of our
country vadya owned go first has
declared bankruptcy and this has led to
the passengers who had booked their
flights about 90 000 of them and the
question of how is go first going to
accommodate them all there has been a
show cause notice that has been given by
the dgca
demanding the go first Airlines and its
management to give a detailed response
as to how it is going to accommodate all
these passengers who have faced problems
because of their because of the fact
that they have bought in stranded
because of the fact that they had to
miss the flights and from May 3rd up
until May 5th for three days there are
going to be no go first flights that are
going to fly this has also caused a lot
of inconvenience particularly to the
staff members now amidst the insolvency
that has has been filed buy go first
there are the issues of where is it
going to be headed in terms of the staff
in terms of those who work for go first
when it comes to the ground operations
when it comes to the captains the flight
attendants all of them are facing
troubles this is the third Airline after
Jet and Kingfisher that has faced
insolvency so there we go talking about
the problems that the consumers the
problems that the staffers are facing in
the terms of the big question mark That
Remains as to how is the money going to
be returned to the consumers return to
the passengers and second of all how is
it that the staffers are going to look
for other jobs as their jobs at this
point of time are in Jeopardy there's
another big question with regards to the
U.S engine maker U.S engine manufacturer
by the name of Pratt and Whitney who has
gone about countering wadia's claim that
it was not able to provide the engines
in time well Pratt and Whitney has said
that they have not gotten funds from
go first airlines management to be able
to then provide these engines to them
which has also led to out of the 61 of
the fleet of kofors there are half of
them that have been stranded they have
not flown in months together if not
years because of the lack of engines
that had to be gotten from Pratt and
Whitney and they have not been gotten
therefore also a crunch of funds and
revenues that the warrior group of
companies facing with its company go
first I'm going to quickly bring your
focus to what Pratt and Whitney is all
about and let's take a look at present
Whitney what is history is so the parent
company is right in Technologies
its headquarters are in East Hartford
Connecticut its president is Shane Eddie
its Revenue has per 2017 is 16.60
billion dollars they are total employees
as of 2017 at 38 737 the global
customers as of 2017 are at 800 in 160
countries
okay I'm going to ask my team to put out
the another set of graphics with regards
to the discrepancies that have been
faced by Pratt and Whitley for not being
able to adhere to the orders in a bid to
then provide the engines and why is it
that they have not been able to provide
these aircraft engines to not just the
wadia won't go first but also to several
other airlines across the globe so
here's let's start off with the report
one this is Patton Whitney's Global
record that you are going to be talking
about and let's I'm going to quickly ask
yes the global record for Pratt and
Whitney and let's start off with report
number one that has come out
and this robot goes about telling that
about 90 percent of the airlines Fleet
of aircraft uses BMW engines it's Pratt
and Whitney engines about 24 of the
airlines 55 planes are grounded due to
the delays in engine Supply by Pratt and
Whitney so the go first may take legal
action against Pratt and Whitney over
engine issues uh that's the allegation
that has been made by Gophers the
warrior group of companies report number
two let's take a look at that this is a
report that is coming in from India from
uh the allegation that has been put
forth now Pratt and Whitney engine
problems cause worldwide groundings for
Airlines one of the manufacturers Pratt
and Whitney has been identified as a
source of the problem with its
pw1003 engine family causing the
majority of the issues so this is not
just in India but globally there has
been a lot of hype that has been created
a lot of news that pnw has created for
its paucity of engines that are then
being provided did as per the legal
documents that have been faced okay
report number three
air Senegal will be filing a lawsuit
against engine manufacturer Pratt and
Whitney for the financial losses due to
the
pw1524 G3 engines adding to the words
air Senegal and air Tanzania are
considering legal actions against the
subsidiary of the rare thin Technologies
so uh there you go it's not just India
but Senegal it's Tanzania it's air
Senegal air Earth in China they both
have also filed cases against Pratt and
Whitney uh report number four over 50
planes of indigo and go fast have been
grounded due to engine issues more than
50 planes of indigo and Gophers were
grounded due to a supply chain
disruption of jet engines facing Pratt
and Whitney engine related issues this
is
as per the news that has been reported
in Wake of the bankruptcy that has now
been declared by wadia and go first do
we have we have next okay there is
report number five as well failing F-35
fighter grounded once again this is the
report from April 2022 it's related to
the Pratt and Whitney it's it's actually
revealed that patent Whitney delivered
only six of the 153 52 of f-37 engines
on time in 2021 this is primarily due to
the quality issues that were required
resolution before the engines could be
accepted by the government so quality
issues have also been raised by a number
of these buyers of Pratt and Whitney
equipment pattern Whitney engines and
those are reports that have been filed
there's another report number seven it
says United Airlines is delaying the
return of Boeing 777 planes after dozens
were grounded last year due to an engine
failure and these engine failure has
happened on the Pratt and Whitney four
thousand engines that were provided to
the company they were grounded since the
incident in February last year this is
about United Airlines
all right uh so there we have it amidst
all these reports uh that have been
filed uh in various parts of the world
whether it is America Tanzania Senegal
and now in India in India there have
been several Airlines including go first
Indigo and a few others that have faced
engine issues from Pratt and Whitney and
complaints after complaints have been
filed I'm going to start off my
conversation here with uh
with my guests let's start off with
Captain SS Punisher he's uh he's a
former director of the flight safety
Indian Airlines he joins me and still
understanding from you amidst all these
references and proofs that we have been
able to take out after doing enough
research and finding out that Pratt and
Whitney has not just defaulted in
providing Air Force providing uh
aircraft engines to go first there have
been uh defaults that have been made
when it came to air Tanzania air Senegal
United Airlines in fact there were a lot
of complaints with regards to failure of
these aircraft engines provided by Pratt
and Whitney
you know one thing
Stater Brad and Whitney is the very
oldest company one of the famous company
and they are manufacturing agents for a
very very long time and their slogan is
Dependable angels
now there was a problem in the new
engine few years back
where the engine they've been feeling
due some turbine failure with the indigo
and go away
the moment the issue was taken up one
Advocate even filed the case in the high
court and I was also in a witness in the
bank support
came forward and they did a lot of
amendments and all that after that there
was no incident now there are two issues
one is
the bankruptcy I will talk a project
with the engine this is a agency which
is department they have inspectors and
all that why they are sitting quiet they
do audit every year of all the airline
they were silent about these angels they
never knew this problem but what action
they have taken what is the initiative
today the incompetent people from did
you say he writes a letter to Airline
why didn't you inform you become
bankrupt what your inspectors were doing
they are doing twice a audit of the
safety other thing and before you were
given a operator's license the ministry
of student civilization must have
satisfied they are the proper
infrastructure and money yes okay okay
I'm not negating that there were rules
and regulations that may have been
flouted by go first by the what a group
of companies but no no rules are not
voted by rules approached by the dtca
okay what audit they have been doing
with the angels divided they come
forward against the company
with regards to with regards to the
aircraft engines out of the 61 aircraft
that they have go first has half of them
are grounded because
they do not have the specific engines
that were to be provided from Pratt and
Whitney to them so now
Indigo had the same problem
but Indigo has a has a fleet of 310 so
and even if Indigo had half of its
aircraft Fleet on the ground grounded it
can still allow for 150 of these
150 of these airplanes functioning which
will which will then be able to figure
out and take the load of the passenger
air traffic that's that's that you know
you know it the volume it's it's again a
case of volume it's it's if you have
more more aircraft then it's a you're
still able to manage uh your Fleet
rotation even if half of them are
grounded when you have 60 of them if 30
of them are grounded obviously you won't
be able to cater to the flight air
traffic
please try to understand Indigo has
experts and all that they have
cooperated with the Planet Fitness they
are solve the problem you have to call
those people you have to spend money set
their engines first or call their
experts what goer has done it why there
are no more problems with the engine
we've taken various aspects of we've
taken the Grievances of the customers
you've taken the Grievances of the
passengers with regards to what is going
to be happening to to the staffers and
obviously question marks that are going
to be raised of the directory general of
the civil aviation but right now my
focus and I want to bring my focus of
the guests to this issue when Sharad I'm
going to start off with you uh
I I rattled off these seven reports of
various airlines not just in India but
across the globe that have faced issues
uh with procuring these aircraft engines
from Pratt and Whitney
if this has been happening since 2021
the last report I read was of what the
discrepancies were there were engine
failures of United Airlines and the
airlines had to be grounded in 2021 now
in such a situation why could there not
be any uh probes investigations that
could have been taken place
well megha I I won't uh defend Pratt and
Whitney at all for the revelations that
you've made and the research your team
has done I really appreciate the
research you've done but then you know
you know go first or other Ley lines
should have filed a suit in Connecticut
I mean you should you can you can drag
them to the court for either delivering
faulty engines or not delivering on time
you know Pratt and Whitney might have
its own story so there is an arbitration
Clause there it's for the arbitrator to
decide that who's correct who's not
correct but while I I reiterate the fact
that I'm not going to defend Pratt and
Britney I would also like to bring on
record the fact that you cannot hide
behind A non-delivery of engines only
there have been operational issues um
you know Mega as far as go first is
concerned there have been cost issues
they've been investment issues there
have been root issues there have been
number of aircraft issues there have
been connectivity issues there have been
so you cannot hide behind only practice
with me to to say that we are insolvent
because Pratt and Whitney did not
deliver on time I think will not be
totally fair with due respect to the
opinion given by the attorneys of of
gophers well obviously Pratt and Whitney
is responsible and I just as I said I
respect your Revelations and they should
be sued they have to be held accountable
they cannot get away with that if they
have been responsible for grounding so
many airlines around the world they have
been responsible for faulty engines they
should not be let off but having said
that I still I would I still feel there
are operational issues with Gophers so
there has to be an independent audit
conducted by the history of civil
aviation to find out what is the truth
how far is pnw responsible and how far
is gopher's own problems Gophers own
negligence go first own you know
carelessness about the operations
golfers lack of funds if you don't make
the payment on time for the engine you
cannot expect me like supplier to
probably deliver them on time yeah so I
would want a detailed investigation Mega
before giving a judgment as was only
fragmentally responsible for grounding
of the airline being I am very very
clear on that and I would I would hang
on to my scan okay okay uh Gotham My
Moment is also get you into the
conversation why is it that a human cry
was not created why was there not a
investigation in international
investigation initiated uh 2022 December
I remember there was a number of
factories that Catherine Whitney had to
shut down primary amongst them being the
Israeli Factory they were P 900 staffers
that had to be laid off all these
indications were there all these red
flags that were raised why was there not
a thorough investigation and why weren't
ah
those the buyers the likes of go first
the likes of air Senegal the likes of
air Tanzania and United Airlines were
already alerted about the very sorry
situation of uh of praten Whitney
well I think they were but the the real
issue is that this probably comes under
Force majority where reckon Whitney
claims uh it has various things
happening which are Beyond its control
and
um Indigo has tackled this by also
taking uh
one as you mentioned it has a far bigger
Fleet second it also takes engines from
CFM Air India has decided not to use
Bratton with me at all in this Mega new
order that they've made they're talking
of GE and Rolls-Royce engines
um so Pratt and Whitney has been
a
you know a delayer and a defaulter so
the roots are as follows either to keep
you know the airline business like the
hotel business is full of perishable
seats that you have to fill or and you
have to put your aircraft in the air or
you die on your feet I mean indigo is
over 7 000 crores in debt and uh number
of banks have been impacted of course
the employees and the passengers and so
on but they have also been in business
for 17 years they even did a a injection
of capital of 3000 crores only last year
so there is no reason to think that they
didn't want sincere some reports are
saying
that their Staffing is very lean and
they had a lot of churn at the top and
in each of the Departments there is no
backup because
they have very few people in reserve all
of this is part and parcel but
what can you do to practice with me
either you go into a lawsuit and the
lawsuit that will stick is not Senegal
uh it has to be done in the United
States that's an expensive business and
as a foreign Airline you have to go
there and prosecute or or attempt to
prosecute praten Whitney in the United
States what you do from here is not
going to yield results in any case it's
a long drawn process if it goes to trial
and so on and meanwhile the airlines die
depend on uh and if he supplier like
this and the Neo engine is the culprit
and it has affected in in some cases
there's been engine failure others they
are underperforming they don't have the
thrust so it's it's bgca has grounded
them rightly for passenger safety
requirements and it is really um you
know I I disagree with Mr Punisher that
it's mainly bgca's problem it is a
technical problem and a technical
problem has to be solved by the
manufacturer which have uh they have
shown no inclination to really do so or
to speed up supplies uh so they are
clearly the culprit but anybody goes
into the airline business and if he
can't keep his aircraft in the air uh
and and he can't fill his seats he
bleeds money at such a rate that it's
impossible to carry on having said that
let us understand that India is the
third largest Aviation market now and
growing and while three have failed uh
Akasha has recently joined there I
believe one or two more in the offing
thank you so then this is
that has to be resolved at at the
arbitration Court in Singapore and this
is between between Pratt and Whitney and
and and go first so uh and they don't
listen
um if I may Mega the arbitration court
right now said to practice with me
please deliver 17 engines
urgently to go first
and they just ignored them yeah
yeah so obviously those questions those
questions arriving Commander prafel
bakshi uh your response particularly now
now in this in this battle uh why have
questions why are questions not being
raised by these agencies by perhaps a
Hindenburg or some some International
Organization comes from impersonal
organization that is going to want uh
Airlines of this shoddy business that
are that is being done in in pratin with
me and then just be made made to be made
aware that listen if if you are if you
are doing business with Pratt and
Whitney then it is a risky Affair and
the hairs are forewarning for you
thank you Mega I remember having
discussed this problem before that also
let us let us be very clear on one issue
Aviation business has to be dead by
professionals it is not a matter of you
can learn from books sitting in the
college
the very very first thing let me again
repeat what I have repeated in our
channel the number of times when the
aviation business has to be run it has
to be run by a professional organization
even at the management level
which is running we're running
unprofessionally Henry it has been found
out a number of times and we have found
out because the people sitting out there
don't even understand they don't even
understand if somebody says uncontrolled
blade problem
when the turbo fan blade breaks out and
moves forward and breaks the airframe
they don't understand this but they will
talk in terms of them they don't have
the professionals to go and check up the
airlines properly
the airline have to be checked from for
the for inspections some price
inspections I am sorry our dgca don't
have those but that's all over Manpower
you can't put a Babu out there and think
that you've got you you you'll meet the
aviation task sorry you cannot do it and
secondly the airlines always cut short
they take shortcuts and they if they run
if they are
of the finances will the financial
experts will be there to find out why
why are they doing in the other
countries yes the problem was theirs in
Tanzania the problem was there in other
countries in every country it was there
there have been problems
bigger countries also with Pratt and
with me perhaps and Whitney problem
engine has been coming the new Airbus
new aircraft that also have a problem we
in India we grounded them the private
and Whitney problem has been there the
dgca should have gone and done a horror
study of the whole thing and all the
present with me and please listen
and it is the consumers it is the
passengers and the staffers that are
bearing the brunt of it that's right
that is what DJ said is responsible they
should have make the rules there oh and
force the airline that if you have not
running your airline properly you close
them where is a hurry I I still remember
whether to put the aircraft took place
the Alliance air yes in one hour the
minister comes and said the Pilot's
problem is there without even inspecting
the whole thing what happened to their
Airline the airline was grounded after
that so question is we have to be very
very careful when we talk in terms of
Aviation AV the big management jargons
yes they fit in classes only but when
you come on to the maintenance board and
talk away aircraft engine and aircraft
flying then the things have to be done
very professionally and let me tell you
one thing other aircrafts have been
maintained there are other
countries are there India has got other
aircraft also we are not they are not
having that problem why is it the
president is having so much of problem
there must be connection between the
problem and the management yes I don't
say only one side is wrong there is for
a lack of professionalism is there in
dgca is there in running away a
is there if
it's in it I have seen myself with my
own eyes where the airline owner small
Airline owner is forcing the pilot to
fly with a tire which is
has to be replaced and he wants four
Landings more out of it or five Landings
or out of it
obviously the aircraft landed up with a
tire burst after that this has happened
I was I was in flight safety I know very
well how the shortcuts are taken and
lastly very very important Airlines make
sure they influence the media and don't
let the negative points come out I'm
very well aware of that of course we're
taking a look at this probe and we're
also talking about what the allegations
that are being put forth by gofrat go
first and then for that for MATA uh
Pratt and Whitney this is just going to
be a discussion Point as days pass by uh
the responsibilities have to be taken by
go first by Pratt and Whitney and of
course the foremost by the dgca now in
such a scenario uh how is it that the
passengers and the staffers are going to
be recompensated is the big question
that I ask on my television today
because because it's there they are they
are the ones who are going to be
suffering the maximum they are the ones
particularly in the middle class in the
lower middle class
section that that will bear the brunt of
it all uh on that note I'm completely
out of time I thank my panelists for

the the Airlines employee who are here
who are stationed here at the airport
they themselves are not able to get in
touch with the uh you know Airline

request a refund on their vehicles and
they have written an entire list of how
many passengers are there which the list
is not being revealed to any uh other
other you know other people is what they
claim okay
because I'm going to give a quick recap
to my viewers about what happened with
go first where the lenders of the cash
trap go first Airline will now meet
today to discuss the future course of
action during the meeting they will be
assessing the extent of provisioning
required now uh a meeting that is going
to be held by the lenders does this come
as a a potential relief for the
passengers and is there any indication
of when this meeting is going to take
place
give me details on a larger scale there
is now indication that there is going to
be a lenders meeting that takes place
but ah give does this give any hope to
the passengers who are at this point of
time stranded facing difficulties in
talking to the staff of go first they
have still not been refunded for the
tickets that they've bought
absolutely Mega reports coming in like
we've just broken on The Telecast
passengers are saying that they have not
been given any refund uh now as all of
this takes place as passengers clamor in
fact do get some sort of refund or even
a word from the airline we're now
learning that lenders of go first are
going to be holding a meeting today now
make a in this meeting what we've been
given to understand is that they're
going to be assessing the extent to
which help needs to be provided to go
first at this point in time let's also
not forget me that go first has a file
for bankruptcy and there's uh it it it
owes Financial creditors a total of
65.21 billion uh rupees and the airline
of course has stated this as it was
filing its bankruptcy now apart from
this up yes okay all right uh also the
fact that there are some uh potentially
90 000 passengers who would have to face
the crunch keeping in mind that go first
is the third largest airline that was up
until now operating in the country uh
any any any sort of justification or
clarification that has come forth from
the owners that's the wadia group
no mega we're still awaiting some sort
of official response
um uh of course they have yesterday uh
spoken and what gopher says is that it's
going to try and do everything that it
can to return the money to uh the
passengers that have suffered due to
this um uh you know due to this stoppage
on all flights at least 28 uh flights
off go air now let's not forget Mika
like you just mentioned
um there are there are at least 8.95
lakh passengers that were flown by go
air in March alone so numbers of April
if the flight were to operate would have
been the same
um three days of flights have been
suspended up for now third fourth and
fifth so today tomorrow and day after no

resignation as president of the party
that he had founded after this Fallout
with the Indian National Congress 20
years ago following massive protests by
NCP workers and strong pleas by leaders
the veteran leader backtracked his
decision and announced that he will
require two to three days to think over
his decision after recommending a panel
to be formed by the senior leaders of
the party to decide on the next
president of the Nationalist congress
party
breaking news coming in many NCP leaders
have started reaching's house at Silver
Oak
and many other leaders every Sharad
pawar's house
sujata my colleague is joining us on the
broadcast to give us more perspective to
this development obviously the Carter
and the party worker and of course the
Associates in NCP are hell-bent on
making sure that Sharad pawar does not
leave or resign and he's way across his
80s
okay foreign
anything while you were somewhere
arrested between him and sherat pawar
and was he and root to take away some
mlas for the party and join hands with
BJP as the rumors were setting in uh the
few days back to somewhere uh What uh it
is that what is the reason behind
Sheriff's immediately and out of the
group giving his resignation as the NCP
Chief is somewhat everybody and
especially the opposition thinking of
right now but as of now we see that the
committee has been formed and they and
they have already rejected the
application of resignation however
stays formed on a decision of not
continuing as as the chief and also uh
you know it was not only that lgp
leaders and workers gather the report of
that announcements but if it's a while
even for the last number of you know
everyone to a large number of people and
other authorities you have to believe it
so I just now uh sheriffs of our teams
in no mood to back up
leader of the Nationalist congress party
is also joining us on the program Mr
Lemon appreciate you joining us sir and
a very good morning to you I hope you
can hear me
good morning
so what's going on in the NCP obviously
there is a strong bond towards Mr sharat
pawar his exit or his resignation is not
boarding well uh with almost everybody
in the party what do you think is going
to be his next move
uh well since yesterday morning when
this shocking announcement came from
Sharad pawar in the presence of his
family members his party colleagues and
all workers you know it appears that it
was not sudden certainly Sharad power
had given some kind of a clue in the
sense that he kept everybody concerned
or related to be present at the relevant
time and when this came naturally it
created a kind of shock and surprise to
everybody and there was a reaction from
the party workers almost unanimous with
an exception of Ajit pawar that people
were saying that no no please withdraw
your uh this decision take it back and
uh only it was uh Ajit pawar who was
heard saying that there's nothing wrong
in stepping down and having a new uh
party Chief which is uh something uh
indicating some happenings by the side
and number two and three I must tell you
secondly that during the past one week
preceding this and all this announcement
there has been we have been seeing that
sheriff Ajit pawar's posters were seen
by his uh followers saying that he is
going to be the next chief minister and
the best chief minister Etc then thirdly
since the Supreme Court decision is
almost due in a matter of a week or so
by 15th May or so where it is expected
that shindeer's mlas would be fearing
disqualification and if that happens BJP
has to be ready with Plan B Because BJP
does not want to lose power they want to
clinch to and remain in power by who can
win by crook so I think they must have
been in preparedness to have some kind
of an arrangement with Ajit pawar which
is also difficult to be ruled out
although we are not certain about it
these are all secret things then Ajit
pawar is aspiring to become chief
minister maybe that the vacuum that
would be created by the fall of shinde's
MLA is you know it could be fulfilled by
ajith power getting the MLS from NCP and
NCP probably will have some problem and
maybe that the uncle and the nephew may
be having some kind of disagreement
between themselves these are all
speculations and we can only guess but I
must tell your viewers that Sharad pawar
is a very tall and very experienced
leader his stepping down is going to
have an impact not only in NCP but also
in MBA and probably a mild effect on the
national politics also there is a
Endeavor going on to bring all non-bjp
people together where also there could
be a setback by this kind of a step
taken by Charlotte tawa unless he says
that I have only relieved myself of
responsibility of this NCP Chief's
position but I am going to be National
politics and more actively giving more
time for the unification efforts and I
think that would be a good sign

crunch the Indian low cost carrier go
first has filed for voluntary insolvency
resolution proceedings before the nclt
according to the Gopher CEO kaushik Kona
the airline will temporarily halt its
operations for the next two days due to
a serious cash shortage he further
stated that the airline is facing
Financial issues due to non-supply of
engines by U.S engine Manufacturing
Company pnw Pratt and Whitney which has
forced the grounding of 28 planes the
airline has taken action and filed a
complaint against BMW in a federal court
in Delaware now the airline awaits
nclt's approval in order to resume
flights we're going to cut across to my
colleague arthi who's going to in fact
let us know
what is going on over here but before
that
let me also introduce some of our guests
who will be joining us and talking about
this Dr Sharad Kohli senior Economist is
with us on the program
uh
I'm gonna go and ask arthi to
demonstrate as to what is going on over
here and what exactly is the problem
that go first is dealing with arthi over
to you right vineeth uh just to take our
viewers through what exactly is
happening with uh go first and the legal
world they're having with Pratt and
Whitney currently now firstly what
happened would go first was that they
had to land 28 of their flights from The
Fleets that they were operating
currently which put them at a loss of
around 10 000 crore rupees uh now what
this then did was uh push go first into
loss and then eventually into bankruptcy
you know this is what's the statement
from Gophers said they also said that
they were pushed to this limit because
of the in ability of praten Whitney
which is an engine manufacturer to
actually Supply them with engines for
the rest of the fleet that was that was
operational now they've gone ahead and
canceled flights for three days and they
have in fact also Pratt and Whitney now
it when it comes to Pratt and Whitney's
statement what the engine manufacturer
is saying is that they have in fact
stopped or supplying uh engines to go
first because of an arbitration ruling
against go first in from the march of
2023 and they are complying to that
which is the reason that they did not
supply and they said that they have
constantly been delivering engines to
all of their Airline customers this is
of course what a pratt and Whitney has
said now a counter allegation from the
side of Pratt and Whitney is that they
are saying there has been a long history
from go first of not complying with
financial obligations that is default of
payment that has been done towards
praten Whitney from the side of go first
which was the reason that they were not
supplying engines in the first place now
this is what of course a pratt Whitney's
statement is uh when it comes to Indian
government and what civil aviation
minister in fact said he said the
government is trying to Aid go first in
every way possible trying to understand
and the situation that they are in and
also ensuring that they ensure that all
the passengers were inconvenienced
because of the overnight cancellation of
flights are then given proper redressal
after this
all right aarti appreciate you joining
us and taking us through what exactly is
wrong with go first Dr Coley I'm going
to come to you while another airline in
the dock another airline is tearing down
the barrel uh what could be the recourse
over here you know in the past we have
seen that the government has extended a
lot of help for these ailing Airlines to
sustain itself but over here you know
even a couple of months seem to be an
uphill task
very unfortunate vineet I would say uh
after Kingfisher and then Jet you know
the third Airline uh staring down the
barrel I mean it's it's a very very
unfortunate situation and uh you know I
mean this is very ironical to uh to the
Indian aviation industry potential you
know you know data shows that three and
a half to four crore people in India fly
out of the 142 crore plus that we are
and of course most of them are repeat
passengers because these three and a
half four crore people keep all the
airlines busy for that matter whether
it's International or whether it's
domestic so I think very ironical with
the tremendous potential for aviation
industry to grow
from here on considering China which has
about 660 which is 66 crore people
flying out of 140 to 141 crore
population
almost half the people fly over here the
percentages is minuscued so with such a
great potential and so much being done
by the government in terms of uh you
know
building new airports and building the
airport infrastructure at so many places
the public private partnership model you
know I am very surprised as to how these
airlines are not able to you know you
know maintain their bottom lines I mean
the problem here let's go on to go first
you know which is now go last until I
call it that way I somehow don't agree
with the Pratt and Whitney issue because
practical with me not supplying the
engines on time
I mean it doesn't go digest very well
with me because cash shortage occurring
due to shortage of supply of Angels the
airline could have always pruned down
its operations accordingly and could
have still thrown into the profit areas
you know the main problem is Cash crunch
lack of Investments coming in to go
first over the last 18 years we
've been flying about with about 60
aircrafts you know which is which is
one-fifth of the biggest airline in the
country which is indigo which has got
about 300 aircrafts so I think the
problem here is the lack of inclusion of
funds at the right time when the when
the airline needed the funds didn't come
through whatever be the reasons whether
it was the wadia family or it was the
investors or it was the lenders I think
uh Pratt and Whitney is just a very
small part of the problem I don't see
that as a major problem but then you
know bottom lines and going into
perennial losses is the problem here we
know I mean Indigo has just slipped back
into the black it was also into red
during covert time but well let's leave
our covert time and most of the airlines
around the world were in red but it's
just about managed to come into profit
spy status is managing to keep afloat
Air India has just been taken over by
Tata so it's too early to ferment as to
Which Way Air India is going in the
times to come so all said and done I
think the aviation industry in India as
I said earlier needs a complete revamp
the think tank of the aviation whether
it's the aviation Ministry or it is the
stalwarts of the aviation uh you know
you know industry experts they need to
sit down together on the table and work
out as to what's going wrong with the
airlines why aren't the operations
remaining profitable for uh for uh for a
reasonable length of time we find
Airlines going into profit and the next
quarter you find they slip into losses
then the next quarter comes again and
they're back into black so what are what
is wrong if you compare this Market to
the to the European in the American
Market
where at very small fares you know in
Europe 20 to 30 Euros in in U.S 30 to 40
to 50 dollars the airlines still fly
with these low fares the airlines still
fly into profits for what's wrong with
India either it's the low footfall well
when you go to an airport like Delhi
Mumbai Bengaluru Kolkata Chennai you
don't fight that maybe the regional
connectivity which has been created by
the government where some of the
airlines have been forced to fly
that could be the loss that could be
bleeding as far as the bottom lines are
concerned but I think a serious rethink
and a revamp we need is required
otherwise the the huge potential with
Indian industry or Indian I would say uh
economy throws open to the aviation
industry is going to get wasted and
it'll be a shame on the country when the
government also wants that people
wearing Hawaii Chapel should fly a
Hawaiian you know so why why is the
airline not able to generate profits I
think some of the cost bits some of the
factors which I can associate is high
ATF cost you know you know lack of
trained or skilled Manpower High
salaries or whatever Manpower is
available
infrastructure constraints technological
constraints lack of training facilities
you know these could be some of the
things but then I think the main problem
is that the base of the flight from
three and a half four crores needs to at
least double
then only you'll witness new players
coming in new players are hesitating to
invest money in aviation for the simple
reason that their presidentials or the
people already in the business are not
doing well so I think go first should be
taken as a classic example where the
think tank of aviation industry needs to
sit down on the table and rework before
another casualty comes our Waverly for

Minister Modi will be speaking at around
11AM after the prime minister's speech
he will fly to uncola and kittur to

all right so the prime minister in full
swing today in the state of Karnataka
which goes into uh
is already into election mode will be
voting on the 10th of May exactly a week
from today and the prime minister is
making sure that the bhati janta party

prize of what the party has done in
Karnataka and what they plan to do if
selected over the course of the next
five years
once again the Prime Minister will be

state of
my colleague is back on the phone line
with us jayaprakash the Prime Minister
obviously putting out bjp's agenda
talking about what has been done in the
past five years and what will be done in
the next five years he's leaving no
stone unturned
well absolutely this elections in Canada
all about the Modi Outreach we have seen
that the BJP is extensively using the
Prime Minister and His Image and
popularity in the state so far he's done
about six Road shows he has done about
uh 12 uh public meetings uh yesterday he
did three today he's gonna do three
first off he's going to be in Mulkey
which is in the Dakshin kannada region
and then he is going to go on uh towards
Udupi uh and then towards the Harvard so
entire Coastal and uh the northern
Karnataka region he's going to touch
upon today too and uh you know he's been
talking about how the congress party who
had the many popular schemes it was
devised only to make money politicians
in the congress party you know
um the eight of the 85 percent of uh the
money is one Rupee was to reach the last
mile person uh 85 was uh the bill fridge
and uh at the end of the day the person
who was supposed to get benefited would
get only 15 Paisa so from there to the
direct debt direct transfer facility of
a DBT of the Union government has seen
to it that grows and crows of farmers
are getting 10 000 rupees by uh directly
into their account without any Bill
courage so this is the kind of welfare
scheme that the BJP works on and the
Congress devices welfare schemes only to
fill its own coffers so not only this
double engine sarkar projects that have
been taken up by the Indian Minister
data infrastructure for Railways Health
Hospitality education aims so many such
schemes are being highlighted by the
Prime Minister as you know he goes uh
for uh you know hunting those votes
which is very important uh for them for
the party especially a year to go for
the all-important parliament elections
this could be seen as a precursor
especially in the southern states
and japrakash historically speaking it's
it's very much likely that the Prime
Minister you know who usually talks
about you know the the current politics
is also likely to bring up what the
Congress Manifesto is all about
well absolutely he never misses an
opportunity to get back at the congress

resignation as president of the party
that he had founded after this Fallout
with the Indian National Congress 20
years ago following massive protests by
NCP workers in strong pleas by leaders
the veteran leader backtracked his
decision and announced that he will
require another two three days to think
over his decision after recommending a
panel to be formed by the senior leaders
of the party to decide on the next
president of the Nationalist congress
party
my colleague joins us at this point in
time to give us more insight into this
rushali obviously a popular leader like
Sharad pavar cannot just you know be
gone as the president of the NCP and
perhaps one of the most prominent
opposition faces with uh you know just
one stroke of an announcement
but absolutely we have seen that you
know the how the pawar has decided to
step down if you see the Wikipedia uh
the official uh uh status of the NCT in
the Wikipedia also it has mentioned the
the position for the presidential
pollution is completely blank so uh
there is no a way for Sarasota to you
know take back this particular decision
we have seen the yesterday how the
workers were tried their best to you
know convince him but he said that uh
let me give me some time to rethink
about it but this is what we are
learning that uh now on the Wikipedia
also they have removed the official
position of the president so certainly
this is a clear indication that
sarathwar is not going to take back his
decision and now it's the only question
that who will be the next NCT Chief we
are learning that the entity minorities
sale is already pitching uh right from
the uh yesterday late night that you
know a supreme parade to become a the
next NCT uh we are learning that many
mlas are also now started murmuring that
she has seen in this space for Tech uh
almost 15 years now uh she has
represented uh uh as a member of
parliament for uh more than one decade
last 15 years and also certainly this is
uh certainly really uh
uh creating a buzz within the party now
that uh supriyasule to you know elect as
a next chief we have seen that houses
yesterday while he announced that he
wished to step down while announcing uh
it was the movement when he released his
biography the second part of his
biography in that particular book it is
already mentioned that however has
misused his name he himself has written
none other than but uh
only has written in his biography that
Ajit pawar misused his name to take MLA
to Raj Bhavan and to form the government
with the BJP so this is the clear
indication uh that you know is not in
the mood uh to make uh Ajit pawar as a
party Chief question arises if uh
Supreme
but
right NCP State the spokesperson Mr
Mahesh tapse also joins us on the
program at this point in time Mr tabsa
very good morning to you I hope you can
hear me yeah good morning to you Mr
tapsee what is going on in the NCP
obviously the most popular leader you
know a elderly Statesman who has held
the party together and several other
parties also together for a very long
time why would he suddenly announce his
departure as the president
well this is a big question which has
come to us and a shock to us which
happened after the book launch of his uh
biography and we were not expecting this
kind of a moon yes it definitely came in
it was a big shock and all the
characters were present protested and
there was a patriotically that would
take back his resignation and to lead us
[Music]
like all the time
Mr
pawar has asked for a few days to
reconsider his decision if he sticks his
ground who do you think in your opinion
is likely to succeed Mr power
see generally Mr pawar is known to not
to recall his decision but here this

FhxvVfmh_Zs,US Treasury Warns Of Debt Default By June 1st | Will The US Economy Collapse Without Reforms?,US President Joe Biden summoned the four top Congressional leaders to the White House next week after the treasury warned ...,2023-05-02T13:13:40Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FhxvVfmh_Zs/hqdefault.jpg,"hello and welcome you're watching news x
with me devika Chopra top Focus U.S
President Joe Biden has summoned the
four top Congressional leaders to the
White House next week after the treasury
won the government could run short of
cash to pay its bills as soon as June
the U.S treasury said that it could run
out of money to pay all of the
government's bills as soon as June
without a debt limit increase in her
letter
Yellen warned that the agency will be
unlikely to meet all U.S government
payment obligations as early as June 1st
if the Congress does not take any action
the estimate given by the agency in the
letter suggested that the United States
could be headed for an unprecedented
default that would shake the global
economy so what really is the problem
here the debt ceiling is a legal limit
on the amount of money that the U.S
government is authorized to borrow to
meet its Financial Obligations this debt
ceiling is decided by the Congress and
it is periodically raised to accommodate
any increase in the national debt in a
situation when the government hits the
debt ceiling it will be unable to pay
its bills which could lead to a
government shutdown a default on the
debt and potentially a global financial
crisis the debt ceiling was reached on
19th Jan 2023 when the national debt
crept above
31.4 trillion dollars it was set in
December 2021
when the debt ceiling was raised by 2.5
trillion dollars and the last another
time when the debt ceiling was hit was
the first of August 2021 that limit was
28.4 trillion dollars all of this news
comes just as the First Republic Bank
becomes the second largest regional bank
with assets over 200 billion dollars to
fail in just a few weeks like the
Silicon Valley Bank which was seized by
the government on the 10th of March the
First Republic Bank also catered to a
very wealthy clientele is the United
States of America then in any sort of
trouble we discussed this with our guest
Ambassador Ashok sajnar joins us on the
broadcast I also have with me Ajay Dua
senior Economist we also have with us
Akash Jindal Economist and also got the
Mukherjee senior journalist with me on
the broadcast say thank all of our
panelists for joining us let me begin
this conversation with Mrs
matters of the finances and economy
little complicated so if we can just
Begin by explaining to our viewers how
exactly does this U.S debt ceiling
system work
very well thank you so much
are like any other government in the
world to fund its activities the
government's resort to
open market for product
in the U.S where the while the
Administration has a lot of powers the
president that's why he's the most
powerful person in the world at the same
time he is subjected to checks and
balances and the biggest of it is
legislative checks upon M it is vested
in the U.S legislature to impose how
much now how much can the U.S
Administration borrow and as you very as
you just read out the current limit is
that greater borrow up to 31.4 trillion
dollars in the in the open market to
fund the activities of the U.S
Administration
we find that during the pandemic and
post it the U.S government has been
spending far more than its earnings were
and has been resorting periodically
okay and hitting the virtually hitting
the ceiling to uh to find its activities
that has continued under President Biden
and this is happening despite
and the latest cause of it being that
despite
there being shot
the tax returns which were filed in the
last quarter showed that the earnings of
the U.S government by way of taxes were
lower than anticipated so the U.S
government has now decided that during
the what during the current quarter it
would borrow as much as 726 billion
dollars which is 400 and almost 450
billion dollars more than what it had
projected in January
subsequent to that there is a fall in
its income and while the income tax
refunds or the tax refunds have
continued a peace so it is hard of
liquidity so this is what has caused the
present crisis that on one hand income
is not there expenditure is continuing
and on top of it to to fund the
expenditure the government of U.S
tomorrow it's going to be it's ceiling
fairly quickly unless the ceiling is
enhanced and there I don't think the U.S
Congress would let
the situation come to such a power in
such a situation to such a level that
the U.S government would default and all
the consequence says which you very
rightly mention would be reached it is
more going to be horse trading already
the indications are very clear the U.S
republican-led Congress right has to be
passed a resolution that they are
willing to increase this limit by 1.5
trillion dollars provided as low as
Government agrees that over the next 10
years it would reduce its expenditure or
increase or reduce the deficit financing
by as much as
4.8 trillion so right some something is
on the table which is what the President
of the U.S okay is going to be
discussing with the Congressional
readers four of whom he has has
requested to join him for a discussion
on the 9th of May okay Mr General let me
bring you into the conversation that was
a very uh clear exhaustive summary that
Mr dua's provided there to our viewers
what really is the U.S facing at this
point in time but
historically of course the US has never
defaulted on its debt their constitution
does not allow them uh to reach that
sort of a situation
but given the sort of banking crisis
that is going on currently in the United
States of America what is it that they
really need to now brace themselves for
uh see as of now in the short term I
think the debt ceiling should be raised
and perhaps it would be raised because
see the U.S economy is not a very
healthy economy let's accept the fact
now pandemic was a bad year A bad period
for each and every economy but it's not
only about pandemic I'll take you back
my organization has done decent research
2001 was the last year when U.S economy
was a surplus economy post 2001 since
2002 to 2000 this year us has always
been a deficit economy so deficits after
deficits deficit uh for the viewers if
your income is less and you are spending
higher that's a deficit now how do you
fund that deficit one way of funding
deficit is that you keep on borrowing so
if you keep on borrowing and borrowing
ultimately you'll hit the ceiling if you
have a ceilingual hit the ceiling now
what are the ways and means of avoiding
that ceiling one way is to have more
taxes to increase the tax rates but
seeing the pandemic levels the way
global economy has been initially U.S
was hit by a pandemic then we all know
Russia Ukraine war then as you have
rightly said problems with U.S banks so
is the U.S government in a position to
raise taxes perhaps not so how do you
fund that deficit so debt is the only
way left to fund that deficit of course
post that I think you need to have a
restructuring of the U.S economy see we
all know U.S is the biggest economy
most successful economy most powerful
economy but what has been the U.S doing
in the past 20 years now we have seen
China which started as a manufacturing
economy in 1979 from 19 1990 to 2015
China became in this 25 years it became
a robust manufacturing economy now did
U.S utilize that time in becoming a
major Manufacturing Company what was U.S
doing those period during that period
I think
U.S was taking care of the entire world
but perhaps U.S was not putting its own
house in order U.S was everywhere in the
world right between Iraq we'd be Iran
we'd be Afghanistan name it any place us
was everywhere but U.S should have
concentrating more on putting its house
in order in front of U.S China became
such a powerful manufacturing economy
just give me 10 seconds worth I'll take
you back to 2015 2014. in an Indian
retail Market if you now of course we
are not buying that much Chinese
products because of what China has been
doing but 2013-14 had you gone to any
any Indian retail Market there would
have been so much of Chinese products
Chinese TV Chinese so much think Chinese
charts Chinese Chinese birth Chinese
land but were there any U.S things watch
U.S manufacturing and selling to the
world I think except for Hollywood
movies which Indians were watching I
think there was not much U.S production
which are available right in India or
anywhere so this is the problem they
have to do a restructuring of the
economy and they have to just see what
China did in the past 25 years
particularly from 1990 to 2015. so that
is what would get them a solution so
ultimately it has to become a
successful economy also yeah a surplus
economy it has to come back to be the
Surplus economy of course we all know
that absolutely yes several relevant
points there but Ambassador once we hear
you know what our economists have had to
say on the panel one does wonder that
after every few months we've been having
this conversation almost every year in
fact we have this conversation about the
US hitting its debt ceiling then will
the debt ceiling be raised ah you know
will it uh will the U.S default and then
of course they raise the Red Sea Lane in
the borrow more money and the cycle
continues
there is of course now a series of major
Banks collapsing in the United States of
America and we've already seen the
repercussions of that the domino effect
of that in several other parts of the
world given how interlinked the global
economy is today the question that then
one wants to ask is how is it that
nobody is really talking about it why is
it that the second largest bank
collapses in the United States of
America and that's merely there and of
course newspapers to read about but
that's not really seen as a major issue
where are the George sorosis of the
world and the hindenburgs of the world
where are there reports about the U.S
economy about the health of the U.S
economy as Akash Jinder was pointing out
they have not managed to really get
their economy back
into the Surplus mode for the past 20
years so where really are those reports
then
yeah thank you very much uh you know for
having me on your show and you know both
your initial report and the statements
by Mr Dua and Mr Jindal have really
brought out the uh problem very very
clearly and very visibly you know what
we have really to understand is and as
has been mentioned by the earlier two
panelists the whole problem really
started in uh early 2000 you know we
need to recognize the 2001 was the year
when China became a member of the WTO
and that was the time when uh if you
look at the national uh strategic report
uh strategic survey coming out of the
United States in 2002. what it was
focusing on was globalization without
any bar without any restrictions and
what it said is that we need to support
the places where most efficiently
products can be manufactured so all its
Investments for manufacturing they went
to China and China kept on increasing
and you know as the earlier two
panelists have also said the uh China
continue to become a manufacturing Hub
and that was the problem that really St
you know how they saw the uh Evolution
how it saw the uh rise even of Donald
Trump because uh you know whether it is
the Rust Belt in the United States all
the jobs are going out all the
manufacturing is going out of the United
States and that is why all these uh
penal tariffs that were imposed by Mr
Trump on China which was the fact that
uh you know in 600 billion dollars a
bilateral trade it was 500 billions was
the imports from China and only 100
billion was export from India from the
United States to China and that is why
there was these discussions with the
China annual default that on 15th of
January 2020 the very big
trade deal that was signed between the
United States and China that China for
the next two years will import an
additional 200 billion dollars worth of
goods from the United States that
unfortunately did not happen for a
variety of reasons one early 2020 we had
the pandemic striking the whole world
and then Mr Trump got busy in his own
election campaign and he could not win
the election so you know whatever the
commitments were given by China to
increase its imports from the United
States that has not happened but now you
see that
we have seen the weaponization of the
supply chains so everyone today is now
talking not only about globalization
everyone is talking about offshoring
about Trend showing about de-risking
about decoupling and so on so forth that
we need to have resilient uh Supply
chains that is why you see whether it is
India Japan Australia coming together to
have these resilient Supply chains
because China has
a control over a large number of
manufacturing
areas which it is using for political
control on many of the other countries
so I think this realization has come not
only to the United States but the whole
world that total dependence on one
particular source of manufacturing is
not good so the you know for it to have
an impact of course it's going to have
some time but coming back to the issue
that we have been discussing in terms of
the uh unsustainable debt that the
United States has gone into I think
there is no other way that uh there will
be a raise there will be an extension of
the limit of debt from 31.4 trillion
dollars it is uh the Republicans who
control the house they have given some
conditions uh that they want the
administration to fulfill in terms of uh
Bringing Down the uh expenditure and I
think also there is the Republicans are
concerned that the expenditure also on
the war is uh very heavy yeah on the
Ukraine conflict the support that is
going to Ukraine so I think they might
try to extract some uh concessions from
President Biden on that score also so I
think it's going to be a negotiation
it's going to be tough hard bargaining
but uh sooner rather than later I think
the decision will come that this limit
has been extended going forward so uh
but of course the there will be limit on
the power and authority of the president
of the White House in terms of what it
can do going forward absolutely
Mukherjee you know bringing you into the
conversation here same question like I
said one does wonder where exactly are
these reports there about the health of
the U.S economy given that yes it is the
largest economy anything that happens in
the United States of America does have a
very direct impact not just in Europe
but on the rest of the world
you know just I I you know going further
from what the other panelists have been
saying about globalization being a root
cause
uh let us remember that the last time
the U.S had a balanced budget was during
the Clinton administration
and not only that they had fantastic
growth rates Alan Greenspan who is the
Fed chairman of the time he believed in
borrow and spent and it went swimmingly
throughout the Clinton Administration
and came to a head in 2008 when most of
the big Banks too big to fail Layman
Etc in Wall Street all crashed when that
happened then the White House and the
administration the treasury secretary
and so on had to bail out not only the
banks but the High Street businesses and
the ordinary people with mortgages and
this was a huge unforeseen if you like
unforeseen expenditure mainly caused by
derivatives from borrowing which were
then passed from One bank to the other
like a parcel and had no intrinsic value
and when the crash came it affected the
entire economy it crashed the stock
market it roiled the global markets and
then you had to put the economy back on
the rail so
the Obama Administration spend its
entire eight years giving a monthly
subsidy running into some 12 to 17
billion dollars a month
to try and keep the economy afloat this
went on for eight years and thereafter
you had these other Black Swan events
your covet
your Ukraine
um and uh you know the militarization if
you like of the Chinese economy and the
need to get away from it and you know as
reclaimed part of the they they the
manufacturing base which had completely
in America
31.4 trillion is the official debt in
addition to that there are other
liabilities that probably take it to
double that figure
and you're talking about increasing by
another
trillion and a half and so on just to
keep going the hope of being this amount
of debt down
is is is different and even if the
government under duress promises all
sorts of cuts who is going to hold them
to it when they fail to do so down the
road so the American economy is a house
of cards uh followed very closely by the
Chinese economy this is the downside of
the borrow and spend uh philosophy which
comes back to bite you if you cannot
raise enough Revenue to at least pay
your interest here
borrowing is used to pay interest
and that is a recipe for bankruptcy
okay but we're running out of time but
let me just bring back
into the conversation when we talk about
them protecting ourselves from uh you
know possible tricky situation like I
said historically the US government has
never defaulted on its debt but there is
also a simultaneous banking crisis
that's going on there is recession in
many parts of the world there are so
many countries in Europe that are facing
protests over the saying the growing
cost of living these are all scenarios
that the US could potentially be facing
in just a short while from now they may
or may not default on the debt but of
course the common citizen will be
hampered like I said the banking crisis
will also have an impact is there
something then that India perhaps needs
to do to keep itself protected from the
repercussions
I think we are pretty safe okay I'm
going to say pretty safe it is because
we've been taking far more precautions
we've been conservative in our monetary
policy or in our federal bank has been
very conservative so I'm I think we
won't be hit as badly as many other
countries of Europe who are virtually
integrated into the U.S capital Market
and there the it's going to be much more
but I just want to say welcome one
particular aspect that I'm just building
up upon what Mr
um Mukherjee had raised the U.S economy
for a very long time has been living on
borrows borrowings U.S households
everybody has cards overspends the U.S
economy exactly the same thing keep
borrowing keep borrowing and today they
have come to such a such a situation
that not only for import of goods from
China they are heavily dependent upon
but even the U.S bond market the biggest
Bond Mark bondholder is the Republic of
the People's Republic of China these
guys hold all the Trump cards in the
Visa V the U.S and I think the sooner
U.S realizes to cut its you know what
they say quote according to the clock
that consumed less
you have gone on for too long
individually families Nation will the
Salvation lies only in that and not in
printing more notes or borrowing or to
go on on a vicious cycle of borrowing
and that's what exactly is happening to
the U.S banking system it is a result or
it is facing the consequences because it
is not backed up by hardcore assets
which average any prudent Banker must
have already demand in order to go
forward
absolutely
wants to make a point I'll leave the
last word with you Mr gender yeah are
you talking about India and the proud
Indian let me tell you
1.87 lakh Road that's the GST collection
which we have done last month of course
it was my prediction that we'll collect
more than 1.75 lakh crore on your
channel and other channels so India we
are growing our economy is growing our
tax collection is going and GST
uh or not but see this is the might of
Indian economy our consumption are
buying the demand which is the strength
of Indian economies clearly reflecting
plus we will be having more than six
percent GDP growth fastest growing
economy we are the fifth largest economy
predicted to be the third largest
economy by 2027 and predicted to be a 10
trillion US dollar economy by 2055. so
India I think is much more resilient
than us our conservative approach a
decent banking system because like see
what happened uh with one of the U.S
banks it that it had a lot of bonds now
what happened was rates of Interest kept
on increasing the mark to market value
of bonds it went down and ultimately the
bank was in problem but here see RBA has
an excellent system for the banks you
have to keep this much amount in SLR
this much amount in crr this much money
can go into Equity so I think India is a
much much better managed and governed
economy and the way we are increasing
the way our youth power is increasing I
think the coming 10 years the coming 20
years are India's years because I I I
America is not performing China also
access has its share of problem China
also has lots and lots of issues like
the banking issue real estate issue then
of course we know the U.S China trade
War then China is not being loved in
many parts of the world because of its
expansionist policies right so I think
clearly going to be India's era in the
coming 10 to 20 years that's that's what
I seriously and sincerely believe that's
what the belief of my organization all
right Gotham Mukherjee just one last
question to you sir the fact that the
second largest bank uh you know Regional
Bank has now collapsed in the U.S it's
almost akin to some of the larger Banks
you know in India also collapsing and if
that happens in India there would be
a lot of furore uproar in the global
Community as well that okay India is not
being able to keep its finances healthy
its economy is not doing well but when
similar things happen in the United
States of America like I said there is
hardly any talk or hardly any mention
about it except for in financial circles
does that narrative somewhere need to
change and do we need to also have a
better understanding of the health of
some of these economies that continue to
be the largest but there there are it
seems a lot of skeletons in the closet
well the new model devika is to Simply
pass the parcel to another bank Morgan
Stanley has bought it at uh no doubt a
good depreciated rate and life goes on
that's the same thing that happened to
Credit Suisse in Switzerland and uh so
you know they quickly do that rather
than have a situation where the entire
thing falls to the ground everybody's
thrown on the road they don't quite
allow that if they fire people they fire
people quietly around the back and so
life goes on
um right it is in India we had a similar
situation for many years what the
government of India does is write off
huge quantities
of non-performing assets every year
with taxpayer money and refinances the
banks so the crooks run away with the
money the government refinances the bank
and all is well
not really they also say that we have
these uh you know the bad banks that are
meant to go after the assets get four
rupees out of every 10 and so on but
nobody hears about it afterwards it goes
out of the media out of the public eye
who knows it's a lot like these various
sesses that Indians are asked to pay on
top of the petrol on top of this on top
of that and it's not used it lying
somewhere we see no benefit we forget we
forget no all governments are pretty
callous about all of this and America is
no different neither is India absolutely

7IHFfM5J-oA,NCP Workers Protest Sharad Pawar&#39;s Resignation | Sharad Pawar steps down as NCP President | NewsX,NCP Workers Protest Sharad Pawar's Resignation | Sharad Pawar steps down as NCP President | NewsX To Subscribe our ...,2023-05-02T09:01:39Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7IHFfM5J-oA/hqdefault.jpg,"has announced that he has quote unquote
decided to step down as president of the
party while doing so the NCP Supremo
also emphasized that he is not retiring
from public life this announcement was
followed by protests and sloganering by
party workers meanwhile his son has
commented on the matter as well assuring
party workers to not worry and stating
that the NCP Still Remains a family so
big developments taking place in
Maharashtra
my colleague rushali with us on the
broadcast rushali big announcement there
by Sharad pavari says he's stepping down
as the NCP Supremo all of this happening
just weeks after there were several
rumors that Ajit pawar is disgruntled
that he's holding secret meetings for me
with the BJP and is planning to quit the
party
what is the latest vishali
well today uh uh there was a second part
the second part of his autobiography was
launched and uh while launching he
expressed his views on his journeys
political journey and while expressing
he suddenly announced his uh retirement
from the uh electoral politics rather he
said that I will not contest any
elections in sports uh by uh rajya Sabha
a tenure is still there for next three
years will continue to raise
maharashtra's issue over there and the
issues concerned uh to the nation but at
the same time will not contest any
elections in fourth and for his fourth
uh I wish I am stepping down from the
post of the president of pncp this was a
big announcement that he made today and
uh he has made this announcement uh when
we know that Ajit pawar's speculations
over uh you know joining DJ see the the
secret meetings took place several times
between him these all the speculation uh
uh uh
between this big announcement he has
made it's a big news for the state
because this will have a lot of
implications in upcoming days for NCP as
a party as well as for the state who
will be heading for the State uh general
election in 2024. uh certainly now the
question is who will be the next uh
chief of the NCP the movement he uh
declares his retirement from the
Electoral politics however he said that
he will remain in the political life he
will travel he will go attend the public
meetings but he will no more wish to be
as a party uh president and there is a
committee who will take the appropriate
decision or as gonna be the next uh
chief of the party but immediately after
this we have seen there's a big
outbursts from the party workers to the
senior leaders just they cried we have
seen the a state president for the NCP
uh Jen party literally cried while
expressing his views and urge to him
like anything to step uh back and you
know step back from this decision and
his announcement even
a lot but then uh uh he said that you
know he is not in the mood to take back
his decision and he will stick with that
but it's the time that the new uh a
president will definitely work under his
leadership but who is the next Supreme
that's the biggest question at this
point of time but we are lodging from
the workers is that they are urging that
they want uh to remain the chief of for
the party uh because they are not
willing to accept anybody else rather
while you know expressing uh different
they express their views and that time
these are testing times for your party
Sir Charles pavar has announced that he
will be quitting as NCP president
what exactly is the plan of action for
the party because a lot of questions are
being raised is is the way being made
for perhaps Ajit Papa to take over
uh it's very difficult to say anything
so immediately because this uh dcn Power
service taken just half an hour ago so
the total party is a requesting uh
honorable to remain on the same post but
let us hope for the best because
our party will take the appropriate
decision
um if
didn't
didn't back from his decision that so
just now it's very difficult to react on
it but it's very loud and clear that we
want to remain as a national present of
rasa the congress party and we want to
work under his leadership it's very
clear let's hope for the best I think
power service is very sensible and very
deep political leader and whatever
decision he will take that will be in
the interest of the party as well as in
the interest of nation so we are with
his decision but we are requesting him
not to quit from this post
all right Mr Mohan with Sharad pavar now
stepping down is there somewhere a worry
in the party that this could lead to
some of the workers or some of the
leaders also then stepping away from the
party that they may not accept any other
new leadership at this point given that
this move seems to be a complete
surprise for everyone within the NCP
no no I I personally feel it is not
possible because the the
worker whichever
workings with raspati congress party
since long they will not leave any party
there is no difference there is no
difference in our party but it is very
clear that uh if pawarsav is not in uh
if he will he is withdrawing from the
politics it is a surprise to each and
every worker also and no doubt it's a
shock to us also so but the the party is
fully integrated there is nothing
defense of opinion we all are one and we
we are the active part of the uh
also right absolutely thank you so much

us that perspective of what's really
happening within the NCP for more such

of NCP is what Sharad pavar has
announced during the launch of his book
so big developments coming in from the
NCP camp where Sharad pavar has made
this big announcement during his book
launch
Sharad pavar has said that he has
decided to step down
as president of the NCP
foreign
[Laughter]
[Applause]
making this big announcement there what
is he said and what is the impact and
implications of it going to be
this will have a big impact on the NCP
and also on the upcoming uh 2014
elections uh the moment he has announced
that he'll step down he he has decided
to step down as the NCT president and
will not contest any uh election in
sports uh so certainly he has decided
that he is not going to be the NCT
supreme or any more NCP uh president any
more uh remember he still has three more
years to go uh to complete his uh just
about 10 years but he has decided that
he is not going to contest any elections
but however he will remain his social
life uh this is what uh I'm learning
that he has decided but yes uh it's a
big news that is coming in and this will
have a lot of implications as well the
movement that the classes we have seen
that in the entire Hall uh uh MVP
workers power
foreign
absolutely and and you know the fact of
course is that vishali this this the
timing is very very interesting as this
statement is made by Sharad pavar this
decision to resign comes amidst murmurs
within the Maharashtra vikas sagari
amidst you know rumors of a possible
split in the NCP amidstalk of Ajit pawar
wanting to Ally with the BJP so the
timing very interesting of this
statement by Mr power
we have seen
who has made a public statement saying
that he wants to be the chief minister
of Maharashtra and you know to cover up
within one or two days even the NCT
other leaders have also said the next uh
chief minister will be from the NCT
party but uh now particularly after this
decision of Saratoga to step down at the
NCP a Supremo as an NCT president
however he will remain in the party uh I
mean he is someone who you know will
look after but not the officially not of
the positions uh but this decision has
now created a big debate or spoke for
the big debate that who's gonna be the
next uh president of the NCT uh uh
Supriya sule or Ajit pawar I'm sure Ajit
pawar will have his own claim uh because
he has seen in the past also he has
already shown a cold shoulder uh to uh
is
before this as well that he always
claims that you know he will leave the
party with these 30 plus mlas are with
him we have seen this since uh you know
many decades that he always gave the
whole thought that that you know he's
somewhere unhappy or he uh he wanted to
you know have the grab rather the entire
power of NPC but now this is the time to
make a choice uh uh how many mlas will
stick with the uh Ajit pawar whether
they want a deepawar to become a
president of the NCP party or they will
stand behind the Supreme that's the
biggest question uh at the moment yes
because
has he given any reasons for this
decision for taking this decision did he
spell out any reasons in that in that
speech of his uh he's interestingly said
that he's not retiring from public life
though so this is not a retirement
announcement just yet
so life he said that she more than six
decades he has beat into the political
uh feel but this is the time that he has
decided to step down as the NCP party
Chief and as per uh
pawar he said that uh he warns that you
know uh now somebody else to lead the
party and that's the reason why after
spending six decades he said uh almost
63 years he spent in uh the political uh
life so now somewhere he will remain in
the social life but uh wish to you know
uh not to contest any more election
however we know that for his rajas about
10 year three more uh years are still
there but uh the next election he is not
willing to contest
and very importantly he wished to you
know step down he has decided and
announced today uh today there was a
book launch uh the book a featured on
his political Journey so at this
particular launch he has announced this
a big decision of his life to you know
step down from the party uh which he uh
very uh he spent so many years to you
know
make that party uh in power uh we we
have seen that pawar is someone who
always remained in the power directly or
indirectly and this is the time where he
has announced uh in front of all he's
the party Workers Party leaders that he
wished to step down as a party president
however we have seen that immediately
after his decision all the karyakarta
started giving slogans that please um
her take back of this decision uh please
do not step down we have contested
election on your name on your face yes
we don't want to you know uh you to step
down you are the ultimate leader for us
this one the immediate emotions or
immediate statements that we have heard
from the podium itself we have seen that
how shikarya's they uh stepped in and uh
they entered on the podium itself
not to you know uh step down and please
take back
our first reaction to this big statement
being made by Sharad pavar how do you
read it
I think that this could also be his uh
way of trying to tell us the party men
uh you know party person to stop this in
fighting because you know there was this
uh there is this huge tussle between the
two factions that is a supreme and uh
his nephew Ajit pawar so then uh you
know he probably wants to tell them to
uh you know mend all these differences
and uh you know get together and do
something uh for the party and it also
could be that uh see he has said he has
not announced his retirement as you
rightly said some time back he has said
that he will be serving as a guide to
the government and to the party also but
he will step down from his post as the
the head of the political party so it's
not as if he will not be in the picture
at all but it could also be that he
wants to hand over the pattern to the
next in charge but then again there is
no clear indication of who exactly he's
putting in charge so that is another
thing but uh this could also be
something where he wants them to bury
their differences and uh and uh he
probably looking at it as a way of
saving the political party
absolutely yes
leader of the BJP is also in fact
joining us now this big story that is
just coming RS patania uh big breaking
developments of course from Mumbai uh
deciding to step down as NCP Chief your
first reaction how is the BJP doing this
okay
you see this is an internal matter of
the Nationalist congress party
NCP it's an entirely but I think the way
MBA Maharashtra because agadi has feared
the way it has fallen like a deck of
cards the way its flock is running
across in different at variant
directions
so God knows what configuration might
have weighed upon another what are the
political situations which
resigned from his own brain child his
own concept is his own political
proposition that is one expect
the stand is very very clear We Stand
committed to the holistic development of
Maharashtra and the government and led
by Mr
and the she'll say now we said ships
for the peace prosperity and the four
dimensional Philip of Maharashtra this
is what I want to submit
huh
yes but you know this is this this
announcement also comes while there are
also rumors of a possible alliance with
the NCP while there are rumors of Ajit
pawar posing up to BJP what will be its
bearing on that RS pathania
I think
nothing official about rumors are just
rumors nothing official about it
tomorrow if something happens but as on
date and as on now
uh I don't think there's something more
than this to tell to be learned various
persons and to YouTube I think we should
keep our fingers crossed and hopefully
the politics of Maharashtra is about to
take a momentous turn with the bharata
party and its people friendly policies
and programs at the center stage we are
committed to a strong to a vibrant to a
prosperous Maharashtra this is the only
concern which I want to support at this
moment so I I are you are you predicting
are you hopeful that the alliance that
there could be some sort of further
Grand Alliance in the in the offing
is of course taking this big decision do
you believe it's a it's a big moment in
Maharashtra politics certainty yeah
given the long Legacy that he has had
absolutely absolutely there's no two
opinions about it that Mr Baba has been
at the center of the Maharashtra
politics since the past so many decades
while he was in Congress no he's no more
in Congress he's leading his own
political party and even then he's at
the center stage one part nobody will
deny it and dispute it
and the other part of the affair as I
said that part is committed to the
prosperity and well-being of the people
of Maharashtra this is our only take
which I want to serve at this occasion I
think we should keep our fingers crossed
and in future also all certain events
all certain developments all certain
combinations are if any if any at
present there's nothing official about
it they shall be in the interest of the
people of the Maharashtra this is what
they want to submit
tomorrow
hello
[Applause]
please foreign
[Applause]
[Music]
so slogany ring clearly continuing their
slogan airing in support of Sharad pabar
are clearly continuing at the book
launch a venue where he made this big
statement
I'm being told rad Lakshmi Joshi
continues to be with us at Lakshmi Doshi
uh you know interestingly we were
hearing of course from the bjp's MR
patania was saying possibly there could
be a big turn in Maharashtra politics
happening very very soon would you
connect this statement with the rumors
the murmurs within Maharashtra as well
uh they you know one thing about
politics is you can never say you know
like they say you never say never about
anything but uh yeah there are there are
huge ideological differences uh between
the parties and questions that you are
hinting at uh but uh like the BJP
spokesperson was saying that you know if
there is something that might be for the
benefit of the people or the benefit of
the government so then uh you can never
say never so
um you know that could also be there in
the afternoon you can't say as of now
but we'll have to wait and watch for it
but uh one thing I would say is that uh
you know this could also be Optics that
you know we all know that uhwati is the
tallest leader uh today in the NCP and
in the entire opposition also I would
say so you know even if he has resigned
from the post he would still be the most
important the most significant leader so
yeah I don't think that any good
Anything could happen without his uh
blessings as they call it so uh this
could just be Optics and you know that
could also uh be something uh that could
that could definitely be something
coming up we can never say that but he
will definitely be there in charge of
things in the NCP that is that is it uh
for sure today
yes
also continues to be with us especially
uh interestingly I think Ajit pawar has
also reacted there Jeet pavares said NCP
will continue to be one family I think
Ajit pawar is also
reacted to this big announcement by
Sharad pavar Ajit pawar praful Patel
other senior leaders of the NCP all
present there arante at this function
where NCP workers are sloganering in
favor of Mr pavar as well
are you able to hear me
hello yes so uh after stepping down as a
party uh president uh he made it very
clear that he will work in the field of
Education agriculture cooperation Sports
culture
Etc uh this resignation uh is only for
the party president post and he will
continue his public life activities
traveling attending all the public
programs Etc uh but uh if the NCT
leaders uh uh who will choose the new
party president uh you're now the
activists of the NCP party they are
demanding to declare the new party
president right now only I mean they are
asking
himself that he instead of the committee
to decide who will be the next chief
they want that their Supreme Court to
decide and declare uh who is who will
take forward his legacy but uh what we
are learning is it's difficult for even
foreign
what we are expecting is you know uh now
there will be few uh uh a meeting that
will uh happen within the NCP and they
will come up with their uh uh a new
party Chief but right now the activists
this is something that uh they were not
expecting rather blood pressure is going
to announce this kind of uh uh you know
his retirement or he he he uh he will
announce so soon that he is going to
step down and that's why the moment he
said so they have reacted like anything
many of them they actually uh uh step in
that uh Auditorium and uh even their
diets as well
urging uh to you know take back this
particular decision and now uh you know
what we are learning is from the
activists itself that you know not to
you know uh take this important decision
or to rely uh to you know announce this
particular decision on the committee of
the party but they want uh uh sarath
pawar himself to you know right now
announce the next east of NCP but it
seems a bit difficult at the moment uh
foreign
to you know take back this decision but
it seems that he has already announced
and he is not going to take back this
decision but uh he has made it clear
that's okay
keep tracking those developments a big
story of course coming in from Mumbai
there sharath pavar announcing he is
going to step down as NCP president my

al-qurishi has been killed in an
operation carried out by turkey's MIT
intelligence agency a Turkish president
uh type Dogan in fact announced on
television that the chief has been
neutralized in Syria this is of course
the latest information that we're
tracking for you from turkey at this
point I'm being joined by our defense
expert major Muhammad Alisha major
Sharna we're talking about in fact a big
win of four uh International
leaders especially as as well as forces
that have been working against
counter-terrorism that have been working
against terrorism now this is a
suspected leader of the Isis that turkey
now says they neutralize
organization so ever since then there
have been a lot of terrorist attacks on
Turkey they I mean recently only if you
say the figure of 300 people dying in
Turkey hundreds of them injured 10 civil
attacks four armed attacks other bombing
so this has been up at it now ever since
then there has been repeated attacks on
turkey and I think any Nation will
actually protect their sovereignty
Integrity their security and beat Any
Nation so what turkey is doing right now
when they say that they claim that they
have the MIT intelligence agencies have
neutralized appu the treated terrorist
leader of uh there is in Syria and the
first time Mr erdogan came out and he
said that's the first thing I'm seeing
right he has been implies and they will
not they will not mention their words
they will go ahead and they will operate
against any terrorists who uh gives a
national security threat anywhere so yes
uh it is uh I would I would say it's a
it's a it's good work well it's I mean
normal work actually I would say it's a
bit but anyone anybody would utilize
terrorists are affecting their National
Security so and it's it so I would say
it's a it's a normal person it's a good
work and normal work as well and it is I
hope and pray that all the other
countries also they take equal action
against terrorists the same way right
absolutely now if we're talking about uh
the terrorists that's been neutralized
right now he was in fact uh chosen as
the leader of the Isis in 2020 uh is
what we're learning and turkey also has
been ensuring that their troops are
present on the ground in Syria uh now
when it comes to neutralizing this
particular leader it does not stop the
Isis from operating their network of
course and choosing another leader to
then go forward and take their
operations forward so what do you think
should be the action to wipe out
terrorism from its roots
it's a very good question in fact very
thoughtful question and I would like to
uh equate it and I would bring it in a
way that everybody was going to
understand this see
Al-Qaeda because then if we talk about
911 Osama Bin Laden everyone connects
with it right so Osama Bin Laden after
killing him they came
was neutralized and now the latest uh
Al-Qaeda leader is a an ex Egyptian
Special Forces officer one left girl he
in fact is said to be residing in Iraq
and operating from there so what
happened when you kill one head ten
heads would be Paul so you kill by
killing Bin Laden did we end the entire
terrorism in the world we did not so
what actually should be the steps to be
taken is the ideology should be wiped
out completely even the ideology wiped
out the youngsters working to the arm
the gun and who want to who who go into
terrorism they should be stopped and how
is that possible that's possible through
education education means I would
commend you the way you are educating
people through your news channel the way
you anchoring it is education it is
getting to them reaching their minds
that what they should be doing they
should not be doing that what they
should be doing is they should be
investing in education in good
activities being a global person so when
you actually convince somebody from the
bottom of the heart that what they are
doing is wrong and that ideology is all
hogwash they are showing them some
dreams of I don't know what right the
life and some nonsense who cares who
cares live your life be good just be a
good human being right so parallel
operations uh security operations as
well as spreading awareness and ensuring
there's no radicalization for more such

now been reported and viewer discretion
is advised to slightly troubling news
which I'm about to read out to you
parents in Pakistan
are now putting padlocks
on the graves of their daughters to
prevent necrophilia
so believe it or not there is a rising
Trend in Pakistan that when a woman dies
there are men
who are digging up the dead bodies to
copulate with them
an example of the photograph
has been put on your screens there that
this is a grave
which has a iron grit and it's locked
now a report says from Pakistan the
necrophilia cases have
gone through the roof
it's a
disturbing
this is to prevent as a repeat to
prevent men from digging up and raping
the dead bodies
very disturbing information
and too much so that this has become a
trend that this is actually requiring
families to protect
the bodies of their daughters from
sexual violence I don't know how quite
to process this or how to communicate
this uh the either
on on how disturbing this is tyrasan
who's an activist here in India joining
us on the broadcast the energy I'm sure
you've read this reports uh ma'am it's
uh how do we process something like this
and the iron bars based on the names of
the women in Pakistan
daughters and women from sexual just
imagine we will not saved even after
death therefore not saved after a death
in Pakistan the sixth State you know
and it's enough
for entire Society or Pakistan to hack
their head in shape you know why they
are not raving why would he ask it what
the what the Dominic is doing no no no
man I you know you know one is voices
and and government but one is you know
this is not from the information that we
are gathering that this is not some
isolated case of you know somebody who
is not mentally sound and is is doing
this this has become a trend uh so this
is something disturbing going on in in
in Pakistan if this is becoming a trend
I mean how do we like I said how do we
process this is a trend not some
isolated random case that you know just
of of some perversion this is a trend
yes
supposed to be Islamic country what kind
of stuff they are preaching why they are
taking action
this type of lecture uh Barbary cash
has been made so far
okay
like that even after death in the
state
what is troubling me more is not just
why is there no law or arrest my what is
troubling me most is that there are a
group of men okay
who are actually
thinking
and planning this because
you're actually having to go to a
kabristan with a shovel
to dig up a coffin
and
copulate with it so this is not some
incidental crime there is not some chain
snatching this is something which has to
be planned and executed
and there is a
mentality involved in this and if it's
an isolated one case that has happened
because there's some lunatic was doing
it but if you have been told this is a

telecast let's quickly take one by one
these survey questions and your
responses by way of the figures and
statistics I'm going to put forth in
front of you the question number one
that we asked of our viewers the
question was what do you think of prime

radio program well a resounding
47.43 percent of you have said that yes
they you find the program to be very
good good at a 24.72 average at 12.82
percent and can't say at
Omega 15.04 percent the next question
that we asked people with regards to
what they thought of monkey but can we
switch the question please what is the
USP or prime minister Narendra modi's
monkey bath so these were the various
options that were given so it's
understandably uh I'm going to read out
all the options because the maximum
number of words that has gotten this
this set of this set of options was
38.85 percent with all of the above so
which are the all of the above options
number one that it brings Limelight it
brings Focus to the unsung heroes and
Builders of our community of our nation
at 2.28 it discusses family and Society
Society related issues at seven point
six two percent it discusses issues
related to the masses and the public is
32.61
it uses prime minister Narendra Modi
uses the informal tone of communication
when he interacts when he communicates
with the people through his monkey bath
at 2.04 and like I said all of the above
38.85 so all these are the reasons why
people have appreciated and listened to
prime minister Narendra modi's and none
of the above 13.30 let's quickly take a
look at the third question in the first
segment of the questions that I asked of
the people the third question is which

initiated by prime minister Narendra
Modi did you like pastely

number of uh topics that have been

Indian Premier League mudha Pratap Singh
the show is powered by dafa news
the big news that has come in from the
IPL is that in the previous encounter
the Kolkata Knight Riders of course will
or rather in the next encounter now the
Kolkata Knight Riders will be taking on
the Gujarat Titans in the 39th game of
the IPL 2023 this match will of course
be taking place today at the Eden
Gardens in Kolkata then I tried as one
three out of eight games the season and
are placed in the seventh place in the
points table one of their three wins of
course came against the Titans by three
wickets so clearly they have done well
in that encounter will they be able to
replicate that today or not is the big
question joining us at this point is
James King Cricket commentator we also
have Sunil gershkalra founder Indian
sports fan live with our sunila Eden
Gardens in Kolkata a delight for sports
fans always isn't it uh how crucial is
this contest particularly for the
Kolkata Knight Riders absolutely this
becomes a very crucial match for the
Kolkata Knight Riders for three reasons
a they've been on a losing streak B
they've got few of the big players on
the bench and third on a strip which
guarantees you 200 runs if you don't
score 230 to 40 while batting first
it'll be a great disaster for Kolkata
Knight Riders I think they're they're
the luck hangs in the in the pendulum
for today's match very crucial yes sir
James King let me uh quickly uh bring
you in here now Gujarat Titans of course
did dominate uh the last season of the
IPL they of course did end up winning it
that was at the inaugural season for
them this time around as well they've
been doing very well of course they may
not be in the top two uh but they
certainly are the favorites to make it
for the playoffs uh do you believe they
are the favorites today or can KKR
emerges underdogs
also anything uh the Titans all the
favorites for today and uh they've only
played the seven games they're one of
four teams on seven games and if they
win today or take them alone to the top
of the table and they just seem to have
the balance right of this season once
again so I'm expecting that they will be
the favorites to take home the points
today as they have performed well as
well at Eden Gardens that previously
yes uh you know just just speaking now
about the X factors for both teams James
who do you believe uh uh will need to
click for a Gujarat Victory as you uh
said which will take them to the top of
the table and uh whom will the Kolkata
team be relying on today
I think it's gonna be interesting to see
uh the the sort of Team selection uh
they put out so some questions as to
whether shipment Gill will actually play
or whether they may go for the Paceman
and the impact player so I was very
Joseph uh potentially in the mix but
unlikely that they'll do that I would
think wanting to put on as many runs as
possible as they do bet first which has
been the uh
prevailing wisdom shall we say this year
at uh Eden Gardens
um so yeah difficult to know sort of
where they're going to potentially uh go
from here it's going to be interesting
to see KKR a lot of their big players
have not really come uh through the last
game against the Titans it was Rinku
Singh who uh hit five sixes of five
deliveries to get them over the line so
it wasn't a done deal by any means up
until that point so it's going to be
interesting and maybe we'll have
something to say Jason Roy at the top of
the order is the Performing you know
decided to perform well in the opening
partnership uh with dragon Easton
starting to actually make some kind of
Headway
okay let me take that to uh Sunil Sunil
X factors according to you for both
teams who's the KKR X Factor who's going
to be the Gujarat X Factor today well
we've seen umeshadow as the consistent
fastballers for KKR he's done a
phenomenal job unfortunately he hasn't
got the wickets but what he's managed to
do is he's managed to control the lined
length and the Rhythm which is very
important and that's where his
experience comes into play where he
bowls in those slow slow Yorkers and
that's what gets them going
if he comes in it'll be really nice for
the for the team because he's he's had
that injury but as far as the the impact
player All Eyes uh will be on Rinku
Singh from the other side and also not
to forget the skipper himself uh you
know pandya hardik has been playing a
great inning and leading it from the
front of course we've got to remember
the other defending champion of the of
of the overall competition last year so
I think they come in as favorites uh
Rinku Singh and pandya from that side
here you will have you may Shadow and
and let's see who comes in in the
batting order that's a that's a crystal
ball gazing for us now you know you
always
because the tournament from the fans
perspective we spoke about Eden Gardens
of course being a Fan's Delight but uh
also not talking about this new rule the
impact player uh that is something that
you know James was mentioning a short
while back as well as to who the impact
player today will be and whether he'd
possibly replace a shubman in opening uh
for Gujarat or not but you know impact
player introduction how are fans reacted
to that and has that livened up the game
uh and you know taken the competition to
a whole new level I think I'll take the
word from you it has livened up the
entire cricketing circles across the
world because here suddenly you don't
have to stick with 11 players you will
get an additional player to come in do
his bit and get out it's like it's like
in in a special appearance in any of the
films so this is a big star who comes in
does his job gets out and doesn't change
the entire composition of the team and
that's what it has done the impact
player I think it is the greatest gift
today I must say from India to the rest
of the cricketing world as we carry on
to the next and a true IPL fashion there
was a new there was a new uh you know
umpire signal as well yes there had to
be device for it which of course we're
we're seeing now and we know it from
from every match uh but just you know
James uh bringing you in here on site
sudarsha now we have seen his form uh
you know uh be uh pretty good in the in
the beginning of the tournament uh but
he has been missing uh in a few of the
games do you believe that's strategic
um do you believe he could possibly be
playing today and and as far as team
selection goes uh do you believe uh that
that it is important to give some
players rest because it is pretty
strenuous uh playing so many matches in
such less time
yeah I think it's important to get the
squad rotation right that's why you've
got a squad obviously I think a lot of
teams rely on the big name players
um and don't necessarily uh bring them
in
um yeah I'll say bring the other players
in so yeah it's going to be interesting
to see but yes I think mix it up a bit
sometimes they can't uh necessarily do
that if they're on a run and those big
players are actually making a massive
contribution so it yeah difficult to see
some of the Fringe players uh getting
into the teams as they head towards the
business end of the tournament
yeah and you know size relation of
course uh you know Sunil has been one of
the new Young entrants who's done very
well and and Kolkata has also seen the
rise of Surya Sharma who of course
entered uh uh suddenly and and has uh
you know performed from from the word go
absolutely this is the platform this is
the place which creates every year four
to five big uh names that we have here
and that's what has happened you've got
Psy two of the other uh players as well
Rinku Singh as James mentioned a while
ago you've got Rinku Singh who comes in
bats down the orders hits five sixes at
a go where do you get such excitement
such uh tantalizing close match going
into the winning part so I think IPL
what it has done it has done three
things a it has given a lot of uh Monies
to the to the to the team and it has
been a good profit and loss statement to
the to the to the team owners B it's got
the reservoir of pool F players it's
huge now India can certainly pick and
choose the thing and third what it has
done immensely is the fan frenzy as
they've done they've innovated they've
got the timeouts they've got the fan
Parks they've got the fan digs and at
the same time what have you got you've
got the impact player so these three
things definitely get into the Mind
heart and soul of a cricket fan
yes it certainly does uh and and just
talking about Varun chakravarti as well
Varun chakravarti you know you were
talking about umeshyada but even
chakravarti has been pretty consistent
in picking up wickets hasn't he
absolutely he's done a good job but he's
been knocking on the doors for past
couple of years unfortunately he hasn't
got one big match winning performance
here what do you need if you need to
stamp and cement your name in the IPL
you've got to make that Rinku Singh kind
of an impact you've got to take three
wickets five wickets at one go only to
be making yourself be heard known or
being taken seriously unfortunately
Varun chakravarti has been there but
still not there okay well well uh before
we wrap up you know I just want to talk
a bit about Delhi and Hyderabad which
also will be happening today uh that is
the second contest of course for the day
daily uh playing Hyderabad let's quickly
talk about that the Delhi capitals of
course has uh not been performing well
at all however suddenly uh you know they
have had a couple of wins uh you know in
in the tournament thanks to of course
David Warner's uh Captain C David
Warner's consistent form he's really
been the driving force uh for this team
not much else is working really for the
Delhi capitals uh is it uh James King
how do you uh you know how are you
anticipating that that contest between
the Delhi capitals and also Sunrise is
Hyderabad who are also pretty much at
the bottom of the table
um you know the fact is that even SRH
has a good side on paper but nothing's
really clicked on ground
no it hasn't had it they've really both
been struggling and that you say both
teams have got the names on paper but
they have to perform so yeah it almost
is a battle for The Wooden Spoon at the
moment and uh you know whoever gets
through on this one one sense is that
the other team is going to remain
lagging behind and he's not really in
with any chance of getting through to
the playoffs so yeah it I know I mean
it's time for the guys to really get out
there and perform you've had a couple of
Hit and Miss performances if you could
call it that from some of the guys that
have come in I mean Harry Brookville
salt both now opening the battling for
their respective teams and these two
Englishmen have a really uh not been
consistent enough for their teams that
you know the big names that have come in
as I said before not turn necessarily
making things happen for them and uh so
yes let's see how this one plan turns
out I'm not sure how this one is going
to work out I would think that uh
sunrises that for me perhaps have the
edge in terms of their all-round balance
but let's uh find out who's going to be
potentially in the mixer okay so
sunrises at the end recording too but
Anything Could Happen uh Sunil and a lot
will depend on Harry Brook you know
Harry Brook uh uh is is one of the uh
you know I think he is he's one of the
few ones to score a century I think just
two individuals have scored a century so
far in this season of the IPL uh Harry
was one of them but uh it's been a bit
of a hit and miss since that uh so
depends on what he can do today prithvi
sure a lot of concern for prithvi show
uh we even played today is the big
question you know in this in the last
six games if he's managed to score 47
runs what do you do as a perennial
delhiwala I would say it breaks my heart
to see this dismal performance from the
team I mean they've changed the
ownership they've changed the skipper
coaches support staff everything that
they've managed to do they did
unfortunately what do you think you will
still get Delhi languishing at the last
two seats and that's that's been
happening for the past one decade again
I think the problem with the team I
think they've got to get their vastu
right and if not the cricketing thing
right absolutely you know the other day
I I had gone to see the Delhi capitals
versus the Kolkata Knight Riders at the
stadium live I was sitting there
watching the match and you know I I was
so happy when Delhi managed to get
Kolkata out for 120 odd runs but then
they struggled to even make that Target
absolutely that's the that's the that's
a poor form that currently that he finds
itself in but you know just just talking
about the Arundel Italy Stadium as well
where the match will be happening today
uh you know as you said Dilli walas love
Cricket yes uh they've disappointed of
course with how the Delhi capital is
performing so far but they've been
turning out uh you know in huge numbers
every game to to watch them at the
stadium I think I think it's a festival
of cricket stadium has been giving them
good ambience good good entry and Arena
and everything put together the entire
surround sound is good unfortunately you
will find a contrasting situation from
Kolkata because Kolkata you have a strip
which is a 230 240 plus here you will
get the first team playing will barely
score 160 which means that it's going to
be a low scoring match the duo is going
to come into play that there will be
some spin it's a short boundary I think
the most of the catches that happen
happen at the boundary itself but but
one thing is for sure that Delhi hasn't
been able to perform and that breaks our
heart in fact they've mastered the art
of creating or getting losses from the
jaws of Victory and they've managed to
snatch that few often times yes
absolutely let me just quickly talk
about now last night's contest well
yesterday we of course did see uh
Lucknow defeat Punjab uh you know superb
win for uh the Lucknow supergiants
defeating
by 56 runs let's just talk a bit about
that Lucknow uh you know also trying to
get back in and have a pretty good shot
at the playoffs uh despite K Raul's
erratic form
um you know he is managing uh his team
to to still be in the Reckoning isn't it
James
yeah it's indeed and a lot of talk about
his performances uh prior to the win
yesterday and uh you know that
incredible second high score ever in in
the IPL and uh on a pitch that normally
you wouldn't expect to see that kind of
score so you know you know if you look
at uh Punjab King getting a 200 in in
reply not a bad tote but can you you
know it was just incredible the hitting
in the middle order and perhaps for uh
you know be being a bit presumptuous
here but maybe kale role getting out of
it early wasn't a bad thing or like now

his resignation after controversy about
role in arranging loan for former prime
minister of United Kingdom Boris Johnson
sharp resigned over involvement in
securing a private credit line for up to
uh 990 000 for the then PM Boris Johnson
from a Canadian businessman an
independent report probing the
allegations found that sharp reached
rules for public appointments in
relation to a loan for then prime
minister Boris Johnson Richard Sharp has
been accused of helping to arrange the
line of credit for then prime minister
Boris Johnson weeks before he was
appointed to the BBC post on the
government's recommendation the matter
has raised questions about the
broadcasters impartiality
International Affairs expert is uh live
with us rabindra embarrassment coming in
there for the BBC uh with its top
executive having to step down in this
manner
thank you so much sir yeah certainly
embarrassment and not only an
embarrassment I think a hit on the BBC's
credibility uh also coming along with
this basically what it conveys as you
very aptly you know summarize uh sharp
was appointed as chairman of the BBC uh
before his appointment He's by the way a
conservative supporter he is a friend of
Boris Johnson okay and Boris Johnson was
a prime minister then for his personal
reasons whatever he needed some money
and sharp introduced Boris Johnson to a
Canadian businessman for a loan of about
I think 800 000 pounds now later on
shark was you know appointed because
there were due process they were 23 or
some names out of which you know Shah
became the chairman what it indicates
and you know the cloud or the shadow it
cars is that you know are there or were
their favors being exchanged right and
that you helped the prime minister to
get a purse alone and later on when it
comes he pays you back and gets you to
be the chairman of the BBC
this has come further into Focus because
you see a few months ago this Sports
journalist Gary lineker
right he criticized some of the
immigration policy of the conservatives
now okay Sonic is the prime minister but
sunnak has this whole stop the boat uh
campaign or initiative right to prevent
the immigrants so Gary lineker
criticized that and said that it
reminded him some time of Nazi Germany
and all
due to his this comment which was on
social media BBC you know fired him or
relieved him of his job so it came
around that the BBC was towing or
wanting to promote the conservative
party right because you know sharp has
been a supporter he'd helped Boris
Johnson Johnson got in the job
whatever so I mean basically bottom line
being that it brings into question uh
the fact that BBC uh can be influenced
by its political Masters and or BBC at
times carries stories or you know
removes stories which are inimical to
the political Masters as and when it
wants so that's a pretty pretty sad
commentary on institution like the BBC
is also joining us at this point uh
joita big Scandal there in the UK the
BBC chairman having to resign after a
much embarrassment
[Music]
absolutely what it shows is that you
know it's a cozy Club in the UK in BBC
or whatever whatever establishment
policies are there whatever anything
related to The Establishment in within
the upper class
it's everything about the Cozy Club
where you scratch my back I scratch
yours and the thing is you see I mean
two or three people will decide uh what
exactly they say for example this
particular BBC board is also comprising
some very upfront people a very limited
number of handful people who kind of
give directions to what BBC will be and
and because the BBC has a name they've
been logged over the rest of the world
saying you know we are the uh the Judge
Judy and the Executioner literally in
terms of we have decided so for example
I'm obviously going to talk about India
you know India is going down the drains
India is the worst thing that has
happened possible to the world and all
we and so the rest of the world will
have to believe that dance because this
particular Club has decided that is how
we are going to portray India okay now
the thing is it's it's up to you after
it's a matter of Shame uh the way the
BBC has been functioning I mean apart
from the corruption at that top because
what has happened is absolutely
corruption you know it's apart from
corruption at the top The Rock in the
BBC is right down to the bottom because
if you see their coverage if you see
that the coverage that they have of
every country that they do not like I
mean they are the worst possible people
you see when you look at the way the BBC
covers India apart from we being you
know belonging to some dark ages and
being oppressors and whatnot you know
even our statutory and integrity they do
not
um you know respect I mean if you see
the kind of bad diseases South India is
headless in nearby they will just remove
it so the whole point you see the whole
idea is that you see they don't have any
credibility as journalists whatsoever
and the more such corruption candles
stumble out of the closet whatever
little bit of credibility they could
have possibly had among a particular
section of Their audience that would
have lost I will think of it like this
you know once upon a time even 10 years
for 15 years plus we used to regularly
watch the BBC and we used to think as
gospel truth whatever they were saying
about Iraq for example but they were all
now later gradually gradually we woke up
to the fact that these are all embedded
journalists that they are giving one
side of the story and you know they have
been doing it about India also for
decades now but we never realized this
it's only now that we are realizing we
now have realized and BBC has exposed
successfully because the counter
narrative has grown Once Upon a Time
organizations like the BBC they control
the narrative completely but no longer
true and more such things cases happen
you know we will see credibility if at
all it was left that also will be lost

the process is on it will it is likely
to take about uh three four more days to
get everybody evacuated and our
operation has been successfully very
successfully it is being carried out
so uh this this itself shows the sheer
power that your determination of the
government
hello absolutely it does show
determination of course of of the

every single route available has been
used there are some evacuations which
have happened by sea there are some
which have happened by a Ambassador

there are two our Air Force pilot landed

kalistani movement in United Kingdom is
staggering in its account of how Sikh
extremists are mobilizing gurdwaras to
spread hate and glorify killings in the
name of demanding a separate State this
report by Colin Bloom who is an
independent Faith advisor recommends the
UK government to take action to curb the
spread of the secessionist movement of
the kalistanis in the country the big
question is will UK Government Act Now
Ambassador on The Telecast with me
Ambassador if you've gone through the
Snippets of these report there are
damning and this is exactly what India
has been telling the United Kingdom to
Canada to Australia to the United States
of America and every single point
then takes us to the direction that
strict and Stern action needs to be
taken by the government of the day in
United Kingdom to stop the propagation
of a separate State agenda that has been
pushed forward by these Pro kalistanis
how should we take forth this agenda now
with the UK government
uh thank you very much mikhai I think uh
this is a very important development
there's a very significant development
and I think it gives us more ammunition
more uh Weaponry uh to uh us that we can
approach the British government I think
as far as India is concerned I must tell
you megha that this has been very clear
to us that there is a minority of
elements Fringe elements extremist
elements who are using the umbrella of
the sick Faith the Sikh religion which
is uh very peaceful which is very
benevolent which is very compassionate
to spread this uh
malice amongst the people and you know
like in the case of if you would recall
that there was a similar report I don't
know who the authors were which was uh
brought out by prevent and that was on
Islamic fundamentalism and there also it
said that the British government on
account of political correctness they
would not take any actions against this
because otherwise they would be termed
as being you know islamophobic and here
also they are not taking any action
because they think that it you know it
might be misconstrued but this report
has come out very clearly and it is a
very damning report that it is not the
whole sick Community there that is uh
you know involved in all this subversive
activities and all these terrorist
actions it's a very small minority
Community there and that needs to be
identified in action needs to be taken
against those people and I think that
stands true not only for the United
Kingdom but for the other countries
Canada Australia New Zealand the United
States and you know going in the program
I can share my own experience audiences
because I have been in many of these
countries and this is what I have seen
unfortunately that you know the
gurudwaras are being the holy precincts
of the gurdwaras are misused or
misutilized and of course the local
governments need to take action but I
think our sick Brethren also who are
there they also need to take action
because it is their faith that gets a
bad name because
I completely agree with you sir I have
darshan Singh who's joining me on The
Telecast as well darshan you being a
Sikh obviously activities like the ones
that have been initiated by this Pro
kalistani movements whether in America
or Canada or Australia or United Kingdom
for that matter or obviously bring a bad
name bad reputation to the entire Sikh
Community but the report particularly
clarifies that the majority of the Sikh
Community uh is benevolent it's generous
it's it's uh made a significant amount
out of development in terms of the GDP
of the country the economy of the
country so these points are mentioned so
yeah what should be the action plan now
India has already been pressuring United
Kingdom to take strong action how can
further how the further pressure for the
influence be made for UK government to
then take action against these small
group of minorities seek extremists who
are hell-bent on spreading hate and
killing people in the name of religion
well thank you for having me on your
channel uh once more the earlier
gentleman who was speaking just before
me has uh pointed out very correctly
that uh there were uh times when
political correctness was being used by
the politicians not to prosecute anybody
and this was happening in the case of
the grooming gangs that were that were
taking place let me let me highlight one
point which our prime minister Rishi
sonak has just done and he has now
appointed a police force which will
handle uh anything but they will try and
say that it is not political correctness
we are going to prosecute anybody who
does anything wrong in this country so
that that part has gone out now since
last couple of weeks I think when Rishi
appointed the task force a special
police task force to handle any
religious extremism anything that is
being portrayed religiously will be
handled with with no no excuses thereby
people cannot then say Oh we are being
discriminated against or it's our human
right to do this that or the other so
that that's that's gone out of the
window and I'm really pleased that he
has done it now coming to the other side
as as we have all very all know that in
every religion you have a small
percentage who will want to harm who
will want to do things that they want to
do but if we go back in history
um if we look at the Second World War
even Japan they're about 15 to 20
percent of people who wanted to rule the
whole world but they forced the rest to
join them in in Germany it wasn't all
the Germans who wanted to fight the
world but they were put in that position
that they had to fight now I think it is
it's very nice that every government
should eliminate these forces that want
to do certain things right at the
beginning and not let it get to that 10
or 15 or 20 percent because once it hits
that Mark they they start controlling it
they start doing things the recently
something has come up which was also
highlighted with a report uh whereby
Hindu children were being told by the
Muslim children that look your gods are
no good you only only where you'll go
into heaven is if you believe in in our
God and that is being highlighted now
and we are having a big uh debate
regarding that and we're going to handle
it I you know I was we were at the house
of Lords last Friday celebrating visakhi
and we had people from
India who were who were lighted and
in the in the function and everybody was
so so well you know happy with everybody
everybody was congratulating everyone
hugging everyone you know and it we are
we are one and I think that small
element that is there will will have to
be removed and the only way it will
happen is by taking action and I think
the British government has started this
direction makes a very strong point he
says that while there is a concerted
effort by all governments across the
board to stake store an action against
this extremism this is also in history
if you go back there are only a small
percentage of people or eccentrics who
have wanted to cause destruction or
tyranny and they they have then
persuaded a larger percent of the
population to then listen to them abide
by them obey their orders now in such a
situation there was a question that I
asked Colin Bloom who was on The
Telecast with me just a short while ago
talking about extremism and how all it
has its tendency to spread over and
become a terrorist activity and how
important does it become for the UK
government particularly to check its in
check its spread to ensure this
extremism doesn't turn into terrorism
uh well megha when you are talking about
persuading a small percentage or
persuading a larger section to join
their quote unquote cause I mean I don't
think the word persuasion is we can say
that because you see all these people
these are extremists and these are
radicalized people these are brainwashed
people they cannot be equated with the
mainstream but at the same time because
they are radicalized because they are
extremists they are Hooligans and in
certain cases they bear arms they have
arms which and they can actually do
physical harm so it is not persuasion it
is coercion okay and apart from that you
see we are witnessing a lot of infective
anecdotal evidence is anything to go by
that there are many people in the Sikh
community in the United Kingdom who are
saying that their daughters are being
threatened that their families are being
threatened that you know there are these
the young men who roamed the streets
making obscene gestures towards their
children so these people are actually a
huge threat to the community itself and
then to the you know because we live in
India two Indians or to India so what
happens is you see there are two ways of
doing it obviously I mean I think there
needs to be an investigation from within
the community and action to ensure that
these extremist elements are not able to
control the gurdwaras because what
happens once they start controlling the
gurdwaras that is where that becomes the
and that happens in every religion yeah
it is often seen that the places of
worship often are turned into you know
hotbed of radicalization and you see so
this is why the voice must come from the
community within the community I mean
the community has to fight it at one
level and then also so since it's a
major Law and Order problem you have to
involve the authorities also so the
community needs to get the authorities
involved and ensured that the Gurdwara
that the places of worship to start with
are cleansed of such elements because
you see the message needs to be going
down you know just because these people
are taking the cover of religion does
not make them religious they are the
ones who are committing sacrilege okay
and I think this message needs to go
down very strongly because otherwise you
are absolutely right as a report also
talks about right now today they are
extremists they are radicalized tomorrow
they may become terrorists as amritpal
Singh was doing over here he was taking
the Garb of religion he was using the
cloak of religion to I mean propagate a
very toxic ideology and he was also
giving bomb training and all sorts of
making suicide bombers and all so this
thing needs to be nipped in the bud and
it must be done in the UK too I agree
with you lieutenant general kamaljeet
saying there was another important
aspect that Colin Bloom said in the
interview that I just had with him a
short while ago he said that this
extremism this Sikh extremism this
kalistani movement is more rampant
abroad then it is rampant in India and
that's what surprises me surprises the
entire world that if if there is a
demand for a separate State why is it
not coming from within India if that's
the problem that they're facing that's
the quote unquote atrocities that are
facing why is it that Sikhs who are
sitting in Canada or UK or America or
Australia are chanting this chant of
wanting a separate state
firstly thank you for having me on your
show if I was to put it I have said many
times before there is a small
French extremely vocal and extremely
visible visible in terms of symbols
which have been devised for Spiritual
purpose being misused to generate a halo
around their identity so this group
punching much above its weight
and and the report points out that the
map that is being shown
doesn't correspond to entire Punjab it
only looks at Punjab on our side doesn't
include yeah on the other side yeah the
port also says and and to answer your
questions straight these people want to
find some relevance some place in the
society so they they you know everybody
can't be Ajay Banga so if you can't be
Ajay banga then deliver in that way so
you do these kind of activities take
control of religious Place start and see
there is a competitive extremism which
which starts taking shape of a domino
effect yeah one one strand treating the
another extremist Trend and another
thing that that report points out
interestingly is
that engagement of these people by
parliamentary committees and others and
we have this challenge we have this MP
like Desi who's there so these people
are legitimizing this this thing and
it's happening in you're right it's
something it doesn't have you've seen
when he was apprehended nobody came out
in his support yeah there is no
grassroot support in India for this
cause but in these countries it's been
kept alive for what bank politics for uh
they are taking control of funds of
those religious places and to find and
relevance in the society Mega that to me
seems to be the agenda of these people
and good I complement calling Bloom for
this report it's very well highlights
that these people are indulging in
violence intimidation
bullying harassment he has used all
these terms yeah so time government
agencies act on this Mega yeah
absolutely Commander arinder Singh get
into the conversation and tell me that
it's also very important integral in
fact to find out where the funding comes
from how is it that these tiny small
minority group of people who are
radicals who are extremists who are
fundamentalists being able to so
meticulously spread their agenda and not
just in small pockets of a country uh
there they are living uh as they did
this country is not even theirs they
have traveled far and wide to live over
there they are perhaps first generation
second generation third generation
Americans or British or Australians or
Canadians but they have been so deeply
entrenched into the system by way of
funding that is coming in that they have
been able to spread their propaganda in
such a massive way so where is the money
pouring in from
hi so we are we we don't have to
ReDiscover the wheel it's it's already
there it's already existing the models
the the planning the the ideas the
Machinery how it will work
on 5th of May next month a film is
coming out it's I have seen the premiere
it's called the Kerala Story how as much
as as many as 30 000 plus Hindu women
from Kerala were forced
Hindu woman were forced to to go to
Syria and become their brides and and
and and served their purpose and what
have you and many of them have come back
but they are neither here nor there yeah
well that's very model with minor
changes is being spread and spent
everywhere how did kalistan vote this
kalistan word was coined long time ago
but where did where did it take take
really the become the Catalyst what did
become the Catalyst the Operation Blue
Star rarely speaking and and the 84
Carnage was one where six went overseas
and took Asylum and then Pakistan
realized that they cannot kill sex they
cannot handle six so might as well put
them in their side and that is how this
entire thing started
and then we have some politicians in our
country first of all the fault lies at
home
uh some some one family one particular
family Sikh family who's in political
family heritatory they think that is
that that private uh religion they they
had what they what what they call the
the programs
I like you to keep your camera at a
little bit of a distance because we're
not able to see your face and that is
causing us a little bit of trouble yeah
yeah I I think you'll have to keep your
keep your phone or smartphone or
whichever device that you are talking
through a little at a little bit of a
distance so that we can see you
boats and ancient side Pages were burnt
and uh those protesting Seated on
protest they were killed and nothing
happened to them committee after
committee
that is the power that this small little
group enjoys where they have the money
backing money backing from anywhere
money backing from overseas reticles
overseas money Canadian funds it's a
public domain knowledge but we have done
nothing about
okay okay
about the fact that the communities
of Sikhs the majority of them who are
living overseas they will also have to
bring about a Crackdown to ensure that
the voices the same voices of the c
community are heard and this radicalized
youth do not brainwash others into
creating this kalistani movement that
that then might gain more traction and
become even larger manage to fight
against
no absolutely I think you're very right
and now uh especially now in the United
Kingdom and I'm sure as we've been
talking about it's in the and I'm sure
the agency is there the security the Law
and Order agencies the intelligence
agencies they are aware as to who are
the people who are behind it but maybe
you know for their own purposes they
don't do it but uh I think now the
majority of these communities you know
whether it is uh as the gentleman was
also talking about this Hindu phobia you
know how the children are being
tormented in schools yeah so I think all
these communities have to take
responsibility into their own plans and
they have to work with the government so
you know meaning they will not be seen
as if they are going against their own
Community they are not going against
their own people they are not going
against their own religion but basically
they are going to protect the sanctity
of their religion and the people and you
know you asked about the money also I
think it is very very clear that the
money one of the biggest sources of
funding is the isi and you know that is
uh it becomes obvious when you see that
it is only the Indian part of Punjab
which is supposed to be a part of
kalistan and it is not the uh not the
Pakistan side of Punjab so obviously the
funding is coming from there so whether
it is the Islamic fundamentalist it is
the so-called kashmiri militants it is
the Sikh kalistani militants who are
being supported it is funding is coming
very much from the Isis there would be
others also but the last point in this
the local communities you know I have
seen
that particularly as far as the
gurdwaras are concerned they really
become tens of drugs of
people who have come there without
visas illegal migrants they are the ones
who are staying there and there is this
very small group that's you know manages
to get control over these gurdwaras so
this is uh the reputation of the
religion per se of the people of the
community that gets very adversely yeah
okay okay strong points strong points
over there and darshan Singh we talk
about politicization there was a mention
of taranjeet things that they see he
keeps spreading malicious agendas with
regards to the khalistani movement there
are several other politicians in fact
there is a government that has been
brought forth in Canada which has
Coalition as a number of kalistani
infested politicians that have then
given in support to the tour government
how how do we disengage politicization
so that politicians don't become Pawns
of these kalistani movements that then
again engage their agenda on a larger
level
is concerned he has spoken up once or
twice but he raises more of the Kashmir
issue rather than the Punjab issue and
then partly he will link and say a
similar thing is happening to the Sikhs
but he he doesn't 100 speak about
kalistan in the British Parliament I've
never heard him do that okay as far as
Canada is concerned there are a few
elements that are that are there there
are a few bad politicians of Sikhs who
are there in Canada who promote that
Sikhs are being persecuted in India but
then there are other Sikh politicians in
Canada who are not who are telling them
look this is not true
so there's a bit of um neither here nor
there but Tracy doesn't have much of a
voice nobody nobody pays any attention
majority of the politics will listen to
him and then say okay you know but
nothing more fair enough I'm short of
time quickly getting a response from you
uh now would the United Kingdom
Government Act would it be forced to act
now that such a damning report has come
out well I would expect the richest
government to be doing something about
it but at the same time I I mean there
is a possibility that a labor government
could be coming in the next election the
general election what happens after that
frankly all bets are off because if you
look at the kind of rhetoric that labor
has been practicing a lot of it and if
you think of Jeremy corbyn I mean he was
kind of uh patronizing he was he was the
patron saint of all the anti-india
forces that are functioning in Britain
so I wonder even if 10 percent or 20
percent of that has rubbed off the labor
party and if they come to government
next year I mean next time whenever the
election is held I wonder what's going
to happen so I'm not going to speculate
on that so let us hope this government
take some action and then the labor
government if it comes I mean fingers
crossed okay okay
it's interesting to note that a report
on this matter has come out in United
Kingdom why not in Canada which is which
is where this kalistani movement
actually grew
see uh basically
Canada the Electoral politics are more
dominant there this element has got
greatest thing and greater control on
certain number of seats so that
manifests into
uh you know some kind of compliant
behavior and part of parties to
accommodate after all we see both Bank
politics in our country also but what I
would go back to that theme that you
were taking
but an internal report has come a report
which is detailed has come after four
years of study 21 000 respondents
but secondly
we have flagged the issue the pm has
spoken to their pm and thirdly
in diplomacy we have an ambassador here
satyanar he would be able to tell us
better it's all quit Proco
so if the if our high commission there
was a problem so British High
Commissioner in Delhi his security has
been given yeah you do consideration has
been taken yeah so so britishers are not
foolish people they would know India
means business and it will be sensible
whichever party comes to park they must
realize
that India is not going to accept it and
why should we accept it absolutely why
should we accept God okay fair enough
all right I'm completely out of time I
thank my panelists for joining me on The
Telecast and a very important message
that goes out to the kalistani movement
that is taking shape in the United
States of America in United Kingdom in
Canada in Australia well Stern action is
anticipated from the UK government from
a prime minister Rishi sunak with
regards to this damning report that has
now come out to that shows the world
what the kalistani agenda is up to for

darshan is set to campaign in Kolar and
Bengaluru rural areas of Karnataka for
the upcoming election
there is no doubt of the Southern Stars
Karnataka stars that have been lined up
for by the BJP BJP leaving no stone
unturned to
are these actors and stars going to be
able to do the trick for the BJP to
Garner support of the people
in the run-up to the May 10th election
in Karnataka is a million dollar
question but uh
BJP is a
all out in its campaigning mode
visuals on your screens of
deep as well as darshan who has now been
lined up remains to be seen which are
the regions it's being told that he
would be campaigning in Kolar and in
Bengaluru rural areas of Karnataka these
are important significant regions
constituencies where BJP is looking to
build its stronghold against the
Congress and the JDS
interesting development this time around
there are actors and stars that have
been lined up by the BJP first it was
kiccha sudeep and now it is kannada
acted darshan is this going to help the
BJP rake up votes
uh yes uh you know there have been a lot
of balithas in in active politics also
and our campaigners also in the past
also starting with the very biggest and
brightest star of Bollywood that is Mr
Amitabh Bachchan you know he was part of
the Congress so he had activity campaign
he was a part of the Congress and then
you have had an entire galaxy of stars
who have been either a part of the
Congress or the campaign foreign and uh
you have seen that in the past also
who had nothing to do with politics you
know she suddenly joins the Congress and
she ships to the ships and there are a
lot of things you know where you know
political parties obviously you know
they want to go in more you know you
have this thing of a star campaign you
tell me
um who can be a bigger star campaigner
than Modi ji the BJP obviously you know
they have bgp has the biggest star
campaign to uh in addition they are
taking whoever and whoever is the
possible to convey to the public their
point of view whoever is able to connect
with the public and I think nothing
wrong in it so this is
they're connecting with them putting
across yeah whatever they are there's
nothing wrong of course you can get in
actors star campaigners to campaign for
you but uh the big question will this
allow for conversion uh into votes for
the BJP
you know it's a matter of how you how
well you are able to connect with the
public and how you are able to connect
or convey to them the points that you
want to put across now all said and done
these tasks we do have a power of
drawing the crowds and they are able to
connect to them so the people do listen
to them so and it is not as if the BJP
doesn't have enough of Captain Earth you
know that you know the bbp they don't
leave any stone unturned to make sure
that they have a connect with the
audience so this is an additional I
would say apart from the entire
political star that are campaigning in
Karnataka including the Prime Minister
and in addition to that they have the uh
this is only for them to be able to
connect with the people and convey
whatever they are able to

Chinese counterpart China has now
released the statement
on the meeting between rajnath Singh and
the general the Chinese readout says
that India China border is generally
stable and that the Chinese Minister
asked the Indian side to have a
long-term View Place The Border issue in
an appropriate position in the bilateral
relations and we will of course now take
you across both the
both the statements that have been put
out by India and China and also analyze
them those are visuals on your screens
of the bilateral that has taken place
yesterday a very crucial bilateral but
we in India and China remember viewers
is the first time that the defense
Ministers of both the nations were
meeting in person for a bilateral since
the galwan Clash
on your screens is the Chinese version
of what has happened what the Chinese
claim to have expressed uh to their
Indian counterparts uh generally Shang
Fu pointed out that currently the
situation on the china-india border is
generally stable and that the two sides
have maintained communication through
military and diplomatic channels the two
sides should take a long-term View Place
The Border issue in an appropriate
position in bilateral relations and
promote the transition of the Border
situation to normalized management it is
hoped that the two sides will work
together to continuously enhance Mutual
trust between the two militaries and
make proper contributions to the
development of bilateral relations so
this is what the Chinese have had to say
on their meeting with their Indian
counterparts let's also take our viewers
through what India has said India has
said
that the raksha mantri categorically
conveyed that development of relations
between India and China is premised on
prevalence of peace and Tranquility at
the borders he has added that all the
issues of the LSC need to be dissolved
in accordance with existing bilateral
agreements and commitments he reiterated
that violation of existing agreements
has eroded the entire basis of bilateral
relations and disengagement of the
Border will logically be followed with
de-escalation so this is a very clear
picture of what India has presented to
their Chinese
counterparts Sanjeev shavasa with us on
the broadcast Mr srivastava India there
being very clear that we need
the Border situation to be better that
we need the broader situation to
de-escalate there has to be
disengagement at the border which will
logically be followed by de-escalation
and all of this has to be done in
accordance with our existing bilateral
agreements and commitments China claims
that the Border issue needs to be placed
in an appropriate position
in bilateral relations but also insists
that there has to be now some promotion
of the transition of the Border
situation to normalized management when
the Chinese say this Mr shivasa on the
one hand on the other hand you see uh
several infiltration bids you see the
development of villages along the LSC
along the border you see a lot of
infrastructure pushed by the Chinese on
the side of the Border then you see them
coming and naming several districts of
arunachal Pradesh they're also
conducting a lot of military
exercises in Sri Lanka you have them
setting up a military base another one
in the cocoa islands of Myanmar a lot of
activity going on in the Indian Ocean
how does one then place any trust in
what the Chinese have to say or do we
now speak their language wherein we also
make these claims that we want
normalization of relations so on and so
forth but we continue to do what we have
to do which is develop our own sides of
the border and ensure that the Indian
stamp is large and clear
yes sir
yeah you know uh
India has made its position very clear
uh that uh unless until uh a border
situation uh the various issues on the
border uh gets uh uh get a result uh by
the complete actions On The Ground by
Chinese side there cannot be any uh no
normalization of relationship between
India and China and this new India under
the leadership of prime minister
Narendra Modi has been you know very
consistent and clear on its uh uh policy
that uh obviously we will not uh we
cannot compromise we can never ever
compromise even one one inch of our
territory and uh uh while on the other
side what we are seeing and listening
from the Chinese statement that uh they
are calling the situation on the border
overall stable I think such
terminologies uh will not be acceptable
to India we know know that there are
certain areas
area there is still the unresolved
issues and uh uh until the time that
those issues are resolved till the time
China takes concrete steps to resolve
those issues like what they had done
with regard to galwan Valley apagong so
area uh gogra and Hot Spring areas the
similar kind of axles are required from
the Chinese side uh to resolve those
spending issues then only any further
moment is possible obviously India would
also like to have a long-term view of
India China relationship as the Chinese
side are saying but to have a long-term
view you have to you know first resolve
the existing you know pending issues and
India has made it very clear that uh
till the time you resolve this spending
issues situation and relationship cannot
be normalized and till the time you know
situation gets normalized any long term
some View
and any such you know moves will not be
possible I think it will be in the best
interest of the both the countries India
and China uh if they are able to you
know uh initiate a dialogues for a
proper clear demarcation of lse and that
is a long-term view that is a kind of a
you know permanent solution of the
Border uh uh uh dispute between India
and China but to have a long-term view
to have a broader negotiations on the
various you know uh larger issues you
have to first resolve the existing you
know issues and that that will that will
create a conducive atmosphere and that
will generate trust which is seriously
lacking at this point of time and I
think China will have to build an an
environment of trust first and for to
build the environment of the trust they
will have to show by taking concrete
actions on the ground that they are you
know serious and uh truthful about their
words which they are saying in these
meetings so I think India has made its
position very clear uh devika and I
think uh obviously there is a difference
of a you know views between India and
China but I think India is not going to
budge and India certainly uh uh stay
time in again that you have to just
first resolve these two pending issues
first and then uh any further progress
in India China relationship is possible
any further development and progress in
other sectors of India China
relationship can only be done when the
Border situation is normalized when the
peace and Tranquility prevails on the
lse uh I think China will have to also
give due respect and regard to the
existing protocols you know agreements
commitments those will have been made uh
in previous times I think China will
have to respect that any violation of
those commitments those agreement uh
will you know further detail great
situation that those have been violated
already so I think uh one of these are
in China how what kind of action China
takes on the ground and based on which
only India will move obviously situation
at this point point of time is not
normal for more such videos subscribe to

3QU5JDGB8Zc,Revelations In Bloom&#39;s Report on Khalistani Extremist Activity | NewsX Accesses Report | NewsX,Revelations In Bloom's Report on Khalistani Extremist Activity | NewsX Accesses Report | NewsX To Subscribe our YouTube ...,2023-04-28T06:27:30Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3QU5JDGB8Zc/hqdefault.jpg,"the bloom review report accessed by
newsx has made several alarming
Revelations for the UK we now of course
talk about the actions that have been
sought on kalistanis by India however in
the second part we will be focusing on
the prisoners in UK jails report states
that prisoners in jails in UK are being
converted to Islam and are being
provided protection the new prisoners
and UK are being given the choice of
either converting or getting hurt denial
to identify as a Muslim will lead to
protection
or being denied from the dominant Muslim
yank however let's quickly have a look
at what the report actually States uh
of course some of the revolutions are on
the screens but if you were to have a
closer look at the report itself I'm on
page number 87 which starts dealing with
the an introduction to prisons and faith
in the UK it says that
uh as far as the makeup of the prisons
is concerned a considerable number of
people are in fact Muslim in the in
these prisons so we talk about the
current makeup of the prison population
where it says that the prevalence of
Faith amongst the prisoner groups varies
with 91 percent being foreign Nationals
87 percent of black and minority ethnic
backgrounds and 75 percent of over 50s
all claiming to have a faith
reflecting virus Society the prison
population is increasingly diverse with
a higher representation of minority
Faith groups than before so what this
report States is that today there are
more people of minority Faith groups in
UK prisons than earlier for example this
particularly is notable in the number of
individuals identifying as Muslim in the
prison population of England and Wales
this is what coron Bloom has noted in
his report in 2021 Muslims accounted for
18 of the prison population which was an
eight percent increase from 2022 so in
over two decades about an eight percent
increase has been seen in the Muslim
population in prisons however the Muslim
male prisoner population in London
prisons itself is almost 30 percent
which is considerably higher than the 15
percent in the general London population
as recorded in the 2021 census this
potentially highlights
the prevalence of in prison conversion
so essentially viewers what the author
here is saying that while the population
of male Muslims in London in the city of
London is about 15 the general
population is about 15 percent in the
prisons of London the population of the
Muslim male prisoner is 30 it's almost
double compared to the general
population which is one of the basis for
why the author believes that there is a
large prevalence of in prison conversion
what is it what are the other parts that
the author here has said will quickly
take a look at some of the other key
findings that have been made by Colin
bloom in this particular report he says
there is this reviewer has heard
numerous stories from some of the prison
staff that the phrase convert or get
hurt was commonly used by some Muslim
gangs and copies of the Quran would be
left on the beds of the new prisoners
failure to identify as a Muslim meant
that at best the new prisoner would be
denied protection from the dominant
Muslim gang of that Wing or at worst the
new prisoner would be subjected to
violence and intimidation from that same
gang so this is what has been now
reported in this particular review
religious conversion can certainly
indicate positive influences on a
prisoner's life is what the author notes
but it can also raise concerns when the
rate of in-prison conversions grow
quickly the 2019 Ministry of Justice
report on separating extremist Prisoners
has noted the growing problem of
religious extremism across the prison
estate including aggressive
encouragement of conversions to Islam so
these are some of the key points that
have been found by Colin bloom in his
report he says that there is
a lot of emphasis on aggressive
conversion to Islam and it is done
through various means the phrase convert
or get hurt has been heard by the
reviewer a bunch of times uh the Quran
is sometimes left on the bedsides of new
prisoners and also
he believes that the failure to identify
as a Muslim can only mean two things
that either the prisoner the new
prisoner will be denied some sort of
protection that these Muslim prison
gangs are offering to other Muslim
prisoners or at worst this person this
prisoner can be subjected to violence
intimidation discrimination from these
extremist Muslim gangs in UK prisons
major Mohammed Alisha with us on the
broadcast to take us through his
perspective of this report that has come
on earlier we were discussing khalistani
extremism which has also been
highlighted in this report but another
important aspect that has come out and
has sent alarm Bells is this forced
conversion that is happening in UK
prisons what the author is noting is
that if there are 15 Muslims in the
general population of the city of London
somehow the male Muslim population in
London prisons is about 30 percent so
he's wondering how exactly has this
increase how is how exactly is this jump
taking place and he believes that this
could be a result of forced conversions
and these are the sort of people who
represent some sort of an extremist
ideology that believes that conversion
is the way forward
oh well I don't know if the numbers of
the Muslims which are in the jail over
there is it because of forced conversion
or not that I can't be very sure of but
the very fact that there are so many
Muslims there obviously that they are
over there that side who are indulging
into crime so that's for sure and
secondly regarding before's conversion
the concerned I think today Prophet
Muhammad would have been alive you would
have been a very very unhappy man to see
to see that people how people are trying
to do their Force conversions it's very
very uh unethical wrong and it's morally
and principally very wrong that is not
the way that's just not the way and when
such full or it could be I don't know as
uh this report said I if I think of it
right now at this point of time that how
the numbers of Muslims especially in the
prisons the percentage has increased
it could it could be I don't know but
the very fact that these when as you
brought out that the Quran Sharif is
kept on the bedside I think in if I have
to put in Urdu Oh
by putting it next to it and by asking
any prisoner over there to convert
forcefully
no one can convert anything you have to
believe in our faith that's why it's
called Faith you have to have faith in
it you have to be convinced you have to
have that conviction in that Superior
power whichever it can be Ram it can be
Allah it can be uh it can be Jesus
Christ it can be anything you as long as
you have that Faith you have that
conviction no I mean it is
convert or get hurt that is so
ridiculous it's at the one of the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard
actually
people who indulging in that and I'm
glad that you have got me on the show to
speak to you because I feel if Mohammad
Alisha has to come forward and put in
views across to for whatever it's worth
or whatever two pennies is worth for
people who would be listening and who
would be actually getting influenced
because this is something which has to
be addressed it has to be addressed by
the people from the Muslim Community
they should come forward and then the
people who are indulging in force
conversion that that's a very wrong
thing that they're doing that that gives
a very ignore wrong name to the entire
religion to the entire Community they
should not do that at any cost now the
very fact in the first conversion
happened I don't know if you put
somebody on gunpoint and say get hurt or
convert and the guy says okay to say the
skin he says okay I'll convert and he he
puts his name from uh Tom from uh say
from Cassius to Ali and this is an
example I'm giving you so now whether he
would believe in that Faith or not
whether he would go everywhere
whereas if someone is genuinely
convinced about anything
I'll give you an example like my name is
Muhammad Ali right I'm a boxer as well
so catfish clay converted to Islam he
became Muhammad Ali but that is because
he himself wanted to that's a different
thing all together but the moment you
make it a forced conversion and the
moment you put on gunpoint and you say
Hey you join your converter you get hurt
that is something which needs to be
called out it is the need of the hour
and that is the most ridiculous thing in
fact the figure that you read out
initially if you saw if you observed my
reaction I was like I'm not sure that it
was a result of post conversion or not
but as I'm gradually in a minute while
speaking I realize yes it could be more
certainly a matter of force conversion
which is really really unethical and I
think once again I reiterate the fact
that ad Prophet Muhammad alive today or
had he been had he been there he would
have been a very unhappy man to see
these kind of extremists these islamists
do indulging in such kind of behavior
absolutely while you you know when you
point out that it's good that you are
speaking on this channel there's uh
something to that effect that has has
been noted by the author and the report
as well before we bring in Ambassador
Goya let me just quickly read it out it
says for a generation policy makers in
the media have almost singularly focused
on the threat of islamist extremism and
proportionally it Remains the largest
threat of course the overwhelming
majority of British Muslims do not
condone the values and behaviors of
islamist extremists so the government
must redouble its efforts to ensure
mainstream and peaceful Muslims do not
feel unfairly associated with islamist
extremists the important distinction
between Islam and islamism must form
part of Faith literacy training for all
staff on the public payroll as
recommended in one of the chapters of
this report so this is something major
Shada the author is also taking note of
that when we put out these reports when
it talks about faith-based extremism and
it talks about uh
you know
islamist extremist gangs in UK prisons
or it also talks about a growing
khalistani movement the author has been
careful to note that this is not the
view of the majority and all of us as a
society must act the government has to
do its bit but it's also important for
the rest of the people in society to
actually come out and say once and for
all clear it out that we do not condone
this listen this is not what we were
taught this is not our belief and we
will not allow these extremists to
appropriate our culture our faith
major Shah
absolutely 100 right you know when uh
it's a three years back cover about
three and a half years I would say when
the on uh 14th February 2019 when the
fulama attacks took place and the
casterly and the most cowardly attacks I
would go down in history I would say and
I wrote an open letter to Jesse Muhammad
the terrorist outfit and mentioning
about the fact that you know what
actually Islam preaches and what the
what the understanding of these generals
are extremists these are radicals is
actually which is totally wrong and I
felt if a major Mohammed Alicia doesn't
come forward and give them a bit of
knowledge who else will and similarly as
you rightly brought out the author in
this book where he has mentioned the
percentage of the criminals over there
and the majority of them being from the
Muslim faith from these Islamic Fleet it
is actually it embasses us more than
anything else it actually was I was
feeling rather very very embarrassed
hearing this because this is something
which we and we one ought to but not to
feed it if you remember us about it one
ought to come because I am a very proud
Muslim but I'm even prouder to be an
Indian and I feel that you know when we
do not call out these shorts if people
from the community do not come out and
say
then who as well so it's very important
to come out and to say in UK resistance
it's shocking it's alarming and it's
this is not even India where one can uh
where one section can say
this is happening in UK so it is
something which is far-fetched from here
and it is uh something which actually
needs to be curved immediately with
immediate effect otherwise as you
mentioned the Prisoners the number of
prisoners specially from the Islamic
faith are increasing they will otherwise
increase further more and then how has
it happened again there will be
speculations and guesses that why is it
because people have because of the
forced conversions of what is the actual
reason so this uh I would call it a
criminal issue and I would call it a
something which the law enforcement
agencies must ensure that such a thing
doesn't happen absolutely either way
it's either that more and more Muslims
are going to prison in the UK or they're
getting converted in the prisons it can
either be only those two things and both
in themselves are alarming and for the
Muslim Community in the UK to actually
now
stand up and voice their concerns over
and see what can be done let me bring in
Ambassador goyal as well into the
conversation basketball you've heard
what the report has had to say about
these prison gangs that are operating in
the UK that are forcing people uh
prisoners in fact to convert to Islam by
offering some sort of protection within
the prisons how do you read this report
sir
uh
uh very uh as a government better author
himself expected they are doing
something about which the Muslims the
British Muslims themselves are really
highly concerned and they have requested
their law authorities and their
government to basically be cognizant of
it and take action on this and I think
that is the right way to go about it a
fourth conversion anywhere whether it is
it's okay or in the USA or anywhere in
Europe or in India anywhere any force a
conversion is a matter to be highly is a
highly objectionable matter because a
religion is for something somebody to
practice or personally and it is
entirely his or her children there was
it should be left to the individual
number one any forcible conversion is to
be condemned number one number two uh
the society and the government of that
country where such Force Converses
safely themselves should really act on
it and if the British Muslims are asking
the government to electronic I think
that is a good thing really and lastly
uh unless this forced conversion creates
a security issue or an issue of
international nature for the other
countries it is best which is all by
that country's government itself that is
all I would like to say uh for the tech
being all right okay it should be by by
that government itself but is this
something that then also needs to be
discussed otherwise ambassador goel of
course we do want the government to take
some sort of action but what can we
expect from say uh the British Muslim
Community like major Shah was also
pointing out the time has come to
actually stand up and speak out against
these extremist elements because sooner
rather than later unfortunately the
larger Community has to then bear the
brunt of what some of these people in UK
prisons or on UK streets are up to
time for who to stand up and speak out
are you expecting the people from India
the Hindus from India to stand up and
speak out against post-conversion in the
British State uh the rivers can very
well happen as you know
and when we will that happen we have
serious problems I think we need to
think of all the angles before we really
start becoming jingoistic about this in
this particular case yet if uh the
government the people do not act against
it if that becomes a problem universally
for the globe then yes but
the first step really is for the
government of that country through
economic and let us see what happens
after that let us not become too
jingoistic about this really all right
major shot do you believe that this is
uh
jingoism or India's part
well it may not be jinguism I feel if
the facts in figure than the numbers and
Theta and static statistics have been
brought out and it has been reported and
my credible agency is something to look
into to do a certain kind of a
self-introspection instead of contesting
it and challenging it and by trying to
convince someone that is not the case
and that is uh it is uh people having
biased or whatever because see one can
lie in English one can lie in Urdu one
can lie in Hindi but on bats figures
statistics data I will not lie they will
speak the facts as it is so now if such
facts have come about it's about time to
do a self-introspection and say okay
though I it was shocking to shocking for
me it's very easy for me because
shopping for me to say no no no I don't
believe it this is a wrong report and I
who am I fooling
who am I basically trying to Fool in
that I would be fooling my own selves by
trying to make a world of disbelief of
saying that no I don't really believe
that so rather I should understand it
analyze it to yourself introspection and
try educating people how much ever I can
from my little bit of two militaries of
wisdom that listen guys this is what's
happening in uh UK so let's ensure that
such a thing is cup and it doesn't
spread any further so I would not call
it jinguism only I would
um from only thing from from anywhere I
would not call it I would rather say
it's about time for the for people to
wake up especially the community I would
urge the Muslim Community as well to
please do a self-introspection and
realize what is lacking why what is
happening it's very easy to stand up and
protest and and disagree it's very
simple that's a simple thing to do but
is that the solution
will anything come out of those protests
of of opposing it no one should actually
sit back introspect realize and then act
upon it for more such videos subscribe

Xe3D6hVW1ZQ,UK&#39;s Colin Bloom&#39;s Report on Khalistani Extermist Activities | Demads For Action | NewsX,UK's Colin Bloom's Report on Khalistani Extermist Activities | Demads For Action | NewsX Independent faith advisor Colin Bloom ...,2023-04-28T04:36:47Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xe3D6hVW1ZQ/hqdefault.jpg,"an independent review commissioned by
the British authorities has recommended
that the UK government must investigate
kalistani extremism the report was by
Colin Bloom an independent Faith
engagement advisor who has now suggested
how the government must tackle the
rising issue of kalistan on UK so the
report says that a small extremely vocal
and aggressive minority of British Sikhs
can be described as pro-kalistan
extremists let us now go through this
report and then of course we bring in
some experts to decode what this really
means for the UK which continues to
Grapple with the rise of kalistani
extremists many of whom will remember
responsible for attacking the Indian
High Commission in the UK as well it's
put out our touchpads on the screens for
our viewers this is a report that has
been written by an independent advisor
on faith to the UK government this
report was commissioned
under Boris Johnson and now finally the
findings are here on page number 121 we
talk about seek extremism and
pro-kalistan extremism so the author
begins this report by actually giving a
description of the Sikh community in the
UK the vast majority of British Sikhs
contribute immensely to making the UK
stronger and more balanced Society the
conduct and livelihood of Sikh
communities in many ways a perfect
embodiment of the breast of British
values that are taught in our schools
which is freedom democracy Justice
tolerance and respects
seeks have a strong belief that they are
all one and are equal before God it is
because of this belief in Oneness that
traditional seek teaching explicitly
condemns the caste system strongly
advises against
secretarialism and promotes the quality
of men and women so this is the
description as I said viewers that this
author has put out for the
Sikh community in Britain one of the
defining qualities of British C
communities is the particularly
charitable and hospitable ways that
Sikhs contribute to the wider Community
for example a community kitchen is a
common practice in every Gurdwara notes
the author then of course when we come
further down to page 122 the author
Dives deep into the number of seeks in
the UK they also talk about how the
British Sea Community is one of the
oldest minority communities in the UK
but the first immigration of Sikhs to
the UK was in the 1950s there are
approximately 250 gurdwaras in the UK
with the largest able to accommodate
over 3 000 worshipers the earliest
Gurdwara the Khalsa jata was opened in
1908 in Holland Park in London and is
still in use today so like I said some
of the key attributes of the British
Sikh Community have been noted by Colin
bloom in this report he also says that
despite the overwhelming positive
contribution of the Sikh Community to
our society the evidence Gathering
process for this review has revealed
some key areas of concern within small
pockets of the Sikh community and this
is the area that we will be diving deep
into in the next few minutes this is
what the author of this report says
he talks here on page 123 about his
second concern this first area of
concern he's mentioned is within some
areas of British communities or who will
represent them at official level so this
is the first concern but the second
concern here is something that India has
also been raising to the UK for a very
long time viewers we have been asking
the UK government to take action against
pro-kalistani elements and look into the
rise of kalistani elements on UK soul
and this is precisely what the author
here says as well Colin bloom in his
review to the UK government says the
second concern is the division between
some British Sikh communities which is
caused by an extremist friend ideology
within the pro-kalistan movement which
is a separatist movement seeking to
create a sovereign Homeland for Sikhs in
the Punjab region it is important to
note that the promotion of kalistani
ideals is not itself subversive but the
subversive aggressive and secretarial
actions the subversive aggressive and
secretariant actions of some
pro-kalistan activists and the
subsequent negative effect on the wide
receiver communities should not be
tolerated
and of course the third area of concern
is the activities of some individuals
and organizations that are demonstrably
fueling
secretarianism and anti-muslim certain
sentiments as well as legitimizing
discriminatory and misogynistic Behavior
so this is what the author has said as
far as kalistani extremism on UK soil is
concerned he says propagating hate and
divisions trying to brainwash youth to
cause divisions and hate in India is
really sad some seek extremist groups
are using places of worship to fund or
getting funds under the name of faith
and spearheading hate these types of
organizations shouldn't be allowed to
operate in our great country is what has
been noted by the bloom review itself
the calling for
uh evidence respondent this is what the
bloom review now says I have Colonel JS
sorry with us on the broadcast Mrs sorry
very good morning to you sir
big statement here by the author when he
says that there are several sections
ah of a friend's ideology of the pro
kalistani movement that is currently
operating and it is actually causing
harm to the larger Sikh community and
this shall not be tolerated this is
exactly what India has been asking the
UK government to look into as well when
we say that you must look into kalistani
activity it is also uh you know we are
concerned about the impact this will
have on the wider Sikh community and
that is precisely what this author has
said he is noted very clearly in the
report called sodi that some people are
very small minority but a minority
nonetheless is this extremist Fringe
group now that is operating on UK soil
in the name of kalistan
uh spelled out that the kalistani
elements are using the British soil to
wage a war against India while I welcome
the report at the same time but it is a
delayed report this report should have
been submitted much earlier because we
have seen past about two years there
there has been a immense you know
repeated and regular hatred attacks
whether against India whether against
India or the Hindus it has high times
that the United Kingdom government takes
strong and Stern action on the kalistani
elements who are using the soil of the
United Kingdom to wage a war against
India and to wage a war against humanity
I totally agree with Colin Broome that
such incidents gives the kism a bad name
there is no doubt on that and these two
elements create this stupidities it does
give the religion a bad name it does the
community a bad name out through the
channel request the United Kingdom
government as the first tester in
accroisement of this good
the British government should take
immediate steps to remove his
photographs take strong understand
action on anyone who's supporting this
movement there on the British soil
whether covertly or overtly
I'll just come to you in just a moment
sir because uh on page number 130 of
this particular report if we can
actually put this back on our screens uh
once again column Bloom has further
spoken about what these pro-kalistanians
seek extremist groups are doing uh in
the UK says seek extremists and the
supporters often upload videos and other
materials onto social media platforms
such as YouTube iTunes and Facebook
which contain alarmingly dangerous and
offensive imagery language and
glorification of extremist Behavior
there are videos that incite violence
and hatred towards Muslims Hindus and
even other Sikhs who disagree with the
minority extremist ideology
and his father of course gone on to say
uh in February 2021 Khalsa television
limited with served C communities in the
UK was actually fined 50 000 pounds by
ofcom for failing to comply with
broadcasting rules the channel aired a
music video indirectly calling for
violence including murder and a
discussion program which provided a
platform for views that are mounted to
indirect calls to action that were
likely to encourage or incite crime or
leads to Disorder so this is what is
happening the discussion program was
also had also included a reference to
prescribed terrorist organization Babar
Khalsa which could be taken as
legitimizing and normalizing the aims
and actions in the eyes of the viewer so
this is what is happening as far as seek
extremism is concerned Professor
nalapath a very thorough report by Colin
Bloom who will also be joining us today
evening on the channel to take us
through some of these key pointers what
do you make sir of this report that has
come out
since India has been asking the UK
government to in fact look into
kalistani extremism for a very long time
well first of all I'd like to say that
these elements have nothing to do with
the with the concept of Khalsa or with
Sikhism the reality is the individuals
behind this particular movement are
individuals who are if I am sorry to say
bonded labor of the of those whose who
are basically the the you know the
families of those who are living in the
homes
uh occupying the the industries
occupying the land of billions members
of the Sikh Community who were butchered
who were assaulted whose women were
abused and insulted in a way which I
Can't Describe on television these
individuals who claim to be representing
such a glorious religion are actually
bonded laborers of of these elements
that it is very easy to track the
linkages it's easy to track from their
phone calls it's easy to track from
their business it's easy to track from
their emails and I presume that those
years are there with the United Kingdom
customer police and I presume that some
of them is being shared with Indian
authorities as well so first of all I'd
like to say there is no connect between
these people and Sikhism which is such a
glorious State the second point I want
to make is finally the United Kingdom
has woken up to the fact that you can't
say that you're a democracy and then
allow individuals to function freely in
your country that want to slaughter
democracy in the world's biggest
democracy literally Slaughter I saw that
in Punjab in my own eyes in the late
1980s and the early 1990s what was going
on there and you cannot call yourself a
democracy if you Connie with this kind
of activity or have a blind eye to it I
am delighted that the receipts are not
government is finally taking action it's
action that will benefit not just India
but democracies all over the world and
it will be a lesson to extremists all
over the world that there will be
nowhere to hide previously there
unfortunately there are small patches of
territory even in democracies where
these extremists function in full View
and they get protection in a sense those
patches are now getting reduced because
more and more members of the public are
being aware of the horrors that these
individuals are advocating
with us in this particular report Colin
Bloom has also made certain
recommendations and recommendation
number 16 is for the kalistani movement
he says the government should clearly
Define and investigate extremist
activity and identify where this exists
within the c community taking steps to
develop a more nuanced and comprehensive
understanding of subversive and
secretariants seek extremist activity
the government should ensure that
unacceptable and extremist behaviors are
not
inadvertently legitimized by the
government or parliamentary engagement
the reconsideration of previous
decisions regarding the activity and
legality of certain groups should also
be included this would require improving
Faith literacy across government and
parliamentary State particularly on
Interfaith issues so that the government
can be more Discerning regarding
engagement and representation within the
British see communities this is an
extremely pertinent Point Professor
nalapath given the fact that this author
is now recommending that you need to
take certain steps to clearly Define
what is extremism what as per your
government is then extremism on its soil
given that these groups have been openly
calling for uh violence and
secretarialism and other all sorts of
you know extremist activities these
groups are leading and one now really
needs to sit down and Define what it
means to be extremist on UK soil because
it's this lack of definition that has
allowed several of these groups to
emerge and they continue to flourish in
the UK
well first of all I'd like to point out
that it's excellent that this very this
report has come out and frankly it is
exposing a truth that has been in full
public view for a long time but which
frankly has been ignored by successive
governments and it is with great sadness
that I point out that even individuals
of the stature of Jeremy corbyn who
could be a future Prime Minister of of
of Britain uh the you know he Associates
with individuals who openly call for
violence because sometimes very often in
the English language very often in
recorded statements and I think Mr
Corbin needs to be confronted with the
statements of some of the individuals
that he is meeting some of the groups
that he has been supporting and asked
whether is this the policy of the labor
party to support terrorism to support
violence to support hate based
narratives that that Target particular
communities including members of the c
community who are you know
overwhelmingly moderate just as members
of the Hindu Community or the Muslim or
the Christian communities are the
tragedy is the labor party in its search
for votes has gone after votes which
frankly are poisonous for any Democratic
party to accept in public and sadly the
labor party in Britain has become an
accessory to these violent groups and
their activities in Britain and in other
parts of the world this takeover for
example of places of worship this
barring of place of worship to to people
which is completely opposed to the
tenets of the great seek Faith the great
seek Faith talks about an Open Door it
talks about Hospitality it talks about
shelter these individuals are the exact
opposite they're following the tenants
exactly opposite of this space and
they're following the tenets of their
masters in Ravel Pindi and Islamabad
it's really tragic that you have
especially in the labor party leaders of
the Statue of Jeremy corbyn who are
shutting their eyes to what they are
embracing and frankly one has the right
to ask them Mr Corbin and others like
you do you support you know hate based
violence against a faith especially
groups who are completely peace loving
do you support the activities of
Narcotics and other channels that are
funding some of these groups do you
support you know activities that are
designed to basically give a bad name to
a glorious Faith please do please Mr
Corbin examine the fact examine the
truth and then come to the right
conclusion which is that terror is evil
everywhere
violent against innocence which is is
evil everywhere and please don't be
smudge the name of the labor movement
such a great Movement by your Embrace of
people who are extremists Fanatics and
accessories to Terror
absolutely at the same time Professor
nalapath what action do we now sort of
expect from the UK government you know
this is not some NGO or some independent
uh private company that has now released
this report this report was issued it
was commissioned by Boris Johnson
himself to get a better understanding of
uh how the government must now engage
with people of different faiths in the
UK and this is what this author has
found after years of extensive research
he also mentions that some organizations
for example he's given an example of an
international CQ Federation which was
allegedly responsible for assassinations
bombings and kidnappings and targeting
Hindus moderate Sikhs and Indian
government officials which was
de-prescribed by the UK government in
2016 because this submitted an
application to be removed from the list
of Terror organizations in the UK so
he's given these sort of examples that
okay while Babar Khalsa continues to be
on on the terror list an international
CQ Federation has now been removed from
that same list because of the probe that
was perhaps commissioned by the UK
government and they found them to not be
an extremist organization but what
action do we now expect from the UK
government or from Rishi sunak
let's let's uh supposing there are there
are organizations in India that openly
support Terror activities in the UK I
think the UK government will be
justified in expecting the government of
India to take strong action against them
and prosecute these individuals send
them to prison in in in the worst of
cases that's exactly what any democracy
can expect from any other and I think
that's what the people of India the 1.4
billion people of India have a right to
expect from Britain Britain is looking
at being a close a friend of India okay
in the 21st century and they have
there's a tremendous Outreach to India
well if you're a friend of India you
don't support those who wish to
basically hurt harm India and who
essentially indulge and and support
Mayhem and murder so I think it's the
least that we can expect is a
prosecution of some of these elements so
that the reign of terror that they are
having and I can tell you I have many
friends in Britain who are members of
the very Noble sea community and they
are facing you know there is genuine uh
apprehension that if they come out
against this kind of element they will
be in a sense you know severe
consequences will follow to them and
their families this is happening in
Britain a democracy where people are
being threatened and very openly
threatened sometimes on social media
often in email messaging often in
telephone calls and I think that the
fact that this is happening is a very
poor illustration is a very poor example
to the rest of the world so I think
Britain needs to get its act together
against all forms of Terror including
this kind of Terror which may I add is
being carried out by those who are
getting handouts who are linked with the
very people who are the sons and and and
grandsons of of people who grabbed the
land of innocent Sikh families who did
unspeakable violence against the Sikh
community and the worst thing is they
are talking in the name of one of the
most glorious faith in the world Sikhism

kashmiri pundits in Jammu and Kashmir
and to ensure their Rehabilitation
jnklg Manute Sinha has inaugurated
576 flats for kashmiri Pandit employees
in the valley 336 Flats at KOJA bag in
baramulla and 248 bandipura ganderbal
and shopia were opened for the
beneficiaries while addressing the
inauguration LG Cena promised 2 000 more
flats for kashmiri pundits by the end of
2023 the transit accommodations have
been a long-standing demand of kashmiri
Pandit employees under the PM's package
the demands which gain momentum after
the targeted killings of Rahul Bhatt in
May of 2022 have been heard and
delivered in this broadcast we discuss
what has been done to allow to help the
pundits rehabilitate backed Jammu and
Kashmir and what remains I have with me
on the
broadcaster kashmiri activist we also
have with us
and historian and also Ramesh Rana
kashmiri Pandit will be joining us
shortly if I can begin this conversation
with utpal call Mr call what do you make
of this latest promise that has been
delivered
uh thank you very much for inviting me
for this debate uh let me give you a
perspective of it if you give me two
minutes
you see uh kashmiri pandas left their
home they were forced to leave Kashmir
and we became victims of genocide in
1990 and for 20 years please note for 20
years government of India and German
Kashmir government did nothing and there
was uh no employment package there so
they could not go uh Kashmir pack there
was no system no home no job at all but
it was the direction of the Supreme
Court
and then this PMS package was thought of
they've said that yes we will employ
five first five thousand employees there
but you will have to uh give the bond
that when you go to Kashmir you will
never return from there and all these
people because they need a job they uh
gave uh bought they gave in writing that
we will not come back from Kashmir but
they were simultaneously promised that
they will be given accommodation they
will be given uh accommodation and
thereby they will be posted uh but it
was not true it took them ages to give
them these Transit accommodations and
let me tell you it is only the job it is
only the their employment and it has
nothing to do with the return of
kashmiri pandas to Kashmir that's a
separate issue this issue is only the
job and the accommodation and let me
thank
that at least these five six hundred
Flats have come up but more is needed uh
more than uh 2500 flats are needed for
those kashmiri pundits who are working
under PMS package uh in Kashmir uh in
fact as I told you that it took nearly
10 years
and now these uh
these apartments are ready
okay all right one more one more point
that the government in Kashmir the
previous uh government of National
Conference at PDP they were got
interested that uh kashmiri Wonder
should come back to uh Kashmir and so
they were not allotting the land for
making these Transit accommodations all
right thank you all right Miss call I'll
come back to you Rajan Khanna also with
us on the broadcast Mr Khanna what is
your understanding of now these uh flats
that have been inaugurated 2000 more the
government has promised by the end of
this year will be inaugurated do you
believe that this is perhaps a sound
move towards the rehabilitation of
kashmiri pandits or is there also a
worry that this could maybe also lead to
some sort of ghettoization in Jammu and
Kashmir
see well begun is half done this is a
very good beginning
575 houses have been allotted to the
people 2000 they have promised by the
year end and I sincerely believe uh at
least 10 000 Transit accommodations must
be provided because people want to go
back they want to go back majorly
because of security concerns the main
hindrance is that I tell you one thing
we we made one documentary on Kashmir
that was Heritage of Kashmir we had that
private screening here in Mumbai and uh
there's a kashmiri Pandit Association
the screen date in front of them I tell
you one thing most of the senior people
who are sitting there they said okay
whatever we are you know watching here
we have seen the same the heritage of
kashmiris in Kashmir with our own eyes
but the younger generation which is
sitting over here that they are deprived
of their Heritage and they all of them
are in tears they said and I tell you
very sincerely younger generation you
know they want to go back to the
Homeland the Homeland which was nurtured
by the their ancestor of the entire
culture belongs to them we it's not that
providing the houses only the main
concern is security and security also it
it is it is not only the physical
security or the you know the kind of uh
police security the security has to be
created in the mindset of the people
majority people of uh Kashmir Valley
they have to be basically you know the
one thing has to be put across to them
okay these are the people who who are
the original inhabitants of Kashmir
Valley these are the people who's who's
you know just one generation behind they
thought they were the teachers they were
who taught the you know the forefathers
of uh today's kashmiri people so the the
all these things the sentiment uh
sentimental Bond you know kind of uh
your bonding it has to be recreated over
there one more thing I will tell you uh
narrative making Because unless social
narrative is made security cannot be
provided one particular or one
particular gated community where
wherever the kashmiri pandas are
resettled you know all around the people
unless they they take it to their heart
okay they are our own people security
cannot be provided the basic security is
the Social Security and for that purpose
narrative making I'll tell you while we
were small uh and we used to stay there
in other so all around in our schools
and colleges we used to hear Look
Pakistan Pakistan's one rupees one one
and a half to three of uh India now one
Pakistani you know one Indian Rupee is
equivalent to three and a half rupees
and Pakistan is in completely dual drums
there's no future for that country so
one thing one energy and Sport used to
be there with the Pakistan it has to be
completely shattered like there's no
hope no hope for Pakistan itself and
there's no hope for the people who are
having kind of religions in Pakistan so
that is one thing International
International narrative also has to be
made wherever the radicalism is there
whether that is Syria whether that's in
Libya that is Yemen any country
radicalism you know they have destroyed
the societies they have destroyed the
nation radicalism has no place in uh
value of Kashmir to always YouTube you
know we always say that even the people
the politicians of Kashmir is like
shakes abdullah's family
Umar is there or maybe Farooq is there
or maybe PDT are they people you know
for the political narrative they keep on
uh always chanting one thing kashmirias
insania what is kashmiriat they have to
Define it yes they have to define the
Kashmir unless unless all the kashmiri
pandas who were forcibly evicted from
the valley they are rehabilitated they
are their resettled there there is no
sense of you know talking about
so-called Kashmir period so that is what
is my take about that yeah stay on with
us uh Ramesh Raina also with us on the
broadcast with Serena uh certain points
they're raised by utkar call and Rajan
Khanna but largely they talk about how
it's also time to Summer reclaim the
narrative as far as building flats and
Rehabilitation and providing government
employment as an incentive to go back to
the valley is concerned all of that is
happening but at the same time you also
have to ensure that the Youth of Jammu
and Kashmir they at least have the
correct version of history and not what
is being what has been peddled for the
past four decades
thank you very much for giving me an
opportunity to speak here see uh Kashmir
is a it's a very complex question as far
as kashmiri pundas are concerned a new
generation has been born and brought up
in Kashmir uh when we have been out of
Kashmir and they have no emotional
connectivity with cashmere and it is
this generation which are our
ambassadors and it is this generation
which has to go back to their land of
ancestors but unfortunately there are
few things which we need to note and
which we need to understand
the first very important thing is that
it is a place which is a no minority
place the biggest dilemma with this
place is that the brute majority that is
Muslims of Kashmir are being linked with
the mainstream Muslim minority of India
therefore
they are enjoying the fruits of both as
a majority in Kashmir and as a minority
in India and unfortunately the abject
minority of Kashmir that is kashmiri
pundits are linked with the mainstream
Hindu majority of India therefore
depriving us both as a minority and as a
majority therefore when we talk of
incentives when we talk that what drives
the kashmiri youths kashmiri pundits
youth back to the valley of Kashmir in
that eventuality you need to create a
minority space in Kashmir and that
Minority space which existed before
1990. see unfortunately during these 32
years a lot of changes have taken place
in Kashmir both political both societal
both social both economical and even in
Kashmir a generation has been born and
brought up without knowing who kashmiri
pundits are this generation has only
heard from their parents about kashmiri
pandas they have never had an
opportunity to interact with kashmiri
pundits therefore
today the no minority Concept in Kashmir
has percolated into the all conceivable
areas of the society and quality once
the flats are given to us it is a very
important step and we appreciate and
welcome the government for this step
but is it enough that is what I'm saying
is it enough the root of Rehabilitation
has to be selected and the root of
Rehabilitation obviously lies through
our temples and shrines through the
creation of a legitimate minority space
for kashmiri pundits in the valley of
Kashmir and over and above through
economy that is employment yes and
self-employment schemes that is
understandable but how are you going to
create this legitimate minority space
for kashmiri pandas in the valley and
the prerequisite for that is to consider
an appropriate authority to manage our
temples and shrines in the valley of
Kashmir very recently you must you must
have known that The Honorable algae of
the place had softened information from
all the district heads about the lands
and their properties uh to see uh what
is the current status of those
properties you know there there are
reports that there has been a clanstein
deal about the temple properties which
have been sold by unscrupulous elements
you know temples and shrines they
constitute the living
symbols of Hindu civilization they are
in the valley of Kashmir and
unfortunately their control is beyond
the purview of Kashmir repunders we have
been all along telling the government
for all these 32 years kindly cast
kindly pass a temple and Shrine bill on
the lines of workboard on the lines of
Gurdwara the committee act so that the
administration of these temples and
shrines comes under the control of
kashmiri pandas and it is for the better
pressure it would also act as an
incentive for the kashmiri pandas to
return to that place because I as I said
Return to Kashmir through Temple route
assumes significance now than ever
before first of all we need to demolish
certain theories the biggest theory that
was peddled in early 90s what that
kashmiri pandas were not thrown out by
uh from Kashmir but it was at the behest
of late jaguan who gave them incentives
to uh to to move out of Kashmir he
created tents he created conditions for
kashmiri pandas to live outside Kashmir
so that to show the world look here that
kashmiri pandas were thrown out to serve
the political interests of some people
but unfortunately that theory stands
demolished when Kashmir files were shown
where the true picture of Kashmir was
shown before the world though it was
only five or ten percent what was shown
in Kashmir Kashmir files but the hard
fact of the story is that the whole
thing stood exposed now the number
second move which I expect from the
government which I expect from the local
Society is to ensure that the management
of temples and shrines comes under the
control of kashmiri brothers so that it
acts as a great incentive it acts as a
push you see you have to understand
there has to be some push factor which
will drive kashmiri pundits back to the
valley of Kashmir today we have nothing
we have lost our land the the identity
of any Community you have to understand
religion language and culture it grows
on its own soil but unfortunately we
have been without that soil for all
these 32 years and we have been ensuring
to live as a homogeneous Community
without having land with us okay
therefore it is absolutely important to
have the temples and shrines control
under our kashmiri pundits management
very ensure that is a push factor for
the reversal of this uh migration really
important points there raised by all of
our panelists Ramesh and of course
they're talking about how the temples in
German Kashmir not only need to be
restored but the land must also come
back under the control of kashmiri
pundits something of course similar has
happened as far as the Sharda Pete is
concerned one Temple has been
constructed recently towards that
effortful call
besides of course temples and also like
I said government incentives in terms of
government Employments and government
Flats we also see of course a lot of
other investment that is taking place in
Jammu and Kashmir and that in itself
should now offer is an opportunity not
just for kashmiri pundits but for others
to also go and explore uh Jammu and
Kashmir as a possible option to actually
build your lives
you see uh I totally agree with you
there's a lot of development uh
happening in Kashmir in German Kashmir
and particularly in Kashmir in in
infrastructure in uh tourism in
Horticulture in agriculture in industry
and uh some investment has come from
Middle East also and government of India
is pumping lot of money on uh as I said
on infrastructure and on uh creating
jobs by that and this year it was uh
nearly uh more than two and a half
million tourists have gone to uh Kashmir
and in summer nowadays you cannot get a
room in Kashmir all houseboats are
booking booked
it is totally a different story
[Music]
with most of the points with Dr Ramesh
Rana put it here
we have demanded to the government that
we will return at one place settlement
reason is that we were living in more
than 700 villages in Kashmir there were
we were living nicely I can say uh 35 40
years back there were five kashmiri
important families and there were 500
Muslim families but it was no problems
we were living all doing our hard work
uh children were nicely going to schools
and kashmiri pundas were running
colleges schools institutions hospitals
they were doing all uh
helping Society to develop uh in a nice
way but at the same time terrorism
destroyed it all Islamic Jihad destroyed
this all and we have to control this uh
control and not only control but finish
this uh Islamic Jihadi terrorism which
has destroyed Kashmir and more than 20
30 000 lives have lost we have lost
nearly 450 temples we have lost more
than twenty thousand houses so
government has to come with a special
kind of uh package which we said that
there should be a smart city we can uh
kashmiri pandas are doing well all over
the world there can be investment not
only by the government but kashmiri
pundits can invest themselves
we can create our own infrastructure but
there should be a some kind of dialogue
between the government and the kashmiri
panda Representatives so that we can
talk how we can settle down in Kashmir
permanently peacefully right but what we
are discussing today about the PMS
package that is only transient
accommodation for PM package employees
and
did then they will get retired they will
have to come back to Jammu or Delhi so
there should be a some permanent
settlement thing that is most important
for kashmiri panda Community as our
younger generation will lose interest in
going back because they will settle down
in different parts of India in different
parts of world here Kashmir is our
homeland Kashmir is our birth land and
as Dr ramesha and Mr Khanna said we have
a great heritage heritage of
um
and so we have to
take this Heritage for a whole of
civilizer society because Kashmir is the
founded head of Indian culture and
civilization uh so whatever we say as
Indian culture Heritage Kashmir has the
great contribution in that and that is
to be taught to the younger generation
that is to be taught to the world and
for that government has to have made
make special scheme for return and
revitation at one place settlement in
Kashmir thank you when we talk about
reclaiming The Narrative as you were
also mentioning and when we talk about
educating the youth in terms of you know
how Jammu and Kashmir or the Kashmir
Valley was actually a cradle of
civilization of art of culture of
Education science uh many thousands of
years ago and kashmiri pundits were of
course a very vibrant important
Community a part of that cradle of
civilization
this education has to happen not only in
the valley and not only towards kashmiri
pundits but to the Youth of India as a
whole why is it that we are not being
able to actually educate all of India
about you know the sort of history that
jamun Kashmir actually has
uh you see we have miserably failed on
his history account being my subject I
tell you one thing uh one of the oldest
surviving temple in North India is
shankaracharya Temple how many people
know that how many history books so
light of that in rest of India also I'm
telling you it was it was a first of all
three thousand uh 300 BC it was
constructed by Maharaja gopad uh the
entire shankaracharya original name was
and now you know whenever any tourist
goes there and taxiwala says okay okay
I'll take you to the sake the entire
native has to be changed you are rightly
pointed out not only in the within the
valley but in rest of India also people
should know that is gopadri Hill and
originally temple
shankaracharya temple because
shankaracharya visited that area and uh
it uh
300 years before Christ it was initially
made and
how many people know about the temples
you know people go to Paragon but how
many people go to mamleshwar Temple
there
Boni Temple and patan's Temple
abantipura we have two temples you know
which are lying in Ruins one is
dedicated to God Shiva another one is to
Vishnu so this Heritage has to be taught
uh in our history books
not only ruled Kashmir he rules the
entire North Western area and he was
main mainly instrumental in thwarting
the Arab uh acquisition of our area
because when Muhammad bin qasim came in
712 his his area office was influenced
was restricted to sin and some part of
Multan only who were the people who
stopped Arab from coming till 1000 to
A.D when gajan became these 300 years
who were the people what is thought
about those people to our students
nothing is taught so you know that is
the part of his team which is we should
be let known uh in all the history books
in India now coming back to the question
of Rehabilitation of kashmiri Hindus you
see I I had been I have seen the
Topography of the entire
city and rest on the valley also the
original old areas of habaga renavari
where which was which used to be the
main harbinger of kashmiri pandits and
then the new new areas like
how many people you know the houses are
left with the original owners they were
snatched away from them some were
occupied by the terrorists some other
policies were basically because when the
people left their Homeland they never
knew whether they will be able to come
back or not
nobody knew whether 370 will be
abolished or not so at that time under
under duress these people they were made
unforcibly to sell their property for
peanuts all that property must be
restored that is one thing you know
making Transit houses one one question
but restoration of the property that is
a major question all the all the
property that is the Heritage Property I
will call that has to be restored to all
the Kashmir original kashmiri contests
and that is one thing second thing is as
I told you narrative making is you know
one thing like we we say our politicians
say uh one lakh 25
000 crore rupees are going to be
invested in jnk you know as my
co-speakers they have already made the
point what benefits they are going to
give to kashmiri Pandit Community which
were evicted from the valley so these
all these things have to be tangible you
know they not only not only not only
they have to be rehabited irritated
security has to be created and security
environment has to be created on the
social level all these people they know
like you know so much water has flown
down
we we have to we have to create in the
minds of the people okay our success
story the entire world is talking about
India's success story we are the fifth
largest economy in the world we are
shortly even another five seven years we
are going to be the third largest
economy of the world Kashmir kashmiri
youth I now when I say kashmiri used as
well as Muslims also they have to be the
part of the success story right this
this narrative has to be you know taken
forward okay the important point there
about you about restoration of property
as well and you know it's this is why
it's important to have these
conversations so that we get some real
understanding of what is it that
kashmiri pundits really truly want and
what is it that's lacking on the ground
Ramesh and I'm running out of time but
last question to you we've seen some
attempts in the recent past now to bring
out the truth at least of what happened
in the valley in the 1990s uh what was
the reality but there was a lot of
resistance towards accepting that truth
how do we change that why do you feel
that there is a resistance towards
accepting that truth because until an
unless we accept that okay yes this
happened people were forced to flee
their homes there will be no healing
process to move forward
see we have to remember the example of
South Africa when South Africa was what
it is today they established truth and
Rehab truth commission and this is
exactly what we were talking about truth
commission you have to fix the onus you
have to fix the responsibility on the
people who did it and unfortunately till
day there has been no commission till
date there has been no attempt from the
government any quarter to know who were
the people who were the perpetrators of
genocide on this small hapless Community
please remember in 90s the national
Human Rights Commission of India told in
its judgment there's a landmark judgment
so far in favor of Kashmir dependence
that their Exodus is akin to the
genocide and how things have progressed
thereafter nothing has happened
therefore the most important part of the
story is that we have to take an
initiative both at the political level
at the social level and at all the
considerable areas of the quality to
know what were the factors and ensure
that those factors are reversed you see
the biggest factor that time was that
there was a sweep of fundamentalism
there were slogans from the mosques and
there were preparations even as old as
1986 when our temples and shrines in
another District were vandalized while
raised to the ground so for all these
four five years the preparation was
going on but the people sleeping why
didn't their work why didn't they wake
up to the realities that something
something uh destructive is going to
happen in 1990 because that was a clear
warning and if you read if you read
Jackman's book The Frozen turbulence he
has given data by Data Page by Page word
by word account of what was in store for
kashmiri panda he has described kashmiri
pandas as pigeons in the cage but
unfortunately nothing has happened so
far now if you want to restore the faith
and confidence of kashmiri pundas if you
want that kashmiri pandas should go back
to the value of Cashmere then I said
that the creation of a legitimate
minorities face for kashmiri pandas has
to be there it has to be consistent with
the rest of the country as the
minorities of the India are enjoying
they have a national commission for
minorities well we have nothing if a
national commission for minority if a
minority commission is established in
the state where
the minorities are being defined and I
can tell you a almost 20 to 30 percent
problems would be over because some
institution would be looking after the
Grievances of after the threat
perception after the insecurity of
Kashmir dependence and the value of
Kashmir we are this time politically
orphaned people right there is a
campaign to make us as voters but what
will drive us to the voting booths what
is the incentive of how why why should
we vote for a particular candidate which
we know that is not going to help us
because electoral politics depends on
electoral mathematics well we don't
qualify that we are politically
insignificant at the moment of the
Kashmir we have been made politically
irrelevant to the politics of Kashmir
therefore what is of utmost importance
is that to Define us as minority to
create a minority commission at the
level of the state and to make Kashmir
reporters as partners of this minority
commission so that to give us the
security and remove our threat
perception all right I I thank all of
our pandas some very pertinent points
there
set up a minority commission that has
also been talk now of restoring some of
the properties that belong to kashmiri
pundits
ensuring that the shrines and temples in
German Kashmir go back that you know go
back into the hands of the kashmiri
pundits for more such videos subscribe

help of police in Dubai have located and
alleged
dubai-based drug Smuggler just meet
Singh Hakeem Zada who was accused of
helping Finance the activities of the
band kalistan Liberation Force according
to officials intelligence agencies are
coordinating on the ground in this
matter earlier the national
investigation agency filed a chart sheet
against 11 persons including Hakeem Zada
where he was charged under the IPC
sections of unlawful activities and
prevention act and sections of the
narcotic drugs and psychotropic
Substances Act apart from this akimzada
is linked to harmeet Singh
a pakistan-based klf operative through
the Narco Terror Network so there is a
big Crackdown internationally on the
kalistani network Sanjeev srivasa still
with us on the broadcast Mr shivasava
does this in a way of course also prove
that the kalistani network has managed
to spread its tentacles not just in
countries such as Canada and the UK but
in several other nations across the
world and this will perhaps sooner
rather than later have to be a joint
Global effort to crack down on this
kalistani network
yes yes sir absolutely I think uh this
uh so-called kalistan Liberation force
is based in Pakistan and as you said in
your report that uh uh some harmeet are
saying who is the founder and who is the
uh key person in the in this terrorist
organization is very much there uh on
the Pakistani soil and obviously uh they
are being supported by Pakistan's
intelligence agency and Pakistan's
establishment Pakistan you know uses
narco-terrorism and also as the
instrument of State policy they use a
drug trafficking to finance and fund
various terrorist activities around the
world Pakistan is known for such a acts
of Narco terrorism and in this case too
I think they are using it I uh and uh
also uh this uh Hakim jagah this person
who has been identified and located in
Dubai and I hope he gets arrested a
solar uh if that happens that will be a
very good development as far as the all
cracked down against this Rising
Tendencies of so-called uh you know uh
ideas and thinking and you know that's
what that's what is being done India
under the leadership of prime minister
of Modi carries out this acts under the
zero tolerance approach we have a zero
tolerance approach against terrorism and
against extremism and India is you know
taking strict action against those uh
anyways those who are carrying out
anti-india activities the so-called Pro
kalistani activities and obviously we
are in touch with the Dubai authorities
we are in touch with several governments
around the globe wherever such
activities are going on and we are
asking them urging them to take a take a
strict action I think uh if that arrest
is made of Hakim Jada that will be a
significant development as far as our
actions against you know our so-called
to kalistani activities are concerned
and I think India will relentlessly you
know first uh carry out such activities
because as I said we have a zero
tolerance approach towards our terrorism
to our extremism this new India will not
tolerate yes uh any any such activities
against India is a dead issue that
cannot be revived yes absolutely if they
if they try to do that they will have to
face a Serial consequences of it okay Mr
shavasa see on with us also with us on
the broadcasting our Intel agencies have
managed to locate uh just meet Singh
hakeem's other who has links with the
klf he's been found in Dubai and of
course authorities are now working
whether the by police to locate this man
to understand his whereabouts better
what do you think needs to be done by
India at this point in time given that
there is a growing realization that
these networks the kalistani network is
not just limited to say a Canada or a UK
or in Australia but in several parts of
the world so how do we bring the world
together in terms of cracking down on
the kalistani network before it becomes
a global issue and not just a problem
that's going to stay within India
that's right there because you're
absolutely right it is not a very easy
task it's not limited to Canada
Australia the United Kingdom and America
it is going to because the Middle East
is one of the main uh places where let
me tell you one thing the the uh uh uh
i i i ICI and there are a number of OIC
countries they are all number of them
are building the kalistani movement
though it's not known to us but it is
understood and through Pakistan to Jammu
and Kashmir this network is there the
they're not only funding but the drug
trafficking the small arm trafficking it
goes alongside to finance these are
their activities so there is an immense
amount of wealth which is available with
these kalistani movement and the Middle
East is one of the major places where
you will find that supporter of
Pakistani movement is there so now our
task for the our external Affairs and
Nia becomes very very difficult there's
no doubt about it but it is not
unsurmountable it can be overcome
provided we now make
High commissions and embassies and bring
out this aspect in the anti-terrorist
drive and there are a number of forums
of anti-terrorism and in fact most of
the world bodies have the you know the
the agent to fight the terrorism this
has to be brought up on the books and
these countries must be told specially
friendly countries we have Egypt we have
um Saudi Arabia we have number of other
countries where we can form a group and
then tell them that this this is this
has to be fought together because you
will be surprised these kalistani
movements will also be getting support
from rohania movement in India they will
be getting the support and other
terrorists are cut terrorists operating
in gnk from Pok they all are under one
sympathetic umbrella helping each other
so this aspect we have to make ritual
and that is why it is very essential a
network has to be created and we have to
be more aggressive but let me also tell
you devika whenever we get the news of
drone dropping
arms and drugs next to the Border in
Punjab or jnk why why are we very
interested to know where it has come
from wema should be more interested to
know where is it going who are the
ground parties will come and pick up and
pick it up who are the people who are
collecting it that is what it should
interest more and it is that that will
be the way to kill these people if you
try to kill them from where they take
off you will never get to know where
they are going to come because they'll
change the route next time again come to
this aspect we have to now change our
approach that is very essential we have
got people problems within the country
it is not coming from outside because
there are
receptions available the people with the
receptive mind available within our
country that is why the others are
trying to help them and our economy is
so improving so fast our technology is
improving so fast we are a nice soul to
a lot of Nations who give us a very
smiling service but we are an eyesore
for them and this is a method they try
to get even To Us by creating a false

the
China announced that the defense
minister General Lee shank who will
visit the India and today he has arrived
here uh to attend the SEO defense uh uh
meet uh in Delhi but uh this uh visit it
itself is significant because uh the

the China on that background this
meeting is taking place with the defense
minister of India rajnath Singh and uh
earlier we have seen that today the
defense minister uh rajna Singh has also
had a meeting with the Russian his

Russia and the China relations with
India uh it's this meeting is
significant on this background and we
are learning that the meeting uh which
is going to take place uh in uh Goa as
well uh uh and uh this meeting is very
significant because
the Chinese relations that uh we have
seen a post Corona and uh
uh there are a lot of significance to
this uh particularly meeting because the
last time meeting happened in 2022 2020
and forced that after three years of
meeting is taking place between the
defense minister of India and
counterparts so it has a lot of
significance particularly uh pertaining
to the Border dispute issues uh we have
seen that in ladakh also uh there was a
last meeting which was held in that
meeting also it was decided that there
will be no confrontation particularly uh
in a border line area so particularly
this issue is going to uh discuss
further what we are learning from our
sources and uh you know after almost
three years this meeting is taking place
between the two defense ministers so it
has its own significance and uh
particularly in terms of security of uh
of India this meeting is you know a very
significant uh we are considered thank

forward both the countries
[Music]
relations uh these bilateral uh
Agreements are very uh crucial and
important so certainly uh some of them
will be signed today this is what you

is important because a lot of uh things
pertaining to the security to the Border

provided you know proactive you know
necessary help to those people who are
wherever they were in crisis situation
and in Sudan too we have what we have

Minister Mr murlidharan to visit there
to go there and to over supervise the
entire operation and obviously we had
seen in the case of a previous times too

Ajit pawar last week had said that his
party is ready to stay claim to the
Maharashtra Chief Minister's post at any
point of time instead of waiting for the
2024 general elections rumors about Ajit
pawar's next political move started
gaining rounds after his comments was
seen as being soft on the BJP and chief
ministry's faction though the leader has
clarified that he didn't take any
signature of families regarding the
rumors of joining hands with the BJP
my colleague is joining us this morning
to give us more details about this
vishali if you can hear me
yes good morning good morning vishali
well you know these are claims which
definitely you know can cause some sort
of friction within the party
well absolutely the kind of posters that
are being posted in a different uh parts
of the western Maharashtra uh although
the Ajit pawar had made a clarification
that he has no plans to join hands with
the BJP and he remained with the NCP
till his last breath but the kind of
posters that were posted by uh
sidharashiv workers of the NCP claiming
the ajith pawar will be the next chief
minister Ajit pawar has claimed that uh
that you know it's a uh sometimes the
karyakarta's workers who in the
excitement they express their uh uh you
know the wish that his leader can be a
next chief minister but he has no plan
to do so this is what we are learning
and yesterday he reactivated the same
thing that he will remain with the NCP
uh and he has no plans to become a chief
minister before 2024.
that is the next Assembly Election so
certainly is again reiterated but uh
definitely the kind of uh
the uh statement that are being made by
some of his the followers are again
claiming that his uh he is having the
aspiration to become the chief minister
of Maharashtra and the current chief
minister of Maharashtra is on uh is on
the satara uh for three days the school
and that's why uh there is a buzz within
the state that there is a possibility
this CM could be changed and can be
replaced by the Ajit pawar when the
particularly uh the chief minister of
Maharashtra is on the satara tour for
three days uh in this particular period
this kind of uh posters have been popped
up in the western Maharashtra so
somewhere trying to give up hinted that
both are belongs to the Western
Maharashtra itself

the BBC commissioned a survey in order
to understand the nation's views on
whether they would wish to retain
monarchy in the UK or switch to a
different form of covenants While most
of Britain wishes to keep the monarchy
indifference has been witness amongst
those between the ages of 18 to 24 who
have showcased their favor of
establishing an elected head of state
some of them even stating that they
believe King Charles III is out of touch
with experience of the British public
meanwhile 56 percent of the public
opinion a majority of which includes
people over the age of 50 still remain
in favor of a monarchy Colonel sodi with
this on the broadcast Colonel sodi well
you know there are mixed feelings
ambivalent feelings about whether the
monarchy should be retained or not a lot
of people feel that the concept of kings
and queens is dead there is no need to
call anybody else another human being as
His Highness or herna highness and you
know obviously the the new heads of the
monarchy are obviously out of touch with
what this new age is all about
beneath with each successive this
support which is showing the importance
of monarchy in the United Kingdom it is
being proven again and again that the
you know support for monarchy is
declining and whatever it will support
is there it is in the older generation
because of nostalgic value the younger
generation do not want monarchy and this
poll is yet again a reflection of this
statement well I totally agree with you
that the era of kings and queens is over
every man every woman is equal to each
other everyone wants to work hard and
become the president of prime minister
or another important to you know
function of their country so everyone
deserves an equal chance I think the
United Kingdom should you know see read
between the lines and finish off this
monarchy on their own before there's a

the fact of the matter is that the
world's concern now is Sudan you know
there are also reports coming out that
there have been some biological Labs
that have been found in Sudan which
would perhaps even threaten what the
world is going to carry back from this
war-tone country
that's right vineet I brought this point
earlier that just just a few minutes
back yes biological weapon system and
chemical weapon system store houses
there after the first second world war
even whenever when the British when the
Allied Forces started Landing there and
after the first world war the aspect the
biological system where Storehouse
houses and they were making the
emergency stores out here which still
exist and both the parties were the
fighting factions both are aware of it I
don't say they will use it but question
is somebody who is not under even under
their control may use it for either
radical religious medical reasons or
whether whatever the reason or even
Jihad region or
God knows so many reasons can be
invented this can this is again a very
dangerous aspect and here I think again
I tell you not only United Nations but
into impact the international icj must
get worried the international Committee

because they are teaching ingenua

dangerous weapons wmd which did not Tire

to the entire world
special Affairs expert Mr Sanjeev
shivastav is joining us on the program
to talk more about this Mrs if you can
hear me a very good morning to you
I've been a very good morning to you I
can hear you yes what what is important
about uh you know this is a third
in-person Court Summit according to you
obviously physical presence does make a
lot of difference but Australia uh you
know unlike uh the late 2000 when it was
not really sure about the quad seems to
be catalyzing catalyzing a lot of
initiative here
certainly you know Australia has changed
and uh there was the initial reluctance
in Australian leaderships uh in those
times but now you know since the Chinese
challenges continuously growing China is
attempting to dominate the entire Indo
uh Pacific region including the South
Pacific region which Australia is
obviously very much concerned about you
know the China the kind of pact they
have had with the Solomon Island like
the Nations uh certainly you know China
is posing a lot of challenges uh to
Australia's uh our security architecture
in the in Southern Pacific also if you
look at the Chinese
Australian economic relationship that
has also gone deteriorated after the
covet pandemic or during the Kuwait
pandemic time when the tries got
strained when Australia demanded for an
investigation of the origin of
coronavirus so Australia is very much
you know cleared now that we will have
to deal with this China's challenge
together here along with other
democracies in the endopathic region and
that is why uh and the current
dispensation uh is a very much looking
forward to engaging with the other you
know democracies India United States of
America and Japan uh in the court format
and I think beneath in my assessment
what uh partnership will continue
deepening uh and uh and obviously it
will have a lot of constructive you know
agendas too like a quad has been
participating in the in the covet uh
related issues also climate change
related issues also and but the main you
know concern of the court is that how to
deal with the Chinese challenge
obviously they do not name the China
Challenge but the China is very much
elephant in the room and that is why I
think what countries have been
emphasizing uh time and again that uh
the rules based order of the
indo-pacific region must be protected
the Democratic rules based order cannot
be disrupted by authoritarian China and
that is what any quad countries are very
much committed about and they will
continue uh doing their work and
cooperation uh to ensure that uh freedom
of navigation freedom of oversight in
the endopacific region remain you know
maintained and I think that is what what
countries are going to do in future and
and certainly the kind of a grouping the
court is developing also you know Vinita
I would like to mention here that in his
remarks prime minister Lebanese has also
mentioned that the court uh quad
grouping would also like to have a
partnership with asean with Pacific
island you know a forum as well as the
Indian Ocean Dream Association like
organizations so I think what is
expanding its Horizon and there is idea
of quad plus also uh there there could
be many other countries in who can join
for later in the quad plus format like
the South Korea New Zealand uh Indonesia
uh some countries I think other than you
know you know these four democracies are
showing their interests some European
countries have also shown their interest
to join a court so I think the quad is
going to grow in inside in a scope and I
think that is uh
certainly going to happen in my
assessment because China is becoming
more and more aggressive China is
becoming more assertive they want to
dominate the entire indo-pacific region
they want to rule the world and they
want to impose their authoritarian
values or Democratic Values which
obviously will not be accepted by
Democratic countries and Democratic
countries are coming together uh to deal
with the you know challenge which is
which is being forced to China for the
rules-based order of the indo-pacific
region and that is why I see a very
bright future uh for Quad partnership
this is a third in-person leader Summit
and uh one time they met virtually
during the corona time so I think
overall is this is the fourth leader
Summit uh which is happening and the
Prime Minister Modi is obviously going
there President Biden will be there
prime minister uh will be there so I
think the the prospects for the quad
partnership is uh is becoming Tighter
and brighter uh in times ahead for more

with the recent imposition of a 2.48
million dollar fine by a Pakistan civil
court on China National Petroleum
Corporation for allegedly violating the
contract sign this is again brought
forth the increasing economic mistrust
between the two countries accentuated by
the financial crisis in Pakistan already
many projects under the CPAC like the
main line one Railway line between
Karachi and peshavar and the Karachi
circular Railway have been stored and
have become Financial liabilities
additionally China has reported to
exclude investments in large
infrastructure projects as these
projects are vulnerable to local
politics and Returns on investment are
delayed the difference is though not new
have been kept behind closed doors but
are now intensified
economic relations are suffering between
China and Pakistan
really we've lost that connection there
with Sharad Kohli
let me uh go back to group captain
devnath at this point on this story uh
what do you make sir of this latest
friction point between Pakistan and
China
very surprising Indian from India's
point of view it is a very pleasant
development uh China and Pakistan uh not
being on the common ground is a really
surprising news for uh all of us in
defense and uh in the corridors of power
in North block and South block but but
it appears that finally uh Pakistan
their uh establishment is making up to
the fact that they cannot always blindly
rely upon Chinese authorities Chinese
contractors and Chinese funding to meet
the requirement of a growing Pakistan uh
if under their contract clause in case
there is a provision for putting such a
fine on China then probably Chinese must
honor that uh it is part of all the
contracts that various milestones and
various parameters and envelopes are
laid out while signing a contract uh in
small print of course that in case
contract does not move as per the
aspirations of the
beneficiary then he may put certain kind
of restrictions impositions and finds uh
we'll have to wait and watch uh what
will be China's uh response on this
China is a big game player they are
playing in trillions they believe in
business but hundreds of you know
billions they are not worried about a
fine or two or few million uh dollars a
Chinese uh know that their long-term
strategic objective is to keep Pakistan
in their pocket so probably they will
smile and pay Pakistan this few million
dollars yes
stay with us let me attempt to go back
once again to Sharad Kuli if they can
hear me now shares if you're able to
hear me now uh do you believe that this
will lead to souring of relations
economically between China and Pakistan
they were never meant for uh you know
you know altruistic reasons they were
they were with a very vested interest
and I think the whole world knows about
what China does when it makes a
so-called friendship with the nation so
the Belt Road initiative
this impact it has all turned out to be
a farce we know that I mean the number
of incidents which have happened and now
I think more important is today
pakistanis have started realizing and
they have they have come to know about
the nefarious intentions of Chinese they
you know the kind of boost that has
happened after this cpeg in terms of
bilateral trade if you look at the
numbers they are sharply sharply uh
skewed I mean the Chinese exports to
Pakistan have increased massively
whereas Pakistan they're exports to
China are negligible so I think the
whole of Pakistan now knows that China
was never a friend and China was only
trying to fulfill its own selfish
uh having India as a common enemy or
whatever you know religious and of
course it has its intentions of
expansionism I mean either it wants to
make profits or it wants to expand its
territory so I think that pakistanis the
sooner you know the better it would be
and as far as Pakistan is concerned I
mean it's not even a country to make a
relation with in terms of economy uh
because they have nothing to offer you
see whenever relations between countries
happen they are bilateral but there is
no bilateral aspect in in Pakistani uh
Chinese relation it's only only for the
benefit of China and nothing else for
that matter today for more such videos

elections are on I think the focus is
really on the larger picture the road to
2024 because that is really what all
this is about the bjp's Outreach to the
minorities the Congress of course
gearing up for the big fight the issues
that are being raised in these elections
in the local level will these work at
the national level also will Rahul
Gandhi for instance get to raise adani
in Karnataka and will it work at the
national level uh is development going
to be a big ticket issue the BJP is also
banking on RAM mandir which is going to
you know on the first of January they're
going to open Ram mandir as ramjan bhumi
Temple will that work is Ram janmumi
still an issue with the people these are
the issues that we are going to be
discussing on the show today joining me
is
of course a Congress sympathizer and a
political commentator Shazia elmi from
the BJP also political analyst columnist
and the levitarian is of course all
favorite at Round Table he political
commentator image Guru they'll have
issues that work in the elections let's
just take the big picture uh what are
the issues that you think the Congress
the opposition can raise and make a
click let's not talk about the face
there is Modi and there is nobody else I
mean literally so let's talk about
really the issues that are going to work
I think that you've touched on many
issues but I think that any opposition
party has to focus on issues which the
large mass of people are interested in
the large mass of people would be
interested by 2024 I expect still in the
levels of prices I think that would be
an issue Energy prices will still
continue to rain high so that's going to
be an issue the third issue is I think
that they will people in general will
have expectations that the government
should have given them more jobs in the
public sector or in government jobs
which simply does not exist so I think
that there's one bunch of what I call
the expected issues then there's a bunch
of stuff which is to do with what the
opposition has to fight about about the
things that the government has done
the thing to avoid is trying to be
confrontational about Mr Modi
Mr Modi as prime minister still has
Teflon coating it may be wearing thin
but it's there and that's the worst
thing to try and jump at
so don't make Modi the issue you're
trying to say uh testing don't make Modi
the issue we're talking about faces uh
you know like I don't really want to go
into whether Rahul or Urban or whatever
let's just first focus on the issues
what are the issues that will click the
macro issues so when I heard the lips
speak this is exactly what I'm telling
the Congress exactly go back to him
Karnataka for example is on a platter
for the Congress as of today tough fight
but it's there don't divert to other
issues so don't divert to what the
governor said
focus on the issues and the issues of
India are unemployment economy inflation
unemployment economy inflation
unemployment economy information
just talk on these three and I
completely agree The Honorable prime
minister is by far the tallest leader
but to quote him he has a Teflon coating
don't make it Modi versus somebody you
stick on diseases Mr modi's Achilles
this is this government that he needs is
it will hurt this government they have
no answers for this question they don't
even know their only obsession is where
the fifth largest economy in the world
but you're one like 65 000 suicides you
have two lakh twenty five thousand
people who have really given up their
citizenship and over 10 like people
who've left the country and gone these
are high Network individuals why would
they leave the country the economy is
doing bad there are several several
issues to challenge this government on
and the Mantra should be these three
nothing else don't look here there any
other peripheral issues link it to
economy unemployment and jobs and
opportunity one issue that you could do
politically just to add to it is the
cost census which I completely leave is
very very important for this country's
social justice not as a political issue
for social justice I think that's very
important and that must be these this is
you know we talked about the operation
point of view what are the issues that
you think the BJP would be raising in to
counter these issues and any of these
issues you feel uh will click
so first things first bgp would not be
countering any issues okay bgp has a
very clear narrative setting agenda yeah
so we don't have to fall for other
people's agenda and do counter attacks
we're going to invest
ment dealing with criminals and giving
them a clean uh you know a safety that
definitely is not a priority safety for
Citizens is first not safety for
criminals yes we do not Harbor criminals
they're seeing you're correct uh moving
on to the question that uh Priya you've
been asking is that when it comes to now
here's what is being said is the
leadership is not an issue let's not go
there but the fact is whether you look
at leadership as an issue as in a
government that people want with a
decisive clear leadership that's one the
definitely Advantage BJP but if you look
at all the other issues that are being
that should be talked about as per the
opposition uh you know members whether
it's inflation or the economy or
unemployment now
the statistics are out for everybody to
see we can keep differing on them and be
cantankerous about it but the fact is
that who do people believe will handle
these issues better also becomes an
important uh concern now when you look
at inflation per se if you look at all
other countries right now in the in the
midst of what we're going through the
Russia Ukraine crisis and before that
the pandemic I mean to be and you can I
mean their scene can scoff at it and say
oh fifth largest economy big deal but it
matters that we have been able to Trump
and uh oust UK and have been there and
we are thinking big so the other
audacity of ambition for the country
matters to the people it affects with
the sense of being their belonging that
yes we are going to be part of a system
or ecosystem which is gonna get better
bigger and I think that is the
aspirational quality of uh of a voter
that opposition do not want to see
instead of running down uh India and
Indians by saying that you're capable of
more and will go out there and capture I
think there's also the Imaging and the
the sentiment that is associated with
the Imaging political messaging of PM
that works very well with the people
okay so dilip you know what let's talk
specifics now should the Congress raise
the adani issue will it click with the
masses or is it just something that we
hear in urban India
any story of corruption only works if
there is a person who is a beneficiary
of that and you've got to be able to
show benefit benefit
I don't think that
like the beaufort's issue was raised in
the past the Iran issue does not have
the same ring to it that's what
the second thing I think that
the new India which Shazia referred to
is actually very proud of its winners
you know whether it's the hundreds of
unicorns who we are spoing out or
whether it's the big industrialist
there has been some of take for the
sentiment around
but beyond that if you look beyond that
I don't think uh attacking an individual
industrialist is going to get huge Kudos
that's one second the inability of the
of of any attack of that kind to avoid
making generic you know mother and apple
pie kind of statements about the prime
minister is where the Trap is right if
they were to be able to say fixate you
don't say the banks that might work
because an ordinary man going to a bank
and wanting to get a loan does not get
it that might be an issue that can have
a little bit of uplift but only amongst
certain Ms
medium and small Industries kind of
crowd but that crowd is large and that
crowd has been hurting post covet so you
have a certain sentiment there and then
a corruption charge or a corruption
charge on banks in general might work
so this is one way to handle a darn
issue because they seem I know you've
also been arguing that it's not an issue
that will click unless you mark you know
you convey it in a certain way but your
leadership seeing the Congress
leadership seems very clear that they
want to then Rahul Gandhi is just
fixated on the Iran issue so how should
he then frame it okay don't ignore the
issue but I'm sure it can be framed in a
better way and I know you have a view on
that first of all not in Karnataka not
in the local elections
what Karnataka Pride nandini uh the
Water dispute with Goa the Border
disputed Maharashtra more or less
settled now you're seeing almost firing
between states almost coming to war when
did this happen in the recent history
right these were past histories right we
buried it and Karnataka pride is
extremely important the language now you
have we are the most populous country in
the world but Karnataka Maharashtra
Gujarat Tamil Nadu Kerala population
below the total fertility rate so then
the point is that they are going to lose
out seats in Parliament whereas the
other states that have not kept it about
those are the issues of Karnataka but
only on that like arjun's Arrow focus on
the fish High nothing else in the
national issue if you want to raise a
corporate first I agree with them don't
make corporate individuals because
you're making the corporate bigger
you're you're lowering a legacy parties
A party's Legacy but if you want to
raise it raise it with three or four
issues can we bring in we do want
capitalism but can it be a competitive
capitalism because Monopoly leads to
extortion so lead it be very articulate
in what you're seeing so you address a
specific audience so you address the
other corporates and msmes who are
feeling left out in their ways second
link it to unemployment and joblessness
don't link it to The Honorable prime
minister it does not work because while
people know the BJP is one of the most
corrupt political parties we've seen
that in Karnataka the corruption for
some reason doesn't stick on the Prime
Minister and it doesn't and that's a
reality and as soon as you understand
this reality then you're supposed to
change your attack so while there is an
attack on the on the system it should
not be under prime minister so never
make your battles personal my one more
advice to the Congress is to a larger
don't be a troll party
it's a very important advice and the
reason I'll give you is because party
you can agree or disagree with
jawaharlal nehru you may like or dislike
him the man with an intellectual giant
was a colossal giant he could argue
eloquently the people expected that from
the Congress even the newer generation
so don't be a troll articulate your
position articulate very nicely and
eloquently and people have a natural
Affinity towards the Congress the
Congress does not realize the Affinity
this country has towards it it should
not lose that charger the more or less
you know keep Modi out of the narrative
because you know in terms of individuals
he still stands tall but um in terms of
um for instance satpal Malik's comments
recently has that hurt the party because
nationalism is your Plank and he's
raised questions on the full one attack
would have to elaborate on those and I
don't know how much traction they have
with the masses who think of a prime
minister in a certain way but coming to
the earlier part you know um the days
and I I've remember being a part of it
you know prayer we started our careers
together uh it used to matter this whole
thing of Ambani Dani attacks and if you
see this government if you look at the
welfare economics and you see the LA
bharti or the beneficiaries and they
become primarily a mean constituency
across all religions and scars and also
that kind of stunts or Blends the the
attacks based on caste or or religion
because the Allah bhartis are
beneficiaries of the central government
schemes are huge and they are across the
Spectrum
exactly so and and I think another
important point is that this whole thing
of attacking an industrialist and
linking him to the Prime Minister that
my other colleagues here also talk about
friends here talk about it's it's valid
because you see with the central
government goes if you and I remember
being a part of the and speaking against
the up2 and the corruption yes almost
every Ministry had a scam coming out of
it so at least one thing people know
that prime minister central government
none of this Karnataka is a
I would not agree with it but of course
we're on opposite sides now I moving
further
um one is the whole thing of who are our
voters and second is you talk about
personal attacks you see today if you
look at the opposition we will think of
Rahul Gandhi obviously and what is Rahul
Gandhi doing 2019 to and now 24.
there has had to be an unconditional
apology
the same Rahul Gandhi turns around and
says no I am no Veer savarkar I mean
whatever that means
but there is an apology there already
for everybody to see so that's one and
the same personal and you know where did
how did how did that work out how did it
pan out it's for everybody to see look
at ahmadmi party look at kejriwal the
constant attacks on the Prime Minister
direct attacks so I don't know whether
that helps so much because you have to
then
um Modi ji must come across to the
people as somebody the others relate to
or the way they relate to Modi ji as
their leader okay so I think the whole
the point of view of beneficiaries is is
important here and uh just throwing
charges without having to substantiate
them not waiting for Supreme Court
report I think it's it's it's it's it's
not been a very uh mature campaign
campaign but uh you know to come back to
my way she began with the Anna movement
did the UPA make a mistake because the
Sonia Gandhi you know she has her with
the standard she was taking a
resignation from ministers even you know
before the charges were proved where
there is
ETC was that later on in retrospect in
terms of branding was that a mistake
because that immediately said there DMK
the 2G scam now they've been given a
clean was that politically a smart
move or was that because that gave them
the plank that this is a corrupt
government
you know I think that it's always
possible to have a 2020 view on history
but at that point of time um
it worked only for one reason that the
general church about corruption was at a
high level nothing to do with the BJP or
to do with the Anna movement the the
facts were coming out media was free and
open RTI
and RTI was a new weapon which people
were you know using very well so I think
that um
you know jump into conclusions as the as
a
as a kind of Coalition leader is not a
good good thing and I don't think it
will happen in the future because also
don't forget that the country has got
inoculated by a lot of this so now our
thing is
[Laughter]
okay we're gonna take a break and come
back and take a look at some of the
other issues that are being raised in
terms of politics in terms of by the
government and the opposition's
reactions to it but after a quick break
foreign
round table today we are discussing the
road to 2024 of course taking a look at
the current elections in Karnataka but
the larger picture as to what are the
issues that will click with the people
what are the issues the opposition can
raise because as Sharjah just said also
and I think all of us agree that
targeting the prime minister is not
going to really cut to it so you have to
find issues that really click which will
have a wider appear and give the
opposition their own narrative I think
they seem instead of taking you know a
negative narrative against the
government say what you stand for but
before that I want to also ask you a
question on the issue of the minority
question the BJP is I've noticed in the
last few and so have you I'm sure it's
not that you know while they're not
giving tickets to Muslim candidates but
they are there is a reach out to the
minorities we saw them going to church
on Easter we saw them the Prime Minister
gave up the Padma motion to a Muslim
leader to um
Muslims they want to outreach so is
there a slight um is the BJP playing
appeasement politics no I don't think
the bgp spring appeasement politics what
I think is I think what the Prime
Minister realizes is that economy is is
is is is a troubled area for him he does
know that and you cannot have the
economy growing if you don't have rule
of law 1 and 2 if you have unrest in
society so I think for I think the bjp's
thinking is more economical and that
would lead to political dividends is my
thinking of how I see it now that
suddenly they have developed love for
Muslims or suddenly they are developed I
think they are agnostic on that region I
think it's just more to do with
political Advantage not wired directly
but because of economical reasons so
that's Point number one but I want to go
back on before I come to what the
Congress should do to something with
dinner which for the first time on this
show I disagree with oh I think the
Congress was absolutely
ill-advised and I don't think this is
Mrs Gandhi I think it was the other
people around her I know it wasn't Amber
Patel to take these resignations okay
Ashwini Kumar was the law minister of
the country director prosecution CBI was
underneath him the affidavit had to go
to the honorable Supreme Court law
Minister
changes you took his resignation for
that
Ashok chavan
so I think some of the rules
and you never put your Lok Sabha in jail
for what and nothing came out of it so
so you put Lok Sabha MPS allies MPS in
jail for what because the Anna and Dolan
was making noise and most of those
people today we know are not credible of
course has gone to BJP and finally she
is a credible one but the rest of them
so it's terrible that you listen to a
bunch of people who are creating Anarchy
so I think not hindsight I think that
was very bad political Thinking by those
around who thought that if there was
there was divisions in the Congress so I
don't want to go into that too much but
look at how the bgps Maya kodani she's
protected
he's protect these are people accused of
murder
ever take a resignation so you have to
understand this so the third point
the Congress and the BJP and I've said
this before on your show imagine two
restaurants at lunchtime one
restaurant's called BJP one restaurant's
called Congress then the BJP you have a
buffy whether you like it or no you know
the star Chef is Narendra Modi ji the
sous chef is
serve you g to NP nirmala Sita ramanji
will serve you the economy and Modi
Jesus Tasha if you made like or dislike
the dish you know what you're getting
the Congress restaurant is only saying
at lunchtime the BJP restaurant is bad I
understand that's why I want to come to
your restaurant but who's your star Chef
what is your menu is it a la carte is it
Buffy you unless you don't have specific
issues to tell the country just saying
BJP is bad won't work and people again
I'm saying I have an affinity for the
Congress so be very specific and
articulate on how you will be different
from their dishes how your economy dish
is better from
how your nationalism is different from
from theirs how your foreign approach
will be different from
and you will see traction so you have to
have positive impact not just negative
and seeing this is a bad restaurant I
think that is a very important
difference
no no it's not because most of the
things that Jai shankarji says and with
respect to him is is rhetoric there
aren't specifics and and I think the
congress with Manish devari and shashita
has so much more solutions to offer they
can so if if you have a shadow cabinet
imagine with your Shadow external
affairs minister so Jay shankarji very
articulate he's speaking speaking you
have raghuram Rajan or chidamaramji as a
finance minister and the rimla you can
have that debate the country will Ex be
excited media will pick it up yeah it
will pick it up don't be abusive about
media don't troll media media will
automatically pick it up imagine
what a range of topics so do that and
give the country something
but the messaging is really where the
Congress exclusions
the statue on a very important point I
think
the Congress needs to reinvent the
current politics of the day yes and one
answer is for example the concept of
Shadow cabinets very good point it isn't
um it isn't rocket science to it's been
invented in many other countries all of
them have it come on you're a democracy
go and do the same I know that you are
about to ask
um no yeah but as you know they talk
about Shadow cabinets you know I mean
how many Shadow cabinets you want to
have because then we have a set of
Shadow cabinet from the Congress
whatever and then the whole range of
other parties whether it's TMC or it's
SP so that we have one or two one two
three I mean that so it doesn't matter
but I don't think and also I was just
thinking I was just saying it too many
Shadows
the shadow of Finance Minister and TMC
puts amethyst so what they people have a
range of issues idea of the economy you
have chidambam Jesus somewhere there
will be convergence somewhere there'll
be disagreeing that's democracy it's
democracy at its best why not and
debating issues
is also about the I mean the simple
thing of the evm machine and trusting it
and then the results come out primarily
that's how you know prime minister
talked about secularism as I wanted to
ask you that yeah prime minister is very
clear about this the secularism and I'm
part of the national executive so I've
heard it not just once I mean this time
that the news of the Muslim Outreach has
gone far but he's doing it now
this thing we've been talking about it
and it's been there for many years now
it's not just in this executive meeting
I've been part of so many Executives and
it's always been said so this time it
became news but the fact is that 80 of
Muslim the population uh they are
pasmanda voters they are from there is
no caste system in the religion per se
but Muslims in India do practice it so
there is a cause abandon pranali here
amongst them and 80 are those who are
not sheikhs mughals or Sayers and that
itself is a and they are the poorest the
most backward so when you reach out to
the most backward on the basis of
economic status it matters
socio-economic backwardness the entire
uh the entire premise of community-based
reservations or cars based was to
address the economic backwardness so if
you look at it as actually
legalistically correct also and
politically correct obviously but we
don't know what is politically correct
anymore but the fact is that uh at the
end of the day a beneficiary or Allah
bharti of any government state center
BJP Congress bjd rjd SP
TMC up what have you would want to say
how is my life any better so and I think
it can be so that said so whether it's a
Hindu or a Muslim or a gujjar or a jat
or a swaran or a dalit it's got to be
better than what it was before but maybe
that is governance just one second so
it's not about the religious so that's
what you said I mean kudos to you please
ask you one thing one thing Karnataka
why did it cancel the benefits for the
Muslims and then you went to Supreme
Court and say no no we are not going to
do it why did you do it in Karnataka no
no it because
there is also provision for Muslims in
ew in the economic weak sections and
that is the only place you know this is
the hypocrisy there is a hypocrisy of uh
congress party
going further Salman khurshid promise
reservations
say that there has to be a
religion-based reservations for Muslims
before the elections and then say it's
not actually possible as per the law
okay
and I think when a party like BJP uh uh
and it's the only party which has
actually talked about reservations based
on the economic status it takes into
account many more Muslims that even the
five person would do because in terms
get delivered into a final word back to
what he was and he was saying also the
communication with the Congress that's
also you know messenger but also how you
convey the message do you find the
Congress is faulting on that
yes I find the Congress faulting on that
um and I am taking
um what the scene said very seriously
that you cannot be a party of trolls but
you've got to be a smart party you got
to be a party that hijacks Trends you
got to be a party which looks at what
the listening tools are telling you I'm
I'm sometimes appalled if the listening
tools which are available free on the
net are used you know which issues are
getting fraction if the issue is not
getting traction change shower come back
with a new one you cannot do this the
point is that Communications must be
shown of ego it's got nothing to do with
a leader or a boss you've got to test
and then rinse and then
recast very well said I think there's a
good takeaways over here as to not just
the issues that have to be raised but
the way they have to be raised also if
the opposition really needs to get us
act together before 2024 I mean if there
is this it's already some people are
already giving the election to the BJP
then where is the democracy and all this
where's the fun in the elections so
we're hoping the opposition does get his
act together and gives us a good fight
and there is an election that we all can
report and enjoy reporting but thank you

witnessed two explosions which leveled
the building at least 12 people have
been killed in the explosions out of
which most are police officers this
incident comes in the wake of Terror

as well meanwhile senior Pakistani

is no evidence of a terror attack and

Pakistan in the past couple of weeks
this is another one such a such attack
even though the authorities there are
denying any Terror links how do you view
these developments coming out of
Pakistan
all right we seem to be having some
connectivity issue with me sorry take
that question
gauri uh on October 11 2011 that then
U.S Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
during a visit to Pakistan had said he
snakes in your backyard remember one day
they will bite you too where uh exactly
that has happened these very snakes
called terrorists whom Pakistan had been
giving a lot of support and training are
now fighting that very Pakistan which
spread them so Pakistan is learning the
lesson the Hard Way But the irony of the
whole situation is in spite of all this
it's support for various terrorist
organizations still continues the tarike
Taliban is the most biggest problem
which is facing Pakistan because it
threatens to break Pakistan into four
separate countries Pakistan has to
change its policies until unless it
doesn't mean these Terror attacks will
keep on continuing uh and one last point
I would like to make though the police
of Pakistan has said that this latest
there are that this latest explosion in
the SWAT Valley is due to electrical
failure I have my doubts on them this is
another terror attack by tarike Taliban
Pakistan the only difference is at this
time the Pakistani establishment is not
giving it the real color because it is
under immense pressure domestically as
it has failed to curb terrorism within
its own soil for more such videos

Kelly School of Business and were

what do you make of these two bodies of
Indian students that have been recovered

investigation into the uh uh I mean into
the whole episode so one has to wait you

investigation unless the reports out I'm
not very sure if the report is out
already yes I do know that it was a few
days ago in fact I have we have a few
friends out there in Indiana who are
posting on Facebook that you know two
local students have disappeared if
anyone has any knowledge please let us
know that was a few days back when they
went missing and then yes this news of
the two being you know found is sad

forbid they could be Foul Play also but

take a look at the global kalistani
Network and how the anti-india Brigade
goes about trying to bring the country
down abroad another pertinent question
is what are foreign governments doing to
quell this nonsense as we see and have
seen in countries like the USA Canada
and Australia unscrupulous kalistani
elements when things are not going their
way we'll turn on anyone people have
been attacked harassed for voicing
disapproval of Hashem or referendums
across the world how to crack down on
the kalistani agenda worldwide is the
topic of discussion for the next 30
minutes joining us on the show is
former Diplomat also with us on the
program is sudarshan Singh International
Affairs expert he's joining us live from
the UK we also have Mr gurjinder Singh
sidhu Sikh Community leader on the show
with us and last but by no means the
least Mr Sumit peer political
commentator also joins us on the program
I'll begin with you ma'am ma'am you know
for the lack of a better articulation
what we can say is that a menace has
come to an end today but what is the
guarantee that another one will not crop
up and another one will not be propped
up by some support from across the
shores what should be India's policy to
in fact nip this in the bud and make
sure that you know the actual issues of
Punjab are highlighted which is of
course uh the drugs and the unemployment
and a number of other issues which have
plagued Punjab and have been used by
political parties to gain power
I think beneath the most important
guarantee is that this man has been
caught by Punjab police inside Punjab
that the Sikh Community patriotic and
hardworking have rejected his negative
and positive narratives
and that he could not find shelter and
suckers within Punjab he was caught
inside Punjab what does that show it
shows that
the ideology and the narrative that he
tried to bring
at the behest of India's enemies
including the isi
and its external enemies outside in the
west did not work at all because it did
not have the people support the support
of the people of Punjab that is the most
important thing it's not it's not just
what India thinks of Peace what does
Punjab feel Punjab has rejected his
narrative and why has Punjab rejected
his narrative because he went against
the whole history of Punjab what is
Punjab but the creation of the most
patriotic people of India who have
contributed to the national movement
how was Sikhism founded
who are our seeks are we not proud of
them yes we are I am more proud of my
speak brothers and sisters today than
ever I have been because I am glad that
he was arrested and caught in Punjab he
was not it was not in haryana it was not
in Rajasthan it was not in uttar Pradesh
it was not in Delhi it was in Punjab
what message does it give it gives the
message that in a democracy where we
have never pretended that we are a
perfect country how can we after 180
years of colonial rule
we have we have our defects our clothes
which we address ourselves as far as
Punjab is concerned it is a border state
it has always been at the receiving end
of Pakistani terrorism every war that we
have caught with with Pakistan has been
fought on the flat plane of Punjab where
it is so easy for tanks to cross over
this is a whole history that we need to
set right we need to bring development
to Punjab
the government Punjab that has been
voted by its own people that government
is not the same as a center but it is
the wishes of the people of Punjab that
same state government has used with the
cooperation of the center Punjab police
very effectively to catch this
unfortunate traitor to the cause it is
very unfortunate that he did what he did
what was his background a former Lorry
driver in Dubai suddenly becoming a folk
hero moving across
trying to imitate the great gurus all
this wreaks our Sinister plot to
partition and divide us again which we
have rejected and that is the most
important lessons that Punjab and India
draw from it today apart the issues
within Punjab
are that it's diaphor of Punjab who have
left and settled outside
they need to send
much more religious remittances to
Punjab so that its rural infrastructure
can be improved is medical facilities
can be improved so that the Punjabi
diaspora can come back in settle here
right now I remember speaking to the
Sikh Community when I was Ambassador
Netherlands we used to always say Madam
humidity
medical facilities
like it it has been done in Gujarat like
it is being done in Kerala it is like it
has been done in the South with the the
center needs to help but the Punjabi
diaspora also needs to invest once
Punjab becomes a prosperous State all
these issues will automatically die away
but today is an important day and I want
to congratulate gurjit Singh with whom
I've done many programs and darshan
Singh ji and all my other Sikh brothers
and sisters that we have finally been
able to demonstrate that at whether it's
any state in India including Punjab and
my home state Bengal we don't need any
Outsiders we can settle our own problems
ourselves please go home
wash your own dirty linen at home and
look after your own problems leave India
to Indian we are a democracy we will
look after our own people the best way
we can beneath absolutely Sumit peer
coming to you you know this is also a
strong message it's a strong precedent
that has been said that it is not you
know easy for you it's not a cakewalk
for you to come to our country you know
gang up with a few people who have
nothing better to do and start or
replicate a movement you know a a
thorough detailed response has been
provided to uh this particular amritpal
and we are hoping that the government is
going to be keeping a watch on all the
offshoots that might spring up as a
result of you know his brief cameo
thank you very much for having me on
your show today first of all I want to
congratulate the government of Punjab
Punjab police Central forces and Mr
amitsha because it does all of them who
have coordinated and we have got rid of
this Menace this person is a Dabba on
the Sikh Community
because he is just isi student was
cropped up by isi to have you know
trouble in India because after the
samritpal came into picture have gone
silent because he was holding the
Affairs you have listed out the amount
number of crimes which are against this
man and how can this man represent the
great sex of India the Patriotic six of
India the land of gurus the land of Guru
gobinds in the land of Guru take
bahaduri who's called chadra the land of
Guru Gobind Singh who sacrifices World
family look at the qurbanis of gurus all
the sigurus look at the qurbani banda
Singh look at what was on his run to his
son what was zafarnama about what is
about if he would have read the history
not there to do this and what is the
most beautiful participate today if it
was a people's movement you would see
Punjabi you would see crowds of six
across the India on the roads is there
any sick on the road no is there any
sick brothers and sisters supporting him
no is anybody patronizing from him no
only some people in somewhere in Luke UK
or London or here and there may be
having sympathies for him but in India
in all the six of India all the
guddavaras of India all the temples of
India all the six brothers sisters
nobody is uttering a word that means
this was an orchestrated move by the it
was Orchestra move by the isi this was
all being done by ASI he was caught
cropped up by it's only after his wife
got arrested he had no other option but
hand his where wear out support where
Awards came out if he was a patriot by
Indian surrender why did he not work for
India what made him from a taxi driver
with all the list of crimes you
highlighted to become a messiah he's no
he's no Messiah he's nobody today India
has showed we have prevailed today we
have shown State and the central
government can work together and we can
bring into such Menace which exists in
India vineet now look the K2 desk of isi
is active K is khalistan case Kashmir
the moment your Kashmir getting better
they will activate kalistan more and
more khalistan is a ghost kalistan is
the idea of a ghost which manifests in
the mind of isi there's no khalistan in
India it does not exist anywhere and by
the way we have seen the American
government
20 of them were arrested we have seen
action happening in Australia but
unfortunately we've not heard much in UK
and Canada we don't expect anybody
anything much to happen why after the
arrest of 20 people khalistan movement
has died if kalistan was a people's
woman today the whole of India should be
burning and boiling nobody is there I
mean we have patriotic six like uh
darshanji is here gurindaji is here I've
been on various debates with them these
are the sixth of India Guru Gobind Singh
ji Guru nanak Dev ji
maharaji bhagat Singh foreign
[Applause]
army who got the maximum foreign
people like amritwal can keep on coming
and going but India will not fail
Sikhism will not fail Hinduism not fail
our Unity is solid nobody can break our
Unity I am a Hindu vineet and in my Puja
garaya Guru take bhagar's photo because
I know Y is equal to if I am Hindu today
I know what what are the sacrifices Guru
Maharaj has given for the Hinduism if he
would have converted today the picture
would be altogether different there will
be no Hindus possibly the Hindus must
know the sex must know the whole world
must know and Prime Minister Modi made
Point made a point to talk about the
sick Faith he made a point to give the
due respect to the gurus and their
sacrifices that is the greatest of
Sikhism and that is what we are proud of
we are proud of our sick brothers and
sisters and people like Amrit pal will
keep on coming and coming and going
nobody can dismantle peace and Harmony
friend those are six nobody can
dismantle India a handful of these
people can try Isis
but they will fail with they will fail
absolutely great points darshan Singh
International expert is also joining us
from the UK Mr Singh if you can hear me
sir
yeah I can hear you very nicely very
clearly right well you know people who
are in UK and uh who end up supporting
these untoward elements you know perhaps
should not waste their time because they
are in the UK to cultivate and create a
better life for themselves but the big
deal that comes about is when you know
these very Fringe elements are addressed
as Sons or Saints by a few people that
is also a a you know a characteristic
which needs to stop in your opinion uh
how is India made this Beginning by
arresting this man today
I would like to congratulate the Indian
government the Punjab government the
Punjab police and everyone else who has
worked towards
um getting this man under under control
there is now locked up I saw the news
this morning and I was really thrilled
that it has happened it I think it was
long overdue it should have shouldn't
have taken that long but never mind it's
come to come to that as far as UK is
concerned we have not heard any news
from anyone uh making any comments all
the kalistani people who are here in the
UK have all gone quiet they have sort of
they've gone back into their holes or
something until whatever next happens
but we are we are really glad now one
thing was I was listening to his speech
I think which he which was recorded some
sometimes last night at the Gurdwara
where vindrawala was born or the village
was born and he has not mentioned
anywhere khalistan in his in his uh
statement that he has made on on video
it is said that is the video was made in
a Gurdwara but no sanghat was shown no
publication there was one lady who
walked in while the recording was going
on but it wasn't shown as a good garage
or anyone else attending that that get
together so it just shows that he has he
has backed off from his original
statements that he's been making that he
wants kalistan this that another he has
asked young six to give up drugs and and
you know become a sick by taking Amrit
and that that's fine but I'm really glad
that he has not made any statement or no
one else has made any statement
regarding khalistan which is which is
which is a plus point that shows that
these people know that that cannot
happen and Pakistan is although they are
supporting kalistan movement but
they have themselves set and I have got
evidence of that honest on a statement
that some Pakistani made that we are
just inciting the Sikhs but kalistan
will never happen so if that is their
thought then
you know we or other Sikhs who are
fighting for calistan should understand
that this will this is just a uh what
should I say just a dream that will
never come true but on on the others
side you know it's it it's it's great uh
majority of the Sikhs don't follow uh
these people he was a self-proclaimed
leader nobody has elected him nobody
selected him he just decided to follow
you know take up the speeches offline
and use those in his favor
um like sumiti has just said I was also
looking at this news this morning that
they have arrested something like 26 and
some of them are not even American
citizens they still hold Indian
passports and they have uh
um found a lot of ammunition guns and
things which have also been taken to
into custody in the American police by
the American police which is I think is
something that the Indian government
needs to put pressure on foreign
governments
um recently there in the UK at the
Indian High commission they have started
putting up
um fully armed policemen standing
outside the Indian High commission so
that this sort of things don't happen
what happened some time ago and it's
it's I think it's it's a brilliant news
and we need to put the pressure on on
All Foreign governments Indian
government need to do it we can only do
so much uh and we can support our Indian
eye commission here and everywhere else
uh and it's it's good it's brilliant I'm
really glad uh please all six
think think with your mind not with your
hearts
absolutely we don't need kalistan it's
not it's not
absolutely we don't need to be breaking
and we don't even need the idea of
akalistan Mr sidhu and that's exactly
Mrs and that's exactly what the next
Target should be about it's about
killing the idea it's about putting away
the idea not the person
say good evening to all my panelist
friends
and uh
you see if you go back in the history in
1947 Pakistan came into
you know
existence and today what is the position
of the Pakistan
so all six knows that it is not in the
interest of sick Community to be
separate from the
main main country Mainland that's our
India and moreover Hindu six are never
and can never be separated because
Hindus
your 10th Guru was you know he has made
the Khalsa on the sakhi day
and this
situation is like like India
punjabis and our second Brothers they
are Hot Blooded people and this these
people as a
Madam mukri said and Smith said that it
was a you know black spot on the Sikh
history and it was a black uh spot on
the you know meritas
that uh he this kind of people have come
and they cropped in and it is because of
our political you know bills also
because I don't know why some people
have vast interest in there and I don't
know for making government and all this
or making this thing and all this so
they they have such some some sort of
sport they they go lenient they
shouldn't they shouldn't have gone
lenient I I remember one thing the I was
in Malaysia and my sister-in-law her
father was a DSP in the Malaysian police
and she forgot her ID and the guard was
standing on the gate and he said just
show your ID I showed I have shown my
passport and she said I just forgot my
ID at home he stayed away slap ten
dollar uh you know fine on her and I
seen just in the front of his her father
is sitting as a DSP but uh DSP also that
Uncle also told her advice
negligence so this kind of ruling should
be you know there to deal with such
people and I have told these people they
they exploit the hot nature of the six
because now I I request to the
government this is the nature of the sex
they are hot they are Fighters you know
the they they should not be
discriminated on on this nature because
they are Fighters and like the sun they
fought uh on the because somebody has
misguided I should I feel that this uh
the sun rules but whatever was made by
the central government they would have
much beneficial to the farmers but it
somewhere it was misunderstood and
farmers were sitting for more than one
year on the Delhi border and they they
fought very strongly and until the Prime
Minister have not assured them that we
will take it back and prime minister
committed that we we somewhere we we
could not explain you how it is right so
like that yeah on on on this issue the
people of Punjab should not be
discriminated and I request to the
government they should develop
Industries they should develop the
educational institute proper education
institutes and like previously we have
raised this sgpc now they they are
having more you know funds than the
Punjab government and they are doing
really not too much they should have
done today people are converting to
christianism because poor people they
they are really not very today our
Punjab is suffering very badly whatever
gurus have preached they Guru ramak said
we all all are equal and we have to
recognize it everybody and today you
know gurudwara is also are divided
somebody say it is
somebody say it is
somebody says it's foreign
they should work very sincerely and
today the the like uh I I raised this
issue and they have just opened one a
small Institute in Mohali and uh for
that IIs IPS and NDA and all but right
so that's that's what we are talking
about here so that's the progress that
you know we need to talk about though
the initiatives are the ones that we
need to talk about we've run out of time
but this is definitely a great day in
terms of uh you know idolizing the right
people and basically also sending out a
message that you know these these
divisive tactics necessarily will not
land you too far from the jail for more

at the spot in bimbargali in Jammu and
kashmir's punch where five soldiers lost
their lives in the terror attack on the
20th of April meanwhile the prime the
prime of AC investigation suggests the
role of at least seven lushkarita about
terrorists
defense expert General Acres of art is
joining us on the program to talk more
about this General Savage this is
definitely a handy work of somebody and
someone and a state that we continue to
talk about this Menace of the government
feels the central is uh well as you know
the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir
that it is not possible without local
help
no doubt we need there is okay in fact
the two terrorist groups are involved
both Jesse movement and also lusteritova
the coordination has been done by the
isi the people uh anti-fascist Forum
which is offshoot of Jesse Mohammad and
and both have planned now you see this
bullets which have been there they are
those hardcore steel bullets which can
penetrate to the two two in fact two to
three inch of
so these are made in China these are now
given through Pakistan come to Earth so
the question comes is that there is a
total handiwork of Pakistan isai and
this is what they are coordinating if
the K2 plan Aid just to create a problem
both in Kashmir and also in Punjab as a
Kalisa movement now they are
coordinating both of this the main issue
which we need to say is that all these
actions are taking place also feed
Punjab they know in north of Punjab the
peace is prevailing of the security
forces have eliminated majority of the
terrorists hardly 40 to 50 regular
territory left
off now their focus is
because this area one is that there was
a peace and Tranquility earlier second
thing is that the security forces are
not to that extent as much in north of
field Punjab third thing is that yes the
snow does not take place so much so
there are passes are already open and
infiltration can take place the area is
gently forested and it is in
continuation with
Pakistan so very easy for the terrorists
to infiltrate and exfiltrate and also
there is a sports system available the
ecosystem which is there we must
understand that there are overground
water and sleeper cells which are
functioning so therefore this is all
coordinated by Pakistan isi though we
are having a ceasefire on the line of
control but put on that the 27 Launchpad
are opposite to rajouri points which are
already active and there are 10 000
Muhammad
start sitting in training area and
launch pad waiting for the direction to
infiltrate in in India and these are
equipped with the modern weapon which
were left by Americans in afghanita so a
situation is very critical Pakistan may
be in a financial condition uh which is
very bad or economic condition political
instability Taliban Pakistan becoming
gold and they are on Awards of financial
crisis yet they will not leave this they
will keep on sending the terrorists they
will like the India to bleed three
thousand such also the point comes with
Pakistan Army and political uh Masters
in Pakistan are not on same page now the
issue is when Bilal Bhutto is coming now
for SEO meeting in the first week of May
in Goa at the same time this has
happened because the Pakistan isi and
Pakistan Army does not want below to
come because they don't want the
relation to improve between India
if you can hear me
yes I can right well we are talking
about punch and how the people who are
responsible uh for this dastardly attack
need to be brought to books
they have launched a massive searches in
the nearby area where the incident took
place and uh you know uh other than that
we have seen that how even Union
committee is continuously uh monitoring
the investigation as well Nia a team was
sent from Delhi as well as from the
Jammu and two teams were camping in uh
rajouri uh in punch for last three days
and uh and as the bomb uh explosive and
latest team is also here in uh to
investigate it further that what kind of
weapon and uh explosive was used because
in that Heavy Rain how vehicle caught
fire that was another challenge for the
authorities to investigate so that's why
not only the Nia explosives at sports
but also from the NSC uh you know the
special analyst team they they were
there so the Manchester police and other
agencies they are continuously working
to investigate it and
put the German Kashmir police they are
working jointly uh to uh find out the
Terrace those who are still hiding in
this area our sources uh says that uh
you know there is possibility that some
uh one to two terrorists those who were
hiding in this area and it's one uh to
two terrorists uh you know those who are
personally infiltrated two points from
the line of control they uh might be
behind this attack in uh and about three
to four taxes they basically were hiding
inside a uh you know a little Bridge uh
at that spot where that vehicle was
attacked and immediately after they have
seen the moment of the vehicle they came
out of the road and they started opening
fire fire was open from the two side uh
both the side of the roads and then uh
multiple grenade for you know lost by
that there is inside the vehicle and

how its impacts are being felt in
Ukraine he said in high court few
countries after growing tried to exert

U.S and now China and China will

U.S and China are fighting making
Ukraine a pawn let's listen in to what
he just said

this could you please explain to our

say
um
[Music]

[Music]
all right I'm also being joined by Sumit
peer on the broadcast Sumit peer is a
political commentator sir what is your
take on this what is your reaction to
this
uh bam good afternoon well this is a
very uh it's a very good statement by Dr
Mohan bhagwati uh look you know they're
aware countries who got the opportunity
you know there was a time Russia was on
the top they tried to have their stature
around the world Americans had tried to
add Japanese right uh China China was
India has emerged and India has grown in
stature at size and economically
militarily in all spheres of influence
India's fear has grown but India is not
trying to you know push it since India
is not trying to push its selfish
interest and selfish agenda also but
India is talking about
India is talking about the Global
Leadership India is talking about this
Global South which has 80 percent of the
countries and 80 percent of the world's
population so when even in G20 we are
trying to give platforms to all
countries to represent we have given
medicines we have given uh it's secure
we have given our current platforms we
have given our softwares we are we are
helping African countries to get out of
debt perhaps our currency is now working
in around 20 countries which is almost
confirmed so the India's approach to
power is different it is not I want to
run my agenda I want to run my stats and
I want to push myself as interest but we
are taking the world together that is
what sanathan teaches us that is what
Hinduism is about so this change in
approach is what world is witnessing
today and if you see some of the data
statements with some African leaders
have given to you know macro Mr macron
and Madame kamla Harris in reply of that
they are they are they are kind of you
know validating what this bhagavat is
saying what Dr bhagwat do you saying
that you know you people have exploited
us you have made us colonies I mean
African leaders were killed wealth was
looted
but when it comes to India we are
helping them with credit lines we are
giving them medicine that today in whole
of Africa and the Indian medicine is the
Lifesaver HIV is eliminated uh almost
are controlled in the world is because
of the Indian medicines now we are
exporting medicines to more than 203
countries you know solar food basket of
the world Pharmacy of the world we're
extending our banking services our upis
in 30 countries so the Indians Indian
approach and the sanatani approach to
power is altogether different it is not
try to have its own hegemony and control
things and control people here we are
trying to help people enable people and
even bhagavadi mentions about Sri Lanka
though Sri Lanka was close to China and
Pakistan have is closed China now if you
look at the Sri Lankan debt the Chinese
debt is the one which has killed Sri
Lanka which has literally got Sri Lanka
where they were now out of all the
countries in the world who extended the
credit line who helped in the IMA
bailout even if Sri Lanka is Bangladesh
it is
who send medicines petrol basil
essential Commodities us who help in the
state to for a stable government to come
to power as and Sri Lankans have thanked
us for that so it is not we are trying
to take advantage of anybody's misery it
is not we are trying to use opportunity
to get territory or it's not we are
trying to use opportunity to increase
our influence or to have those
india-controlled puppet regimes there no
we are enabling the people who are
enabling them and the best thing about
India is we are not giving loans at the
eight percent ten percent interest for
China use but we are giving credit lines
which help people to come up which help
people to stand on their own doors which
helps the countries to regenerate and
get back into action so it's a different
approach to the world world economics
and world power when India is in power
Russia was in power on America or
Chinese or Japanese they they miss this
opportunity nobody talked about the
global South we are the only countries
talking about the global South this is
the approach in power taking everybody
together
is reiterating this is why India is
different this is why India is making a
difference in the global affairs for

adityanath is set to perform the
jalabhishek of ramlala with the water
from 155 rivers of different countries
including Uzbekistan Pakistan and China
amongst others the water is brought from
countries around the world and will have
stickers bearing the flags of those
countries their names and the names of
the rivers from where the water
originates
envoys of many countries will also
participate in the program
so what we're getting to know in the
latest is that uttar Pradesh chief
minister Yogi adityanath is set to
perform the Jal Abhishek of ram Lala
with water it's from 155 rivers from
different countries across the world I
have my colleague Abhishek with me on
the broadcast

ground of this taking place you can see
devotees flocking in uh to get the water
from across different countries in fact

lots of enthusiasm on ground over there
as you can see viewers my colleague
Abhishek interacting with the devotees
flocking out there Meanwhile we're also
being joined by Rahul ishwar who's a
Hindu activist so thank you for joining
us on the broadcast I want to ask you
that water from 155 countries is coming
in for the Jal Abhishek of the ram Lala
what sort of message does this put does
this highlight the vasudeva could become
message of the world is one family
absolutely Jai Shri RAM and it is a
momentous occasion where India's culture
and civilizational values is being
celebrated and it is a great privilege
to let people know that bhagavan sriram
is not only the most revered person in
India the largest Hindu majority Nation
but also in the largest Muslim majority
Indonesia Ram is a common culture of the
entire humanity and sriram ought to be
celebrated and everyone in the world
agrees that sriram was born in ayodhya
and in respect for that the ancient
Island had named their Capital ayutthya
before they moved it to Bangkok so
sriram is a universal figure you know he
was called Imam hind by Poets like
Muhammad Iqbal so when vijal Abhishek is
happening and people from nearly 150
plus nations are coming it's a
celebration of the oldest civilization
on the face of the Earth it is a
celebration of one of the earliest
avatars that we have seen and it is a
celebration of Mahatma Gandhi's Rama
rajya too because gandhiji said he wants
India to be
all of us
so I'd like to pose another question to
you
um as you said it's an occasion to
celebrate
um you know the universality and the
values that are being inculcated through
our ancient culture uh apart from this
uh you know there are Waters that are
coming in even from countries such as
France uh such as Ukraine Russia Canada
uh it's also coming in from Pakistan and
China so what sort of message do you
think that this gives to the world
she rightly pointed out earlier gives
the great message that world is one
family that in spite of all the
diversity we can be United in our
Harmony pluralism and India is showing
the way for it India is right now
heading the G20 we are rightly pointed
out to be the mother of democracy so
Indian and Indian values and our we are
the ancient most civilization which is
still existing there are other
civilization like Egyptian the Sumerian
which has perished but Indian
civilization still exists as a living
entity and bhagavan sriram bhagavan SRI
Krishna are two of the most oldest
symbols of our thriving civilization
they are still in the hearts and minds
of the people in the blood veins of the
nation so when people from other nations
are coming learning ayurveda learning
yoga learning about Indian culture it is
revitalizing our Dharma our culture our
sanatana paramara our Guru parampara in
a big way and this is a momentous
occasion and I had the great privilege
to be there you know some months ago
with the help of the up police and they
were showing me around the places that
people who are usually restricted access
to being a Hindu devotee and activist so
it's a moment there's a case man do you
feel Goosebumps when you walk on the
floor the same floor you know in which
may have walked so it's a great occasion
I believe it will bring more Glory more
peace more spirituality and more Harmony

LCiXieUXu5Y,&#39;Engage &amp; Neutralize Hostile Ballistic Missle&#39;|Indian Navy &amp; DRDO Conduct Maiden Flight Trial |NewsX,'Engage & Neutralize Hostile Ballistic Missle'| Indian Navy & DRDO Conduct Maiden Flight Trial | NewsX To Subscribe our ...,2023-04-23T07:49:50Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LCiXieUXu5Y/hqdefault.jpg,"the drdo and the Indian Navy have
successfully conducted the maiden flight
trial of a sea-based endo-atmospheric
interceptor missile the test has been
conducted off the coast of odisha in the
Bay of Bengal in a statement issued the
defense Ministry has specified that the
purpose of the trial is to engage and
neutralize a hostile ballistic missile
threat thereby elevating India into the
elite club of the Nations having Naval
BMG capability prior to this the drdo
had successfully demonstrated a
land-based bmd system with the
capability to neutralize ballistic
missile threats emerging from
adversaries
I am being joined by sham Kumar who is a
defense expert of Sir what is your take
on this uh how big of the achievement
how significant of achievement do you
think this is
thank you this is Captain charm from the
Navy and to the music's channel to
giving me giving me this opportunity uh
see ballistic missile defense is one of
the critical require
uh to intercept a incoming threat or a
aircraft
a craft like a walk or a high-speed
aircraft but mainly when you are looking
at ballistic missiles
we need to have a system by which we can
get a early warning we can track it we
can carry out a interception by
effective interception by our missiles
which can engage them at a very long
range and it is
above the atmospheric you know levels
that is within the atmospheric levels
say maybe 100 kilometers up to the
height or Beyond 100 kilometer height
because there are ballistic missiles
which come in exothermic level and
endothermic levels are low level so
after the land base missiles are proved
by the country our adversary is threat
that is that we have from the North End
Northwest is very important for India to
have a very concrete and foolproof
missile defense system now coming to see
it is very important because Maritime
domain you must have a multi-layer
difference for the ships to maneuver and
carry out the sea control Mission
wherever we need to move so our aircraft
carrier and the naval fleet must be
protected against the incoming missile
threats because we have very high value
assets like aircraft carriers tankers
destroyers which can change they could
be Game Changer in a situation when you
are looking at a peripheral or diversary
plan to attack
so I feel that it is a great achievement
for Country we have joined into the
light club of three four countries of
the world Russia USA Israel Etc who can
have effective ballistic missile defense
for their see best capabilities so I
congratulate drd on Indian Navy and all
the associated team members for
achieving this high value
equipment for the Indian Navy and for
the country as a whole
uh Captain Kumar I also want to pose
another question to you this missile has
been developed by drdo it is an
indigenously developed missile
Interceptor how do you think this
bolsters are defense
so very uh very correct reset India is
on path of indigenous capabilities
Naval equipment takes a lot of lead time
you would always be watching that
firstly we have a land-based capability
then we look at air-based capabilities
and
move to the third dimension that is the
best capability whether it is nuclear
ballistic missile launch nuclear tired
or Trident that we call it the
capability to launch a ballistic missile
from a submarine after the land and air
capability has been achieved
so in that Dimension when we have
achieved a third strike capability to
launch a ballistic missile from Land p
and air now here
in the same mission of indigenous
capabilities we are into the level of
developing a full-fledged
ballistic missile defense from sea so I
think this is a stepping stone and
another
feather in the cap of that Smite and the
scientists design development and
operation by the team and it's really a
achievement and I really congratulate
the full team for this uh the
spectacular spectacular achievement for

built at tapir Kigali on Mughal Road in
Jammu and Kashmir and this is a 5000
rupee crore development project which
will link a punch and rajouri in Jammu
to shopping in Kashmir the Tulane tunnel
will help tide over the issue of
snowfall impeding vehicular movement
during Winters making the road
functional throughout the year it shall
also reduce the travel distance by 365
kilometers and will make the Mughal Road
an alternative to the Jammu Srinagar
Highway this project a project is being
hailed by local residents in Jammu and
Kashmir which is a testament to the
success of the slew of vikas Endeavors
transforming this particular region
we'll talk about this and the benefits
that this will entail with our guests
joining us on the show is Major General
Dr Gigi diwedi Global and strategic
Affairs and defense expert also with us
on the show is Major General
strategic and Global Affairs expert
Direct of India Foundation
group Captain UK devnath former Indian
Air Force and defense expert also with
us on the program and last but by no
means the least Mr Sumit Peter political
commentator also joins us on this
program General I'll begin with you well
you know the construction of this stunt
tunnel is definitely something uh to be
applauded for because connectivity is
imperative when you talk about
strengthening the bond even you know not
between regions uh but also the kind of
security and the kind of safety that
India is looking to procure uh in the
face of uh you know this uh double
threat that we have from Pakistan and
China
oh thank you vineet yes I totally agree
with you you see there are two aspects
to this one is whenever we build these
roads and uh this road of course the
Mogul Road has already been built it
came up in 2012 uh but it remains closed
for half the year because of heavy
snowfall and now with the tunnel coming
up um as and when it comes up it will it
will be open 24 hours 24 hours a day uh
throughout the year now that of course
is an important development but
alongside that it has got great
strategic significance also because now
any movement of forces which has to take
place uh between Srinagar shopping aside
and you want to get onto the pooch
rajouri side uh that can be done in a
very very quick time frame uh you don't
have to worry about the road at all
because if you have a 24 hour 365 day
rule uh then that strategic
communication from that angle it becomes
that much simpler now uh it is something
which really boggles the imagination
that since Independence uh from 1947 the
first time somebody thought of building
this road was really in 1980 I I haven't
understood why this time frame it took
so long to even think about it but even
after thinking about it nothing happened
till about 2005 when they actually got
onto building the road and finally
completed that road uh Sands the tunnels
in 2012. now with with the tunnels
coming up you see what great difference
it makes uh even when you look at the
East with the Cena the Sailor tunnel
coming up it greatly increases your
strategic mobility and here as far as
the local people are concerned their
connectivity of the people of the
rajouri Pune side to the people in
chopia and Beyond uh as also from the
military point of view the Strategic
aspects I think it is going to be very
significant just to put things in
perspective you know when we are looking
at poons and you look North uh the URI
sector comes up there about 35
kilometers to the north and in between
is the hajipirin pass which we had
captured in 1965 and gave away now if
you have to come from URI to punch
instead of starting 40 kilometers we
have to travel something like six to
eight hundred kilometers now that is
what communication really takes into
account now with this coming up of
course even the stretch from foods to uh
URI it gets reduced dramatically but uh
uh I think the more we concentrate on
roads the better it is to get normalcy
back into the area and uh Mr ghatkari
has already announced uh another large
portion of this has been put on the
ground a one lakh road or more than one
lakh road of Roads tunnels and bridges
is coming up in the valley order of
which 75 000 crores their works are
already in progress so I think this
particular aspect when we're looking at
it holistically it's going to make a
tremendous impact on the valley and lead
to normalcy in a very short time frame
beneath absolutely great points there
sir uh do you think that connectivity
when it comes to uh you know not only
the Civil Avenues and but the Strategic
Avenues in this part of the country has
been under neglect and this is perhaps a
big big big move in that direction
absolutely we need uh you know when you
see our borders are contested they are
disputed therefore I think
infrastructure plays a very important
role for the defense and also for the
security of a borders I I have operated
in these areas extensively basically
what happens is that sap Punjab age
which separates the Valley from the
region of kunch and the Georgian as
posted here and done enough patrolling
and uh you know this it becomes a
barrier and if you have to go north or
south of field Punjab we keep talking
about the you know militancy we keep
talking about terrorism we talk about
peer Punjab now peer Punjab can be
actually crossed in this area at peer Ki
Gali which actually becomes a bottleneck
and this road was as brought out was
constructed and operationalized in 2012
but then it is not a always road because
was when we are talking about security
we are talking about all weatherhood and
especially when you have to shift your
forces from north to south this become
very important but there are two three
issues which are I think we need to take
in mind we need to look at border
development as a integrated you know
project because it's not only which
helps the strategically it also helps
the local development so what we call is
the Dual use because once you build up
the road you build up the infrastructure
automatically there's a huge momentum
huge traction that the locals also
benefit what we call civil military
Fusion and the second important factor
is that once your borders are developed
automatically you know these uh threat
of militancy threat of terrorism also
get degraded because the prosperity
brings as a different uh complexion to
the whole issue but coming into this
road per se because this road you know
if in Ventures you have to go all the
way from Jammu and then you have to go
to coach or the Jory and otherwise
because it takes two days now to
transfer the distance whereas on ground
the distance is just about 126
kilometers and I remember having
patrolled across you know the other
place uh Khalsa one calls or to coast
and then we come down to Saudia but with
this road coming it becomes very easy
for us to shift all our resources and
also the troops from Lord to South all I
can say is that this project must be
given highest priority like we are
having with the Jilla tunnel that is
also a very major project and similarly
we are connecting padam you know to
Manila and uh to the Manali and also to
Nemo such projects I think need to be
taken at highest priority because they
will give a great impetus to our
security of the body areas and also for
the development of the body areas
especially when they
you know become very imminent as you saw
this instance only therefore yesterday
and repeatedly I think this will be a
huge benefit for the locals as well as
for this strategic and operation angle
right absolutely and group Captain
they've not you know seeing these
numbers and seeing this you know
prominent need for infrastructure in
Jammu and Kashmir as a citizen you know
one would actually wonder why wasn't
this taken up before
uh vineet that is their million dollar
question in fact that is a 5000 crore
office question uh mobile Road uh always
existed from Mughal era uh
uh his uh stories uh mentioned this
route and uh the Lahore report during
summer used to move to Srinagar by
Mughal wrote in those days of course
only tattoos and Buddhas were used for
the movement in those days uh
subsequently if I can go back to a
little bit of history
1947-48 when um Pakistani razakas
attacked jnk immediately after
Independence uh Mughal Rose came under
dominance of parked forces because Pok
had segregated from India and that time
the road exists present Road present
main road which goes from Jammu to
udhampur to Banyan tunnel and then
did not exist that time so we head to
Indian Air Force had to deploy Dakota's
aircraft which carried Indian
troops from India
to Srinagar by Dakota Airtel and that's
how at the last moment we managed to
save Srinagar from
Invaders uh this road should have been
as rightly bordered by both the generals
this road should have been constructed
long time ago because of its strategic
needs but as we need they say
I must thank Mr gadhgiri and a lot of
kudos to the Indian Engineers who are
putting in their hard earned
uh Talent into this project this project
will be of a great importance to Indian
Army Navy Army and Air Force you see as
both the generals put out there is a
need that during any conflict of forces
have to move from Valley to peer punjal
and west of peer Punjab uh Air Force
also certainly has to move large number
of
ground-based equipment our Radars
missiles units our forward mobile
observation post from Srinagar from
Kashmir Valley across peer punjal to
west of peer
Punjabi sector now presently in the
absence of this Mughal tunnel we have to
come from our forces of the Air Force
with brownie units have to travel all
the way from Srinagar avantipur where
they are based to Jammu and then move
Westward to the punch and rajori but
afterwards this tunnel is constructed
Air Force will have a great advantage
and quickly within few hours we will
move our Radars and anti-aircraft
missile systems from
across this tunnel to West and deploy
them near poon cherajuri south of URI
uh but uh we need most important thing
will be that uh this road will lead to a
lot of development as far as job
opportunities are concerned it will
definitely lead to increase in number of
students visiting uh these areas of peer
Punjab range is full of places which can
open avenues for adventure sports it
will lead to Great increase in trade
right now Valley remains closed uh due
to snowbound Mughal Road Mogul Road
around say December January it closes
due to snow and it opens only around
April so uh was this tunnel is
made a trade between both the sites that
is west of punjal till Kashmir Valley
will become easy Commerce activity will
take place it will lead to certain
amount of what is called Improvement in
life of the local people there
um Kashmir people their aspirational
needs will be met so I think uh it will
go in a long way in integrating Kashmir
Valley with the rest of India uh yes
Sumit your thoughts on this
developmental push obviously the one
thing that has come to my mind and I'm
sure it has crossed every person who's
come across this news as to why this was
not done before but like they say in
Hindi they write
very thank you very much for having me
on your program in fact why it was not
not done before is a billion dollar
question because you know when this
article 375 and 35 year was there so
what was done that the government had a
different flag they had different powers
for example CAG was not applicable their
IPC was not applicable there Supreme
Court did not have jurisdiction there we
would get billions of dollars billions
of dollars as packages and you will
splurge the money nobody will ask you
questions a kashmiri girl marries out of
Kashmir you deny her from all the rights
around here can get a citizenship there
but you as an Indian cannot get the
citizenship there a Bangladeshi can buy
a piece of land and he can be even
citizen but president of India was
denied that so this organized loot which
was happening there
challenges
so this was all done because the local
politicians and the families wanted to
loot and plunder not only that they also
purposely did not build any
infrastructure why infrastructure was
not built because they did not want
Indian army Indian troops and the Indian
government to mobilize troops and to act
to act as needed for example look
between Jammu and Kashmir the road is
280 kilometers and all that at that
times you see restaurants
there is a road Landslide lot of things
happen but all these years they never
tried to build alternate road never try
to build the alternate road why because
they wanted that whenever they want they
could cut up the Kashmir temporarily
then they will complain our apples are
not able to reach the Indian markets our
saffron is not able to reach we are not
getting cold we are not getting food we
are not getting supplies but what did
you do to build the alternator what the
answer is nothing and buy this also you
see this road sells 350 kilometers
imagine Jammu to Srinagar is 280
kilometers drive by one tunnel you are
saving 350 kilometers imagine the
quantum so you are literally build the
alternate route You're Building all
whether root your integrated punch into
it you've got employment into it so they
work with the pockets have developed
when they were mostly Kashmir
not hardly any development happened
there because it was not a powerful
World Bank a lot of votes were not
coming there the traditional China
Valley was not the stronghold of them so
they did not bother kashmiri politicians
the the jnk state means Srinagar Valley
65 percent of the seats were 15 of the
population that is what it was so the
fixed match was continuing nothing was
made to enable nothing was made to
repeat and then nothing was to make it
to keep it the valley accessible why
should they develop punch why should
they develop rajouri why should they
develop other perias for example look
when we're talking
seven we had ideas that the lithium was
there were you waiting for it to become
Pakistan when it will become Pakistan
then Pakistan
why this was not flat after this 35 am D
17 gone then these all things have
started happening thousands of crores of
infrastructure push now we have a road
from Jammu Delhi to Katra see that she
the new road of Mata vaishno Devi see
how am I impeccable it is
four and a half hours with the note now
this all over the road see the amount of
infrastructure push which is done
because if you don't have infrastructure
you cannot get people into the
mainstream traditionally a Jammu Kashmir
Highway would even close up 15 15 20
days because the highway that the
geography the highway is like that so
then they'll say oh we are cut off we
are have opened our trade with Pakistan
let's open the musafira bathroom so if
we don't get supplies from India let's
get the supplies from Pakistan it was
all political there was no political
well three families which rooted the
valley which which did all the looter
plant and never wanted that to integrate
never wanted these roads to come why
didn't Omar of the law of law never even
proposed this if the government of India
would have rejected that's a different
thing now we are building one tunnel at
zojila we are trying to build all
weather road because only open for six
months so by not having roads was to
also keep these people and these areas
deprived of development keep them only
in the ration queue for bijli Pani and
chai Pani and that's all you control the
power you control the value therewards
do not matter industry will not come up
no alternate political dispensation will
come up there that was a move why why
this was not thought of it is only after
Modi ji came it's only after the
alliance with PDP was broken because PDP
you know what they did after the chinab
panel came up zojila Channel roads
infrastructure Katra Road and let me
remind all the viewers you know Faro
gupla was also the chairman for Martha
vaishnav they will transfer a lot of
billions of dollars equivalent of INR
has been Borrowed by Earth's wild Indian
sorry government of jnk from Mata
vaishnavi trust this money is still not
returned the salaries of the government
employees and the cars and their
Bungalows was paid by Mata vaishnavi
trust Mata vaishno Devi
ant swelled state of jnk that is how the
loot and plunder was happening don't
build infrastructure don't build Road
take the money from Mata you are the
trustee save will return you you never
return that money only now Manu Synergy
has started returning some money that
was the reality of Kashmir seven percent
voting you from the government seven
percent voting you from the government
fifteen percent of the area 65 percent
of the seats fixed match don't develop
anything don't have anything Supreme
Court
Indian government please send the money
and and Indian army please protect us up
on the borders because if pakistanis
will fire you will die because your
people will die we will be safe we are
here to have a nice life live in
palatial houses never develop
infrastructure deprive people of
development and tell them how bad India
is and how badly do we need Independence
when Pakistan became redundant will go
to China now uncle will give us
independence that is reality this is
what has happened why after the
abbreviation of 35 and 370 all the
things I've changed why 1.8 tourists
have come there now why my hotel room
one for one lakh rupees because things
have changed why there is a nightlife
there why picture Halls are running full
stream why nobody is supporting uh you
know hurry up why nobody when the jilani
died nobody hit the streets why because
this is the change this is the change of
development this is how the development
people are feeling development why malls
are coming up now why Saudis and uas and
are you know investing a big time there
because this is what 370 abrogation and
35 years done that glass ceiling is
broken it's a very welcome step
integrated bit strategically also yeah
also out of time we'll take concluding
thoughts from all our guests starting
with General katoch
I think this is a very exciting time now
uh to be living in India and especially
for the people of Jammu and kashmirs uh
what Sumit Peter said is absolutely
correct you know there was an agenda
really to keep this place
um to keep the pot boiling and make
money I think those days are over now I
think for any enterprising person uh
from the union territory of Jammu and
Kashmir uh there are the floodgates of
opportunities have opened up it is up to
them to seize it uh as part of the
military is concerned I think uh this
road once it comes up it's called the
Mughal road but uh it has been existing
there for a thousand years before the
mughals were even born uh it was
actually the namak road of the salt Road
a use for trade for more than a thousand
years but I think it is these groups
actually which will make a huge
difference and strategically I think it
will strengthen the country beneath all
right
you asked a very pertinent question as
to why this development didn't take
place earlier well I have got this one
answer that uh you know infrastructure
was never a national priority and it was
across this spectrum whether you take
border areas or you take internal inter
landed and every priority and Border
area was totally left to fit to complete
and I have served mostly in the body
areas and just give you one example when
I de-indicted from
blocked so I have to bring my Battalion
through the Manali road and it was a
nightmare now we are making this all
weather road I think we have woken up
and rightly so time has come to actually
give big push to the infrastructure
because only infrastructure can give
security to our board areas and also go
a long way to integrate our nation as
such
all right
group captain
uh this road will go this tunnel will go
a long way in ensuring strategic uh Plus
for Indian Armed Forces especially Army
and Air Force but having said that both
the site people living on both sides of
peer Punjab that is people of Valley and
people who live across at punch rajuri
area they have Roti patica Arista so I
am very sure that they will be the
greatest and happiest people at present
yes all right Sumit quickly 10 seconds
we need um
made a very important Point first of all
it's called the namak road it has
nothing to do with mughals or Mughal
Legacy let's let's get rid of the name
mughals because that will send a very
bad picture and image secondly for the
first time jnk is most cured people are
more integrated we are breaking those
glass ceilings and glass walls Brick by
Brick Wall by wall and getting this that
in the flood of development and
prosperity to reach the last Village and
the last man standing in the last queue

special broadcast on news X where we now
decode something that we've been waiting
for a very long time these row has now
released the Indian space policy 2023
the first of its kind the policy directs
ISRO and the NFL to make way for private
players Israel will now be focusing on
research and development to transition
out of manufacturing of operational
Space Systems while the nsil will focus
on commercializing the space sector in
space on the other hand will serve as
the nodal private space project
authorization body these are some of the
key structural changes that will be seen
in India space sector which like we said
will now pave the way for private
players to really flourish and Bloom as
far as space development in India is
concerned we take you through the
details of this space policy that has
now come out the white print is out
tapan Mishra founder director
for cc radar private limited with us on
the broadcast we also have uh with us
several other guests uh srimati Kasen
founder and CEO at space kids India is
also with us and I have with me
Lieutenant AKA dg4 Indian space
Association in space what we've been
referring to let me begin if we can in
fact put out
the Preamble that is on our screens
right now let's put this out for our
viewers let's see what is it exactly
that is being said
the Preamble States here viewers of the
government of India andish reforms in
the space domain in 2020 opening the
doors for enhanced participation of
known governmental entities in carrying
out end-to-end activities in the space
domain with an aim to provide them a
Level Playing Field so this is the first
part subsequent to these reforms the
government seeks to provide regulatory
certainty to space activities by various
stakeholders in order to create a
thriving space ecosystem the Indian
space policy 2023 has thus been
formulated as an overarching composite
and dynamic framework to implement the
reform Vision approved by the cabinet so
this is the preamble we will come back
in just a moment to the vision as well
but let's go right into the strategy
that has been put out what shall be the
focus of the government as far as the
space policy is a concerned before I
bring in our guests as well the first
part is encouraging Advanced research
and development in the space sector to
sustain and augment the Space Program
providing public goods and services
using space technology for National
priorities creating a stable and
predictable regulatory framework to
provide a Level Playing Field to
non-government entities in the Space
Center
through in space prompting space related
education and Innovation including
support to space sector startups using
space as a driver for overall technology
development nurturing scientific
temperament in the society and
increasing Awareness on Space activities
is what has been laid out as the vision
and strategy for the government to focus
on very clear words there let me begin
with reference General AK but Mr Butt
we've been waiting for the fine print of
the policy let's keep this on the
screens for our viewers we've been
waiting for the fine print for a very
long time here it is before us
what do you make of these five key
features that have been put out at least
as far as the government is concerned
you know uh
in its form is visionary and
forward-looking
a space which had been for so many years
the domain of ISRO and the government is
now being opened to private players
startups entrepreneurs
and as I would say it is now looking the
vision gives us that private players
which which have been called nges
non-governmental entities
have now been given an opportunity to
operate in multiple domains all domains
of Upstream Midstream and downstream
it's it will bring a new space
revolution of course
higher exploratory and research would be
the domain of ISRO which it has been for
so many years but this also provides
opportunities to our new startups to our
industry in all multiple domains and we
welcome that
absolutely let me bring in first
comments from srimati Cason as well what
do you make of this uh miscation when
you read you know this fine print of the
policy that has come out in terms of
creating a stable and predictable
regulatory framework to provide a Level
Playing Field to all non-government
entities this is something that we at
musics have also been pushing for uh the
fact that we need more and more private
players to be invested in the space
sector but because of the lack of a
clear space policy there was an
uncertainty you know is this a sector
that we're concerned about is this a
sector that we should put a better money
on but all of that will change
yes yes you're absolutely right uh party
see first clearly we should understand
that initially the space industry of
India was only of national interest so
whatever was you know for the country
purpose you know we were doing that now
there is a Innovation hinge that is
added to this there are a lot of
startups coming in and opening up of the
startup industry has created a lot of
innovation across the globe if you see
there are so many players entering this
but the only thing was we did not have a
regulatory policy in which we did not
know where we stand who stands where
what to do right so this give you know
clearly demarcates our roles each and
everyone's role you know and because of
this you know what is encil going to do
in space going to do and ISRO going to
do and private players like us whatever
we have been doing we are going to be
enhancing our Innovations that's what I
would say because you know there is a
lot of questions you know about
anti-satellite about space debris there
are so many things green propulsion
everything ISRO cannot do right so we
need to support them we need to be doing
all this until and unless there is a
framework as to what all we can do what
all we can pitch in it is very difficult
for each of us to play so this clearly
demarcates and we are extremely happy
about it and no wonder we had skyroots
launch a private player's rocket launch
and uh you know space kids India as well
as through our spaces satellites have
been launched pixel satellite have been
launched so all this are going to open
up a great array for our economy
space is one industry which is going to
give you dough it gives us delayed you
know slightly delayed but yet it gives
us chunk of money now we know one web
launches and everything have been a
brilliant move by ISRO and we have
gotten so much of uh you know the
foreign inflow into our country this is
important so I'm extremely happy and
hugely welcome and thank our honorable
prime minister for doing this absolutely
let me bring in tapan Mishra as well but
before I do that I'll quickly go through
what the non-governmental entities will
be encouraged to do as far as this
policy is concerned uh it's a very like
I said exhaustive policy so we'll try to
go over it as quickly as possible it
says that the nges would be encouraged
to offer National and International
space-based Communication Services
through cell phone or procured or leased
gso and ngso communication satellites
then establish and operate ground
facilities for space or objects
operations use Indian orbital resources
and non-indian orbital resources to
establish space objects for
communication Services over India and
outside make new itu filings through the
WPC slash dot to acquire orbital
resources establish and operate remote
sensing Satellite Systems within and
outside India through cell phone or
procured or leased satellites
disseminate satellites based based
remote sensing data as well as
applications based on such data in or
outside India there are 13 pointers here
14 pardon me as far as non-governmental
entities are concerned uh we will of
course put out this policy on our
website as well so that everybody has
access to it in totality but Mishra as
far as non-governmental entities are
concerned what is the big game changer
as per you as far as this policy is
concerned what really will change
look at it you know the details are in
that the devil is in the details and the
details are very very has come out I am
you can have a lot of vision and
strategy but if the details are not
clear then all those business strategies
are going to go west
what is very important that they have
clearly identified and demarcated the
roles of ISRO NG in space and seal and
the overarchical responsibility of the
dogs and most importantly that is
through an NG were going to compete on
the same task and today they take this
term boundary has been drawn though not
very firm boundary but still a boundary
and ISRO has been entrusted with the
advanced research and they
NG has been asked to do almost all the
normal rudimentary Works what the ISRO
was going to do so this will make you
know that the ISRO is a behemoth and the
in the presence of that's a big Banyan
Tree all small trees would have died now
the government had made a possibility
that a that a smaller startups and all
they can survive and the competition and
they don't have to fear a big
competition from ISRO
but it over and above that what is very
important I look at it and even the NG
can disseminate more than one feet with
poorer than one quit resolution and that
is a 30 centimeter which is a great one
you know that will make many many new
applications and the second is that they
have asked ISRO to give away the data
many of the downstream startups cheaper
but they another very interesting thing
that angels are interested with even
with the asteroid mining you know it's
it's a last call you last but one point
and it only shows that they what to what
extent the government wants AMG to
perform not just space But even in the
asteroid mining
but they
one interesting thing I see missing you
know that say I was expecting it there
is a there will be a clear statement on
encouraging the indigenous development
because today I would like to give you a
scenario at one time no in that there
was some very upcoming Indian mobile
companies carbon Micromax today you
don't see them you see the same this
this Chinese companies have come and
captured the space again I I have
nothing against the quality wise but
this will happen that if you do not give
a special recommendation for
encouraging
indigenous development you will see that
they've made knocked down foreign
companies will be entering through a
back door okay and occupy it and then
kill this nascent industry and it will
not we should not repeat that what
mistake we did in the mobile industry
and the second is that if the funding is
to zero that is I expected there should
be more clarity on the funding issue
because today's funding is mostly
dominated by pieces and they are not
Indian Banks or the Indian financial
institutions are not coming forward with
a
funding in the startups and they you
know there is a danger of if the moment
to take a funding from foreign basis
they will also tell you to take the
technology from the foreign companies
and you can see it for yourself that
they it will over the period will kill
internal initiative and I feel that
these two aspects you know would have
been addressed we have declared our
policy but the financial policy has not
been established yes Mr very relevant
issues raised by you miss uh lavender
but uh you know what do you make of
these issues that have been raised by
tapan Mishra will of course come back to
the policy but he says there is a bit of
a worry about certain foreign elements
or foreign VC is trying to now come and
control the entities one way or the
other either through funding or via Tech
sharing
well my understanding of the policy and
what I see and read it uh nges have been
defined
and it is very important that the checks
and balances are that these no
non-government entities which are
supposed to be Indian companies
or Companies Incorporated in India it is
safeguarded in the right manner that is
I think what Mr tapa Mishra means and I
agree with that but yes it is just
making it for Indian players may maybe
would have not been approved because
this is a sector which cannot operate
only with indigenous
companies we have to yes incentives have
to be given and which is more important
which I expect in the budget or in
policies ahead is incentives for Indian
companies in in taxes
in in providing GST
and giving them incentives in tax uh tax
holidays as well as plis all these we
are expecting and of course
I am very confident that the FDI policy
will follow very soon
which would also give Clarity would also
Define ownership for companies which are
operating in India we should wait for it
because largely this policy document
which covers the larger aspect has very
well defined one it has created a single
window for us called in space it has
defined NGS and given them the boom they
can do anything they want to in the
space domain a very forward-looking
policy
okay all right you know this is like I
said a policy that has now come out it's
a very large and it actually requires uh
two to three hours to decode analyze and
understand the fine print I just have a
few more moments left a few other
pointers uh that have come about that
I've found interesting promoting
industry clusters zones manufacturing
hubs incubation centers accelerators and
tech centers for the space sector this
is something that has been laid down for
in space to focus on and also working
with Academia to widen the space
ecosystem and enable in Industry
Academia linkages I want to bring back
Mrs
question if I can here on this point you
know on musics also man for a long time
we've been talking about creating space
hubs in several parts of the country uh
for now we see that most of the space
activity happens down south and of
course the reasons are obvious that uh
the great Technologies of ISRO are also
available only down south of course
those are all technical reasons behind
it but we also need to encourage as
they've mentioned through academics a
larger interest in the space sector so
when we talk about creating space hubs
it's not just about allowing say
startups to come up in different parts
of the country but also having an active
interest in space in science that can be
inculcated at a very young age because I
kid you not I did not have this access
when I was growing up and I probably
would have studied I would have worked
harder and studied science if I knew
that these opportunities would be
available to me one day
you are on the dot bharti you know what
for the last five six years I've been
harping on this particular issue and
I've been talking to Chief ministers and
in fact I had an opportunity to even
interact with honorable prime minister
about this one point we need is so we we
have ISRO it's so hard so many things in
their Kitty that they had to do now of
course it is defined fine but we need a
space Research Park space Research Park
doesn't mean we have startups and we
have manufacturing units there no I mean
to say a space Research Park wherein
children like NASA which has got the
educative portion of NASA you know I've
been the Ambassador for the NASA Isa and
gctc space camps so I know for sure
going there the mindset of the children
changes and you know so many of them
have taken space as their profession now
so catch them young is my policy and if
we are able to build something like that
you know a place where children can come
even at the age of five six and seven
you know we should be able to impart the
basic knowledge simulators use of
simulators the feel Touch of space if
that is there I think you know ideas
will crop up even at the age of 10 15.
our country you know our children are so
intelligent it is just that we need a
place we need a place to go and to have
all these things to be experienced and
also one other thing I want to mention
here is the duty portion see when we
build satellites sometimes we really
bleed bharti because 77 we have to pay
for the you know for little little
sensors so this manufacturing thing is
very very important and I think you know
blighted players okay but I think
government should invest into a
manufacturing code as well is the
testing bed you know when we go in for
testings it is it is a task you know it
is so expensive if we have to you know
do the testing outside so if it is a
government entity then you know testing
of course we do it in ISRO ISRO is uh
you know economical but still we need
something more economical so that more
Innovative satellites can come up and
more innovative ideas can crop up so
that you know this whole cluster that we
are talking about Academia industry and
ISRO and its base I think that will be a
beautiful beautiful chain I should say
absolutely it would definitely need that
yes and what I love about this
conversation is that the moment we've
all opened up the policy our minds are
racing everybody has something that they
want to discuss that they want to
contribute that they want to point out
and this is what we need in India the
most these sort of positive healthy

are trying to ensure Congress candidates
are disqualified KPCC president
allegations against CM bomai they try to
disqualify my application as well says
DK shiv Kumar
he is alleging that CM Boma is himself a
part of several Corrupt Practices but he
is trying to normalize the image of TK
shiv Kumar let's quickly listening
it gives rise to your suspicion and we
are asking the election commission to
look into it we are blaming the election
commission we are blaming the CCM they
become desperate to win this election so
look at the list how they have given
whom all they have given what are the
track record and they're trying they're
leaving no stone unturned to ensure that
uh even if there is a little uh a way
that they can find a small way that they
can find to ensure that the Congress
candidates don't cannot contest they
will try to exert pressure on that using
authorities
all right today you heard it the
allegations of the congress party
they're saying that it's not the
agencies in fact it is Chief Minister
bobai who's trying all that he can to
ensure that the Congress candidates get
disqualified and that they're not able
to compete in the elections in a free
and fair manner so allegations they're
coming in from the Congress the day
after
off the BJP
accused DK shiv Kumar of taking bribes
from all Congress candidates for giving
a ticket
of the BJP joins us on the broadcast is
Mr suthadri you've heard what the
Congress has had to say how do you
respond they are alleging that the this
is yet another attempt of the BJP to
malign the image of Congress leaders and
to ensure that there are no free and
fair elections in Karnataka because the
congress party is as per them expected
to win due to anti-incumbency
you see basically
they are trying to take a card too early
in the beginning itself that's all I can
say because uh the election process is
on as per the statutory requirements and
law because there has not been blockages
of anybody nobody has there was a
suspicion they had that they would they
would get blocked because of their own
problems but nothing happened on those
lines and now it is a battle lines are
drawn fight for the next 14 days or 17
days
and see who wins actually 15 16 days of
campaigning is there and they are born
to make allegations on different areas
I don't I mean we have already said that
there have been lot of
uh sale of seeds and things like that
all right and then it is for them to
prove it is not so it is for their
okay I request you to stay on with us of
the Congress also joins us on the
broadcast we say other we've heard how
the BJP has responded to several
allegations of the Congress they say
that this is the Congress uh you know
just making these assumptions before the
elections and the congress party is
desperate how do you respond
Congress didn't have to make any
assumptions nor trying to set up the
perception on people that is not
required for congress because as a
principal opposition party we have been
taking on the BJP on head on with them
and try to expose them in number of
matters for example the Prime Minister
had accused of government in the 2018
election saying that it is a 10 person
government without any allegation
without any a complaint about any
particular party connected to it but
there is a prime minister's office a
received a complaint to the contractors
Association and till now no action no
super action has been taken on them
rather than taking an action they have
been asking for the witness the
government has been accurate and the
same government is asking for a witness
how do you uh how do you give the
document to the person who have been
accused of it is a government of India
should have set up on sewer motor
sitting judges under the sitting judge
an inquiry committeeable setup and
bought out clean because they said the
party difference now the party with
differences become party with
differences one thread is corruption
second thing that from foreign
[Music]
minimum of 10 percent also they have not
even able to fulfill the promises and
they said that Farmer's income is going
to become double today's what is the
rate of uh fertilizer today per bag and
what is the rate of uh gas salary today
for a common man to use it what is the
rate of a petrol what is the rate of a
diesel what is the job rates today
unemployment is the highest unemployment
rate in the past 50 years now and who is
responsible for it is the double engine
sarkar which claimed to be a people
friendly where are the people friendly
today people are cursing them day and
night and this is not acceptable and
it's not a political allegation it's a
people's voice where Congress is based
and Congress is completely fighting
against him since the day they came to
power and they have not kept up any
promises and also they are the first
people in India to buy up the MLS to
form the government which is
undemocratic and mockery of democracy
what moral rate they have to say that to
their they run the government doing well
all right I request you to stay on I
request you to stay on Mrs sudhadri but
what the Congress has had to say how do
you respond sir they're saying that the
BJP is in fact once again trying to buy
mlas and this is what the BJP does
before any election
see basically one factor is that 40
percent issue they need to prove or at
least perceptionally they can say that
this is what has happened they are
unable to prove anything and secondly uh
talking about the various developmental
activities in Karnataka they may say
only 90 has not been fulfilled or
whatever it is 90 percent of the
total value has been completed and we
have done an excellent job in the state
with the center with us and as a double
engine sarkar we have delivered whatever
people wanted and that will be answered
by the people of the state and I am
quite confident that we have delivered
it and there is no uh doubts in the
minds of the Common Man that we have
delivered and coming on to the Amelia
issues and other things it is for them
to take care of their mlas if their mlas
feel that they are not delivering things
and they have joined it was an annually
Alliance what they had with GDs uh
[Music]
reliefs that are offered where the
government did not have the funds to
deliver also in this case in this issue
uh and there were people who were
dissolution with the Congress
functioning in that moment and they're
moved out so it is for them to answer
their mlas who left them it is not for
us to answer their emulation see it is
because of the Unholy Alliance what they
did
it really happened in that way their own
members did not agree with the high
command or the managing group of the
Congress so
can complain too many things but they
need to look at severals in a mirror I
think they would understand where they
are
we have delivered 90 percent of the
requirement of the state more than that
and the government has worked
unfortunately the visibility of this our
people we don't know how to show off all
right the problem maybe we have okay so
uh I thank both the BJP and the Congress
for joining us this morning of course
only time will tell uh who really has
the people's pulse uh in control but uh
Mr siddharaju political anus also joins
us on the broadcast business do you
believe that these allegations encounter
allegations of corruption or attempts at
disqualification will actually work so
close to the polls or through the
political parties actually focus on
offering something better to the state
on offering the people a plan when do
you think we'll be able to move forward
you know from what really is petty
politics
uh well this is not the time for any
political outfit whether either BJP or
Congress or JDS to blame on the
government or reach against each other
they're creating somebody blocks for our
girl that's naturally your very and
Congress was ruling the state between
the
2013-2018 which if we did the same
allegation against the Congress we are
being troubled we are being blocked up
and we cannot do the campaigning
official missionary is being miserable
say every election that has been the
order of the strategy of their political
parties the Congress is also are doing
the same thing again it's a PJP and
since BJP Associates the same two
leggings
now they have to be tolerant and
accepted this is a common methodology
you should be any political outfit now
that is
the allegations of that candidates are
being disqualified or something that
situation is born now the scrutiny is
over under two days left more to left
for withdrawal of candidature wherever
their Rebel candidates in each of the
parties if they manage to get it to try
it well and good for them otherwise they
have to face the moment whatever the
results are Mom and that will be and
again it's a Rebels can do the damage
okay this kind of allegations are due to
the religious thing and development and
other things I don't think they will
become an issue at all even I don't
think the corruption seems to be an
issue at all if you're asking for a
distinct of some
evidence or something like that see what
happened to Mother Guru pakshapa's case
what happened to that what more evidence
I don't think uh see if the government
of the day is very serious but they can
do something but as the BJP people have
responded it positively whether the BJP
High commanders responded positively to
this kind of charges no then naturally
this this 40 percent or some other
non-development issues the same thing
was also the same modesha did the same
again
so that government was defeated
I'll come back to you let's quickly
listen into what CM bomai also had to
say
missions so there is no question of
interfering he is scared of his defeat
so he's making all this baseless useless
allegations every day morning and I need
not answer all this he also says that
you are trying
to do yes it is very well known in the
state that what he is doing to Sidra
Maya he has he has once defeated in
chamundeshwari now he's trying to defeat
in Warner that's known first let him

HaKSk1nRd8k,&#39;I Want To Become CM But Will Not Join BJP&#39; | Ajit Pawar On Maha Political Crisis | NewsX,'I Want To Become CM But Will Not Join BJP' | Ajit Pawar On Maha Political Crisis | NewsX To Subscribe our YouTube channel ...,2023-04-22T06:44:38Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HaKSk1nRd8k/hqdefault.jpg,"day after skipping the NCP convention
has now led to many speculations around
Ajit pavar he has come out and said that
he wants to become the CM even today
although the NCP leader has shunned away
any speculations around Rift with sharat
pawar and him leaving the party this
statement comes at an interesting time
so days after dispelling rumors
around his exit from the NCP and then of
course sources also told newsx that Ajit
pawar did hold several midnight meetings
with high-ranking BJP officials he also
had a meeting as for resources with Amit
Shah and the BJP has as per sources put
forward and offer Ajit pawar that he may
come in
individually however other NCP leaders
will not be welcome Ajit pawar has
skipped the NCB convention meeting now
van has also come out with a statement
saying that he still wants to be the
chief minister of Maharashtra my
colleague vishali with us on the
broadcast vishali this crisis in the NCP
continues in Maharashtra
if you can take our viewers through the
latest details Ajit pawar has kept an
important convention and he has also
made a statement saying he's expressed
his aspirations to be chief minister
well absolutely
has made it quite clearly it was asked
to him that would you like to become a
chief minister in 2004 to answer that
question he said why 2024 I am ready to
become the chief minister of Maharashtra
even now so this is something that the
first time achie's bar has expressed his
willingness to become a chief minister
we all are aware that that is the only
ambition left for Ajit pawar because he
he has served as a deputy chief minister
uh for at least four times the different
uh chief minister and he always wanted
to become a chief minister of
Maharashtra but we are learning that
this time his ambition He has expressed
in so many words and said why uh 2024 if
a given chance I am ready to become a
chief minister even right now and
somewhere he has also given a hint that
this something going on within the NCP
that a few mlas are still with ajith or
although he has made it quite clear that
I will remain in NCP till my last breath
still uh this particular statement made
by Ajit pawar somewhere gives the hint
that although he has made that statement
that he will remain in NCP but something
uh going on within the party that a
group of ncpa MLA uh happened
okay but at the same time what exactly
are our sources also then telling us
about how the NCP is dealing with this
entire crisis they're trying to put out
a united front and Ajit pawar like I
said a few days ago did make a statement
he dispelled uh all the rumors around
his exit from the NCP but he is also
dropping several hints here and there so
clearly a power game is in play in
Maharashtra
oh well many times when these
politicians make the move a stone
disclose we have witnessed this uh when
the uh sweating ceremony happens early
in the morning at 8 00 am uh before
anyone could you know guess or make out
uh it was ajith pawar who then became a
deputy cm and you know uh Devendra Patna
will become a chief minister or for that
government uh didn't survive for more
than two to three days but uh till this
thing has happened uh when they
sometimes you know make a statement
sometimes they express their ambition
but what we can learn from the
yesterday's interview of Ajit paware
but has expressed his willingness to
become a chief minister uh but uh he has
not expressed that whether he will be
chief minister of NCP or uh MBA or he
will join hands with
Tippy so he has put his card he has not
yet disclosed we can see his guard but
yes he has experienced he should to
become a chief minister for more such

broadcast and getting us the latest we
will continue to track those
developments viewers as they come in but
for now we shift our Focus to our top
story now in a shocking incident a truck
carrying jawans from the Indian army was
attacked in the pool sector of Jammu and
Kashmir and has claimed the lives of at
least five jawans the names of the five
soldiers martyred in the terrorist
attack
Mandeep Singh Lance Nayak debashish
baswal
Singh
and the boys sivak Singh the Army's 16
co-based in nagrota said that hunt for
the attackers from Jesse Mohammed who
has claimed responsibility has already
begun and an Nia team is going to be
reaching the the spot of the attack very
shortly in punj now other than this
viewers details are also emerging tell
us that pom squad and FSL teams are
already on the spot and they're trying
to ascertain what exactly happened now
we can just get my my touchpad onto our
television screen so our viewers can
also look at what I am looking at
they're perfect so viewers the first
image that we want to talk you through
we're going to take you through the
sequence of events that took place when
this pawn star attack took place now
keep in mind that we don't have a lot of
details this is just from what the Army
statement says and from the details that
our reporters on the ground have been
able to get us uh so the first image on
your television screens right now is of
the area where the
um where the firing incident took place
so bhimbar Gali is somewhere where
um where the
where the Convoy of the Indian army was
at and it was on its way till sunkout
now somewhere in between this place uh
if I can just zoom this in for our
viewers if we can just adjust this if I
can ask my PCR crew to just adjust the
image on our television screens you'll
be able to see the exact location of
where this attack took place on that
Highway it is uh somewhere close to here
that arrow that you can see that we're
showing you
um that is where the attack took place
this is uh the distance of the route is
somewhere close to 22.7 kilometers and
this place that you can see marked on
your television screens is the place
where the attack took place so now that
you know uh what this looks like on the
map let's also get you an image of what
the terrain looks like
the terrain along the highway is hilly
it has a forest cover for large
stretches and this of course is uh the
terrain that you're looking at on your
television screens right now now as you
can see there's a lot of forest cover
that stretches for miles and miles in
the center of course there is this one
road that leads which is probably the
highway on which the soldiers were
attacked on the other side of course on
the on both the other sides you can see
Heavy Forest cover so Forest cover is of
course something that terrorists use to
take cover in uh probably is where they
were hiding before they came out and
attacked the Convoy the military Convoy
that was there in punch now let's also
then viewers now that you've understood
the location you've understood the
terrain of the region let's also talk
you through what exactly happened when
this Ambush took place now on your
television screens right now is an image
from the time that the Convoy of the
Indian army caught fire after a grenade
was reportedly lobbed on it now if you
can see very clearly
um it's a little hazy in this image now
why it is hazy is because it was bad
weather there were clouds it was foggy
and that is something that terrorists
have reportedly taken advantage of the
fact that there was there were bad
weather conditions that were prevailing
in punt at the time of the incident is
something the terrorists have taken
advantage of let's also talk you through
another image that is on your television
screens right now this image viewers is
once again from the highway from when
the Convoy was attacked as you can see
there is fire that is emerging from that
truck there are multiple people that
have also gathered there and the
incident of course took place on the
Jammu punch Highway and that highway is
original television screens now look
very closely there is dense forest cover
there's also a Ridge on one side on the
right side of that Convoy there is a
ridge as you can see of course there is
heavy Forest cover and as you can see in
these images the smoke aside from that
burning Convoy there is there are lots
of clouds so which means that it was a
cloudy day it was bad weather conditions
and that like I've already mentioned was
something that was taken advantage of by
the terrorists so who attacked this
military Convoy now moving on to another
image here is another picture of yours
now I've already mentioned there's a
ridge on one side dense forest cover on
the other and this is one more image
that is that has emerged from the site
of the incident now in this image also
very closely you can see
um the Convoy is on fire now no First
Responders have reached the site of the
incident in this image because this
image is merely minutes from when the
Convoy was attacked but there are of
course civilians there are people who
were on that Highway who've stopped
their vehicles after this military
Convoy was attacked um so once again I'm
going to talk you through the sort of uh
um the sort of terrain that we're
talking about here the terrain
Forest cover dense forest cover on one
side on the left and on the right of
course there is also a ridge now let's
talk you through uh what exactly
happened now from what we've been given
to understand this military Convoy uh
with five jawans inside of it was
traveling on the Jammu punch Highway
this Jammu punch Highway
um this Jammu punch Highway of course is
a very well frequented Highway It Is
frequented by civilians it is also
frequented by armed Personnel Armed
Forces personnel and what exactly
happened we don't know detail we don't
know the we don't know the exact details
but from with what we do know I'm going
to tell you Jammu punch Highway a convoy
with five of our jawans inside of it it
is going through and there are
terrorists that were most likely hiding
in the bushes who then come out they
Ambush the uh Convoy they Ambush the
truck the military truck in which that
over there with the five devons that
were that were going and once they am
pushed that truck they reportedly lobbed
a Grenade on
um on the truck and after which they
started firing on on the uh truck from
at least three sides so whether the
grenade was lobbed first or whether the
firing started first is still something
that we're trying to assert in where we
still await official details from the
Army but this is what we know so far a
grenade was lobbed and I was firing from
at least three sides that took place on
that Convoy now here's a close-up image
you've already seen images of the truck
on fire but here's a close-up image of
uh the bullet holes that can be seen on
that Convoy proving a testament to the
fact that there was firing that was
involved in the incident there is one
bullet hole that you can see on your
television screens there and the other
of course is uh
somewhere here so these are the details
of the terrorist attack that we've been
able to gather my colleague Ajay jandal
also joining us on the broadcast now for
more on the story Ajay
um we've just told our viewers scene by
scene what exactly happened yesterday
um what are the latest details that
you're learning
[Applause]
they lost their life and attained
martyrdom the protest has begun here in
the German Kashmir and not only in the
Jammu but everywhere in the German
Kashmir tests are going on when people
are where people are protesting against
Pakistan you could see that how they are
raising a Pakistan these are the voices
from Jammu and people are saying that it
was peaceful it was peaceful for last uh
some years but Pakistan don't want Jammu
Kashmir to be peaceful that's why they
are protesting this is the protest
organized by the BJP and a similar kind
of potassium is happening in the punch
as well
foreign
[Music]
that's why they are protesting I will
ask my camera person to show you the
visuals as well where people are moving
on the roads and protesting continuously
against uh you know uh the Pakistan
slogans against Pakistan can be heard
they are saying that action is required
actually is required against Pakistan
because these kind of dirty friends of
Pakistan will not be tolerated and the
blood of the martyrs will not go in vain
and we will ever avenge that uh you know
attack you could see that diners
Pakistan
Banners are in the hand of uh the
protesters those are protesting over
here and you know pictures of the
pictures of the jawans those who laid
down their life for the nation in Ponce
that can be seen in the hands of the
protester and saying and their blood
will not go in the vein and people are
continuously protesting Pakistan high
high these are actually visuals from
upper Jammu where people in large number
they are on ground and protesting here
are in Jammu and clearly saying that
this will not be tolerated we want
action against Pakistan we want uh you
know we want tolerate such Act Pakistan
this is what's happening
Jambu and clearly anger among the people
anger among the common masses can be
seen because they say that Jammu Kashmir
is peaceful for last several months
several years but it doesn't suit to
Pakistan so that's why Pakistan is
trying to you know create a trouble they
are continuously doing it we have with
us yes
[Applause]
Pakistan will not be spared you can see
the visuals here where protesters are on
the road and protesting against Pakistan
raising NT Pakistan slogans and saying
that Pakistan will not be spared this
action the sector of Pakistan this uh
you know an incident which has taken
place there in the poncho will not be
you know taken lightly and that's why
they are saying that the government and
the forces will avenge the martyrdama
for javan's five Jawan those who lay
down their life life for the nation they
were going uh you know from one place to
another and brutal Act of Pakistan that
they uh ambushed that a vehicle in the
punch and then uh you know they they
attack the five job on those who were
moving in that vehicle you know chemical
uh weapons is used by the Pakistan that
what we can say because in that incident
when uh vehicle caught far that clearly
showed that there was some chemical in
the ID or the explosive which was used
to Target that vehicle and that's why
this has happened these are the visuals
from jammuvia BJP and uh other people
are protesting and not only here in the
Jammu but in other part of the uh
country they are also protesting
have been deployed over here to uh you
know for the moment of the traffic in
this area that that shows that how uh
they uh they want to you know this
protest to be peaceful because people
are angry angry among the people of
Pakistan am I anger among the people
against Pakistan can be seen over here
in the Jammu
can you also give us a little more
details with regards to the protests
that are taking place in punch because
from what I understand you are in Jammu
as we speak but there are protests also
taking place in other parts of the
Valley can you talk us through where all
the protests are happening
well yes you know protests are taking
place every in every District of the
German Kashmir in rajouri people are
protesting in punch as well people are
holding the tri-color up and they are
protesting on the roads and saying that
this is the nefarious plan of Pakistan
to dips our peace over here in the
German Kashmir because for last as I
told you that after the application of
370 what has happened that German
Kashmir is not a short strain like
earlier what was happening that short
call was given by the separatist leaders
uh the tariffs were setting for closing
the shops and the other thing but now
the things have changed after the
abrasion of 370 what we have seen that
uh the the people can move anytime in
the German Kashmir people can go
anywhere in the gym in Kashmir shops are
open people are running good tourists in
number of you know tourists the crores
more than one crore tourists they have
visited German Kashmir in last one year
that indicates that how peace is
prevailing in the German Kashmir then
that doesn't suit to Pakistan and that's
why people are protesting that why peace
is being enacted is interrupted by the
Pakistan done why Pakistan is allowed y
action is not taken against Pakistan now
once again like the surgical strike and
the other actions was taken against a
Pakistani by when forces went ahead of
the fenced area so that's why people are
protesting and saying that this is
something which should not be tolerated
and action is required once again
against Pakistan against terrorists
those who are sitting across the line of
control uh in the fenced area and even
people are saying that those who are
culprit those who are involved and
giving support to the terrorists they
will not be spared and that they should
not be spared and that's why they are
protesting in every District of the
German Kashmir okay all right
um you know if you can also talk us
through some of the demands that are
being made by the protesters because
you've been given to understand that uh
you know the protesters are saying that
there needs to be strict action that
needs to be taken with regards to
Pakistan other than that Ajay what are
more demands that the protesters are
making if you can just help us
understand
well yes I will I will watch again try
to show you uh individuals that how
people are protesting and Pakistani
flags and names have been burnt here uh
in Jammu and people are protesting they
are burning the refugees of uh the
protest of the Pakistan and you could
see that what is the condition here of
the Pakistani flag in the Pakistani name
this is what they are doing they are
wearing uh you know they are you know
matching it in the foot and that is
what's happening let's speak to the
people once again uh those who are with
me Pakistan
[Applause]
[Music]
so these are the clear versions of the
people they are saying that Pakistan
should have been used by the uh people
and the forces in the German Kashmir you
could see that everywhere people are
protesting and saying these are the
females those who are protesting uh here
in the Jammu they are the BJP worker and
protesting saying that action need
actually needed again Pakistan
Pakistan Pakistan
um
you could see they are saying that every
you know a life of the soldiers should
be Avenged and that's what the words of
the people here in the German Kashmir
those were protesting on the roads they
are saying that this is something which
should not be tolerated how Pakistan is
continuously doing nataka for you know
saying that we want you know peaceful
border we are not violating ceasefire we
are maintaining the ceasefire on the
border and other hand Pakistani is
pushing the weapons drugs and other
things from across the internet border
and the line of control area in one
month more than dirt and incident of
drone dropping weapon dropping drugs
dropping and the infiltration attempts
has taken place which was spoiled by the
Indian army and the BSF on the
international border in German Kashmir
and it clearly indicates that this is
something which clearly shows that
Pakistan is bankrupt Pakistan is a
terrorist State and they want to show
the world committee that we are
maintaining Peace On the Border but on
the other hand they are pushing drugs
weapon and the terrorist in the German
Kashmir so that they can bleed India
thousand cut that is what Pakistan
wanted since the partition but Pakistan
must understood that this will not be
succeeded Pakistan's in various plan of
a spreading Bloodshed in the German
Kashmir and the rest of the country will
not be succeeded until the last breath

before I let you go you know I have you
here with me I can't not ask you about
your former friend former Governor
satpal Malik he's been lashing out at
you at Prime Minister Modi at everybody
else in the BJP also
um he's made a lot of statements against
you I know you filed a defamation notice
against him but you know he's alleging
that there were some bribes
or he actually he said first bribe then
he's backtracked on his own statement
also but what exactly happened no
whatever he said is just the opposite
what he's saying is absolutely untrue I
am not the coming out to give any
statements about it for two important
reasons one is when he first made
without invoking without taking up my
name when he first made certain
statements implying that somebody from
BJP with RSL background try to influence
immediately wrote to the government both
the state government and here senior
leaders it's unright on paper I sent a
letter asking the lieutenant governor of
German Kashmir who immediately Institute
an inquiry this was uh towards the end
of 2021 when he started making the
statement funnily he never made such
statements in 18 in 19 in 20 in 21 end
of 21 he started making certain wild
delegations immediately I wrote two to
the government government responded by
instituting an inquiry in 2022 April
these cases I said actual conspiracy as
to Gunners why these two cancellations
I actually demanded it
then an inquiry has been instituted
handed over a case was handed over to
CBI CBI has been investigating the
matter we all submitted our statements
we all gave our uh statements to them
they have spoken to Mr Malik also
ideally after the case was being
investigated by a CBI Mr Malik should
not have talked about it
I am not talking about it
for that one reason we have given our
statement we because we I myself
demanded inquiry I gave whatever I have
to say the reality is totally opposite
of what Miss Malik is saying that whole
fact we gave to them CBA secondly today
since I showed a notice for defamation I
would rather say whatever I have to say
in the quote
definitely when we file the deformation
case because it's a patent
understatement it's definitely damaging
to a person like me but it is better to
learn true well he's not stopping at you
he's going to I think everybody in the
BJP he also so I think that pan Malik
but there is a disclosure here very
important disclosure that a CV inquiry
is also going on at Push by the uh at
your request I would say if I may say
that uh into the matter so we'll wait
and see what happens and what uh
develops on that front but on the Rises

more secure and the alliance much
stronger on the broadcast without Suresh
Kumar goyal former diploma thank you so
much Ambassador goyal for staying on sir
your first Thoughts with regards to this
invite that has been extended for NATO
well as we all know Sweden and Finland
are the other two countries which have
been trying to join NATO over the last
one year came in the way finally they
have agreed to electrol and join Sweden
uh again I have my doubts whether turkey
will agree immediately as well as
Hungary because of the positions taken
by Sweden for the human rights matters
in the different Torah which actually
does or go against the views of turkey
and other countries uh this is number
one number two point really here is NATO
is a security organization and and
therefore my expectation would be that
the work of natural should focus on
maintaining peace and stability in
Europe I really wonder and I think there
is a question which everybody needs to
answer whether expansion of NATO by
including Sweden and Finland and so on
so forth are that is actually going to
improve Security in Europe or is it
going to you going to encourage and or
lead to more confrontation and security
problems in Europe my thinking is that
it is it is a retrograde prep to certain
security of other nations which is not
the right thing to do
as far as Lloyd Austin's visit to Sweden
is concerned of course uh he's
reiterated his support for Sweden's
membership
um also said that is going to make
Europe stronger what do you think so do
you think that this is the United States
trying to beat other nations to join
NATO because in the past we've also seen
United Nations extend that sort of an
invite to India now although these are
two completely different circumstances
to talk about Europe and you've been
talking about Europe when we talk about
Sweden Etc
um and India is completely separate but
why do you think Southern United States
at this point wants more Nations member
states to join NATO
uh for United Nations uh even though in
1991 with the disinfiguration of the
farmer Soviet Union the thought was that
the security in Europe has been loved as
such as but clearly not because the USA
does say that Europe should become
entirely an area of influence for the
USA and this is going to be difficult
for Russia to really live with uh so
this contest between Russia and USA will
continue forever
China is an arid factor which has not
come into the into the dynamic China and
Russia friendship is going to put
further pressure on the USA on the whole
the situation is going to become
increasingly complex
so let us see how it goes
all right to stay on with US ambassador
let me also rope in Colonel JS sodhi who
is still with us on the broadcast
Colonel sodi your thoughts as far as
this invite that is being extended by
the United States to Sweden is concerned
uh what is your take on it sir
before it broke that they will not
expand Nato one inch Eastward but
America did not talk to his promise and
kept on increasing its NATO membership
so this itself you know is a is a wrong
thing to happen because once the
Assurance was given and NATO is
expanding this is a with a clear aim to
encircle Russia from all sides and if
today we look at the ongoing Russia
Ukraine war the main reason has been you
know the expansion of NATO so as NATO is
expanding as its Nation members are
expanding it is a dangerous sign for the
world because there is only one military
Alliance which is so powerful today in
the world and that is NATO and if it
keeps on increasing it will uh you know
create a lot of problems for the other
nations as well I feel that you know USA
should have kept up its word of 9th
February 1990 not expanded now that it
has done it should put an end to it now
so that peace and prosperity once again
come through the world for more such

bullets on that Army Convoy as used by

well let's see multiple shots were fired
from the the terrorist side when they
attacked this Army uh vehicle in the uh
in the Bata Forest Area when it was
moving towards uh rajouri from the BG uh
BG area and it it seems that there are
possibility that there were multiple uh
you know terrorists those who were there
at that time when they have attacked
this vehicle because the three side of
the vehicle has been attacked and they
have uh received marks of the bullets
that indicates that there is possibility
the multiple uh terrorists at that place
two to three terrorists were there and
they attacked this uh vehicle and then
they loved grenade and some chemical
kind of grenade was used by the
terrorists to basically Target the

explosion took place with that vehicle
caught fire and the uh the the Army
personal those who were inside the

Z1wdAiggCoc,Jaish-E-Mohammed Claims Responsibility for Terror Attack | Time For India To Crackdown? | NewsX,Jaish-E-Mohammed Claims Responsibility for Terror Attack | Time For India To Crackdown? | NewsX's Paridhi Bhanot with more.,2023-04-21T05:22:16Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z1wdAiggCoc/hqdefault.jpg,"ahead of the heart-wrenching terror
attack that took place in punch late
last evening where an army vehicle was
attacked by terrorists when it was
moving between bhimbar Gully and punt in
the rajouri sector reports have stated
that terrorist group jeshe Muhammad's
offshoot People's anti-fascist Front has
carried out the attack and claimed
responsibility for the terrorist attack
on the Indian army vehicle amid all of
this the big question now is the
rather the fact is that Jesse Mohammed
leader Masood Azhar continues to live in
Pakistan
one of the biggest Most Wanted
terrorists on the face of the Earth fine
Safe Haven not very far from India our
neighboring country Pakistan is Chief
Masood
is as we speak today right now
the question that then arises viewers is
is it time that a major Crackdown is
conducted on Jesse Muhammad on Masood
Azhar and the pressure is put not just
from India but from Nations across the
world and is it time that saving
Pakistani terrorists is done by China
time and again is stopped let's discuss
this
joining us on the broadcast now we have
Ajay chandrayal our Jammu bureau chief
Ajay
what can you tell us about this offshoot
of Muhammad that has taken
responsibility for this terror attack
why don't we start by asserting the role
of jai Shri Muhammad in this entire
incident Ajay over to you
another attack was carried out to a by
the Jason moment you know uh you know uh
Professor anti-fascist front where that
clearly indicates that it was a
pre-planned attack and they were already
having a tout over here and then they
opened foreign army vehicle and then uh
you know planned this attack over over
here in the Army uh troops over there
that indicates that that uh Muhammad You
Know Chief is sitting in Pakistan and
he's continuously been you know given
instruction by the Pakistani army and
the intelligence agency isi to carito
carried such attacks in the German
Kashmir and especially ahead of a G20
meeting I mean we already know that how
Pakistan went frustrated when this
decision was taken by the German Kashmir
by the union government that G20 meeting
will held over here in the Kashmir is on
20 uh 2 and 24 of uh this may so that
clearly indicates that when Pakistan is
frustrated because Pakistan knows that
if such meetings over uh will be
conducted here in the German Kashmir
then it gave a message to the world
community that see that the situation is
uh completely normal in the German
Kashmir that doesn't suit to Pakistan so
that's why it indicates that Pakistan is
behind this attack and Pakistan is
continuously planning understand the
German Kashmir they are continues trying
to disturb peace over here in the German
Kashmir which is prevailing after the
application of 370.
all right and Ajay you know as far as
Masood Azhar is concerned let's also
talk about
is the chief of Muhammad he's been
living in Pakistan for years now what do
we know about Masood Azhar and his life
in Pakistan as it is
well see this is not for the first time
when this name of jashem Muhammad came
in the light that they have carried out
this attack planned it planned this
attack in the German Kashmir in the past
also so many times you know dojos was
given to Pakistan about the when Walmart
you know took place that Dozier was
submitted to Pakistan that uh Muhammad
Chief is behind that attack other than
that we have seen that when uh URI
attack took place there even at that
time the documents and the proofs were
shared with the Pakistan and the world
Community but nothing was done by
Pakistan Pakistan uh always claimed that
they want peace uh uh peaceful
neighboring neighbors but what Pakistan
is doing is you know behest of uh you
know uh doing it uh you know Pakistan is
continuously pushing terrorists over
here they are continuously spreading
terrorism they are sending drones to
drop the weapons and the drugs in the
German Kashmir that clearly indicates
that Pakistan is planning it uh and
trying to uh you know repeat these
things again and again no doubt that
ceasefires
violation is not taking place Pakistan
have agreed for the ceasefire on the
borders but you know amid this ceasefire
while the ceasefire agreement what
Pakistan is doing they are continuously
trying to push the terrorist over here
in the job in Kashmir only a few days
back there was a infiltration attempt in
the same punch District in which one
terrorist was gun done by the security
forces and why are two terrorists were
apprehended alive so that indicates that
number of attempts which is taking place
here in the German Kashmir from the
border from the line of control that is
that have increased and this is all what
happening only after the instruction and
the guidance of the Pakistani
intelligence is ncisi and the Pakistani
army because these terrorists those who
try to infiltrate to this side they
always get support from the Pakistan
Army uh when they you know stay there on
the borders in the Pakistani army
position so that indicates that this is
nothing but a glove in a hand of a
terrorists in the Pakistani army and
that's why Pakistan Pakistan is a
terrorist State and they always try to
spread terrorism here in the German and
other part of the country as well
all right Ajay do stay on with us please
we have some more details that are
emerging from uh the ground which is
going to address them in a minute but
for now Colonel JS sodhi a defense
expert also joining us on the broadcast
kernel sodi
um so the big question that we're asking
on news X is should Bilal Bhutto the
foreign minister of Pakistan be allowed
to attend the SEO Summit the SEO meeting
scheduled to be held in Goa next month
um the question of course arises after
the attack that has taken place on the
on the Indian army Convoy late last
evening and um this is this is my first
and only question to you sir for now
being the foreign minister of a country
which is part of this forum you know has
a right to attend you know so does the
foreign minister of China though though
you know we we know that Pakistan and
China have always waged a war against
India be it a conventional War be it a
proxy war through terrorism but the fact
remained that within a foreign minister
of a nation which is part of this uh
Alliance or this you know organization I
think he should be allowed to come
because our enmity is separate this is
international Forum in case we uh we ban
blah puto's coming to India for this uh
you know meet it will send wrong signals
and it will paint India and the you know
bad light
all right so do stay on with us the
group Captain UK devnath also joins us
on the broadcast to Captain so your
thoughts um do you think that Bilal
Bhutto should be allowed to uh in fact
uh be visiting India and you know the
big questions sir I've already post this
to you before I'm going to reiterate
this for our viewers Muhammad Chief
Masood Azhar continues to live and
thrive in Pakistan
um where does that leave us sir
chief continues to thrive and live
inside Pakistan
is known to Indian agencies very well
because uh you see he was in India he
was captured by Indian security forces
in Kashmir in 1994 he was in for five
years he was in jail but after 1999
um
hijacking of our aircraft
uh during negotiation he was released in
2000 uh in year 2002 Pakistan and after
going to Pakistan he was held by
Pakistan's intelligence agencies isi
included for setting up uh jayasha
Muhammad now a fact remains that all
over the world Muhammad has been banned
USA UK EU United Nation everywhere jaesh
is that has been recognized as a terror
outfit
difficulty is whenever fatf meat comes
up Pakistan makes some sounds showing
that he is trying to Pakistan as if
Pakistan is trying to control these
sterile groups and as soon as
fetf meeting is over and Pakistan last
year was taken out of the great list
they again start giving incentive giving
start giving incentives to these people
um Indian intelligencies agencies had
prepared a Dozier last year and we
handed over to all the visiting
dignitaries from Western countries last
year but Pakistan's in response has
claimed that
does not live in Pakistan he is in fact
hiding somewhere in the mountains of
Afghanistan
um so probably the very soon
intelligence communities will catch up
with his existence wherever he is hiding
in Afghanistan or most probably in
Pakistan we will locate him and um uh
give his this input to
um Interpol and other civilized police
agencies in world difficulty you see
parida what happens Israeli is known for
heart kill of terrorists Israel
follows a policy where wherein any
um terrorist organization leader or
terrorist organization activities
activists is changed all around the
globe he may hide in South America he
may hide in some part of remote part of
Africa Israel mosa chases him
and uh carries out his neutralization
India being a very very civilized
country we are not resorting to these uh
tactics
a lot presently it depends upon what
will be the future the course of action
followed by General munir I hope that
now that Bilal Bhutto is coming to India
he must have come with the blessings of
general munir and general munir appears
to be a little
um
a less harsh with India I am very sure
that genuine munir will push Pakistan
establishment to maintain a closely with
India and slowly win away from a
terrorist organization because
um General has said twice including
while he was addressing the candidates
of Pakistan Army during their parting
out parade that Park Army wants to
remain away from politicizing from
meddling in the politics of Pakistan
I mean the difficulties Muhammad gets
huge amount of support from Taliban they
are also linked with Al-Qaeda and their
total focus is confined to Kashmir only
they want to unify Kashmir
um you know like what we call Pok Park
occupied Kashmir uh they call it
yes from his headquarters he keeps doing
funny funny things
are improving very soon we will get
grips of Joshua and probably Masood Azar
will be caught captured and Justice will
be done to him yes parida
yes sir
um of course that is the the that is the
hope that the terrorists responsible for
this cowardly attack are brought to book
uh but for now uh thank you so much for
joining us to stay on with us dosa
also with us on the broadcast is uh
Ambassador Suresh Kumar goyal who's been
a former diploma thank you so much
Ambassador goyal for joining us on the
broadcast so of course um you know
multiple angles that we've been
discussing the first of course being uh
that the attack yesterday
was carried out by an offshoot of jaise
Muhammad funded aided by none other than
the chief Masood azer who's living in
Pakistan on the other hand sir we have
Pakistan's foreign minister bilawal
Bhutto visiting India next month fourth
and fifth of May for an SEO meeting in
Goa
um so how do you view these two
developments do you think that India
needs to be taking a strong stance as
far as no terrorism anti-terrorism
um is concerned your thoughts sir
uh so much has been discussed in the
last five minutes of this particular
item so I will be very brief
is coming to play part in Shanghai
cooperation organization meeting not
because of participation only yes our
invitation of course has gone from but
SEO is very important to China
and China would like to see Pakistan
present in the beating but India is
presiding over it and therefore is
coming because of their friendship with
China because of Chinese agenda and the
SEO where they want to reassert their
influence in Central Asia Republic
number one number two
uh the explosion
in both in Jammu and Kashmir
has twin purposes one is to disrupt the
G20 meeting that India is holding in
Jammu and Kashmir
on on tourism to disrupt that and number
two to send a message to the world that
India is not able to control terrorism
related activity in one of its important
areas therefore India has to respond in
a very firm manner and that I will again
say should have trained for thin angle
one to deal with this as a low end order
situation through the Army and police in
Japan Kashmir arrest all those who were
involved punish them number two
check the link with those who are
located in Pakistan pafs and Muhammad
then do this to our own Security Agency
we don't need to always go for very
overt armed action there are other ways
to deal with it where the risk and the
retaliation are lower and I think the
government of India should resort to
those tactics rather than an open armed
escalation for more such videos

investigation agency is all set to visit
the punt site in Jammu and Kashmir where
the explosion took place late last
evening
getting all the latest from the ground
since late last evening Ajay over to you
help us understand where does the
national investigation agency stand as
far as this probe is concerned have they
officially now taken over the case is
Nia going to be probing this or is this
just an explosive expert of the Nia that
is going to be coming to Jammu and
Kashmir
well see that is what our sources are
saying that explosive experts expert Dr
biswani uh he is likely to reach a punch
uh the spot where that incident has
taken place and he's a expert in the
explosive so that is uh why he's
visiting the spot to uh definitely
collect the samples as well because we
have seen that most of the terror
attacks which took place here in the
German Kashmir their case was later
handled over to the National
investigation agencies so it is possible
that in the coming time this case will
also be handled over to the National
investigation agency and in advance
their teams are visiting the spot to
collect evidence and uh to uh we can say
that startup parallel inquiry till this
is handled over to the National
investigation agency as we know that at
this at this you know this seems to be a
cross-border uh you know uh cross-border
uh plan of Pakistan because we have seen
that even in the past whenever this
Terror these Terror attacks took place
in the Dominic Kashmir what in the
investigation was found that the
Pakistan is a basically using the local
you know touts and Tennis to carry out
these attacks here in the Dominic
Kashmir but everything was planned there
in the Pakistan so that's why National
investigation agencies can investigate
it you know more effectively as well as
to uh to definitely uh that they can
also investigate into very perfectly so
that's why it is expected that that in
the coming days the case will be handled
over to the National investigation
agency and that's why the parallel uh we
can say that investigation of an ien
that's why Nia teams are you know uh
expected to reach the spot
of course sorry for interrupting you you
know you're telling us that ni teams are
going to be reaching the sport in just a
short while but meanwhile uh we've been
given to understand that bomb bomb
disposal squads as well as the FSL teams
have now reached the spot of the
incident they're going to be collecting
samples in order to a certain what sort
of a bomb was used what were the key
idioms that were used in this bomb the
make who it is that uses these kind of
Weaponry
um so lots of developments taking place
on the ground as well simultaneously as
we speak
um thank you so much for joining us on
the broadcast and getting us all of
these latest developments meanwhile we
also have meeta Mohammed Alisha joining
us on the broadcast he of course is a
defense expert has served in the Indian
army fairs now um thank you so much sir
for joining us on the broadcast so your
first reactions to what has happened and
where you think the probe should be
headed from here
extremely disturbing you know about
what's happened and when this happened
it happened in the evening and at night
I was with the Army Chief and I in fact
with the generals with the top Brothers
I was there with them in the evening and
we discussed this and we spoke about we
have very very disturbed extremely hurt
about this and uh it should be arranged
we should be we should know we should
get to know the investigation is is on
it was by unknown uh we haven't
discovered as yet who uh the attackers
were but let me tell you let me assure
everyone that these attackers are not
going Spot Free they took advantage of
the Heavy Rain the poor visibility well
if they took advantage of that we will
take double advantage of that
if they think they can get away with
just because they are they don't know
what they are in for so my first
reaction is Anger of course and I am
very very deeply pain like all of us for
losing out our brave arts and it is
going to be Avenged for sure I mean this
kind of a cowardly attack is just I mean
uh not done no ethics no Warfare ethics
no I mean even I have seven Northeast by
the absolute jnk and Northeast in Back
to the entire area where did it happen I
am so familiar with this I have spent
two years out fighting contents agency
before ceasefire and when ceasefire took
place as well so this entire area is
very very well known for me the entire
stereo is very well known for me it is
very very difficult terrain no doubt and
uh but the stairs over there and let's
see let's borderline is where does
terrorism come from where the root cause
who Harbors terrorism
it is Pakistan and so all the terrorists
they come from there and they think they
can get away with things but they will
not get away
I have some of the Northeast
in the Northeast the insurgents we do
not even call them Terrors we call them
Insurgent in the Northeast because even
they have certain ethics and principles
they don't even get into uh in the
suicide attacks and such things yeah we
have the most cowardly attacks the most
dark disasterly attacks so my first
reaction is of course very very uh I'm
very very angry and uh uh yeah I mean I
I discussed this with the top browser as
well in the evening I was with them and
I we were very very disturbed about it
very very perturbed about it the entire
not just the Army Community the veteran

intelligence inputs about Terror attacks
before Eid and the G20 Summit in
Srinagar and we've also been told that
sources have now confirmed terrorists
fired upon the army truck from at least
three sides
joining us on the broadcast now for more
on the story my colleague Ajay jandyal
our Jammu bureau chief
Ajay can you hurt me
yes yes I can all right AJ can you just
very quickly talk us through what these
inputs were that would receive sources
are now telling us that we had inputs
that before Eid as well as G20 there
were terrorist attacks that were being
planned in the valley
um what more details are you Gathering
from your sources
foreign
terrorists they could try to disturb
peace in the German Kashmir ahead of a
G20 meeting as well as the you know
ahead of this Eid UL uh Eid uh here in
the Dominic Kashmir and that's why a lot
was founded and we have seen that round
of meetings took place here in the
German Kashmir where where a special
secretary International Security of mha
she participated and she took the
meeting uh she had a meeting the samba
District we have seen that number of
meetings in the Kashmir as well and also
and DJ and I was here in the German
Kashmir for a few days back and
definitely he must be here to uh
for the same but the thing is that even
after that when this incident has taken
place that basically shocks the our
country and the people over here because
uh the Pakistan's nefarious plan of
doing such act over here in the German
Kashmir that is well known to everyone
and especially they used to carry out
such kind of attack which basically uh
you know which basically create a Havoc
over here which can it's Panic among the
people as well because if you see that
security 4C vehicle was going and it was
a suicide kind of attack it seems that
they have used some uh explosive as well
as the uh Terrace open fire and the
vehicle and then they went uh towards
the forest side that that is what the
possibilities are our searches are on
and the ongoing forces they have gotten
up that area to ensure that if anybody
is hiding in the forest area they can be
uh they can be traced and then
neutralized there in that area our FSL
team and uh the bump Squad of team of
the German kashmi police and army
they're on the spot to collect evidence
from the spot so that they can get some
more information about the explosive was
used which kind of explosives are used
by the terrorists in this attack because
right after that explosion took place in
the vehicle that vehicle caught fire
which basically resulted in um burn
injuries to the jawans as well
you know as far as as far as more
details are concerned we've also been
given to understand that the army truck
was fired upon from at least three sides
um what do we know about this so far
pardon please repeat the question Ajay
if you can hear me we've been given to
understand that the army truck was fired
upon by terrorists from at least three
sides uh do we have any idea with
regards to how many terrorists there
were that were fighting they were firing
on the army truck in fact do we have any
details with regards to the revolvers or
the ammunition that was used what more
do we know
well see uh the the visuals which
basically what uh can be seen uh you
know uh which can be seen over here uh
on the ground and especially the the
marks of the bullets on the vehicle that
clay clearly clearly indicates that uh
there is possibility of the multiple
terrorists in that attack because the
three side firing uh they can be seen on
the vehicle so that is why it is uh
seems that there is possibility that two
to three terrorists was there and they
opened fire on the vehicle and then they
locked grenade as well uh so this is
what exactly the the matter of
investigation and the forces and the
agencies they are investigating the
matters but uh but the priority of the
security agencies is to uh corner of
that area search that area to ensure
that if terrorists are hiding in that
area they has to be traced and
neutralized as soon as possible for more

tK4884XLiBs,Credit Suisse Blocking Nazi Account Probe | Why No Outrage Against This?,"It was one thing to be involved in money laundering, being involved with Bulgarian drug rings, investments INF fraudulent ...",2023-04-20T16:08:10Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tK4884XLiBs/hqdefault.jpg,"it's one thing to be involved in money
laundering with Bulgarian truck sinks
investment fraudulent companies and
Espionage cases it's quite another to
loot the money of the victims of
Holocaust
a damning report Into the Now defunct
Credit Suisse alleges that the Bank
Authorities obstructed the probe into
the Nazi accounts investigation Credit
Suisse maintained that the accounts for
at least 99 individuals they were all
affiliate affiliated
to the members of the Nazi group or they
were senior members of the Nazi group
and
the U.S lawmakers have pointed out that
figures that are linked to Credit Suisse
for impeding an investigation into its
historical assistance to the Nazis
Credit Suisse had failed to return
assets to the survivors of Hitler's
genocide and their heirs and not just
that victims whose assets had been
loaded by the Nazis were then deposited
in this Swiss bank I'm going to open up
this discussion Ambassador Mukherjee on
The Telecast with me first question to
you doesn't it become a human rights
issue
with Credit Suisse being under the
scanner for keeping accounts of 99
Nazi Affiliated groups individuals and
they were survivors monies that were
looted by the Nazis during the genocide
that have thus far not been returned to
their kin
Mega it is well known
that the number would be much more than
99.
I actually served in Geneva for six
years for the UN for human rights
actually
and even at that time way back it was
well known that part of Switzerland's uh
Prosperity afford from the asset of
victims of the Holocaust
whose assets were looted
including paintings Treasures Etc
jewelry they were kept in the fixed
deposit of credit Suite in addition
they were very high ranking Nazi
officials not one as the news report
says but many who were indicted or
executed post Nuremberg
whose accounts some of them were open
till a few years ago
which is interesting because in
Switzerland like in India and I can tell
you because I had a Swiss bank account
for 20 years if you do not operate your
account for more than two years like in
India it gets frozen so how interesting
that an executed Nazi Commander's
account remained open for so many years
after his execution maybe because the
Credit Suisse authorities were using
this money for investment for the
prosperity of the bank and for
Switzerland it's as simple as that and
Dr Sharad Kohli is here with us I'm sure
he will he will explain this better than
me but what I'm trying to tell you is
that it is even more ironical as you so
correctly pointed out that the Human
Rights Council and its predecessor the
Human Rights Commission are situated in
Geneva
and the Swiss are always highly
sanctimonious about human rights about
child rights in India about Labor rights
about poverty related issues about human
rights violations flowing out of poverty
Etc but sitting right there and are you
trying to tell me Vega that this is not
known by the Israelis that this is not
known by the Americans the entire West
knows all about it the entire West knows
how Switzerland escaped being
swallowed by Nazi Germany because it was
just too convenient a place
small mountainous prosperous and very
Germanic ninety percent of Switzerland
is very Germanic a very useful place
to keep the loot of the Nazis
it's neutral
very neutral extremely neutral towards
the Holocaust and towards Germany at
to give them their credit they did allow
some Jewish very very uh famous Jews to
escape from Germany to Switzerland I
know that because I lived for six years
in the house of that gentleman and his
wife the husband that died the wife was
with she rented her part of her house
out to me so he escaped the Holocaust by
train and he survived in Switzerland so
to give you to give credit to the Swiss
some of them did give some uh Comfort to
the Jews but to most of the those who
died in those terrible concentration
camps most of the loot was there now
where it has gone since then makes it a
very very interesting question just as
interesting as India's Treasures that
are lying in the British Museum and in
and in the Victorian Albert Museum in
the world especially in the world and
here too the walls of the Credit Suisse
if they are opened up will show you
megha the millions and millions and
millions of that of those who died
terrible death in the concentration camp
so I'm glad that for one it's all coming
out and I'm glad that the Americans are
doing it because the Americans for years
knew where all this loot was and so did
frankly the Israel
Ambassador you make very strong points
pertinent points and that obviously
reflects why the natural inclination of
the Swiss Credit Suisse Bank to then
allow for Nazi accounts to operate up
until this state
uh Professor nalapath besides being a
human rights violation there has been no
Focus whatsoever that has been initiated
and it has only been highlighted once
Credit Suisse has been taken over by
another Swiss bigger Bank what does this
indicate
well it clearly indicates that Credit
Suisse has a lot to hide as the
Ambassador very correctly said and may I
point out Mega that the Nazis came to
power in Germany in 1933 but by around
1930 34 35 it was clear that they were
basically indulging in unspeakable
atrocities against the Jewish community
and against other communities that were
hostile to them for example the the
former the Communists those who are
members the Communist party or the
Social Democratic party the this was
very well known it at and after that may
I point out sadly let me say that the
Nazis were made stronger and stronger
right from 1933 onwards until they
launched the world into a world war in
1939
by
companies and individuals in the U.S and
in Europe
they including Britain may I point out
um Nazis will welcome visitors to
several of the country homes of
distinguished British Aristocrats for a
very long time even after Czechoslovakia
was swallowed up for a very long time
they were welcome visitors and this is
the point that the Nazis were basically
their human rights violations which
well taking place in plain sight the
Nazis were not hiding the fact that they
were doing unspeakable atrocities
against the Jewish people at that point
in time they were not taking them away
to be killed but short of that they were
dispossessing their assets they were
humiliating them on the streets they
were making them you know scrub the
Pavements all kinds of atrocities were
being done in plain sight and can I tell
you how many countries protested to
Germany not see Germany about this how
many countries in North America how many
countries in Europe countries which are
supposed to be the you know they regard
themselves as the fount of civilization
the answer is none no country really
officially created any kind of any
problem about this I am sorry to say
that some religious entities also they
signed agreements with the Nazi party uh
government and they also just looked the
other way where this was going on yeah
so Credit Suisse knew very well these
were the proceeds of murder these were
the proceeds of genocide and at the very
least these were the proceeds of theft
and yet they welcomed them because for
them their motto was it doesn't matter
if it is blood money it doesn't matter
if millions of human beings are dead
because of the money but what matters is
the money and the more money the bank
gets the more the shareholders get that
was the narrow approach of Credit Suisse
and it's a good thing that this is now
slowly slowly finally coming to light
okay then um rabindra is there any
action that can be anticipated human
rights violations that have been now
committed by Credit Suisse it's now
defunct unfortunately uh will UBS have
to face the music and also as Ambassador
Mukherjee said that the United Nations
Human Rights Council which is in Geneva
is it then going to take action
thank you so much Mega great discussion
uh one short answer to your first
question I do think that yes UBS will
have to take some steps because what has
happened Credit Suisse had initiated an
internal inquiry about two years ago
with an ombudsman and Credit Suisse has
been supporting that inquiry due to
which and this inquiry was ordered uh
internally but under pressure from the
weisenthal museum in the U.S right which
which you know looks into issues of the
Holocaust of the Jews and all and now
American Senators uh I think Chuck
Grassley has asked that uh Credit Suisse
has not been cooperating has been
obstructing this inquiry so I think one
short thing is that this inquiry even if
it's absorbed within UBS it will be
conducted one secondly you see there's a
larger pattern to create a Swiss credit
Swiss has over
I mean its entire existence you can say
or especially in the last 30 40 years
facing a lot of scandals facing or has
created a lot of scandals which have
come into under the microscope you know
they've been laundering money on the
Japanese Mafia
they've been laundering money of the
Bulgarian drug dealers they've been
laundering money from Mozambique and
working with dictators in Africa they've
been working with officials in Hong Kong
in a jobs for business deals now these
scandals have been emerging every now
and then
there have been too many scandals around
this bank and it started also by the way
with respect to Holocaust I think in the
early 90s there was one settlement that
they made of about 1.4 billion dollars
or Euros or so right so that was one
settlement they made in the early 90s
then
tax evasion the American Regulators find
them about 600 million dollars around
2010 or 11 for tax evasion or helping
Americans away taxes right they've been
doing the same thing with Germans so the
bank and so that I mean looking at the
bank the bank has been prone to too many
scandals many banks fail because of
miscalculation of riskers Dr gollywood
very well articulate but Credit Suisse
failure when it came down came down to
having too many scandals and investors
losing trust that it can come out of the
next Scandal so to say yeah and last two
three years you know there was Rumors in
the markets and some big bank is going
to fail which one was it it was being
rumored or whispered it will be created
Swiss and lo behold that's what happened
to Greater Swiss so Credit Credit Suisse
has a culture of hiding its uh hiding
its accountability and to Professor
valpaper's point exactly like serving
the returns of their shareholders
whichever way they can get the money in
the door you know be the bankers to you
know such uh pockets of money or sources
of money and make your dividends
taking on the points
what's rabindra said about the defaults
that have been regularly made by Credit
Suisse with regards to money laundering
with regards to defaults that it made an
involvement with Bulgarian drug Rings
there is there is also Espionage cases
against him and then Investments being
put from fraudulent companies which have
since then uh completely vanished Into
Thin Air because because of the
fraudulence because they could not keep
up the appearances now the latest one
with regards to these Nazi members and
their accounts being put up and their
money being rigged up by Credit Suisse
again the question will UBS will have to
bear the brunt and what actions will be
taken by the world community
well I think the mega UBS should be
knowing what it has adopted when you
adopt a child uh which is Tainted which
has got a checkered past you've got to
be prepared with uh with the paint
coming on you as well well not that I
would I would say UBS is completely
clean as of today we don't know because
until today Credit Suisse was supposed
to be a very very clean large Bank in
fact it turned out to be a discredit
switch not a Credit Suisse it was a
discredited Swiss for that matter you
know with the facts coming out the 1.25
billion dollar a deal which uh rabindra
referred to
this happened about a quarter of a
century ago and uh to my mind maker this
was an eye wash
and I watch for what because it wanted
to take in all the investments in return
it paid a compensation where it very
well knew that in lieu of this money it
can get billions and billions of dollars
of Nazi money especially for those 99
individuals all the numbers are more iot
with Ambassador Booker G that the
numbers are far more but the highlighted
99 individuals the Nazi uh guys you know
whose illegitimate money shall I say
rooted money has been parked in in a
Credit Suisse Mega uh you know a moral
of a story which I once met in school
was that somebody was crying for a pair
of shoes until I met somebody who did
not have legs now we were crying all
this while for tax evasion from India
you know I had heard stories of you know
these stress Bank Representatives coming
to India in various big Indian cities
collecting stacks of cash converting
them through hawala being deposited in
Swiss bank accounts so a classic case of
tax service
well little did we know that it was not
just tax evasion it was it was a case of
far more than tax evasion there was
illegitimate money coming in there was
looted money coming in there was there
was crime driven money going into the
bank so I think tax evasion becomes a
much smaller crime maker in front of the
crimes which are nine now coming to the
surface so I think I agree with you but
also also you know uh with what gumption
could the then Credit Suisse could
collude with Hindenburg and uh
cast aspersions on the adani group of
companies and decided not to fund the
adani group of companies uh when when
its checkered past showcases that it has
not only had criminal past not only had
Investments with criminals they were
like you said Bulgarian drug rings that
it was involved with but also unethical
money that was pouring into so so what
what ethics uh is Credit Suisse talking
about when it takes over the money of
the survivors of the
Holocaust and then decided decided to
keep it to itself and not return them
well because there are no ethics there
as I said I mean I call it the
discreditsues I mean let me not even
call it Credit Suisse for now because
there's nothing to the credit I mean
there's nothing if we take the other
meaning of credit they they don't
deserve credit for nothing for that
matter the three billion dollar deal
done with UBS the recent takeover by UBS
uh megha is just eye wash it is just to
give credibility to the brand name the
so-called brand name and inverted
Commerce I would say which they had
built across the world that if there is
a Credit Suisse involved so I think
people who are now uh believing the
Hindenburg report people who are now
hell-bent on demeaning the Indian
businessmen they must take cues from the
the relationship between Hindenburg and
the discredited Suite shall I say and
they should start believing and
inquiring into what is happening at the
back end because somebody who lives in
glass house should not be throwing
stones at others this is the classic
case of your own checkered past it's in
question yeah your own your own
legitimacy is in question and you've
begun to investigate and comment and
probably discredit and demean a business
group I think this puts a question mark
if you ask me uh Mega this puts a
question mark on the whole Hindenburg
report from the beginning
I'm again going to going to take the
unethical moral question that Credit
Suisse and its authorities and its heads
and chairpersons obviously disregarded
why should India not raise this matter
in the United Nations Human Rights
Commission why should we keep mum with
regards to the moral
discredit that
Swiss Credit Suisse has done in Wake of
the Holocaust victims that were
completely sidelined
we should first of all highlight
the double standards of the West
for instance
the recent attacks on the adani group
which were deliberate again I would say
Dr Polly knows more than I but it will
deliberate and it was intended in a way
to lower our GDP level it was actually
an attack on the Indian economy now
adanis were attacked
but ever since I can remember and I was
in Switzerland from 91 to 97. it's a
long time to stay all alone I knew the
whole issue backwards everybody who who
lived in Switzerland or in the West
and also the Latin the argentinians ETC
everybody knew where the loot was
stashed right sure then you have to ask
yourself the question Mega that why did
people not ask any questions perhaps
because their prosperity flowed from
these hidden deposits maybe their money
was being used for other nefarious
activities but how come that those who
destroyed the concentration camp those
who brought Hitler down
how come they didn't take any action
that is the point we should highlight
it's not really the UN yeah we should
everywhere we should talk about double
standards and we should say that there
should be a full and open investigation
into this whole Credit Suisse Affairs
and my own feeling is
that it's come out now because Credit
Suisse has been brought out
and if there is litigation and if there
is a call for compensation and this
particular Institute which has published
the report is highly influential and
very rich and you have a very
influential Jewish Lobby in United
States who's also very prosperous if
they get after credit speech and those
who brought out get its credit fees
some Swiss banks will surely go bankrupt
100 bigger yeah that's no danger to
India from the adani but there is great
danger to Swiss Prosperity if there is a
huge human cry a scandal and a demand
which raises the question again megha
that just as the timing of the adanis
attack on adani is very curious just
before our general election this
exposure of Credit Suisse its timing is
also very curious yeah and now much more
will come out in the days and weeks to
come
also very interesting to note that why
had thus far only after Credit Suisse
got bankrupt and had been taken over a
USB that there is a report that has come
out that the U.S Senate has taken action
and come out with these allegations and
charges against Credit Suisse why was it
not done several years ago
well Megan that's a very fair question
uh I'd like to remind you that if you go
to different consumptions many countries
in Europe you will find houses that are
occupied by uh by by by different people
who that houses that once belong to the
Jewish members the Jewish Community who
were forcibly removed from those houses
and who frankly were killed now I have
myself for example gone to two or three
locations where I you know I asked I
mean there's a magnificent Hall here uh
they said yes yes it was a synagogue you
know before the war and of course they
never wanted to you know to to discuss
the matter further but what is very very
clear is that the owners of that
synagogue were killed they disappeared
and you have millions of Jewish people
who simply disappeared and their houses
their properties sometimes their
companies or they they continued to to
to exist and until today I I'm not I'm
not at all sure that any serious effort
has gone on to try and identify if at
least if there are no enough family
members left because entire families
were entire families were killed off at
least you know in in the cause of for
example some kind of a humanitarian
cause the these this kind of property
that is has been seized from people who
are being led to the to the gas Chambers
could be used for humanitarian purpose
yeah I want to say one thing Mega that
unfortunately these Swiss the Swiss
banking system and it's very curious as
soon as reports came in India and Indian
media about you know of that a large
number of Indians are having accounts in
Swiss banks all of a sudden you found
that you know you had a large number of
people going to London or somewhere else
and then making a side trip to
Switzerland
and and after some time the report came
that the amount of money by Indians in
Swiss banks is almost nothing so the
money simply disappeared in other words
the deficit simply disappeared so that
because the people who are responsible
they wanted to avoid with them being
found out and they went and changed
their names or whatever and in that way
they escape Justice in India although
the government of India the present
government was trying their hardest to
uh to catch them the point is the crime
networks the narcotics networks all
these networks not on the basis of money
and they keep their money safely in
entities without a conscience like
Credit Suisse so in a sense these you
know these kind of agencies these kind
these so-called respectable Banks their
accessories of crime and in a way they
are responsible for the crimes that are
committed by those who give their money
saved in these Banks and who use that
money for for furthering the cause of
crime right you're absolutely right but
but again I'm going to keep my focus on
uh the Nazi money and the victims of the
Holocaust and their can who have not
received the money that was their due
and then then when you UBS is going to
take forth the charge of Credit Suisse
here on then Robin
should it become the responsibility of
UBS to then finally give the money to
the people who is due
uh thank you very much yeah I mean on
the face of it I would assume it
absolutely comes down to the UBS because
it's it has acquired uh you know the
both of the assets and liabilities and
whatsoever it be of credit switch to its
fold so whatever the liabilities are do
you out there have to be complied with
that's UBS by the way regarding UBS it
is now being said you know we've heard
our term A banks too big to fail now
what's becoming UBS could become a bank
which becomes too big to be saved right
you know when they collapse such Banks
uh it will totally devastate the uh
Swiss ad actually have Tremors across
the global economy that's one second to
your question of Ethics versus uh ethics
you know the bank my point is that
forget ethics regulatory compliances the
bank has not complied with regulatory
compliances
it has tried to figure out ways and
means of you know Meandering and getting
around all of those creating loopholes
and all ethics is maybe the next layer
of question after you complying with
whatever regulatory compliances are
needed there the third aspect as to the
timing interesting question ah CC The
weisenthal Institute of Center they came
up with this list in the year 2020. then
they talk to creators Swiss to
investigate in 2021 or so great Swiss
set up an internal probe with an outside
agency along with the Ombudsman at on
top who was a former U.S whatever you
know official the probe continued for
two years at the end of the probe now or
in December the chairman of the
Ombudsman outside was appointed to lead
the committee he was bumped out or
removed from this committee credits we
said that he has no idea Etc this report
which came out in this report they said
the agency which was doing this audit
they said that create Swiss has been you
know hiding not revealing not
cooperating obstructing our our you know
probe that then went to the U.S senators
so that's why now Chuck Grassley and all
and other Jewish Lobby you can
definitely expect them to you know
tighten the screws on Credit Suisse with
regards to clear Swiss or the now UBS
which is out there so that's with
respect to the timings from what I can
understand of this this particular
episode
okay you all make valid points India
must make a human cry and the rest of
the world also needs to make a human cry
and and also then pose these questions
Over The credibility morality and ethics
of Swiss banks in being the Hub of
people organizations institutions going
to three spans to put in their money and
their Investments are fraudulent there
are Espionage cases there are drug links
involved and now the very immoral money
of the Nazis being kept in the banks
invested without giving any public
information off so thankfully there has
been an investigation that has been
initiated and more will be dug out that
is going to be the device of Credit
Suisse and the other Swiss banks that
are operable for more such videos

but for late China could not you know
manage covid-19 and it was one of the
main reasons was it has a very poor

another pointer of that I think it is
time that China starts devoting more

one part of the country in fact they're
being held Across the Nation not only in
Varanasi but also in Srinagar and ahead
of the G20 meeting in Srinagar the
ministry of Home Affairs the special
secretary sundari Ananda has now reached
Jammu to chair the internal security
review meeting other senior officials of
different security agencies are also
expected to participate in this meeting
my colleague has filed a ground report
regarding the same have a look
foreign foreign
what are the preparations that are
currently underway in Srinagar for the
G20 meeting of course we saw your ground
report there but what are you learning
on the ground
well I see government is very serious
about the event and definitely they are
you know they are prepared for any kind
of situation here in German Kashmir and
especially we know that how um you know
China as well as the Pakistan is a uh
frustrated after this uh decision of the
government that they are going to held a
meeting here of G20 and that's why it is
expected that Pakistan could try to
disturb Peace by uh pushing in uh you
know uh terrorists and uh carrying out
any attack here in Germany and to deal
with such sets up uh senior officials
from the mha special secretary mha uh
you know uh she is Jammu and she is she
is sharing a high level meeting here in
which police BSF crpf and other senior
officers from the security agencies they
are participating and she's reviewing
this is 30 scenario and definitely they
are um they must have um you know
planning uh that how to deal with any
kind of a threat or any kind of uh uh
you know any kind of uh incident if
happens here in the government Kashmir
so uh borders we have seen that in the
recent past how from across the line of
control and the international border
area that is say they tried to you know
infiltrate to decide that was filed we
have seen that how drone was pushed here
to drop the weapon and that was also
called by the astrology dances here in
the German Kashmir so it shows that
there are possibilities that Pakistan
could try to disturb Peace by doing any
you know nefarious act over here but are
positive they are prepared enough and uh
to talk about the MH especially they are
uh they don't want to leave any on uh
stone unturned to see that if anything
is working here which can be dangerous
for the civilians life or a piece that
has to be uh you know taken care of
all right Ajay can you also um you know
give us some more details of course you
said at the beginning that
um you know Pakistan has of course taken
some has made statements with regards to
um the G20 meeting in Srinagar can you
talk us through uh you know what are
some of the
main oppositions that Pakistan has been
trying to create but regardless of which
India continues to hold its meetings on
its way soil
Asia for last many decades Pakistan is
trying to disturb peace and uh by
pushing in terrorists and other Terror
related activities here in the German
Kashmir and uh that have been foiled by
the the security agencies here in the
German Kashmir and part of the country
as well Pakistan want uh basically was
trying to uh you know make kashmira
issue unnecessarily and the Pakistan
have failed on all the front end
especially after the application of 370
we have seen that uh you know how
Pakistan basically uh was continuously
uh trying to uh you know defame India on
the Kashmir issue but when world have
understood that uh the things are very
positive and peaceful in German Kashmir
and it was nothing but Pakistan's uh you
know
propaganda then Pakistan realized that
they need to do something here and
especially uh during uh you know new
decision of government that they uh they
are going to uh hold up uh you know
meeting here in the German Kashmir that
is something which practice make
Pakistan again frustrated and once again
they could try to you know do something
here in the German Kashmir by pushing
interest we have seen that in how from
points District uh three terrorists they
were in trying to infiltrate to this
side and that was acquired by the Indian
Army to spawn Terrace for gun down we
have seen that how uh you know weapons
and drugs were uh exported and smuggled
from across the line of control and the
international border area that also was
uh followed by the forces so uh Indian
forces are prepared enough basically
they don't want Pakistan uh don't want
that German Kashmir to be peaceful and
that's why they once again are trying to
do uh some nefarious act over here but

important day as far as the hearing on
the same-sex marriages is concerned
today is of course the second day of the
supreme court hearing a bunch of
petitions demanding legal recognition
for same-sex marriages in India a
five-charge bench led by Chief Justice
of India Dy Chandra shoots said that it
will not be touching upon the aspects of
personal laws and the hearing will be
confined to the special Marriage Act the
union government presented by solicitor
general tashar Mehta opposed the hearing
on the ground that it is exclusively for
Parliament to take a call on recognition
of same-sex marriages according to the
SG the petitioners were wrong in seeking
confirmment of a legal right of
recognition of same-sex marriage from a
court which lacked the jurisdiction to
Grant such a relief meta also asked the
court not to hear the case at all
emphasizing that the legislative intent
is clear that only a biological man and
a biological woman can enter into a
valid fed lock but the court was not
impressed with this proposition put
forth by the child Mehta the solicitor
general of India and responding the
Chief Justice of India truth said and I
quote
there is a value judgment you are making
it entails a biological man and a
biological woman this is wrong there is
no absolute concept of a man or a woman
it can't be about your genitals it's far
more complex than that the notion of a
man and a woman can't depend only on
what your genitalia are the CGI observed
only
joining us on the broadcast now is my
colleague Ashish Sinha for more in the
story Ashish can you help us understand
what has transpired in the court
yesterday before we move on to
expectations uh of from from today's
hearing
the Supreme Court yesterday
for the legal validation of the same sex
marriage and observe that the very
notion of a man and a woman is not an
absolute based of genital in a day long
hearing this took place yesterday in the
uh the fight before The Constitution
which was headed by uh CGI Justice d y
Sunday tour and he took note of the
submission in the favor and against of
the petition and one of them was the
even the special Marriage Act has come
like a man and a woman and using some
person instead May unsettle existing
status uh Center also
Tushar Mehta who appeared for the
central government he also said that let
the matter lead to the parliament but
Supreme Court reduces there to take up
that particular argument and Supreme
Court said that we will go ahead then to
Sharma said that let Supreme Court
should issue notice to all the States
government and union territories they
have to also make their submissions
before
but Supreme Court clearly says that
first we will going to hear all these
petitioners that means 20 petitional
positive input is going to here and
after that Supreme Court will decide
whether the state should be make party
in this case or not after the hearing of
submission of 20 petitioner and the
central government
all right and Ashish you know as far as
the key arguments are concerned made by
of course the solicitor general as well
as a response by the CJ can you talk us
through uh some of the key highlights

strengthen military cooperation to
safeguard Global and Regional security
during a meeting between the Russian
president and U.S sanctioned Chinese
defense minister now the meeting between
Putin and Lee took place in the backdrop
of the ongoing Russian invasion of
Ukraine of course which Beijing has
declined to call it and so has in
instead accused the U.S in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization of
provoking Putin instead now Lee who is a
state councilor and a veteran of China's
ongoing drive to modernize the pla has
come under U.S scrutiny uh five years
ago for allegedly purchasing the su-35
combat aircraft and the s-400 missile
system equipment from Russian armed
sellers now China in fact has is said
that it is ready for further
strengthening the Strategic
communication between both militaries
and bolster multilateral coordination
and cooperation to safeguard Global and
Regional security and stability now of
course just as we were discussing
passing earlier
uh Russia does say that their trade with
China has improved over the years as
well I'm being joined by International
Affairs expert Robin thank you for
joining us this morning sir we're
discussing how China and Russia uh are
in fact they've done their uh their
discussions of trade and Russia in fact
saying that their trade with China
including defense trade has increased
and now uh they're working on a defense
cooperation uh to strengthen their
military uh cooperation as well how do
you see these development
you
yeah
yeah all indicators all statements all
rhetoric that we have seen thus point to
the fact that Russia and China are
getting closer and much closer getting
kind of joined at the fifth right I mean
the one issue is that is China supplying
or will China Supply weapons to Russia
that is the big question one out there
but apart from that or aside from that
uh there is a lot of military
cooperation in the works if you see
their state
people saying about a month ago and now
for this defense minister and imagine I
mean it's a three-day visit of the
defense minister or a three-day visit is
a long visit normally you know even
ministers
right and for this principle in the
first meeting outside China
minister right so China is according it
seems a good prominence to its relations
with Russia and also let us keep in mind
you know both of these countries Now
call them the enemy is U.S or vice versa
for the U.S the number one enemy is
China and Russia both of them combined
for the U.S it has other Military Allies
in large countries okay within the
framework of NATO let's say Germany
France UK Etc Japan even Christian
Exchange China does not have any big
Ally China needs Russia also to stand up
against America maybe not militarily
directly but in a strategic Manner and
Russia needs China the the downside to
all of this is and especially for India

Sharma now BJP first
which of his first list of 189
candidates from the upcoming Karnataka
polls has quite quite the has caused
quite the approach within the Congress
veterans within the bjb veterans now
there are Party leaders who are
disgruntled there are some who have
showed open disgruntlement there are
others who have quit the party as well
now if rumors are to be believed there
may be back Channel talks also that may
be taking place between the upset BJP
leaders and the congress party mlas
in Karnataka Now bjp's messaging is to
give chance to Young Blood and fresh
faces and what is it that the
disgruntled mla's disgruntled ministers
and leaders from the Karnataka BJP have
to talk about and also we have exclusive
voices who have been given tickets and
how are they going to Herald the
Karnataka election and win for the BJP
here on I've been joined by yashpal
suvarna he's a BJP candidate he has been
given the ticket for the very first time
from Udupi his claim to fame while he
was the one who initiated the ban for
girls by wearing hijab in the Udupi
School quickly
first question from you yashpal why are
you even expecting that the BJP would
give you a ticket for fighting from
Udupi region keeping in mind that you
are a BJP worker and you have not had a
thrist with active politics up until now
I was thinking Party may give me an
opportunity
but I don't expect from would be or
somewhere else
giving me a chance then I would
we agreed for that
now the incumbent MLA from the BJP
raghupati bhat has been dislodged to
make space for you in Udupi uh do you
think he is going to be upset for this
upheaval that has taken place in Udupi
region
is there a party decision
because
anything changes happens means the party
sheeness will take the decision
so that I'm not a person to question it
okay also now raghupati but is he going
to be supportive in your campaigning to
win from Udupi
uh that might be for my growth from the
past 25 years we have been working
together at the time of my life of
contesting from the election
he was a part of my victory and I have
been served in several responsibility in
the party he was guiding me each and
every day so that I don't have any doubt
I have trust but we both will work
together and lead to a victory
now you came in the Limelight for
Banning the hijab in Udupi school now do
you think this is a reason for which BJP
has given you the ticket at the first
place
I don't think so it's my responsibility
working in a Sangha so it is a part of
that so that giving Justice to the
children Justice to the institution it
is my responsibility don't think that
it's a live light for my career
now will polarizing politics be your
agenda while seeking votes from the
constituency
main agenda is good governance good
Administration which has Modi is leaving
from the last nine years
today
each and every person in the world which
every country likes they need a prime
minister like Modi ji that means your
product of our modiji because not only
our country leader he's a world leader
I'll expect them
[Music]
should be their prime minister of their
country
okay all right and finally sir would it
have been possible for you to fight the
election had you been in the Congress of
the JDS would you have been given
opportunity to fight for the Karnataka
2023 assembly polls
so that I don't think about Congress or
JDS
it's not of none of my duties to think
about that
thank you yes for joining us on The
Telecast and uh congratulations on being
giving a ticket by the bjpa for the
Udupi region now former Minister R
Shankar has also resigned as the mlc
from after he was denied a ticket our
Shankar had sought a ticket from the uh
uh there's this time around an mlc who
has felt
humiliated that he's not been given the
ticket and he therefore he's therefore
resigned from the party
all right so that's the big story right
now we are also getting to know that the
BJP leader and former Karnataka chief
minister Jagdish shettar has arrived at
the residence of the Union Minister
prahlad Joshi and uh in fact that was
the big meeting
that he was anticipating he has shown
his disgruntlement he has made his
disgruntlement apparent to the party
High command is he then going to also be
JP NATA that's the big question
visuals on your screens of his car
entering into pillar Joshi's official
residence is Japan also going to be
present or is he going to make a
separate meeting and visit JP NADA at
his official residence today
we are also getting to know that BS yet
eurappa the former chief minister of
Karnataka and uh BJP veteran in
Karnataka has confirmed the second
candidate list is also going to be put
out today itself
so in a span of 24 hours
the entire list of candidates for the
bgp is going to be released BSD Europa
had just a while ago also made the
statement that Jagdish shettar who was
unhappy for not being given a ticket
might also be included in the list of
candidates that are going to be
announced by the BJP in the second list
Jeff prakash on The Telecast with me so
the second list Jeff prakash is going to
be released by today which means in 24
hours all the candidates will be
announced is there likelihood of Jagdish
shettar being given a ticket in the
second list
in all likelihood Mega in fact what to
pick up foreign
was Keen
to uh to come to uh to feel the Jagdish
atar uh in the coming Parliament
elections in 2024 but he's very
interesting that he this is the last
election that he wants to contest and uh
he's got a lot left in public space and
that's the reason why he was very keen
and uh you know either ways the
dissident or the anger will be coiled
for sure but whether he will opt out of
the race and then again contest in
Parliament elections 2024 or will the
BJP agree to give him ticket will he buy
that that these are the two options that
we're looking at there is no chance of
him falling out of the party or raising
a banner result but there was some kind
of uh you know disappointment which he
expected but that is being taken off by
the party but as far as uh okay the
remaining 30 odd seats of BJP is
concerned um the chief minister this
morning also spoke to the media here in
Bengaluru and he said that in a in a day
or two uh the uh the list should be out
see we are seeing a lot of movement as
far as Stone turn courts are concerned a
lot of uh you know ifs and buts and
probabilities are being looked at uh
there are uh those who don't get ticket
in the congress party they will come to
BJP and those who don't get in the
immediately they will go to Congress but
13th is the day uh for uh the
nominations to start and that's going to
go on for four days before that the BJP
will announce these 30 seats but then
these uh it's a tricky situation for all
the three parties JDS is sitting today
at announcing 93 seats the Congress has
announced so far 167 seats and uh the
BJP has announced 189 seats it was
Congress which took the first lead in
announcing the list of candidates even
before the election was notified so that
way they have moral High grounds to say
that the BJP is is playing the you know
wait in March game right ultimately
everything is allowed in in war and they
say it's a bit of War out there it's a
very important high stakes battle for
both Congress and the BJP and this being
the case they're leaving nothing to
chance right absolutely also uh there is
this big meeting that is taking place
right now at proffel uh uh Prophet
Joshi's residence where Jagdish shettar
has now arrived he's like is he likely
to meet uh
the BJP president as well
you see the Parliamentary affairs
minister and he's also an MP from North
Connecticut the same city where City
shutter comes from uh prala Joshi has a
lot to say when it comes to uh you know
giving ticket distribution of tickets in
Northern Karnataka region uh he holds a
very top position in the BJP government
and this being the case
of Karnataka politics
or any other senior ministers the first
stop or these leaders are the residents
of Yoshi because he's a via media
between the party High command uh and uh
the local leaders at the state level in
Karnataka JP NATA has in fact summoned
uh before that is picking his brains
trying to counsel him uh to uh you know
opt out of the race and then consider
himself for the next parliamentary
election whatever options are there he
will take these options and go in front
of JP NADA that's why to happen late in
the evening and probably a solution will
be inside once that meeting is over okay
I'm going to keep coming back to you
Japan because this is a sensitive matter
there are a lot of developments taking
place in Karnataka as well as the
national capital meanwhile I'm also
being joined by Chef Allah sayb he's the
senior spokesperson for the JDS it's
good to have you on The Telecast with us
and my first question of course is JDS
ready to fight the Karnataka elections
and are there chances of your party to
be able to defeat the Congress as well
as the BJP that is the incumbent party
that has the governing rights over here
in Karnataka right now
um
see Madam we have been working very hard
for past one year
towards this these elections facing this
Assembly election
and we are fully ready
to win 123 seats and form the government
and as far as the the
BJP is concerned it's fighting its own
issue of 40 percent uh fame
um
the BJP government is very famous for
its 40 issue and that is why all the 40
percent star Star Wars have been removed
in order to save the face because all of
the
Karnataka population know very well that
this government is 40 government because
ishwara has resigned because of the 40
issue and one of the contractor has
taken his own life uh he he has he has
committed suicide showing that ishwara
has demanded more than 40 percent which
he is not able to give
and at that time all the worms have come
out of the can and all the people who
were collecting 40 percent have become
very famous
now the BJP government want to say BJP
party want to save the face by throwing
all those 40 percent stalwarts out of
the party
now they are saying they are being
thrown out because of the age which is
not true they have been they have been
sidelined only in order to save the
party from 40 percent
the last time around you and Congress
had come together post Alliance post
election Alliance in able to topple the
BJP but you were not able to do that
because of the horse trading that took
place and a number of your mlas shifted
their base to BJP how are you going to
ensure that you are insulated from this
horse trading come the election and the
election results Madam please
Madam please correct your statement we
have not toppled any BJP government the
BJP government was not there in the
first place BJP had not secured the
number required for forming the
government
yeah
led to the horse trading and more MLS
led to it constituting the government in
Karnataka yes
not only not only BJP led the whole
thing to the horse trading it has it has
created a new world called Lotus for the
operation Lotus and they have somehow
they have prepared and 17 people to run
away and they have already parked a
chartered flight in one of the airports
much before the 17 people ran away to
the airport and they didn't know Mr
amitsha had arranged this uh uh this
chartered flight as per the reports and
that's how they have far they have
toppled a very well running government
which was very
farmer friendly labor friendly and janta
friendly government they have doubled
and for which they have given the name
as a Lotus operation Lotus and this very
well known to the people of Karnataka
and now the BJP governments 40 percent
commission thing also is very well known
and also the Karnataka people are really
very much against these central
government imposing Hindi and Karnataka
and uh
one last question before I let you go
now is there a tacit understanding
between you and the JDS will there be a
tacit understanding between you and the
JDS in the selective fighting of
Elections and selective constituencies
in being able to support each other
post-election
is the question for me yes yes
the question is for you see as far as as
far as
see as far as uh JDS is concerned we are
not in uh we are not cooperating with
the any party we have we are not we have
not joined with any party for the for
contesting elections we will contest
elections independently and we are
targeting 123 seats to win and we are
going to win enough seats to form the
government we are going to form the
government single-handedly and Mr SD
Kumar Swami will form the government and
he will run the government according to
what we have shown the schemes of farmer
friendly schemes labor friendly schemes
and no Hindu Muslim issues and everybody
will be given proper protection I know
Hindu Muslim
riots and we will save our Karnataka
from the taking away of the our
banks and dandini and all other
Industries what we have formed here it
has been taken away by the other states
we will stop this and we will see that a
farmer friendly and janta friendly
government is formed by our party okay
all right also uh do you think as
compared to the campaigning that has
been initiated
which is a juggernaut which prime
minister Narendra Modi has been
campaigning he has been going about
releasing and launching a number of
projects these developmental projects
airports infrastructure trains
etc etc and we've also seen campaigning
from BK Shiva Kumar and siddharma and
other party members from the Congress
is JDS cap but the JDS campaign
is this on an equal footing as the BJP
or the Congress
see as far as the jda BJP campaign is
concerned we have seen the campaigning
in the Delhi elections and we have seen
the campaigning by the BJP in Bengal
elections against Mamta Banerjee and the
where our pm and the whole of Hill
cabinet his cabinet has arrived in
Bengal and Delhi and they have tried all
the ways and they have lost completely
same thing will happen here in Karnataka
to the BJP we are going to win the
elections and no matter what they do we
have seen when our prime minister Miss
Modi had come there was 50 more than 50
percent chairs were empty and we are
sure that's how this is going to be and
when Mr Deva gowda and Mr Kumar Swami
had a very big
samavesha whole chairs of were filled
and lot of people were standing outside
in the rain
and there were no empty chairs and this
is same issue is going to be in the same
way and BJP is going to lose and the JDS
is going to form the government Madam
okay also you know there is this lot of
speculation and talks that are happening
with uh
promise they're calling it to be a weird
promise because they're saying that 2
lakh rupees will be given to women who
marry Farmers Sons now what is the
agenda behind this campaign
see whatever whatever we are going to
promise we are going to definitely
Implement there is no uh false promise
going to be made by the JDs and we have
got a team working towards what all the
uh promises why what we are going to
make and definitely after forming the
government we are going to see that all
the promises are implemented
okay all right on that note thank you

Belfast and this is the capital of
Northern Ireland to Mark the 25th
anniversary of the Good Friday peace
agreement a huge Security operation is
already in place in the city for
President Biden's visit his visit to
Belfast will be the first leg of a
four-day stay in Ireland during which he
will discuss his Irish roots and meet
Irish relatives
President Biden is also expected to meet
the leaders of the five main political
parties of the Stormont Northern
Ireland's Parliament that is
President Biden's visit comes after
Monday's 25th anniversary of the Good
Friday peace agreement which was marred
by improvised bombs being thrown at a
police Land Rover during a republican
rally in Derry also known as the
Londonderry
Foreign Affairs expert Mr Sandeep
Sanjeev srivastav joins us on the show
to give his take on this Mrs I hope you
can hear me sir
what do you make of Joe Biden's visit
to Northern Ireland obviously it's
historic he was also greeted by Rishi
sanak as he stepped off Air Force One at
the Belfast International Airport but
definitely the stocks a bit of a
controversy as well for all those people
who've been asking for a separate state
in Northern Ireland
you know uh first of all good morning to
you good morning to all the viewers uh
it's a historic moment uh uh for uh the
northern Irish history uh when they are
you know celebrating the 25th
anniversary of the historic uh Good
Friday agreement and uh that is the land
that was the landmark agreement uh and
that led to you know restoration of
Peace in Northern Ireland and which was
heavily marked by the a lot of violent
acts before this uh you know a card was
signed and uh from the 60s onwards
territory was very much inaudible area
but uh after this Good Friday agreement
uh which is the United States of America
also helped broker you know the piece
was stood and now uh uh you know when
they are commemorating the 25th year of
this historic uh
bookside agreement
you know roots in our land and he is
also going to make some of his relatives
when he is going to Republic of Ireland
after this Northern land digit so I
think it's a very historic moment uh
personally also for Joe Biden but uh
overall he is to commemorate the 25th
year of Good Friday agreement and when
he was asked that what is the purpose of
this
got to
stand that he wants to
he attempting to emphasize the historic
importance and the relevance of the it
was Amplified agreement and uh and
obviously some people there are some
discontent youth uh people may be having
different opinions different agendas
obviously they are not happy with the
status of the Accord at this point of
time and that is why they are they have
some some kind of a turbulence out there
and they were engaged in some violent
acts Etc before this visit just to
emphasize the point that they are having
a different View and different opinions
so I think there must be having some
element of this thought or not happy
with it at course but if you look at the
you know significance of this Accord the
historicity of this record is enormous
it's still still very very significant
effort and I think it is this is going
to shift the the next 25 years of this
Northern and history and that is
precisely a lot of the Prime Minister of
Britain said uh and uh he is obviously
there so he was there to receive Joe
Biden when he arrived there so I think
uh just the Accord is a landmark
agreement and its relevance is very much
there I think it will continue the uh
shaping the history of and future force
of events of London Ireland but yeah
certainly there are some people there
are some elements and there are some
section of societies of Northern
elements they are not happy are not that
they want change they do not want their
status quo to continue and that is why
right they have appreciate you joining
us uh Wing Commander Prophet bakshi also
joins us this morning to give his
insights into this visit uh Commander
bakshi you know Joe Biden of course of
Irish origin he's also considered to be
the most most Irish of all the
presidents that have come and gone in
the United States but according to you
what is the cultural as well as the
political signal that this visit is
sending to the world as well as those
people who want a separate State uh in
Ireland
thank you we need
which has been which has been in the
center of discussions a number of times
the origin of Americans where do they
belong to their Roots lie in Europe
everybody knows and a number of
personalities have come from Ireland
including Joe Biden and a lot of film
stars and actors and leaders well that's
about all that's right but the question
here is that the 1968 peace agreement
that a good Friday agreement which took
place because there was a lot of you
know an Irish problem I will not go on
to this how there's a problem between
the United Kingdom and Ireland and what
are the reason what are the religious
intonations behind what are the causes
yes there are a number of causes the
Earth the fight has been tremendous
armies have been involved a lot of guys
have been lost a regular armies have
been involved in this and that is what
the example everybody gives to Great
Britain that please don't play in others
Internal Affairs because everybody
starts playing in your Irish Affair so
this aspect of Joe Biden when he has
gone there he has gone with a cost with
his older in mind they are very
interested in bringing out peaceful
negotiations between the dissident
groups and dissident groups are becoming
very violent they are resorting to Arms
forearms even legal weapons are there
and not only means of warfare but the
methods of warfare are becoming very
inhuman that aspect has been seen and I
know some British officers personally
who have got the better difficult end of
the stick from the island but but for us
I personally feel if this problem is
solved and
smelted down then most of the problem
around will start simmering down too
because thereafter the people will take
lead America has now taken this lead
America will have to walk the talk in
other places also and that's what is
required at the moment I personally feel
for the Peace of the world this would be
very nice step and a very nice gesture

her first day in the country yesterday

this was the only choice for a vishwa

joparova who is expected to meet the

Ukraine's efforts to combat Russia's
unprovoked aggression
editorial director of the Sunday
Guardian also joins us on the broadcast
Professor nalapath you know it's
heartening to see that Ukraine has
indulged in this Outreach but at the
same time Ukraine has also been critical
of India buying oil from Russia how do
you think we should uh you know be
balancing our Focus towards Ukraine
well I think we're doing a good job of
it in the sense that we are not diluting
our relationship with Russia and at the
same time we have been providing
humanitarian assistance to Ukraine the
reality is this war is a tragedy for the
Ukrainian people and it's also proven to
be a tragedy for the entire
International Community so the sooner
the war ends the better but ultimately
uh there is a difficulty and that is
that the Ukrainian side believes that
with the help of NATO they will be able
to push the Russians out of every bit of
Ukrainian territory uh including in the
Eastern territories that since 2014 has
not been under the control of care this
is a slightly unrealistic perspective
and quite frankly it is unrealizable so
this is the difficulty in Ukraine I
think this war and this conflict is is
going to go on a little longer until the
Ukrainian side comes to a compromise
settlement uh in a sense a land for
peace settlement it's a horrible thing
to do therefore the Ukrainian point of
view but the fact is that realistically
speaking NATO is not going to enter the
war of the eukary side directly although
the ukrainians will like that that's out
of the question and given that they
don't have the muscle to throw Russia
out of the donbath and lugan so they
only went out frankly is to accept that
there will be a trade-off of territory

Ambassador goel your thoughts on Joe
Biden visiting Northern Ireland
obviously it's a state visit but at the
same time Joe Biden has gone on to say
that he's also here to discover his
Irish roots
and good morning to you and all the
viewers
uh it's a significant reason in the
sense that it is a reaffirmation of the
American faith in the Good Friday
agreement uh reached 25 years ago which
actually has basically held all uh for
all these years with the minor
exceptions here and there and uh just
only yesterday there was a kind of a
student of violence other people died
but those are those are exceptionally
hidden I think for the first time we see
in the history that a regiment has held
on with the two opposal Camp sharing
power in the capital and I think Biden's
visit is a reaffirmation of faith in
that agreement very significant
Discovery Irish root on the on the other
hand also uh re-establishing the
connection between the USA and Ireland
at two states
absolutely and you know so Northern
Ireland of course has its own history

policy
uh and uh it has been accepted by UK in

it's happened in the case of brexit and
then uh Ireland had difficulties in

with the crossing over a good problems
Europe using UK Etc but my own sense is
that those those have not really created

Christina Scott has now debunked all
these rumors saying that free trade
negotiations between India and UK are
very much in progress the deputy High
Commissioner also said they take the
security of embassies very seriously and
are working to ensure that security is
maintained isn't it
now is calm but let me first of all just
extend and repeat the assurances that my
ministers have made that we take
extremely seriously uh the security of
the Indian High Commission in London and
we're working very closely with them to
make sure that their security is
maintained the situation right now is
calm but let me first of all just extend
and repeat the assurances that my
ministers have made that we take
extremely seriously uh the security of
the Indian High Commission in London and
we're working very closely with them to
make sure that their security is
maintained the situation right now is
but what I can say is that negotiations
are continuing on a 3D trade agreement
and we're determined that we can
continue to work together to try and
find a free trade agreement that
supports British and Indian businesses
and support our Collective Economic
Security
Sanjay Kapoor editor hard news is uh
joining us at this point on the
broadcast Sandra Kapoor your first
interpretation of this statement by the
British Deputy High Commissioner
I think there is a bit of a crisis when
it comes to a trade agreement between
India and UK If you go by the reports
which have appeared in the London times
and you would see that the agreement has
been put on hold primarily because India
has concerns about security to our high
commission especially from kalistanis
with the who last month or around that
time raided our premises and did all
kinds of nasty things which is that and
the security use come is handled
properly by the state by the United
Kingdom government I don't think India
is going to go forward in that
all right Sanjay stay with us in fact we
have Sanjeev shivastava also joining us
at this point International Affairs
experts sanjivastava do you believe that
there is trouble for the Free Trade
Agreement obviously the British Deputy
eye commissioner are denying that saying
that uh the talks continue as planned
but just read between the lines for us
yeah our UK featured agreement and I
think uh with regard to our strategic
partnership in that economic partnership
to play a very important role I think
that is quite in depth and I do not
think that uh this kind of uh you know
uh you know situation security related
issues will make much impact on The
Unwanted negotiations as as you know our
honorable uh Finance Minister nimula
Sita Raman had also mentioned and during
her talk at the Peterson Institute of
you know International economic Affairs
in the USA saying that uh some something
uh uh being built that uh uh India UK uh
State talks are not going in in the
right direction so I so see has already
clarified this and I do not think that
uh this kind of a security situation uh
will make any impact on the ongoing uh
any negative impact on the ongoing and
negotiation those are for the free trade
but having said that let me say that
that I think it's high time that uh UK
authorities are should you know respect
and should have uh whatever uh the
concerns and whatever the input which we
are giving with regard to our concerns
in the uh around our UK High commission
our high Commission in the London so I
think that kind of a security concerns
must be addressed and the proper
security has to be provided as quickly
as possible but more than that there
must be action against anti-india
Elements which are active on the UK
territory and that is the you know that
will be a very good thing if the United
Kingdom takes action proper action uh to
curb the anti-india you know activities
and those Elements which are obviously
supported by you know various
intelligence agencies including Pakistan
so I think a comprehensive action
against to curb anti-india activities
will be a very good thing for the uh
India UK strategic partnership and I
think this partnership is very much
intact it is robust and it has a very
you know Sound Logic for it to grow but
the security concerns must be addressed
and that is what India has you know
emphasizing time and again that we
cannot compromise with our security
situation and this uh so-called Pro
kalistani activities Etc is related to
our national security is related to
India's the vital you know code National
Security interest so that must be
addressed and I hope that UK authorities
will take you know proper action in in
quick time and has been as has been
assured by the one official of the you
know uh UK Embassy here so I think I uh
uh uh we hope and look forward to
further actions uh being taken action uh
to be taken against uh you know
so-called kalistani elements and
so-called whatever the ntnd activities
which are going on that must be curved
and that is the need of the hour I hope
that UK 30
a quick and uh no strict action against
such elements and that is uh quite
imperative uh for to maintain and to
grow uh this India's UK uh strategic
partnership
right Sanjay Kapoor also continues to be
with us Sanjay uh uh obviously you know
there there have also been questions
raised over India being very upset after
that uh attack on a high commission do
you believe that is also a reason uh for
this stalling of the agreement talks
even though the deputy eye commission
has also spoken on that saying security
off the high commission remains a
priority for us
I think there has been uh issues with
the British higher British government
over not just how the kalistanis have
been entertained and how they've been
it's been there for a while in a certain
way maybe this could be the straw the
last straw and the camel's back if you
say how these British government reacted
to it although there is a view that we
overreacted to the situation and we
could have let it pass like the U.S
embassy had been facing a lot of uh you
know demonstration and protests there so
they moved their the embassy to some
other premises so India should also be
mindful of it British is a society is
fear so you know there is a conflict of
how you perceive a situation the
britishers have a different way Indians
have a different way so uh Indians have
been telling the Europe UK government
that we don't take this slightly and we
think this is a violation of our
premises
certain way violation or every thing
that we hold here and that is why they
should react very strongly so if the the
biggest papers are saying that one of
the reasons why the Free Trade Agreement
has not gone forward is because of the
security concerns and also misgivings
about how UK reacts to our security
issues and how they meddle in different
ways so there are as I said far more
other reasons not just this but I think
they have to be resolved before the
trade agreement goes forward for more

Karnataka is most likely to be delayed
sources are also telling us that party
is set to ask kamul to pause its entry
into Karnataka with us on the broadcast
uh prakash the executive editor of the
ITV Network jaffrakash big news coming
in we've been given to understand that
in fact amul's entry into Karnataka
might just be delayed after the furod
that erupted yesterday what are we
learning with regards to the same well
see this is a successful Congress
campaign you can say I mean the time and
again the Congress has uh you know come
out with such narrative to show that the
BJP is an outsider party you know to
understand the Karnataka politics it's
quite essential the role of the
Karnataka milk Federation the kmf which
produces nandini milk every uh it's a
Cooperative Revolution that happened of
course India saw the in a white
Revolution under Korean and in Karnataka
the similar model happened but then it
was uh you know indigenized at the at
the grassroot level in Karnataka uh uh
you know Dairy farming is a huge economy
uh in the rural areas of Karnataka you
have about 30 milk Federation
associations across the state and
they together they produce and uh you
know meet the supply demand uh chain of
80 percent 80 to 85 percent is met by
kmf and there is uh you know Democratic
process there of electing directors two
platforms are there from where you know
politic politicians you know take form
and further their cost one is the gram
panchayat election the other one is the
diary and here they the BJP you know uh
according to Congress feels that they
want to throt the advances of Congress
is because traditionally they've been
very strong at these milk federations
and other allegation is that you know
amul is going to take over a kmf of
course the Cooperative Minister himself
has has said uh St swam Shaker that
there is no such move nandini itself is
a Big Brand they are selling a milk at
around close to 40 rupees whereas amul
is selling at 60 rupees a different
category altogether and there was a
shortage and that's the reason why amul
was asked to you know a chip in and
fulfill that shortage and Congress has
been alleging that it was an artificial
scarcity and demand which was created to
allow amul to come in so this is the
best case scenario to study how you know
politics can be played
hitting at the sentiment of the people

cash and materials worth rupees
108.78 crores have been seized in
Karnataka in the 11 days since the model
code of conduct for the May 10th
assembly polls took effect the seized
items include
37.24 crores in unaccounted cash
5.23 lakh liters worth of liquor which
somewhere sums up close to 26.68 crores
as well as 397 kilograms of illegal
drugs worth 11.54 crores and more the
election commission has said that during
the same number of days ahead of the
2018 assembly elections as well there
were similar recovery that was made by
the EC now the big question here is what
does this truly mean for the elections
of Karnataka on the broadcast with us
still our executive director our
executive editor pardon me Jay
prakashram
what do we make of this EC seizure that
has taken place in what are you learning
well I mean 38 crores in cash close to
23 crores in liquor and drugs um amongst
other seizures in fact the election
commission of India when he was in in
Bengaluru to take on the preparedness of
the state election commission he had you
know informed and uh you know told the
officers there that don't wait for the
election code of conduct to kick in you
need to crack down on this kind of uh
you know freebies that are being you
know given to the voters especially
those economically weaker sections or
the slum dwellers there amongst the
other waterways who the politicians want
to keep them tied with elections around
the bend but compared to last year ah
this Caesar is almost double so this
this actually shows that the the stakes
are really high for all the three
parties more so for the the BJP and the
Congress the Congress is upbeat that you
know they are going to ROM form with the
majority because they feel that you know
this time around the Miss governance
corruption and all the bad Optics that
the BJP got beat the madal case beat up
the 40 charge against the bgp government
by the contractors Association uh be the
PSI recruitment scam several of these
scams have happened uh as uh you know
mentioned by aloksa that basuraj Bama
though has a clean image he was
surrounded by certain you know corrupt
elements and how the BJP will deal with
them in these elections will they give
them tickets this is going to be very
very important call and in that Pursuit
I think is is why the BJP has delayed
releasing the list but as far as these
seizures are concerned I mean this this
is election and it shows how you know
politicians are using all this test
activities to who the voters I mean this
is just a tip of the iceberg and just 10
days into elections 100 processor is a
huge one going further another 28 days
to go for elections we don't know what

we are discussing today a landmark
judgment that was authored by Justice
the Chief Justice of India which is on
uh which is the case name is
State Bank of India versus Rajesh
Agarwal this is on the rbi's fraud
circular and this judgment gives the
promoter and the company an opportunity
of hearing before they are declared as a
fraud account now this is very very
important because this has brought
relief to thousands of businessmen
across the country who would have been
in a sense unfairly labeled as fraud
accounts or had the possibility of being
labeled as broad accounts and putting
them out of business in some cases but
to discuss this issue I have with me
some uh my guest today who are an expert
in these kind of cases I have with me uh
Neha nagpal and Malad part from Eden
Lord Chambers they specialize in these
kind of cases in the past couple of
years and uh nomenclature of what you
called as fraud circular lawyers was
likely said about them in the courts of
law because they ended up doing so many
of such cases I would like to welcome
advocate
so nice to have you on the show today
and looking forward to some interesting
insights on this judgment
may I request
could you give me an opening comment on
Justice judgment
thank you it's always a pleasure to be
on your show and this indeed is a very
interesting uh development that's
happened especially in um for the not
just for the economy of this country but
also for the business landscape and for
what we call as white collar crime
landscape
um the frauds you know reading in the
requirement of
um principles of natural Justice I.E a
hearing uh before Declaration of fraud
has come as a big relief
um to to the business Community
um it is once again the Supreme Court of
India and Justice is uh the honorable
Chief Justice in particular has sort of
reiterated and um
strongly reiterated in fact the the
valued principles of Liberty and the
right to do business in this country
um so really I feel what this judgment
does is it it makes the the the you know
the promoter of this account which is
being considered as a fraud account yet
to be declared at some stage gives them
an opportunity to be a part of the
process till day before uh I mean to
leave first when the judgment is
pronounced but till day before we were
in a situation where if an account got
declared a fraud nobody knew uh you know
there were various Consortium Banks and
different dates declaring an account as
a fraud and
um the only way maybe uh promoters got
to know is even when CBI landed up at
their doorstep saying oh now there's an
fir against you or if some of them were
traveling there was an loc against them
or in some parallel proceedings if there
were um you know reference to this so at
least today we are there's a state of
stimulants
um you can participate in the hearing
you can you know transactions which look
dodgy you can explain them your and then
you can you know take whatever course of
action you have to take
um
once you know the reasons for which you
have been held of um declared a fraud
account so it definitely is a very
welcome step
okay so welcome step in in a sense the
interest of ease of doing business in
India also I'll go across to Advocate
your opening comment to this really
important judgment delivered by Justice
Channel student
thanks thanks everyone so I will in fact
break this up in in three parts uh it
definitely is a welcome step but as one
would expect Justice chandra's judgments
to be 8 45 is the uh the requirement of
reading fundamental rights into
situations where vitals takes and
interests are involved so if you look at
the Judgment it has three very very
important characteristics number one it
is well balanced and that one has to
remember because the prayer made before
the high courts against which the slps
came up was that the fraud circular
should be pushed for the want of a right
of hearing not being there so while the
Judgment does deal with the fact that he
has a right to hearing has to be there
it also recognizes the importance of the
circular to the extent it says that it's
one of the steps that the banking
industry uses for the purpose of
preempting fraud uh that perpetrates in
the in the system in the banking system
and therefore it upholds the circular he
does not watch the entire circle it only
reads in the right number one number two
it is a very critical requirement that
today Justice Chandra has read in the
requirement of accountability within the
banking system for the purpose of
promoters
at the stage of which they when they get
declared a uh the Congress declared
fraud and that is the core principle of
administrative law that the Judgment
reads into that that very system what
the Judgment effectively says is that
look it is not a mere reporting
mechanism that the bank is trying to do
any action of the bank which has an
impact on the rights and interests of
the promoters or of the account we will
definitely have to meet the bare minimum
standards of administrative law as we
call it today which is that you have to
at least be sure caused as to what is
the case being put up against you you
will have a right to be heard on or
right to be to give an explanation to
the allegation being put up against you
and the order which is being passed
against you will be a reasoned order
these are the three very basic
principles of administrative law which
in India has been developed from AK
kripa today I would see this judgment to
be nothing but an extension of that very
uh core principle state law and probably
five years from now this judgment will
be read in that line of judgments to be
one of the core uh critical decisions
which write down important rights for
the business industry within the banking
regulations that exist today
deconstructing the Judgment first we'll
try to understand what was the fraud
circular all about and then we move on
to what the arguments were made in court
uh could you explain the viewer what was
the fraud circular about what did it
contain why it was in a sense of worry
for uh the promoters this
is on fraud 's uh introduced you know at
a time when the rise on of npas in the
country was um you know there was a
serious rise and there was this
government was making all steps possible
to try and curtail uh the banking system
uh the public banking system at least
from uh unprecedented failure which was
which was important at that time uh
tarun because there were there was a
series of uh steps that were taken the
insolvency act so the insultancy code
um you know the prior there to the the
s4a so on so forth and this was a part
of that because you can't just clean up
a system without you know also coming uh
understanding what was the wrong and so
the fraud circular came about with a
very good intention one it it talks
about an early warning signal an extra
two of that circular you know recognizes
a series of uh criteria which where
there is an early warning signal suppose
it's it's prior to when you become an
NPA maybe you you're simply at an SMA
one uh and then that sort of required uh
whether it was uh you know a single
lender or a Consortium of banks to then
red flag the account which is called an
RFA account and then at that stage get
an external help through a forensic
auditor to conduct a forensic audit with
that account the most critical parts of
that circular were one to say that fraud
will have the definition under the IPC
secondly it said that there will be
continual consequences that will also
follow uh under Clause 12.8 of that
circular but the real heart first Clause
uh 8.4 uh 8.4.5 yeah 8.4 and 8.4.5 of
that circular which basically said that
if there is a single Bank the single
Bank can go ahead and declare the
account is fraud if there is a
Consortium then the one member of the
Consortium has to inform all the other
Banks to say that look this is a there
is an early warning signal I'm marking
it as an RFA let's get a forensic
conducted and once the forensic exercise
is done then together 60 of the
Consortium members had to approve
declaring the account is fraud
also there was a particular timeline
that was given this entire process had
to be completed in six months because
obviously you can't uh have restrictions
or you can't keep an account in sort of
you know in an early work because
obviously even when it's an early
warning signal or RFA there are limits
that came into play in terms of
usability of that account and then there
was of course while we talk about the
penal consequences there were also
consequences that you know that account
cannot it has to uh the banks concerned
or the Consortium concern had to inform
um the banking system they had to be uh
properly notified to RBI as well and
then there were limits on uh not just
credit worthiness was impacted but also
for the credit
um availability of credit
um the the promoters of that company
were prohibited under Section 29 a of
the insolvency code from um becoming
resolution applicants uh you know so
there there was a series of fallouts
which is why what is also now in this
judgment been called civil consequences
or what we call civil death of not just
the company but also the right of
Liberty of the promoter
um so I I that that what what really the
biggest problem with this circular was
that very well you identify the account
is EVS you identify the account as RFA
you get a forensic started it's only at
the stage of forensic can the forensic
auditor reach out to the company and the
promoter and say we're conducting a
forensic please come and answer our
queries but there was no obligation to a
share the report with the promoter of
the company there was no obligation to
invite the comments of the company or
the promoter uh before the final uh
forensic report was submitted by the
auditor to the banks
then there was no requirement to conduct
a hearing before the banks went and
declared uh you know a fraud now that
very well they may be a related party
transaction which is seen as siphoning
of funds but that may not be the case
that may be genuinely a bona Ferry
transaction or it may have been a loan
in advance which is actually paid back
or adjusted somewhere else who can
explain that but the company or the
promoter or the you know the management
behind it
and like I mentioned earlier so this
declaration of fraud then happens on the
basis of this forensic report which is
not with the promoter of the company
which is never put to them their
comments are never invited the banks
unilaterally go declare fraud and for
for these promoters then to struggle
with these consequences which can meet
them for a very long period of time and
literally finish
um a thriving business
you know reputable promoters image for
times to come so uh it was in this
context that various petitions were
filed across the country challenging the
circular at a very threshold level that
hear me before you seal my fate
point point very well taken I'll take
this now to Malak but about what were
the arguments made in court against this
master circular on for details of
physics Neha shared with the viewers
so uh let's get to the background of how
this matter reached the Supreme Court
this was actually two separate appeals
that came up there was a judgment from
the Telangana High Court which confirmed
the view taken by the promoters that yes
one has to be heard before a declaration
of fraud is castigated by the bank so
the Telangana High Court actually read
in the requirement of national Justice
within the fraud circuit the other hand
you had a Gujarat high court judgment
which had taken or endorsed The rbi's
View that this is ultimately only a
reporting mechanism and because the
Declaration of fraud is nothing but a
consequence of certain actions that the
bank has seen within the play that's
happening in the account and they've
it's it's nothing but a factual finding
that the bank really comes to basis what
the forensic auditor finds this is not
really a an action which is taken by the
bank which has any judicial consequences
it's not an exercise in judicial in in
law to be considered to be a decision of
the bank and therefore it need did not
have a an element of hearing and that's
the view that the Gujarat High Court had
taken so both the matters came up
together attacked before The Supreme
Court
now the primary two contentions that the
promoters had raised and large part of
this was also touched upon by Neha is
that look today the manner in which the
RBI circular is is frame
a there is a requirement for the bank to
mandatory declare me a fraud if the
categories of the definition of Rod are
made so the forensic auditor does come
to a finding that yes A B C D E F have
happened which are within the Ambit of
the definition of Fraud within the RBI
circular then the bank will necessarily
declare me a fraud now the decoration of
fraud per se if one looks at it in
isolation will have no meaning but if
you look at Clause 8.1 to 8.12 of the
circular there are various consequences
that take place the majority the biggest
of that being that you cannot Avail any
further banking facilities number one
number two consequences of being a
willful default I will automatically
flow and number three you will be
debugged from a accessing the Capital
Market as well as you will also be
debugged from being a director or
promoter of a company going forward
where other stakeholders are also
involved so ultimately it's a financial
debt for that promoter that company that
business orientation going forward so
the argument put forth by the promoter
was that look if ultimately the
consequence is going towards a situation
where my rights and here we are talking
about in essential fundamental right not
just a legal right but right under
article 191g is getting violated the
least I expect law to do is to give me a
hearing before that
the second argument was that part of
this this entire exercise is that you
have a forensic auditor who comes into
play so I am expected to be at least
given a show cause of the findings that
are put up against me by the forensic
auditor I should be provided the
necessary documents which form the basis
for that and the order that you give on
declaring me a fraud should obviously
contain the reason as to why my
explanations have not been accepted
now the counter argument of of the RBI
in the banks all that look look you have
to read in administrative law principles
of natural Justice Etc within the
context in which the secure was framed
so if you look at the purpose the
objective of why the circular came into
being it was to preempt detect
and prevent to the extent possible in
the fraudulent exercise within the
within the banking regulation system so
if I as the bank am required to give
notice to the borrower that look I am in
the process of declaring you as a fraud
account
then it will a Wither away the very
immediacy with which this is to happen
number two it will Scuttle any further
investigation or any further action
which is to be taken against that
promoter of that company because the
promoter will get a hint of what is
going to happen and the biggest example
that the banks give over here was that
one of the actions which follows after
decoration of fraud is that I am
mandated to file a criminal complaint
before the investigating agency if it's
beyond a certain threshold of the CBI if
it's under the threshold to the state
police or the eow so the moment I give
show cause of the fact that I am in the
process of taking steps under the RBI
circular the the promoter will get whiff
of the fact that things are proceeding
towards that end which will ultimately
Scuttle a criminal investigation where
the ultimate finding of guilt is to
happen and the last argument raised by
the bank was that look if you look at
the manner in which this entire exercise
is frame it is an economic policy
decision of the RBI to declare accounts
as fraud so since it's an economic
policy as the law of the land stands
Court should be circumspect of entering
into that Fray and should leave that to
The Experts so there is no requirement
of a hearing to take place because
ultimately it's only nothing but a
reporting mechanism not even reaching
the threshold of an administrative
decision now let's break this down how
the court comes to the finding
very I would say very poignantly put
civil consequences has been defined
within the Judgment not very clearly but
if you read the the manual Justice
understood
any action which has an impact on the
way in which you will deal with your
business undertakings
Falls within the Ambit of section 191g
article 191g or right to do trade-in
profession which can only be curtailed
with reasonable restrictions so any
action which today has the consequence
of not just a mere restriction on your
right to do trade but goes to the extent
of curtailing you from accessing the
banking facilities going forward
curtails your entire manner which you
will do business is actually much higher
so he says the Civil consequences your
are way higher than what you would
expect a mechanical reporting mechanism
to do and therefore he reads in the
requirement of natural Justice number
one number two he says you cannot buy
and this is a very interesting concept
that he has brought about
till now the arguments that we've always
seen play out in court is that if if a
natural Justice principal is not
specifically recognized in the statute
or in regulation it means it's impliedly
excluded
he has reversed this principle to now
say you cannot impliedly exclude
principle of national Justice unless
you're specifically said that you will
not be given a hearing so by way of
implied inclusion he now says why the
circular does not you know
uh touch upon it it also does not say
you will never be given a hearing and
since fundamental rights part three of
the Constitution is way higher than a
mere RBI Master Direction This principle
necessary has to be read into it so
that's aspect number one aspect number
two which is I find to be the more
critical part of this is he says while
this entire process can take place you
will give a show cause you will give
detailed documents Etc the order given
by the Banks has to be a reasoned order
and this is drawing on from the fact
that we've seen uh SBI versus jar
developers which was on the lines of
which was a judgment on the willful
defaulter side where Justice nariman
clarified that look A Bank when it
declares someone is a willful default or
has to give a recent order that dual
students today has developed through the
Delhi High Court Bombay high court and
various high court orders to say this
the principles of natural Justice have
to be inbuilt to the extent that the
bank while declaring willful default
should also give a recent order to say
why you are declaring them a recent
order and now with the fraud circular
also being brought into that embed what
happens is that you cannot wish away my
explanation to say look I have looked at
your your explanation to ABC I find the
forensic report to be more sacrosan than
your reply therefore I'm I'm not
accepting your reply I'm declaring your
fraud this today cannot stand which in
fact in cases you've seen happen there
have been cases where a bank for the
formalities sake has given a show cause
has given me a hearing But ultimately
given a one-line decision saying I'm
accepting the banks I'm accepting the
forensic audit report so that today is
the more critical part of it where the
bank is now held accountable to give a
detailed reason order and the last part
of this I'll just touch upon this in 30
seconds is that he says
in the Judgment that apart from civil
consequences and the right to be heard
one interesting aspect is that you you
cannot just be heard by the forensic
auditor and be told that look this
that's substantial compliance because
it's the decision maker which is the
bank which has to give you a hearing and
that again using practically happened
where forensic Auditors are seek
clarifications from the promoters and
the promoters are told by the banknote
look you've already been heard by the
forensic auditor we need not hear you
anymore and that he categorically denies
to say this is not acceptable
okay I think just one point there which
malark has beautifully articulated I
just add one small point is that they've
also banks have also try to say that
this is a time-bound process and
therefore we you know excluding the
right to hearing but Justice even
pointed out on that that six months is
enough time for you to complete the
whole process and give a hearing so he's
really
um I think very strongly uh uh upheld
the right to do business the right to
Liberty and the right to reputation
through this judgment
uh I want to know what about the people
who have already suffered and declared
fraud uh
you know that is really right now it's a
um
say that it is definitely
that comes before all of us
uh there is it's not that there is no
solution but it's just that solution now
in light of this Ambit that has been
laid down by The Honorable Supreme Court
is going to still be very fact based on
every particular case now I can give you
a situation there may be a case where
because of a fraud declaration a company
is taken into unsolvency the insolvency
is an advanced stage
um
the subject to applicability of section
12v of the code and regulation 30
now because the fraud declaration will
go because there is no opportunity of
hearing was given the 7th June 2019
circular which allows Banks to consider
a one-time settlement by a promoter and
except for where a promoter is declared
as a willful defaulter or a fraud can
today be maybe if circumstances permit
uh
such a promoter can make an offer for a
one-time settlement secondly there will
be consequences on Locs that were issued
by Banks person to Declaration of fraud
those those will also fall
most most importantly the Declaration of
fraud as is
against the company and the consequent
impact on the promoters will go but then
again one will have to see where where
is the whether the complaint is only
made to CBI or the police as an firm
registered has a charge sheet been filed
those will then be specific instances
now cases where there's only a complaint
one can still try and you know uh maybe
uh write to the bank to try and say look
now that this
um fraud declaration has gone in the
Wheels of Time have been sort of set
back this should also be held back if it
is just at an
um
fir stage appropriate recourse can be
considered there now if it's a chart
sheet stage it's a whole different ball
game altogether
uh but I do think that despite all of
that most individuals most uh promoters
most uh companies should definitely seek
for that Declaration of fraud which was
without giving them a hearing to go and
definitely go back to the banks and say
now hear us before you do anything else
because that will definitely Aid with
all these other proceedings in some uh
at the appropriate stage that is really
the way I would think of it right now
and like I said it's going to be all
very individual case uh paste as well
yeah so I mean if the way forward is uh
at the courts and at the strategy level
both a lot of petitions are already
pending before various courts where they
were waiting for the supreme court
judgment to come in so everyone whose
Declaration of fraud today is pending
adjudication before these various High
courts will obviously all be cost and
set aside which automatically the
the way forward for these promoters
companies is that they revive themselves
back into the banking system and they
are then left to Avail whatever remedies
they have under the various RBI
circulars including the fact that
they'll be now open to availing more
banking facilities to ensure that
whatever shortfall is there or whatever
uh efficiencies are there in terms of
their uh their their outstanding debts
can can be resolved Suns the criminal
proceedings let's look at how criminal
proceedings will span up very much one
very interesting aspect that the
Judgment talks about is that it says
that while this entire process on the
Civil remedy side which the bank takes
will require a right to be heard there
is no requirement for the bank to hear
you before going and filing a complaint
or before registration of a fire because
that's the normal criminal law to set in
motion that if you have cognizable
information in your hand that should be
sufficient for you to go and file a
police complaint and the police is
mandated to register an fir so if the
decoration of fraud which is the fulcrum
of the case
will the criminal proceeding also
automatically lapse will have to be seen
on two fronts one will have to be seen
as to whether the the Declaration of
fraud is the sole basis for the bank to
have actually gone and filed the
complaint if that is so then I assume
one will be able to take up an argument
what we generally call as the fruits of
poisonous tree and say that look if the
if the very root of this entire criminal
complaint has gone and you you are
filing a criminal complaint only basis
this only and I I stress on the word
only then the criminal complaint or the
consequential fir should also go
however if in and that again is a part
of our practical experience what we've
seen is that Banks apart from declaring
the account as fraud has also taken
large part of Q from its existing
internal reporting mechanism the
excerpts or the forensic ordered report
some categorical finding of the forensic
audit report which may not typically be
within the four ambits of the fraud or
the definition of Fraud but has used
that to say look some criminal offenses
definitely being committed so we are
resisting their fire
will that fire stand is again something
which helps which will have to be tested
in court
and the last part of this obviously is
if the criminal investigation has
proceeded to an extent because a lot of
promoters would have faced the brunt of
this and for them the Judgment comes in
too late because a decoration of fraud
would have happened say in 2018-19 today
the criminal investigation has reached a
point where things are already
proceeding at the court level where
police after investigation has actually
found that there is an offense made out
and a chart sheet has been filed charges
have been framed to them I feel this
judgment is more of a remedy on the
Civil side than on the criminal side
because it it does not to that extent
help them unless that case specific
facts can be maneuvered around to show
that look ultimately this is the sole
decision why all this has happened and
that argument today I believe will be
tested in various other high courts
okay thanks thanks so much for sharing
all this perspective on the Judgment by
Justice General trude on the rbi's
master circular and fraud uh this was
indeed the enlightening in the sales
that people got to know what are the
implications of the judgment and what is
the course of future we also discussed
uh what about people who've already been
declared fraud how could they be helped
uh thank you so much
from NM Lord Chambers for sharing all
these details with the viewers uh
looking forward to discuss this issue
some more because I think they will be
an implication of the judgment will
which will have to be discussed in the
months to come so maybe in a month's
time you'll replace for your time again

MV0sADSNDow,PM Modi At Sacred Heart Cathedral On Easter | Historic Church Visit By Indian PM | NewsX,PM Modi At Sacred Heart Cathedral On Easter | Historic Church Visit By Indian PM | NewsX To Subscribe our YouTube channel ...,2023-04-09T16:05:52Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MV0sADSNDow/hqdefault.jpg,"it is a
pretty historically significant because
this is the first time to the best of
our knowledge that a sitting prime
minister
has visited
at a public ceremony a church this has
never happened before it's an excellent
thing that's happening what you're
watching shorts on your screens that
ladies and gentlemen is the Sacred Heart
cathedral in New Delhi we've been
talking about it lots of people on on
the broadcast with us I still have Savio
with us on the broadcast I believe
Professor Madame nalapath is joining us
as well alok Mehta is going to be
joining us very shortly as well when
we're trying to get more people
hopefully and my reporter from this
church up very very shortly I already
have reported the BJP headquarters where
also the Prime Minister should be able
to visit uh after this after this church
service is over so let me get back to
Savvy on the thought that we were
discussing right before I took a break
now Savio for people watching the
broadcast Savio joined the joined the
BJP he has contested from a constituency
in Goa in which the majority population
is christian ah
Savio there are been a lot of
apprehensions misapprehensions about the
bhartiya janta party in the past I am
sure you've come up with them people
would have raised them with you that why
have you joined the BJP why do you think
the BJP uh can you know service even the
Christian Community because we have a
you know religious fault lines in
politics uh
how is the perception of the bjb change
for you let's start with you why did you
join the BJP
well I actually joined the BJP Prime and
it was after late uh defense minister
the chief minister
manohar parikar and having watched him
haven't interacted with him I realized
that beyond the Hindu majority tag that
BJP normally carried a weighted self Mr
parikar was a man of extreme Integrity
he had a vision and he was working
towards a better Goa and a better India
and that was very inspirational so my
first understanding of BJP itself other
than reading the books of of Dean
dayalupate and nanaji Deshmukh and every
you know learning about them I think the
real inspiration came from Mr Manor
Parker
I realized that you know he was such an
open open book in in his interactions in
his relationships with people so there
was never a divide in his in his
approach to to certain aspects of of
governance or or friendship with
different people he was
the leader he was a BJP leader and he
looked at the Hindus the Christians the
Muslims everybody in the same uh
wavelength which was why in 2012 the
people of Goa gave him a thumping
majority
never before did you see constituencies
of which were predominantly Christian
dominated constituency which is the
salsit region in in gork actually come
out and support Mr Marvel Parker and
they did that because he was able to
break through to them through an
intellectual reasoning you see the
Christian Community per se
they are not to interfering the
community number one the car the the
allegations of conversions that happened
this was not the entire Christian
Community this is a section of people
okay okay so I have to ask you the
political question on this because there
is a lot of symbolism in this there is
no doubt about it okay and that's you
know you can argue the symbolism both
ways but there is symbolism in this
there's always a first time and the
first time has been done by Narendra
Modi like I said we've seen him visiting
uh you know the Artis and the temples
we've seen him visiting the gurdwaras uh
and now we're going to see him visited a
church for the first time now
for you know literally your friends and
neighbors Savio will they look at it
this cynically that this is some sort of
tokenism for the cameras
or you know will they actually perceive
this as as a positive symbol well I can
tell you to tell you about 70 of the
people will not look at it physically 30
of the people will look at this but then
that's the that's the choice people have
right for us what's the most important
aspect the most important aspect is that
you have a prime minister who's
inclusive this tag that you have BJP
Hindu majority party I think that's a
little cliche right now because what you
have is the prime minister who's
thinking India
you which is what I said my my leaning
this is the BJP happy because of Mr
manual tarika okay
form a stronger supporting family
okay I was if many many people don't
know I was a part of the Congress for a
very short time and I realized that this
is not the nationalism Spirit my family
brought me up
okay I know I I I I can I can I can you
know it is almost worryingly predict
what the political discourse on this
later in the evening and tomorrow is
going to be I'm sure you know and it you
know it's it's very predictable nice but
it's going to be oh you know this is all
you know all all symbolism uh he's doing
it because you know he's eyeing some
water Bank in Kerala or you know some
somewhere else uh and he would never
visit a a Masjid that the way he would
visit a church or why is he not gone to
Masjid instead that's what they're going
to say uh on the other side you know
then the brick pads are going to happen
and then the people of the BJP will be
saying okay we don't know what religion
Sonia Gandhi is this that this is what
political brick bats comes down to now
I'm not I'm a TV journalist I had to
accept that political big bads are part
of my life also I have to cover them you
know savior Rodriguez is also runs the
newspaper so we have to accept it but
there's a chance sometimes to rise above
that so I'm going to make an appeal for
people watching this broadcast just to
not miss that chance let's let's try to
rise above that for just a minute which
is why I've been talking about this
church talk let's talk about Easter
Sunday it's it's relevance why this is a
historic visit why this is good for the
country and and and the community at
large so let me get a Manchu but on this
before I come to my colleague himanshu
just a quick quick thought on this
because
the you know we you know what the
cynical argument is going to be
at this point of time okay uh you know
nine years into uh being being prime
minister
why do this now why why not go last year
you know why not go two years ago five
years ago why not do it as Chief
president of Gujarat why why now
no no why why now is not the question
why not now
see one must ask that because now when
you see the word equations changing
people looking at India in a different
manner you have to give a certain
message to the word also
see opposition here yes they have been
creeping as you said you know there's
going to be so much of political
backlash and what you can call it
whatever you want to call it you call it
that's going to happen because of our
politicians are basically you know
active and reactives that's all they do
they don't think rationally at times
see if you are viewers might do it
politicians will not
and that is the message that is why you
know this is the message you know in a
day a prime minister of a country he
goes to a tiger Resort and then to a
church also
gives a very very subtle message
it's a message of we have arrived and
you better look at it
you look at us in a very very
straightforward manner
now you know all those days are gone
when 1999 some U.S journalists or some
NRI in India will call him Hindu
nationalist party the days are gone
see as the time moves you have to
understand one thing people have to
evolve and those who evolve succeed
those who don't evolve are perished okay
okay so there's an evolutionary process
and that conversation is going to happen
in this country and it's going to happen
across the world because again yeah it's
it it's not a visit to the on a ad hoc
occasion it's on a significant occasion
which is Easter Sunday yes it's not that
he decided to just pop in for for no
reason there's a there is a special
ceremony that's happening
okay okay okay let me just put out I
think we have got from uh father Francis
swaminathan who is as I just mentioned
the the parish priest there he has said
this and I'm quoting from an agency PM
Narendra Modi is coming to our church
today and we are excited about it I
think this is the first time that prime
minister is coming to a church
uh so this is the information that has
been put out by the parish priest whose
names I've just read out to you all in
total okay so a whole bunch of people
are joining us on the broadcast let me
go first to my reporter mahima kataria
who right now is uh at the BJP
headquarters where the prime minister is
also scheduled to visit uh Ajit my
colleague is joining us now uh from the
Sacred Heart Katrina going to Ajit in
just a second mayama first over to you
so we are expecting him to go in the
next half an hour or so
well absolutely uh Richard the tentative
time that is given in the itinerary is
somewhere around 5 30 because prime
minister then have to leave for the BJP
headquarters because directly from the
church he's going to be here at the
headquarters where we people are and
like you correctly pointed out about the
priest that is of the very particular
church that prime minister is going to
visit today and he clearly stated that
prime minister is living on the agenda
all the principles
so it is also very important definitely
uh like you could actually pointed out
there is going to be a political slot
Fest uh when it comes to the community
but also there is Karnataka elections
there is the Outreach to the community
there is there are people who are
joining BJP we cannot deny deny the fact
that AKA Anthony's uh Anthony has also
joined BJP uh so there's a lot of long
way when it comes to uh Conquering the
Southern India so prime minister
somewhere down the line I was also
focusing on that but today it's a very
special occasion and prime minister yeah
also met one of the you know the chief
uh the chiefs no I would
okay my mother stay with me I'm told uh
uh a lobo Naga is joining us uh content
creator who hails from the northeast of
India Mr Naga thanks very much for
taking out your time just I just want
your first thoughts we'll be getting the
visuals very shortly uh it's uh it's a
notable thing I know you you sat in the
conversation you know what the cynical
argument is going to very shortly be but
are you happy that to celebrate East
Easter Sunday Narendra Modi will be at
the Sacred Heart Cathedral in Delhi
hi uh good evening first of all thank
you so much and yes why not why not it's
it's a it's a celebration day for the
Christians around the world and we are
so happy the Prime Minister forget about
politics I'm not a politician so I don't
know anything about that but then all I
know is as a Christian we talk about
love and we are so happy that prime
minister is coming to the church and we
believe that this will set an example to
all the other uh you know friends from
other feet also you know uh to to you
know it's a very good example for me and
I believe that uh uh it's God's
intervention and God is going to bless
our prime minister okay okay you know
you have nothing to do with politics uh
you know yeah so so uh so as you are
observing this just as a as as a
layperson uh do you see this cynically
that this is some sort of symbolism
tokenism uh you know or or are you
actually happy that this is happening I
am actually happy I mean they might have
their own reasons for coming it might be
political gimmicks whatever but then as
a Christian I am so happy you know
coming and celebrating with us and then
we we are sure that this is going to be
a blessing to a lot of people yeah
okay I was just mentioning uh to uh when
we began this broadcast that I this
church is of course place where I've
visited several times and uh the first
time I went to the Sacred Heart
Cathedral uh was with a Muslim friend of
mine uh the two of us were in in in in
Connaught place and we uh we we were
walking down and we walked into the
Katrina and saw it for the first time
and of course I've been there uh several
several times after that including for
midnight mass which is it which is an
experience it's just it's an experience
uh it's not one of the biggest
cathedrals in the world uh it's the
biggest one in Delhi uh to the best of
my knowledge I've lived here all my life
and I I'm pretty sure this is the
biggest one Delhi there are other
churches in Delhi but this is the
biggest one and I was just pointing out
uh if I can just quickly get my
colleagues to get my my touchpad back
here
okay so this is where the church is
ladies and gentlemen uh I know I'm being
a bit cliched in this but sometimes the
cliched story needs to be etcetera so
the roundabout in the middle of your
screen that's called Golda Khanna okay
is the central post office the GPU okay
uh immediately to the east of it is the
Bangla sahib sarovar so that's the
Bangla sahib
gurudwara which is the grandest Gurdwara
in the national capital and immediately
to the north of it is the grandest
church
in the national capital and of course to
the west of the churches selling Saint
Columbus school to the east of the
church is the convent of Jesus and Mary
uh uh I'm pretty sure uh uh somebody
will correct me if I'm wrong I think I
think I think Shahrukh Khan is I think
from Saint Columbus's School uh so there
you have one of the biggest Muslim stars
in this country went to a a Christian
College here I'm going to confirm that
just once that's what I remember okay so
this is it tells a lot about the
synchronicity uh syncretity of this of
the city which
we take a lot of pleasure to sit on
television and Bash actually uh
Delhi is a beautiful place from where I
live in Delhi uh I can I hear uh within
I would say 500 meters there is a mosque
there is a Gurdwara and there is a
mandir so I I get to hear at home
everything I get to hear the Azan I get
to hear the the bells in the temple
every day and and we just grew up like
that let me quickly uh try to get my
colleague I'm still waiting for Ajit
Ajit can you hear us joining us on
broadcast he's at the golden outside the
Sacred Heart Cathedral in New Delhi Ajit
show us around what's expected
foreign
security reason but can you just show us
around the church and obviously there's
heavy security there for obvious reasons
again
foreign
I don't know how close to the gate of
the church you can get but you head in
the opposite direction I'm coming back
to you in exactly two minutes so that we
can actually see the church live and of
course we're waiting for the Easter
ceremony there 5 30 is the approximate
time so now I'm going to quickly get
Savio back in before I can imagine but
back into this conversation we can free
you will come back after after this over
for when the PM's heading to the BJP
headquarters will be let's free maima uh
I'm gonna get Savio back in okay Savio
so I'm going to ask you the the larger
picture question while we wait for Ajit
to get closer to the church
now
you know you in in your under your
journalistic hat in your journalistic
after okay
have taken on some crucial issues that
the larger Church in India faces okay ah
crucial issues regarding abuse crucial
issues regarding the internal workings
of the church and oftentimes when
somebody is trying to investigate or you
know move for reform or tell the stories
of people who've been oppressed it gets
confused into an attack on on the
religion an attack on the institution so
these problems do happen so it is
important that when we are looking at
issues that the Christian Community
faces here they are not seen from a
religious Avatar they're not seen from a
defensive mindset how do these these
kind of interactions like we are about
to see today help in that
see a largely most most people in the
Christian Community whether there are
atrocities happening within the church
or whether there are crimes happening
within the church like the crimes of
sexual abuse that has happened within
the church or the abuse of Miners and
nuns it is I mean the community that's
raised the issue up if you look at the
case of Bishop where the nuns that
raised the issue the supporting uh
strength for the nuns were the Christian
Community itself so there are
conscientious citizens in the Christian
Community that just that believe that it
is necessary to uphold the precepts and
the teachings of Jesus Christ now
sometimes there are some people who
within Russian institution which are
some priests some Bishops that strain
and that strain brings a bad name to the
entire Community brings a bad name to
the entire institution and that needs to
be called out and there are people
within the Christian Community that
calls it out how does the church look at
it I believe and I have seen Pope
Francis taking very very strong steps
towards sexual abuse by trees to a
strong steps in Corruptions related to
Catholic priests around the world so
there is an attempting weight yeah in
fact in fact just I think yesterday he's
even welcomed lgbtq members and he's
spoken about uh about about some very
difficult to speak about issues for a
for for for a pope including sexual
relations uh so that that has happened
this past 24 hours so there is there is
there is a learning there is a there is
a transformation there's a Reformation
that's happening within the Catholic
Church itself because you're trying to
see the larger interest is always people
you have to understand what
and that's how
it can evolve so even the teachings of
Christ while the uh the the order of it
and the importance of it Remains the
Same it needs to be adapted and adopted
to situations that are there okay okay
what is the situation in India right now
uh savior to the best of your knowledge
and I know we've just we've just you
know plucked this out of thin air
because honestly ladies and gentlemen
this has come as a surprise uh nobody
was planning for this we just found out
an hour ago that this was going to take
place so what's the situation in in
India for people watching this broadcast
Savio uh you know so there is a there's
a Catholic Community there is a
Protestant Community uh you know there
are many other alliterations of of the
Christian faith that are also active in
this country how does that play out
which is the largest
see the largest population in this
country right now are the Roman
Catholics and then you have to protest
and then you have ways of the
denominations that follow the
non-catholic uh belief system but I mean
believe me sister you know
the most important thing to do now is
people even from the Christian Community
are looking at Prime Minister Narendra
Modi as a leader of India the so-called
tag attached to BJP the RSS sometimes
does not even a hamper modi's uh you
know the image Modi has because a lot of
Christian people want development they
want better life okay so aside from the
cynicism which we know is going to come
our way there's no running away from
that you know when you when when a high
profile person visits a a high profile
phase but in your native state Goa how's
it going to how is this visit going to
go down in an hour's time
I think many people are going to
appreciate it they're going to respect
it
as to the right body but I mean many
people I'm talking almost 70 75 of the
people in Goa okay will appreciate what
Prime Minister Modi is doing so let me
let me ask the completely exact opposite
question to uh to himanshu but of course
will there be another set of people who
actually might be upset
that ok what is this what is the reason
for doing all of this why all these
Church visitor visits why do we have to
be apologetic about you know making
Outreach to the minorities uh you know
so many atrocities have been done on
Hindus of course uh by by uh you can
argue that the British were Christians
you can have that argument will there
some be some people uh within the party
itself uh who are going to be unhappy
about this
no it's not going to be that there are
going to be a minuscule few now in
2023-24 since they know how the party is
evolving but uh if I'll get you very
very very very very interesting episode
when Modi was chief minister here rather
why was chief minister here and we had
some trouble in dance
about the so-called conversions
it's an old issue after 10 12 years it's
again racking up again you know by this
one visit that time Narendra Bhai was
the chief minister here
and the approach he took was
he just said one sentence
personally he said
see it means a lot you know on a on a
personal belief when I see
A party's president
by going by a chopper to a remote
Village in dark
that's on one side and on the other side
a chief minister clearly says
what does it mean
see what I'm trying to tell you is
the perception has always been wrong
from the beginning
but as you know the person as you know
the party as you know the man
has evolved
words well well I'm I'm not a cynic okay
by the nature of my job I have to be
look at people but I can tell you that
on on the on the straight up front of
this
generally news happens when something
has gone wrong okay right somebody some
incident has taken place some Clash has
taken place some killing has taken place
some Riot has taken place and then
becomes new so then you draw an
assumption that you know the Interfaith
relations are very bad everything is
chaotic because that's all that gets
covered so today we have an opportunity
to discuss the opposite now the reason
this is important is because we do not
want
persecution complexes in this country
because if you want to raise a serious
conversation let's say conversion is a
serious conversation it's not a black
and white issue it's a gray issue when
it comes to uh sexual abuse is what's
happened by the by the nuns in the
church which is a very very con very
difficult conversation
so an assumption is being made or a
convenient assumption is being made that
we can just
pigeonhole this as an attack on
Christianity as an attack on on the
Christian faith and not deal with the
issue on the merits of the issue so we
are having a different kind of
conversation and opportunity I mean I 15
years I've been doing this I've never
had the opportunity to discuss the
Sacred Heart Cathedral a place where
I've been to several times in this
length to discuss this architecture to
discuss his history I don't think father
Francis has has had will will or has or
will see these many TV cameras that are
about to show up at his door for Easter
for you know Easter Sunday
let me quickly hop across now to the
church itself now it's close to the gate
shows around
foreign foreign
on the broadcast as well I take a very
short break ladies and gentlemen within
one minute we are back and we continue
our live coverage on the other side stay
with us
[Music]
first about your journey you know you've
been a Convent educated girl uh who got
married into a political family politics
I don't think you'd ever thought to my
buddy okay I will become a Neta or
Mantra
so how did you feel about it let you
into a secret prayer the basis of me
marrying my husband was
like my father said it was an arranged
marriage he says
if the boy never comes into into
politics that two years later he would
become an MP in a couple of years later
Sobo died so I say it's all Destiny
nothing's in your own hands and forget
about ever thinking I hated politics
like a typical young Delhi I I think now
there are a lot more aware than what we
were there's a lot that you can do and
my aim was always to uplift women in
fact I started nanicha which was an NGO
to uplift women take one is to you know
marry into a political family second is
to be a politician yourself and will be
in Punjab how are you taken as a woman
in a way a woman coming there set the
bar for other women to follow as well
which is why I feel that a lot more
women need to come out but what is uh
you know the now we are seeing at least
the opposition is coming together
whatever the issue is do you see this
Unity lasting till 24 what is the road
ahead if someone came with domestic
violence or someone who was raped they
say when we go to the police station the
guy tells us
go back go back home so who should we go
to always when I told my dad in law that
at least there should be women there at
night who can she go to she can't go to
those drunk policemen in the police
station and tell her problem because
this is what they say to her
[Music]
okay welcome back we're gonna State go
across to the Sacred Heart Cathedral in
New Delhi where we're expecting Prime
Minister Modi to attend a special
service
on Easter Sunday it's it's the is the
oldest church in Delhi to my memory it's
100 years old or near 100 years old 95
years old and is definitely the largest
church in Delhi this is right next to
the central heart uh of Connaught place
next to the gurudwara bangla's Bangla
Baba kadak Sigma next to the Grand post
office Central post office my colleague
Ajit srivastav is there at the gates of
the church Ajit uh you know you were
showing us around please go ahead what
what's happening there now
foreign
uh and I and I know for the next 24
hours I've done this for a long time
you've been you've been reporting for a
long time
so this is going to happen right so we
accept that this is going to happen and
the ugliness of this is going to happen
ah and that's how democracy functions
these things happen but I want to try to
take on the larger picture we make an
effort here on news X just to uplift the
conversation rather than take the
conversation to the gutter okay so let's
upload the conversation alok Mehta who's
been doing journalism since before I was
born is joining us on the broadcast I
look better I didn't know this it just
it just come as a revelation
uh to think about it that no sitting
Indian Prime Minister has ever been to a
church
uh unusual
because only news X covered this kind of
serious discussion and I feel it show it
proved that what the rate Modi was
telling even in Gujarat and later on in
the uh in the Prime Minister always he
said that we feel and we respect every
religion but sometimes because his image
was from RSS and all people think that
because many go to kedarnath then people
say okay he's going for a vote if you go
to Varanasi they say oh he's going by
vote you know if he believe it is some
but here I would like to mention one
more interesting thing Dr Manmohan Singh
used to go to Gurdwara nobody talked
about it why he's going for a boat and
is he going to get some vote in Punjab
but not himself but for the Punjab
Congress was there so whatever but I
don't think because I following since
last almost 50 years and that's why I'm
telling you you are really right that no
other prime minister I remember but I
don't remember about the nehru's but I
remember but interestingly one point I
would like to mention here I can't tell
the exact year because it must be
don't remember the exact year but you
see Sonia Gandhi used to go churches and
because I was a intern so we used to
carry stories but somebody go to an
archive and one can find it because at
the time it's a chance on the Christmas
or something like that no it's not
necessary but I remember earlier the
family used to go to church but then
they said okay we are going to ganga
even with all regards
he was talking that known she become
fully and she believed in it I can
understand she must be all doing the all
rituals in Hinduism but why do you want
to keep secret about you if you believe
in a church you are born in a from a
family who believed in a Christianity
and your name was also there so if you
somebody go for your church you go to uh
Gurdwara
here also you have to go to an archive
even in some foreign visit uh in some
Gulf countries uh prime minister
Narendra Modi also went to uh and
recently a few uh two months back I
think Mohan Bhagavad ji also went into
this so as a mother's eye if you have
something a very auspicious and you feel
that one should go and somebody invite
here the father invited Prime Minister
Modi and he said okay if I have a time I
can come so why why we always correct as
journalist I feel sometime bad that we
always talk about the world
[Music]
that's why I feel is good at least give
a message that in India we are really
secular maybe we believe in a Hinduism
but even then we respect our religion
against terrorism and the name of the
religion
okay I'm just asking my team to pull out
those photographs as well we'll just put
them on your screen so yes so uh a look
math is right uh it uh 2018 was the
first time that Narendra Modi as sitting
prime minister uh this is the Borah
community in Indore he visited the
mosque he's of course been to the Sheikh
zayath mosque in Abu Dhabi that's why I
know for sure that's happened very
recently
we're going to get some information uh
why are we showing this this is me uh
just giving a good quick literation my
PCR group obviously is not being able to
follow what we're doing so I'm going to
request them to just follow up meanwhile
with us uh sumitra goenka joining us
uh and uh major Mohammed Alisha on the
broadcast with us on as well let me let
me come to you uh so it is Easter Sunday
I was just telling our viewers okay and
it's a it's a
sometimes we get lost and you know uh
car aren't able to communicate anecdotal
stories well which actually represent
our lives so the first time I went to
the Sacred Heart Cathedral I was still
in school and my school was nearby it's
not senka numbers but it's nearby
and I was I remember I had to go to San
Columbus to put some posters uh for a
debate we were organizing in school and
I was with a Muslim friend of mine who's
who's a daughter of a very well-known
politician and on the way out of Saint
Columbus we we stopped by to this church
so a Hindu and a Muslim went to a church
as as students right across the road
from this church of course is the is the
Bangla sahib Gurdwara where I've been
several times as well uh
you know we always find these topics of
conversation when there's some problem
going going wrong but actually on day to
day life these are all very normal
things a major Shah
absolutely
these are very very normal things and uh
I would like to recite one thing when I
was posted in the Northeast in nagaland
100 person Christian Street 100 I mean
being a Naga Mitchell means you're a
Christian and I used to go to mizoram
very often mizoram again 100 Christian
so it's a very normal thing I mean
people and what is
surprising is the revolution that no
prime minister has ever been to a church
I will have to ask this to myself 10
times are you sure when you spoke on
this I said no it can't be I'm I'm
aghast I'll tell you one thing of of a
video a photograph had got viral last
year when a lieutenant general Pandey
who was GOC 15 Co in Sri Lanka at that
time he was he was there in a mosque in
for a Namaz along with Sikh officers so
I mean it is a seek Hindu a Muslim every
single officer I think it's called
what's it called it's called the MMG
right if I'm not mistaken that's right
in fact so it's a very normal thing to
do and I am surprised why no no I will
give an answer to people who you are
talking about who would say it's because
election the coming of awards I would
say two things firstly it's a good sign
that he's gone there he's gone to a
church but well you can get into uh why
not a moss why not this why not that but
they're very fat is bad say that he's
going to church should be happy for that
should see it very very positively
secondly yeah amen come on people if I
got a doctor hey you would be curing
patience
you would be in the body or you would be
safeguarding our Frontiers
you would be doing a show similarly
so what firstly it may not be for
elections secondly to put everything in
back in perspective even if people say
it is for words
so what I remember when he was cleaning
a beach and uh they were photographs of
it I've been working fun of it that oh
he's cleaning a [ __ ] symbolic so so you
gotta expect the minister for God's sake
to go around being garbage if that
example of his if it's a photo shoot
people went on it fine I if I'm saying
even before the photo shoot as long as
it Bears good results okay okay let me
let me let me get Gotham Mukherjee into
this conversation I mean it's not just
any random day it is Easter Sunday okay
uh so it is or it is a it's a day of
significance uh so uh uh this is going
to be a a private ceremony for security
reasons obviously so there's not going
to be no congregation in the church at
that point of time but the parish
priests are going to be there and
there's going to be an opportunity to
plant a tree ah after the ceremony is
going to be it's going to be a quick
visit maybe about half an hour 45
minutes
is it is it uh to be looked at cynically
gothamukurji can you can you is is this
what is going to become coming coming
down to the next 24 hours
well I think it's part of the Outreach
that the RSS and the BJP are doing of
late
because much of their constituency is
now becoming not just Hindus but also
Christians the whole of the Northeast
which is now either part of the BJP or
Allied to the BJP is largely Christian
with the exception of Assam
and so a gesture like this which is
again it's interesting it's he's gone to
a Catholic church and Easter is
celebrated with greater forever amongst
Catholics rather than Protestants the
north is known for being Anglican
formerly Anglican and now the Indian
Church version of it Church of Northern
India but he went to a Catholic church
so it is aimed partially I would imagine
at Goa partially at the Northeast which
do have both Protestants and and
Catholics in in quite a proportion yeah
but but then there are you know there
are shivides and and vaishnavoids and
Ling you know lingayats and and vocaliga
so you know there are denominations
amongst all Faith uh in in Christianity
you can go on and they are you know
Jehovah's Witnesses and you know you can
go on in terms of denominations
the big denominations of course are what
gothamukher is referred to but
gothamukherjee no so so but but then the
obvious question remains no should we be
looking at it as there is always a first
time okay this is the first time we are
being told and I can't think of any
other occasion the Lok Mehta can't think
any like I said he's been doing this
before I was born of any occasion with a
sitting prime minister has gone to a
church should this be there's always a
first time great or should it be oh this
is tokenism it achieves nothing because
you know what's going to happen when the
opposition sings their teeth into this
well let us remember he went to visit
the pope and stayed with him for over an
hour it was a very cordial visit
recently when the pope was unwell Pope
Francis uh Narendra Modi sent her
message for uh for him to get better
which he has and he has conducted the
okay okay I'm sorry to interrupt you
prime minister is about to reach my
colleague there is there on the ground
Ajit go ahead
foreign
[Music]
will enter
there are plenty of side gates to the
sacred architecture I don't really know
this place so much so well I spend a lot
of time
playing and organizing things in Saint
Columbus school when I was in in my in
my younger days let me quickly get
sumitra going kind to this conversation
uh sumitra goenka now
this is something that plays out not
only in this country it is it is Easter
it is Easter Sunday
is it an opportunity for us to look at
the positivity of this visit because you
know what's going to happen once the
opposition thinks it's written to this
they are going to call it you know uh an
eye wash a Joomla tokenism and all sorts
of other nasty things
good evening rishab I think uh we should
not read too much into this because
Prime Minister Modi has always been
inclusive he has uh whatever policies he
has implemented all the policies have
been inclusive one of your families was
saying that this is a part of some
outreach program viruses and all I
completely do not agree with this
because see he is the citizen citizens
prime minister he has been uh you know
meeting people from different sections
of the society different religions
different caste recently uh he gave each
other uh for uh ajmer Sharif he has
visited the Pope Francis uh earlier like
you mentioned he has visited several
mosques so I think we are reading little
too much into this the opposition
naturally there are comments coming from
opposition for any and everything
including right now the latest
controversy about you know raising the
controversy about his qualification so
there can be anything moment he clicks a
photograph on a Jungle Safari there are
people who are commenting about it so I
think we should not look into uh those
people who have this constant habit of
you know criticizing the Prime Minister
on anything and everything that is
happening in the country or each and
every position if he goes into a gufa
and prays there then they will say okay
see how he is doing this if he clicks a
picture people will say okay see how
what clothes he's wearing so I think the
kind of criticism or the kind of
scrutiny that the prime minister is
under is really heavy and I don't think
it makes any difference to the people of
India people are seeing this as a great
gesture and I am really happy that first
time ever in in the history of India a
prime minister is going to visit a
church and uh this speaks a lot that you
know BJP is inclusive the nation uh is
together and we celebrate all religions
uh equally in this uh country and you
know there is complete Harmony but
that's the life that you and I lead okay
but let's not like I said this is always
the first time uh so I just want to show
an image here on your screens as both
sumitra I think and other guests were
mentioning this as well let's put our
pad on our screens here this was if I'm
not mistaken October of 2021 so about a
year and a half ago can we get the image
yeah so this is this is the meeting of
the Prime Minister with with Pope
Francis you can see uh Ambassador
jayashankar in the in in in the in the
backdraw back background and of course
this is uh the Prime Minister receiving
uh some books uh as a gift from Pope
Francis which he's putting you know a
politically uh putting uh to his head in
respect he's also uh on you can see that
there's a private audience that was
granted by the pope so there was 16
months ago okay there are plenty of
other images we've been pointing out uh
you know aloki was pointing out that
when he visited the Borah Community
mosque I know he's visited then mosque
in Indore I know for sure he's visited
the Abu Dhabi Sheikh Zayed mosque he's
visited others as well uh and it's up to
us to understand whether this is a
cynical approach or or otherwise so let
me quickly I interrupted before this let
me come back to him before I get in I
think Yoshi also joining us on broadcast
uh Gotham Mukherjee now
in the larger scheme of things as a
prime minister
the symbolism is important you can say
that I believe this you know I'm I
believe in real SEC tourism uh but
sometimes you have to wear it on your
sleeves uh is this a good thing a more
representative thing of what India that
you and I recognize looks like because
this would not be absurd this is what
our day-to-day life would be if you
happen to go for midnight mass uh with a
few friends for the experience of it not
for the religiosity of it it would not
be an an obtuse or an unusual thing to
do
well I I definitely think it is a fairly
recent broadening uh a sort of uh overt
broadening of the BJP RSS perspectives
uh there is a Outreach to asmanda
Muslims there is in an effort to blunt
the constant criticism coming
particularly from abroad that India is a
communal
country under this Administration as so
to take care of all this I I do think
there is a special effort being made to
reach out to minorities of all kinds as
well as to make
statements which are inclusive uh this
may be as sumitra pointed out something
that the BJP feels in their hearts but
it isn't apparent to most people and
most people do regard it as a Hindu
nationalist party uh with uh you know
blessed in their hearts if you like for
the minority okay so my question are
there still people in the BJP who still
regard themselves as the Hindu
nationalist party you will be saying
what's the reason for all of this stuff
yeah yeah you you've you've got a bit of
of that but you know uh doing something
like this is a policy decision and it
has been
um you know coming out more and more of
late whether it is aimed as the
elections or it is aimed at correcting
the perspective on the BJP RSS uh is
difficult to say okay as I was pointing
out I think several people have
mentioned this already the head of the
Syrian Christian Church which is the
denomination which you're seeing on your
screens uh which qualifies as the oldest
church that was uh built in India
also met the Prime Minister just a few
days ago and extended an invite for him
to visit this church in Kerala as well
let me quickly get in uh before I get in
Lakshmi Joshi also
my question to you is is going to be the
same
how do we then grab these opportunities
to represent what actually India
represents like I said you know
my first visit to this church was as a
as a a a young student in college with a
Muslim friend right across the road is
uh
Gurdwara Bangla says I'm sure you've
been there several times I've been there
several times these are normal this is
how we live normally right but we are
somehow perceived that we are always at
War amongst religions which you and I
know is not the truth
yeah you are very right because you know
the name people were working with some
extent with Gautam ji because I was
covering in Northeast what result uh got
or the BJP God just because the other
people working since the last 30 40
years there it's not today and most of
the Christian women just now our uh Mr
Shah also mentioned about the nagaland
so I remember when I visited in 9283 in
the Northeast area and then I know at
the time who were working in the RSS and
even the Congress regime was there but
he was there so I feel that there are
there are there were people who were
working behind the curtain maybe because
openly they accept is okay we believe in
hindustava and everybody we won't be
feeling but here they are both of these
right they abroad earlier also when
prime minister visited Italy or other
countries people were aware that he is
very open but you see in President Obama
or uh
if they take oath in a with Bible nobody
say okay why they are they are religious
in earlier years a few decades back the
church used to dominate in American
politics a lot so now if you feed the
teju because the majority is Hindu and
Narendra Modi is trying to convince all
our divide and especially the kalistani
moment or something like that if what is
happening in Canada
the people should know that India is a
real from heart as a Hinduism also you
say like to accept everybody
there's a problem here no there's a
problem here and let me get rajalakshmi
Joshi into this you know
uh
there is an Arthurian concept okay and
the reason I am referring it to because
you have the the Arthurian Knights of
the Round Table okay and with habitat
the chivalric codes then you have the
logic of good governance because they
have a very fair and just system so
there's an Arthurian concept of logic as
you're watching live shots of the
goldakhana uh where the church is in
Delhi on your screens so this Arthurian
concept
about good governance about chivalry
about good behavior is widely accepted
the story of King Arthur and the rights
of the round table are you know I mean
our children read these stories
but as soon as I say Rama rajya which is
supposed to be exactly the same thing
okay about good governance about
inclusivity we say no no this is a Hindu
fundamentalism so there is a
miscommunication a misrepresentation
that does happen now how do we fix this
how do we take opportunities like this
to fix that misrepresentation
a very good afternoon Richard
uh hit the nail on the head this is
exactly what even I was thinking that uh
you know all these Concepts which have
been borrowed or these kind of terms
that have been borrowed from uh Western
Civilization uh they actually uh you
know people think that they are some
kind of a modern or the they have I
don't know why they are easily
acceptable so that uh that kind of a
mindset has been purposely put into us
you know that has been put into us by
years of education uh hundreds of years
of education that the British have you
know they have created these uh this
term called as College children that is
what they have done so all those terms
that are that have come from the British
system that have come from the European
system we somehow tend to think that
they are superior and that they are
something that we need to be following
instead of we telling the world that
this is the so the conceptive concept of
ramraja which meant an a system of ideal
government and we take it to the whole
world instead of that our own people
keep bashing it down they keep saying
that this is something outdated and this
is something that is going to be biased
etc etc which is very unfair okay so how
do we yes finish your thought finish
your thought yeah
yeah like alok mataji was talking about
the Northeast you must have seen in the
recent uh election result you know a
completely Christian majority state has
voted for BJP it means that BJP is not
their only bandrant to the Hindus or you
know or that any Christians they feel
that it is anti-christian or anything of
that sort the kind of ideology is India
first you must have seen what Modi has
been talking about right from the start
he speaks about India first his idea of
secularism is India first which means
that you know in the earlier time the in
the earlier government they used to talk
about how the minorities need to be
given more important I I don't see
anything wrong okay okay okay yeah yeah
so yeah so when more more importance and
that line between uh real secularism in
appeasement it's a debate that's
continuing you're watching live shots on
your screen ladies and gentlemen uh we
have been told that the PM's cavalcade
is on its route and you can see the
advanced cars that are arriving there
the PM of course is just just landed in
early he was has spent the past near 48
Hours inaugurating
projects all over the south of the
country he was at a tiger Century just
before this announcing this Global big
cat Alliance Forum uh I think that's the
PM's cavalcade arriving at Ajit my
colleague is there on the ground Ajit
take it away
foreign foreign
what should we take away from this about
what has just happened how do I absorb
this
I think it will be a good good will for
the government also because in the party
at government because we need a peace in
cooperation with all communities and
that that's why the Prime Minister
Narendra Modi hard-working person and
all the time he was traveling in Tamil
Nadu also there are Christians in Andhra
Pradesh you remember yesterday for
yesterday Kiran Reddy also joined and at
present the Andhra chief minister is a
Christian from Christian Community so
indirectly it gives a confidence to the
people that this prime minister is not
for any one community and the majority
is there certainly he respect with every
religion and that's why this beating it
will go a long way for party for
government and for the society because
you know as you are very rightly said in
the school days we used to go and those
schools
and never felt about it in different
religion same thing prime minister
Narendra Modi wanted to give a message
what I feel so
what is this then the so
the the Pope Francis has respectful
meetings with Narendra Modi uh Muhammad
bin Salman has respectful meeting
Narendra Modi the sheikhs of the
Emirates Abu Dhabi Dubai they have
respectful meetings in Narendra Modi uh
but in this country we are told that
there is going you know this it's
anti-minority Muslim genocide you know
Christians are in trouble
how is the how is that happen because
now if you look at the larger scheme of
things the paragons of the faith the
heads of these Faith have all now met
Narendra Modi and at least uh you know
the the the people whom we all recognize
have an access to our prime minister
who's very respectfully I was showing a
photograph receiving gifts from Pope
Francis giving him a hug
uh why have we created for ourselves
this mindset that something is wrong in
India when actually nothing is wrong and
until we make make a crisis
Frankly Speaking this is a political uh
I think the level everybody tried to do
it that's why I was mentioning the
common people also they used to go to
when Sonia Gandhi used to go to prayag
and then foreign
they are trying to convince because
maybe the perception by the political
and some extent sorry to say by old
Community the media also we create a
hived at all because the election is
doing this because if you don't go in
the the background I don't meet the top
person then you always feel that there
is because there are paretic people in
every party I am not talking about in
BJP they are not everybody is very open
or they are even you will find some
people may be criticizing why he's going
to use the mask
because I had a very I had a very very
interesting conversation it was live on
television so this will be on record or
I'm sure you can find
so you know it wasn't a question I asked
is a story that she wanted to tell as
well
she said look uh you know I was made
minority affairs minister
and the immediate objection was that how
can somebody from the Hindu majority
become minority affairs minister
she said because you look at uh
the post from a religious point of view
you don't look at the post from the
point of view of what needs to get done
what needed to get done was that for the
first time
uh about four and a half thousand Muslim
women could go and visit the Hajj
unaccompanied with a male relative which
has never happened before
that there is now transparency in the
Hajj waiting list of the process has
been automated you know favoritism and
you know somebody cutting the line
doesn't work because everybody gets an
automated number on when they when their
turn comes in this is for the uh they
brought down the prices of the Hajj
travel they've removed the subsidy but
everything has become cheaper because
more competition is coming so the
Monopoly has gone so why can't we look
at the work that is being done rather
than the religion of the person who's
getting that done is there some sort of
thing that rest should resonate in that
oh well uh about that rishabh that is I
feel the society will not change unless
and until we change our own selves the
change has to begin from within and uh I
totally conquer with the points of Mr
alokmata especially I'm thinking he gave
a very very balanced uh very very
neutral and a very rational view I mean
uh so most certainly if you have to look
at the performance at the delivery of
what a person can deliver I mean not
just the person's religion is so and so
and so and so and I totally concur with
uh
as well and uh sumitraji also I think
she was fine I mean but there are
certain points which I maybe I I wasn't
very clear with what Smith conveyed like
for example she said she spoke about the
prime minister's qualification I don't
think it's got anything to do with his
qualification at all you need a
qualification to enter a church in the
first place secondly it's not about
history of RSS because the people I
think it's a very normal thing for
anyone to do today I can go to a church
I can
of course an Outreach is is to be made
and of course uh uh major Shah's father
is part of that process and there's no
reason we should be shy away from saying
that that's an important process Nadeem
has been part of it right he's been part
of it others are also taking the effort
uh because there is a lot of
misapprehension and miscommunication
some people who don't want to be
convinced and are and want to tell you
that it's been guys it's also almost 10
years of Narendra Modi now okay
for 10 years we've been told there'll be
Muslim genocide that the minorities will
be wiped out the minorities are thriving
in this country there are a lot more
needs to be done let's not assume that
things India has stopped all sorted
tomorrow we can wrap up because job done
obviously things need to get done but I
am telling you that I have grown up in
Delhi
which is a very syncretic culture it is
as if not more syncretic than any New
York and London where also I've lived in
London as well and I can tell you it is
perfectly normal for a person in Delhi
to visit a church to go to a Gurdwara to
go to Jama Masjid to go to the
nizamuddin darga listen listen to the
Sufi music and stop outside to have a
kebab It's Perfectly Normal it's routine
but we are told that these places are
all broken down and Hindus and Muslims
are at war with each other
within 500 meters of my house there is a
there is a there is a mosque I hear the
Azan there is a Gurdwara and there is a
temple
across the road from where this
Churchill which is the largest church in
Delhi is the largest Gurdwara in Delhi
this is perfectly this is how we grew up
and I have not
in until the Delhi riots happened during
Trump's visit I had not seen a riot in
the national capital
since I don't know the mandrel days okay
which is early 90s
so for 20 plus almost 30 years you know
a single riot in the capital but we are
told that Hindus and Muslims this
country are tearing each other apart
they're not tearing each other apart and
that's a conversation that needs needs
to be had let me quickly get in sumitra
goenka into this conversation back in we
are waiting now for the prime minister
to exit uh after this uh meeting that
he's having it's not per se a high
profile meeting he's not meeting you
know one of the you know archbishops or
Catholic Bishops or Cardinals and there
are cardinals in India he is just going
to the local church to meet the parish
priest
on Easter Sunday uh if they wanted they
could have you know organized something
and said okay we will only meet Cardinal
this is as normal as it would it would
get if you were a Christian today on
Easter Sunday
I just wanted to say a couple of things
from uh whatever I was hearing others
speak so first thing is about Northeast
I would like to come first on that point
that uh people are saying that you know
in Northeast uh Christians have voted
for BJP but actually you have to know
that there has been a silent amount of
work which is happening for 35 to 40
years one program is like a student's
exchange of Interstate living I have
been a part of this program because I
have got uh several guests coming from
Northeast who come and stay in my house
you know for many years they come home
they spend a day here they eat what we
give them they understand our culture
and again students from Mumbai Delhi and
other parts of India they go to
Northeast and understand this and this
program has been going on for 35 40
years so this kind of uh relationship
which is built many people are not aware
that this is a silent effort which has
been going on it is not that because
Prime Minister Modi has met the pope or
he is going to a church that the
Christians are voting for him I think
that bondage has been builded over time
and we have to realize this second thing
is uh if you if you talk about symbolism
there are so many people who are doing
symbolism we know readers who wear a
dhoti sometimes and where to uh and go
to visit temples you know that is
symbolism it is not like somebody who
has a long relationship uh modiji has
been going to gurudwara he has uh you
know halted his speech when the Azan was
going on I remember those things he has
visited the dowdy poras in Mumbai
recently earlier he has met them so
these are some very natural and normal
things it it always doesn't have to be a
symbolism and okay like you rightly said
we all are in Delhi we know that this is
a church which is visited by many even
modiji going for a small event like this
so it is not not something which we have
to you know read that okay this is an
outrage because it is only because of
the elections or something like you said
there are always elections in the
country somewhere the other the next
election is in Karnataka there's always
an election somewhere or the other in
the country okay so everything you do
can be seen from that lens
and it's okay in a democracy you should
see everything from whatever lens you
want to I have no objection to that I
have a fundamental objection
to us creating a global globalized
perception that India is at war with
India that the two Nation theories still
exists and we can't live in peace we are
not a syncretic culture when that is an
abject lie I live here and if I say it's
an abject lie I am bhakt I'm godi or if
I'll if I'm telling you I've been to
this church I'm a Hindu I've been for
midnight mass in this church it was not
a big deal I've been to the same church
with Muslim friends we walked in just to
see a service out of curiosity and
experience you know the lovely choirs
that happened on on midnight mass it's
an experience uh and this is normal for
me and if I say this is normal for me
and India is doing fine no we are not
doing some Muslim genocide then we are
supposed to be godi bhakt that's not the
case so this is where the irritation
hits and unfortunately
a lot of people
in in the opposition especially the
Congress need to understand that that's
why it's irritating if you just sing
what it is okay
uh and you've been told no no no you're
saying this because you know you are you
are all sold out and bribed and brow
beaten or bullied or whatever none of
that is true we can call us pay this
paid because you can see in front of you
what is the truth and what is simply uh
not the truth let me quickly get a look
back into this conversation now
as we now walk a walk on okay and it's
not an easy thing to break okay this
perception which has been created since
I don't know since pre the division of
Bengal by kurzen in 1905. that we are a
country that cannot live in peace with
itself I am going to quote you know Mark
tally I don't know whether whether it
was a book India in slow motion or is
one of his one of his other bookmark
tally ladies and gentlemen uh was the
was the BBC correspondent in New Delhi
and he's he's chosen to live on here and
he said it's not the surprise that there
are riots in in this country they're
surprises there are such few riots in
this country given the sheer scale of
the populations that are involved you
know any lump and element anywhere can
do something but it never happens come
on I mean until the Trump visit riots
happened uh you and I haven't seen riots
in Delhi in 30 years
years
[Music]
there are more people killed in those
rights so he this is the problem in our
country because we don't when they want
to just uh think in our own after
Independence and you are very right
since last 10 years also even in Bihar
recently some incident happened
otherwise you see in Bihar up
Maharashtra
madhya Pradesh renor was a very
sensitive uh City I belong to those
areas and that's why I'm feeling that
nowadays in last 10 years the perception
because the projection by the I am not
blaming some foreign either in Western
countries are the Chinese or Russia
because there are some forces who just
criticize because otherwise the gulf
countries how many Islamic countries
investing in India it proves money from
Jammu Kashmir to Kerala Kerala to
Maharashtra and the number of people
they were invested in Gujarat also they
are invested so much money so it proves
that after Narendra Modi came in power
and that's why perception about the
Christianity about the Muslim or the
sick because if you want to rule in
India I think prime minister Narendra
Modi was from down to earth and that's
why he knows that for every Community
but but because he doesn't want to say
okay I forget about Hinduism I don't
believe I just want to do secularism
what the Congress used to do so
certainly he's a different person he's
not a congress person in the same way
okay just just stay with me uh Kennedy K
president of the Christian Church
Council in Kochi joining us on on the
broadcast uh Easter greetings to you sir
and if nothing else has given us an
opportunity today to have an extended
conversation on Easter Sunday now I I
know that there is a a progressive
visualization of this I know you can
have a cynical visualization of this
where do you stand Kennedy
uh see
um Let me let me share a happiness with
you actually uh this is a totally
relevant day for with this issue
whatever you're talking now uh today uh
our Global Chief I mean the zero Malabar
Church Global Chief uh major Archbishop
George Island Jerry he was he was he has
expressed uh his opinions in uh in a
Indian experts today and it's it's just
been it's came out and I am in one of
the China studio now we are you know
most of the channels you know in the
evening they are debating in the same
kind of issues actually uh we we are you
know how to wholeheartedly we are
welcoming uh the uh Modis and bjp's
approach in this issue and uh I know in
Kerala you know it's actually I would
say A revolution is going to come here
we are going to expect we are we are
just sort of keenly watching what is
going to happen because they already
they've never done you know same like
this and this time they are moving
social they have joined with our pregame
places they are sharing our prayers and
they are really moving fast and BJP is
going to make something in Canada we
don't know but like I said the cynics
will you know we'll see this as you know
just as as symbolism okay do you see
this as symbolism or do you really feel
that look we are a country in which we
have Hindus we have Christians we are
Muslims and to the large part of it we
get along just fine there are other
issues that we need to take on and and
the BJP might be something in the past
but today it is misrepresented as some
Hindu fundamentalist party
let me let me uh tell you some truths
actually as far as concerned about the
Christian they have not at all a
religious Fanatics they are they're not
at all running after this religious you
know atrocities and all kind of things
when we come to the National policy when
we come to discuss the national
development nationalism and all those
agencies these uh you know some some
people are here they are running after
the conflict theory you know they're
they're basically that party made up of
the conflict theory that the friction
their need always the problems and you
know everywhere they are expecting some
kind of conflicts those people are
opposing these moves actually what they
have they have done a wonderful job they
have already started to talk with the
Muslim organizations and here in Kerala
they are talking with the Christian
leaders and they are on the right path
and we are wholeheartedly we are
supporting and we expect something
miracle in this next election it's a
good move we congratulate the total
leadership of the BJP especi
I mean this is important right sometimes
you have to say it some you know like I
said sometimes you have to do it
sometimes you have to be seen doing it
as well is is this important are these
kind of visits important at least it
gives people a a talking point which
they can you know touch and feel I was
just showing our viewers uh you know uh
re-showing the viewers rather uh when
Prime Minister Modi met with Pope
Francis that was you know in 2021 so we
get an opportunity to express these and
you know does that help the messaging at
least
sure of course of course it's going to
make difference this time it will it
will it will it will work it will work
that's why I'm saying I'm I know we're
just we're awaiting the result uh you
know to come out in the next Parliament
election so there there was you know
they never you know got even a single
seat in Carolina but this time uh you
know the expert some kind of miracle in
Kerala and they are moving in that way
they you know they've got a Unity some
kind of good colors uh good okay good
feelings are coming out okay that's an
interesting perspective coming uh yeah
sure sure from Kennedy that's and of
course he's in Kochi right now ah in in
Kerala itself let me quickly get in ah
major Shah into this conversation major
Shah I know
that
black and white conversations are a
disservice where we think that one is or
the other is always much grayer is
always a lot more complex and
complicated as it as it well should be
but you and I can predict what is going
to happen next right this is going to be
trashed as some sort of cynical
symbolism some Joomla some belated
Enterprise to hide real intent all of
these pettiness is going to come out do
you genuinely feel that the public
appetite for this is now for the
pettiness and the cynicism is now slowly
dying
for his craftsmanship
and he had been hoping for the reward
for the last 10 years he applied five
times and when after 2014 he says he
stopped applying completely to he felt
that the BJP government would not do
anything for Muslims so there's no point
he had given up hope he got the award
and after that there was the opposition
came about and saying he was tutored by
BJP to say this
I mean isn't it disgraceful isn't it
yourself goal by the opposition isn't it
ridiculous that you are doubting The
credibility of an artist of a Craftsman
who is exceptional not outstanding
neither excellent he's not good he's
exceptional he's better than the best in
his job and then you say after he is
being rewarded if you are unstoppable no
if you are like really good at a job no
one can be dealership no one can stop
you no one even if you want even if you
wish to stop someone who is unbeatable
who's Unstoppable you cannot so that's
why Allama iqbals who wrote is
so that is why it holds good and now
with the very fact that you said earlier
also Outreach is always good so now the
perception the Brahm that the my
minority that oh anti-christian
anti-muslim at least that's broken it
sends a message loud and clear to the
entire country to the entire world that
now listen minorities have nothing to
fear just about a month back my father
also had gone to Mumbai where Prime
Minister Modi had inaugurated
institution educational institutions
acknowledged the presence of my father
as well over in that meeting so now tell
me one thing rishabh is as you said
earlier being rational being moderate
being very pragmatic and if someone
points a finger at you someone accuses
that oh you are taking that side no
nothing anyone sides you don't have to
deal with sides because we don't owe
anything to anyone we don't owe any
religions to any political party or to
any political ideology what is what is
that okay okay now
have we then
reach that stage
where you can have the pragmatic problem
solving conversations rather than
immediately build up the fences of
religion I'll give you the examples you
you say interlock is a problem no no
this is anti-muslim you say madrasa
reform needs to be done no no that's
anti-muslim you will say board reform no
no that's anti-muslim uh you eventually
you will go and say okay the conversion
issue we need to be looked at and these
conversion laws no no that's anti-anti
Christian so we get into this
Zone immediately if we say look in
mathura there was an issue regarding the
the Krishna Temple oh but no no no no no
no okay uh it's uh it's uh it it's it's
a polarization polarization plot are we
able to are we reaching the spot where
we can have this conversation without
immediately going oh my God this is
anti-sum minority or the other
well I I as far as the diminished and
further diminishing opposition goes the
answer is no because they will just be
flush down the toilet and
Ajit
a problem foreign
Channel
okay yeah so what do you feel about it
very good on this yesterday it was very
kind of him to pay a visit to the
Christian Community and I think it is
for the first time that the prime
minister of India visited the Christians
on the day of Easter so what do you feel
is the first time PM Modi will reassure
in Catholic Church in Delhi so do you
think it is a right time to talk to PM
okay we are not afraid we are not any
such kind of persons
no why should we be afraid it was a very
welcoming initiative that he came to our
community
we did not request this it was on his
own uh initiative so do you request to
uh to visit for the some other Church
like Kerala and some other places
we have not invited like that okay yeah
so first time you will meet them what do
you discuss between the U and PM Modi
nothing
nothing when he came to greatest on
yesterday it was not a moment of
discussing discussion no
he just came and wished us a happy
Easter happy Easter Bunny no nothing
else nothing else is
um
what do you feel
foreign
foreign
I'll let you carry on with these
conversations you carry on okay let me
quickly open this up I still have all my
guests with me I'd interrupted uh Gotham
Mukherjee just a good chance to speak to
the to the parish priesthood and other
members of the congregation I could
support at least 40 50 people there over
inside who had a a brief greeting 25
minute conversation there with the prime
minister they said that he came wished
us happy Easter and has has given us a
good wishes and and a good message and
we are very happy to have received him
now your thoughts on what's just
happened now that you've heard from
inside sir
yes as I was saying that no you are
going to see criticism from the hardcore
opposition
uh who will call this a Joomla a photo
opportunity a attempt at PR publicity
Etc however
at PJP and the RSS is
and actions are being implemented along
with the rhetoric now this if it
convinces more and more people then uh
we do get the concept of one India a new
India in actual terms it may not happen
overnight it may not even happen but uh
you know 2024 but if this policy is
constantly used okay then it will reduce
these sort of binary which has been the
kind of basis on which the politics has
been conducted okay all right let's
quickly hear across from it from from
our panel that you've heard from the
parish priests and the other members of
the congregation who were there inside
your thoughts
I think this is a good gesture actress
because this was not the part of the any
political message or something that's
why uh father said that he just gave us
uh the happy Easter so I think this is
kind of a gesture and when we go we
never talk about the politics what you
are doing or what will do for society it
give a message to all the community that
okay prime minister himself went there
to greet all the community he said
symbolic and he's going to the church
but it give a wrong right message and
that's why I feel that it was a very
good question but he did and maybe for
coming elections because what he is
doing for the long term uh for the
society you see even after five years
ten years other people like yesterday Mr
engineer also joined the academy so
these kind of people also joining the
party and the minority people all people
were nominated in the up legislature so
I think this kind of gesture always give
the confidence to the people the
conclusion created by the congress party
and others that BJP is Untouchable
because they are very much against the
minorities so I think this kind of
occasions either but even if you
remember in Monkey but also he mentioned
about Easter it's not for today it's not
for the Karnataka or for the Kerala
elections but I think Whenever there is
a occasion he just mentioned also when
you talk about any speech when you go to
outside and I think this is the right
time because in the this time people are
very creating most of the confusion by
Rahul Gandhi himself because he said no
no this is a terminal we have to fight
with RSS and BJP because the baby we are
fighting the 50 years back with the
congress party but even in the garden BJ
people were also fighting but then then
also over the Congress people also
worked with them
example for this a number of people the
Congress people were used to hide get
help from the RSS
foreign double so this kind of because
they wanted RSS always wanted they
should convince the people that we are
not biased with any other community and
the political any government they should
not feel the currency is working hard
but here one point is there for the
conversion or some foreign forces work
in the name of the religion either from
church or from other community and then
they say okay just create some confusion
or create some terrorism that's why the
government okay this government is very
against this kind of any okay any
extremism in any particular okay let me
say same image I think we're just seeing
shots of the premium he's now arrived
the BJP headquarters uh just your
thoughts that you've heard you've heard
the congregation inside mitasha
right uh I think it is I think the prime
minister is a great leader let's accept
it let's accept the fact and uh no one
can deny the fact that he connects with
the masses he connects with the classes
he connects with people and no one can
deny that it's not about being a pro
bjpo and tbjp pro Congress
anti-congratives what are the fact of
the fact one cannot deny it the very
fact okay they're very fact even if
people say that okay it's uh it is
symbolic or it's this I mean I'm saying
I don't know whether it is or is not I
can't comment on that but even if it is
so so as long as it is getting good
results as long as the country is moving
forward as long as the India has a
standing in the global community in the
global country that people overall they
are looking at India India Today India
can stand tall on its own feet India is
no more what it used to be earlier as a
fever at one point of time right agree
now that's the mid 17th century
thereafter we were looted by britishers
but now when we are regaining our lost
glory in every way possible you know
I'll conclude by saying just a few days
back I was in conversation I was
interviewing a former Service Chief and
he what he told me was something very
interesting he said that when I became
the chief I did not see that I belong to
so and so regiment okay I prompted the
entire yes and that's a point well made
you know Point well I was doing the same
thing we're doing a series on the real
Sikh Heroes of India saying exactly the
same thing okay we try to now doing
Hindu versus seek new concoction they've
come up with now in in Punjab how
horrible shots on your screens that's
the Prime Minister uh interacting with
uh uh the the the parish priests and the
members of the choir some of the nuns
the congregation uh uh there is having a
quick chat he's wish them happy Easter
inquired and I think you can see father
Francis right behind the camera person
says there and you can see the Prime
Minister here and the other Parish
Priests of course a decked up this is in
the apps uh you can see of which is the
Dome of the of the Sacred Heart
Cathedral uh in uh in New Delhi that was
the Prime Minister photographs which
have just come out this was from about
about yeah about 15 minutes ago I'll
just take the same thoughts from Raja
Lakshmi Joshi Joshi that you now that
we've heard people from inside who've
met the PM your quick quick thoughts
you know he there is no question about
uh his bride in his Hinduism and at the
same time he always believes in
I think that is a very easily visible in
all his schemes and all his policies and
the way he approaches them and he has
spoken the about uh getting rid of uh
reservation on the basis of religion and
instead you know it is always focused on
making sure that even every even the
last person in the line uh gives the
benefit of all the skin so that is uh
that is something that I think that
actually has made a lot of difference
okay so it has ensured that everybody is
in on no one the same page okay okay I I
don't know if himanshu but is still with
us Sandeep Chandra I think is with us
now that you've had a chance to hear
from people who met him the Prime
Minister inside what what do you what do
you make of this
you see
um thank you this is a very very
important question what I make of this
is that Mr Modi is not a reactive prime
minister he's not an active prime
minister he is a very proactive prime
minister countries blessed to have him
as a PM number one number two true
secularism is being only practiced and
it has been practiced by The bhakti
janta Party The Decade of 2004-2014 was
a decade of Lost Years today Mr Modi is
responsible for making making India or
International if not a regional
superpower he has sent out a message
that India belongs to everybody
everybody belongs to India irrespective
of caste Creed or color and this is
borne out by the fact that unlike pseudo
secular Prime Ministers of the congress
party Mr Modi is a truly secular person
he is the first sitting prime minister
to go on Easter to uh you know you you
think you you know that that almost
sounds strange and unusual but like I
said there's always a first time better
better late than never uh it almost
sounds unusual that in 80 years no prime
minister has ever visited a church let
alone on Easter not visited a church
period in office while in office uh
himanshu but now that we've heard so
from from the parish priests and the
members of the congregation that the
Prime Minister has met your thoughts sir
yeah my thoughts are very very simple
you know I might have so many things in
my heart but if I don't show it if I
don't express it somewhere people will
not know it
and that's what exactly is happening in
Indian politics
people have been casting aspersions on a
party
to be a communal which actually it is
not
now for that it is it the owner says of
that party to show
that they are not true they are secular
they are really total sense secular
party now what do what do they do
they have to show it by their actions
in a space of nine years we have not
seen anything
which will not call them a real secular
party
this is one of those things and as you
said I was surprised
that no other pm has gone to this
particular Church
yes I was surprised
is that so that
so that's mine but but you know when
they live in India with a Hindu majority
the easiness at which the other people
live also has to be shown and that is
generally shown the symbolism this types
of ads on the day of Easter or the time
of Christmas or whatever it is at the
time of week you know you will see that
[ __ ] purma
it's true that government has stopped if
there are parties
government doesn't do that but that
doesn't mean there will not be Shield
kumas
people will enjoy it it's the wasteful
expectation which has been stopped now
paying off over here during your step is
something you know which for the word to
see he does things you know she listens
to one thing listen one thing before I
stop Narendra Bhai is the person a very
attitude politicians at the politician
at that and everybody knows it now okay
he will not do anything
which is not uncalled okay
let's get a contrarian perspective uh
Professor shastri on the broadcast with
us also profession uh Happy Easter and
here we are sir uh the Prime Minister
just paid a paid paid an Easter visit uh
for about 25 minutes to this church
Sacred Heart country till you and I
would recognize it your first thoughts
[Music]
as a
and of course it is very important for a
leader like him to visit uh dharmonic
that is what the entire country needs
and I am very religion equal and
important and uh even though he
understands things about the Hinduism so
powerful but at the same time he
realizes that it's equal and he
exhibited and it is a welcome step for
the country there is no doubt about it
okay uh so you're seeing the visuals on
his twins that was the Prime Minister of
course who has sat through a choir there
was a full congregation that was present
in the church during this time and a
statue of uh
Jesus Christ has been gifted by the
parish priests
to the Prime Minister and so yes it was
indeed a full congregation it wasn't
just a private visit and that you've
seen that he sat through a choir
rendition on Easter and met with members
of of the of the parish and the
community and there you can see the
choir girls
singing as we were listening as the
Prime Minister was listening to that
okay so so let me let me just get
himanshu but
yeah back back into this conversation
okay uh himanshuji aware for from here
okay so uh do we need to see more
visualized
outreaches like this or you know or
is that honestly not really required
people get the message now
hey now people will have to get the
message you know
activities
this type of visuals will send the
message across
see there must be something here I'll
give you a very simple example of our
social life
some young boy falls into love with
falls in love with a young girl unless
he tells that or shows some expression
shows up by some expression how is she
going to know it
it's as simple as that
the social fabric turns into politics
it's a very simple political agent that
till now what we have been calling so
many things taboo
are not the doubles now today we are in
31st Century people are progressed
further people have gone apart and this
probably those who realize as I said you
know before also okay those who realize
that was potential and work accordingly
okay so sometimes you have to do things
and sometimes you have to be seen to do
things as well and that's that ends if
your heart is in the right place if your
effort is in the right place uh
sometimes you need to make that that
extra step should be visualize better
politician understand that Narendra Modi
for sure understands that uh but uh let
me just now just to hit the
hit that subtext of why we are having
this conversation
major Shah
it's been 10 years almost since Narendra
Modi became prime minister of this
country for 10 years both within India
and outside India we've been told that
democracy is dying
that India is in trouble Hardline
fundamentalism takeover is imminent
Muslim genocide is imminent all these
are nonsense but there are still those
who are feeding it how do we now more
actively counter this attack which we
are under because you and I well know
that not no such thing is taking place
uh rishab you are right but you know I
totally concur with the palace who spoke
earlier who said that whatever is there
in the heart it should be expressed one
should uh tell what is what you mean
because then what happens then there is
a communication error activities for
example coming from the Army background
that's why I'm giving the example of
Agni wheel is actually a very very good
scheme and my short service also myself
I joined to serve for five years only
but then there is a commit communication
they have a lot of apprehensions to
change people who are very skeptical
about it initially they were protests
they were what what not there was
Rampage there was vandalization there
was violence in the beginning but now
people have slowly begun to accept it
because they is communicate when you
communicate when you express people will
know what's there in your heart how it
is then what happens it only clears the
air people who want to spread rumors
about you people want to spend stories
about you that will not last for too
long they have been a lot of
communication gaps one has to admit that
and that must be rectified
the very fact that people can say
therefore democracy is dying in India
the minorities are in trouble the very
fact there's democracy in the country
the very fact that democracy is still
alive that is why people can't okay
there's a reality check no no now these
images hopefully will circulate not only
in India but also circulate across the
world
ah which would be the the right and
appropriate thing to do let me quickly
get uh Sandeep Chandra into this Sandeep
Chandra but like I said there is a
broken record okay
there are Indians part of this broken
record there are members of the
opposition part of this primarily I
would say of the Congress Party part of
this broken record
who are into this Feeding Frenzy for 10
years we've been told
that there is chaos
that this is you know the the tip of the
iceberg you don't know what's going to
happen to the minorities in India and
absolute hell will break Clues and
genocides will take place none of those
things have happened are happening or
are going to happen sir
is the broken record now
over is it is it is it is it time to
shut up now on these matters
very very
invalid powerful Point made by you you
what has happened is the record has been
set straight it is for everybody to see
and I'd like to expand the context and
like to tell you that India is the only
country on the planet which has got so
many religions languages people of
different cars speed and color existing
very peacefully together Mr Modi is
proved by his actions he leads from the
front he walks the talk and he has he
has it is for everybody to see it's like
a sky on a you know clear sunny day that
through secularism has been practiced by
the bhartiya janta party opposition is
just putting false charges they are a
bunch of headless chickens they don't
know where to hide today people of it's
the eye opener of people of Kerala Tamil
Nadu no but it's not just the opposition
here Mr Chandra you know there are there
are people who have you know their their
clothes in a Twist uh in you know in in
the U.S there are people in the labor
party in the UK within their and their
peers in the house of House of Lords who
are talking about oh my God oh my God
India is is India is a disaster
minorities are going to be massacred by
their Millions uh you know genocide
means by definition genocide means that
we will have to kill about three four
hundred million people in this country
to to uh to for genocide all of this is
utter sheer nonsense but this happens
all of the time
both within and without
is is that game over now sir
now what has happened is
that it is now this this genocide Bogies
all over it is for everybody to see that
Mr Modi has transcended from being a
politician to a world Statesman Mr when
Mr Modi talks the world listens and this
is truly a path breaking example you can
make out by the fact that so-called
pseudosecular party no prime minister of
the Congress ever visited a sitting
plans to ever visited a church so this
is for everybody to see that Mr Modi is
practicing
because and most important okay he is
one the hearts of people by this very
good guest okay okay maybe maybe some I
I can't say suggest that it is going to
be all and the answer is never black and
white alok Mehta is this then a step
forward in in winning sabka vishwas
because there are some people who will
never be convinced and there's you know
there's no point after a point trying to
convince them
yeah actually here I would like to
mention that the other leaders of the
BJP
hope and wish that they will also follow
the same type of tradition in their own
States like in madhya Pradesh or
Rajasthan or Maharashtra because
everywhere the Prime Minister message
was not only for those Community but
even the political and his own party are
allies also because during sometimes
there were some confusion and you know
even from the up people say he will
always only serve for the Hindus but
earlier also we have seen he was working
for the minorities he also have the
ability Minister but after the Prime
Minister this kind of President I think
this will give a long message for the
their own party people and the even the
people who just uh sometimes talk in a
very poetic way against uh even the old
uh sometime alleged everybody so I think
this is also a message for his own party
people he just LED for his own party
meeting also so I think this is not the
only political purpose for the other
parties are their position this is a
message for his own party they they
believe in Hinduism they go to temples
but they should also try to convince
those people who are from the other
communities and give countries and some
this kind of occasion either for Eid or
Christmas or the Easter or any other
occasion and mahavir jayanti people try
to do something but here this is the
right message from the prime minister of
India because first time you visited to
church okay that's why I say give a
message both and for his own party too
okay all right uh jivya shastri
almost 10 years now of Narendra Modi for
10 years we've been told longer during
the campaign before that so 2013 2023
we've been told that this inevitable
Hindu majoritarianism that there's going
to be a genocide that minorities are you
know they're finished in this country as
long as Narendra Modi is there and this
sabka saath is all just a political
slogan
has has opinion now changed now
is that why this reading it is not the
International Community reading
the kind of because I agree with
immediate what is that you know there
are leaders in the you the up and now
there are so many BJP leaders and RSS
leaders are clearly seeing every time
indoor asked him we are not interested
sorry
we are not
our Constitution doesn't say that
sorry we one should not there's no need
to call
even I am from Hindu Hindu major
organization I am also a general
secretary
this makes a massive disturbances
that's what I feel Narendra Modi has
felt
that is what he felt
and the message is loud and clear to the
oh no the message is important but Divya
shastri do you really think that that
that that Hindus are
are somehow bent on genocide that Hindus
are that if somebody says Hindu rashtra
thy by default means
minority should be afraid
take its own course of action as well as
the Constitution is concerned
a chief minister no need to say in the
assumpty standing in assembly
what is the meaning of it are we I as he
playing a role of Judiciary okay all
right so I have another question
you know there is a you know if you
I'm sure you've read about this I've
certainly read about it in school and we
were taught about you know
King Arthur and the Knights of the Round
Table okay that they were very nice
people we were taught about you know
Robin Hood very nice people who were
very chivalrous
had a judicious and just form of
government
and we were taught about these stories
knowing full well that all these were
the Knights Templar they were the people
descendants of those who fought the
Crusades very much Christian
but an Arthurian concept of governance
was considered as good governance and
nobody really had a problem with that we
all aspire to it yeah they sat in a
round table because they're all equal
group of peers very good well done but
here if we put the similar context of
ram rajya we are told it is
majoritarianism why
say what is International Community says
that is irrelevant that is not required
because if they say so many things they
say so many things to so many people as
per their convenience the world order
now Russian president wants a whole new
order as per the New Order only he wants
a negotiation so anybody said say end of
the day what is exactly you are
but I am very happy that prime minister
said this said this said everything
equal
he cleared every manner okay
he really did a good thing by visiting
this church today I'm really happy okay
all right I'm I'm short of time himanshu
but before we take a break sir uh the
Prime Minister very recently in fact in
in Parliament I think it was the uh end
of end of the budget discussions uh when
he pointed out and he said look when it
comes to the awas yojana uh the mudra
loans the building of the of the toilets
the building of the highways
that this is a real secularism
now it's not an easy concept to embrace
sir because
as politicians and you covered politics
for again longer than I I I've been
doing this provision sir
these are not easily emotive issues it's
much easier to get people angry and and
charged up about dharm and other kind of
issues
is real secularism is is the concept of
sabka vishwas do we now as Indians
understand these things better and as
Modi become what uh Mr Chandra just said
not just a politician anymore he's a
he's a Statesman of a different
different different level
yes I would say one thing see in 2002
Narendra Bhai was a state politician and
a chief minister 2014 he became a prime
minister that is his own statement he
had said it took me few years
foreign
words
and then he started his work
so what you are asking me today
a prime minister becoming a world
Statesman
will have certain qualities and that is
what he possesses so it should not be
seen unnatural for anyone that how is
that progression taking place
this is happening because he sits in you
know the top four
with the top four
top four respect him it's not he
respecting people
respect him okay so so that is why okay
so so canards and Bogies okay so let me
uh last word
when it comes to the frustrated cliched
canards and Bogies okay one of them was
that of course uh uh you know we can't
act up with Pakistan because you know
they have the nuclear bomb we can't
solve Kashmir
uh that we can't uh
do anything about ayodhya to 500 years
300 years controversy going on that we
will forever we be a developing country
because you know it's impossible to do
anything how will you build a highway
without riots and protests and you know
dharnas it's not it's not possible then
of course the biggest one of them all
that we are not even one country we are
two countries two Nation Theory which
has been subsisting are we seeing this
generation and with some leadership
credit to Narendra Modi but a lot of
credit to the people of this country are
we seeing this generation that will
break out of these lashes of the past
yeah you should be this was the change
for the society in last 10 years is a
miracle like a historical change in the
Indian Society Indian system Indian
economy because Liberation was there but
how we see the in aviation in nuclear
energy in solar energy in the
infrastructure so and for everybody
that's why prime minister people say why
he is speaking in London or in America
everywhere we go and talk about how much
uh bank accounts but you see when people
listen in the United States or even
including China if they get some message
at least that India is not what it was
in 62 so that's why now I very rightly
said that everybody the top four
countries are even I should say that the
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a real
most powerful Democratic prime minister
of the world because nobody is like in
the same in Democratic manner is working
since last 10 years and these are
popular in the buses and the same thing
even the other countries also they
respective a lot because of the Good
Will of the Indian Society because
Indian Society also cooperated then he
says okay
period you go away in the 24 hours you
are you are in the home for three months
and so on so people accepted just went
for thali bajao and everybody go for a
so this kind of uh gesture what prime
minister is doing and I think it's a
very good message for the future of
India okay so uh
we've had an opportunity to have a a
larger conversation over what was just a
25 minute visit and it should be routine
it should not be a big deal but it is
both isn't and is uh to visit the Sacred
Heart Cathedral in Delhi uh for Easter
Sunday and for people watching this
broadcast
a very happy Easter we've had a chance
to discuss it at Great length
and we will now have to look within okay
and take the proof of the pudding in the
eating take the evidence for what we see
and touch with our own eyes
and
a lot of people in this country
I have to say
we'll have to
let go
of the sheer animosity
the sheer absolute irrational illogical
approach
which with which they see current
affairs
there is no muslim genocide happening in
India Hindus and Muslims are not at each
other's throats anybody who lives in
Delhi knows that we are a very syncretic
City we move from one to the other I've
been to this church with Muslim friends
I've been to the Gurdwara across the
road It's Perfectly Normal for people to
do this it was normal 10 years ago it is
normal today it will be normal 10 years
from now
and that's what India represents
we have other challenges and we've taken
up too much of our energy too much of
our time has been wasted
first by the people who wanted to break
us divide us and fight and then by
ourselves
fool us once
shame on them fool us twice
well shame on us

that we have to have the ability
with a great sense of responsibility
purpose and gravitas
that sometimes what we wish
were to happen because it would be
convenient for us to happen
simply
is a ghost
it's not the truth
and it takes a maturity and an ability
perhaps
with a mindset of Truth and
Reconciliation the concept of satyagraha
that if you stay on the side of Truth
you will be able to make your point
more vociferously
perhaps you'll have to work harder
somebody very senior
asked me this a few days ago
that you sit on news X and you abjure
tamasha there's no screaming and
shouting and name calling
so how do you get ratings which is what
we are supposed to be right rating
hungry people
and my answer is I have to work twice as
hard
my team has to work twice as hard
we have to make an effort to be more on
point more engaging
to provide greater perspective because
yes if I start screaming and shouting on
the roadside a crowd will gather to
wonder why I'm screaming and shouting
but I do it every time
Cry Wolf
eventually the crowd will just
call me a maniac
I'll become a meme a joke
so yes sometimes you have to work twice
as hard
there is a duty that oppositions perform
in a democracy
and the duty is
that no matter what the government is
doing to run a fine tooth comb and take
out all sorts of issues
to keep government on its toes
and I respect the need
and it's the need
for the congress party of current day
modern day the Rahul Gandhi day of
Congress
looking back at what happened
how his father was maligned with buffers
how the previous government of Manmohan
Singh was maligned by 2G and Colgate and
and Corruption to to find a Cause
that is very similar so you're sitting
in a room and you're sitting with
advisors and looking at what are the
causes for the election campaign next
time around last time we took a profile
poof Rafael disappeared all the 36
planes have arrived and they're
currently performing an important duty
on the frontier with China
so now let's come in
something new
but in that process
we somehow get disconnected from reality
it's been four months since a foreign
quote-unquote Think Tank
with profit motive
came out and did a hit job on one of
India's biggest conglomerates ladies and
gentlemen it is important for us to
think of the antidote of socialism for
which you need to do the mudra loans the
toilet building the road building but we
also need large conglomerates why could
we go Gaga or Microsoft and Elon Musk
and Tesla and SpaceX but give Gully to
our own people
so all these guys the billionaires in
the U.S are all honest hard-working
Geniuses like Bill Gates but our guys
are all chores we have a great sense of
racism against ourselves which needs to
be chronically
abjured in the future it's been four
months
The Head of the State Bank of India has
said that for four months the adani
group of companies have been paying back
their loans just fine
in those four months
209 Billion Dollar Bank collapse of the
Silicon Valley Bank 59 billion dollar
collapse of the Credit Suisse in Europe
in between right before that there was
this Sam bankman freed and his and his
crypto Empire again a multi-billion
dollar collapse that took place wherever
the Hindenburg reports on this
nowhere
so Hindenburg and George Soros George
Soros who thought he could destroy the
British economy by by causing a run on
the pound George sorosu contributes 140
million dollars to the Democratic party
in just the midterm elections he feels
that he can teach us a democratic lesson
and we are supposed to say yes sir
well we don't and for the congress party
now to be seemingly coming across
as they listen to Hindenburg
they listen to Soros were still the
impression given that they connive with
these individuals and then sit in
Cambridge and lecture us is a disconnect
which is very damaging
and he made a very simple point to me he
said that when Mahatma Gandhi came to
Delhi whose house did he stay in in
birla's house no so was Mahatma Gandhi
corrupt not necessarily
said that this JPC demand is just
political posturing what was achieved in
the 2D JPC
and that's for the BJP also to
consciously say what was achieved
nothing
where is the 2G case now nowhere
so gosh sake what is going on in this
country let's open up this conversation
joining us on the broadcast I have
Sharad Kohli appreciate your time sir
let me also get in jeji bhattacharya
also joining us very shortly
Dr Kohli
it's been four months
since this all almost four months in
this Hindenburg report
while the companies under the adani
group are doing fine they're paying
their loans they have in fact prepaid
some of their loans they have repaid
whatever fund Revenue that they were
doing for this fpo
but there has been a loss in share all
the value there are millions of ordinary
people who had bought sheds in in adani
and 100 billion of dollars of that
shareholder value is gone real damage
has happened
and in between
there has been a actual bank collapse in
San Francisco there has been an actual
crypto Scandal a a stinging thing of one
of the oldest banks in Europe Credit
Suisse which has gone under
but we are still doing adani bashing
what what is disconnected Sarabi are we
living in an alternative reality what's
gone wrong
well rishabh uh you know stock markets
are a very vulnerable platform I mean I
must tell you and you know it's very
easy to swing stock markets and what
surprised me here was that you know
stocks coming down in stock markets
being raised by the opposition I'm I
don't come from the political fraternity
but I'm just giving it an overview
and when they found that talking too
much of stock markets talking too much
of LIC you know SBI giving loans LIC you
know investing in adani group when they
found that the the general public is not
going to be misled and they are not
going to understand I think the recent
hopping that we are hearing is and I'm
literally bored of that sentence
where is this 20 000 crore coming from I
mean where is this 20 000 this belongs
to so and so this belongs to so and so I
mean I mean at least come out with a
with a narrative which is easy to
comprehend which is easy to believe for
a moment Trisha let me even take a
situation
well let's say you know a lot of a lot
of businesses they may be resorting to
this is called round tripping you send
money from here it goes to Mauritius it
comes around probably it's called round
tripping under taxation laws or under
the transfer pricing laws or under the
money laundering laws whatever
now you know linking road tripping to
the ruling government without any basis
evidence I think it sounds absurd and
then on top of that when a Supreme Court
committee is formed which consists of
people with very very credible
background technically competent you
know a JPC is what JPC is a is a group
of parliamentarians who would have
anywhere taken help of technical experts
they could not have you know done
anything on their own because they don't
understand the technicalities here is a
group of people who understand like Mr
kamath you know they understand banking
they understand money movements they
understand stock markets so when people
like these are in the committee I fail
to understand
and the time given was time span was two
months if I'm not wrong so what I fail
to understand is that this whole
campaign this whole narrative could have
been postponed for at least two months
God say wait for the wait for the
findings of the Supreme Court committee
then you form an opinion now uh the
logic given is that the the committee is
is beyond you know the Nexus between the
government but you know but yeah but Dr
Coley come on it's none of us are naive
okay is is crony capitalism does it
happen it happens all over the world I
mean you just look at at the at the arm
twisting uh the Amazons of the world do
in deciding in which city in which state
in the U.S they'll put their
headquarters and what all uh tax reliefs
they want they want to pay no taxes the
biggest companies in the US are all held
offshore they don't pay a penny on on
billions of pounds of profit so all all
the offshore territories are run by the
by the Brits and then they say that we
have no you know we have no control over
them there all you know you know
semi-autonomous
I mean look at Hong Kong Singapore I
mean these guys
the city of London provides Bankers an
opportunity that as long as the
transactions are of offshore entities
they come under zero scrutiny nothing no
scrutiny no regulation is required as
long as not a it's an offshore
transaction so God knows what is going
on but the bottom line in this is let me
get Dr jages bhattacharya
now I understand you I'm sure you
understand also that there is a
political lead for making a case and
let's put that aside for a second
but in the course of that political lead
had we subsumed to it the last time
around we would not have had the refire
aircraft right now okay
let me even go to say that it was the
beaufort's gun the Swedish gun that
saved lives of our soldiers during
kargil because if he didn't have that
artillery police that could be carried
to those inclinations we would have been
in a whole lot of trouble so thank God
we have the refile aircraft because all
of them have not been delivered
and while we have to provide the mudra
loans and the toilets and all that the
Grassroots level we also need big
companies to be able to operate in this
country and why should we feel that only
Elon Musk
is honest and all of our people are
chores
yeah
so uh I think I'm just stealing my words
in that sense this is exactly the words
I've been using for over a decade that
um their business people are tycoons and
our business people are Crooks that's a
mindset that we have been operating with
uh that's clearly not acceptable uh I'm
not an expert in politics so I'll stay
out of politics but
um you know um the the Dharma of a uh of
an opposition leader obviously is to
find issues to take a bone with the
government
um as long as that does not compromise
on India's security or on India's
industry and its economics and therefore
the prosperity of the people uh those
are not fair Targets in my uh limit view
um coming to the issue of uh the the
whole Ruckus around the Hindenburg
report and adani
um it is up to the adani group to defend
themselves if they're strong enough if
they have the braces they will defend it
there's no need for the government to
step in unless there are many many jobs
in the line uh which might be hit we
haven't seen any jobs being in the line
and therefore we haven't seen the
government stepping in either uh there
should be least interference of the
government in um in the running of
Industries
and that's what the government has been
trying to do to stay to to move out of
uh business and only provide the
conducive environment for larger and
larger Capital to flow into India the
larger place to provide the mother
platform
I have to ask you this because our Focus
for the past several weeks and months
has once again been both internally
externally and and maybe George Soto
should not have tweeted out because I
think he gave the game away maybe you
shouldn't have put that tweet or maybe
you should have kept shot but he could
nothing couldn't resist himself or he
felt that he's such a you know such an
influencer that if he says it then the
rest of us will of course bend over
three times backwards
but we lost Focus that in the interim
period while Hindenburg was doing a
great investigation into adanis which
they were convinced on the base of their
hypotheses
nothing happened here everything's
running just fine there has been a stock
market valuation loss which is a very
real economic loss
but the companies are running fine the
SBI chairman says that their own
payments are fine some some in fact
prepayments of borrowing against the
shares have already been made is the
bank in Silicon Valley under their noses
is the one that collapsed it's Credit
Suisse that collapse is is sank bank
print freed and is crypto Scandal that
is that has staggered them
why did the Hindenburg guys not see
these coming
yeah no absolutely uh there were other
short sellers who did predict uh in Jan
that the Silicon Valley Bank is
collapsing but there was no Hindenburg
involved uh in fact the string of events
that you see uh without sounding
parochial uh have been um you know the
the Jewish Community involved because
even the journalists who first broke the
Hindenburg report uh was of the same
Community uh again as I said with the
underlining that not wanting to be a
parochial
um uh there is the question that you
raised uh begs to be answered let me
also put another question because what a
doubt about the
um about the scandals around
um military Imports the scandals somehow
have the tendency to come up only when
the procurement does not happen from
Russia America or Israel whereas 95
percent of our procurement if not larger
happens from these three countries the
moment you you move your aircraft
platform away from Russia uh and you
know you procure anything from Sweden or
France or Italy you name it you will
have a Scandal coming in okay and you
know okay so I can understand and and
and I I you know I I let's let's not
even try to go into in some sort of
community conversation into this at all
but we have to accept that there are
some forces out there okay
who have decided
that they will going to do a hit job on
India
okay they feel that they are fully
capable of manipulating India's markets
they feel that they are fully capable of
manipulating India's politics
and I would like to believe that this is
not true that the politicians here in
India don't actually feel that Cambridge
is a better spot because there the
people agree with you
because you are telling them what they
want to hear by in your own country the
people are disagreeing with you because
there's something fundamentally wrong
and broken let me get Ankit into this
conversation Ankit
in a very real sense
the JPC on 2G achieved absolutely
nothing
we are having no conversation and that's
very equally for the BJP to answer
so should we accept
that the demand for a JPC on the issue
of the Hindenburg report
is just for the sake of political
posturing the economic or policy or
legislative benefit on it would be
absolutely zero
uh I agree and disagree on this uh JPC
uh started on uh 2G because there was a
cad told about it that there is a scam
related to vivet and everything was done
without an auctioning process which was
just given first come first Services
which is against the natural principle
of giving national resources to private
parties and that is how the JPC in the
2G scams happened the government could
not recover any money because the scam
definitely happened and it has never
happened in any scam uh the money has
been recovered it has never happened in
history the second in this case there's
a third party which is saying something
and issued a report
do we have any conclusive evidence which
they have submitted to government of
India or any regulatory uh compliance
companies like sebi RBI or Ed or
something that adani has done something
wrong you will start something when
there is a criminal Administration which
needs to be done and privileged in
restriction doesn't have to happen that
I say to you you are a criminal that we
start the investigation
it has to be something something has
happened somewhere Hidden book said in
the entire stock market of adani Crash
that does not lead to any conclusion
that radhani has done something wrong
and the JPC has to start it JPC is just
a political phenomena to do it and okay
so let me let me ask you then
has the day of the Assumption gone okay
that we in this country can look at
big corporate guys
okay
and call them chores we assume
that they're criminals
but we aspire to be Google
Microsoft trillion dollar companies in
the US are a great aspiration and a
motivation wow look at these guys are so
amazing
but somebody makes it here whether it's
100 billion 200 billion dollars hundred
percent is a chore how does this mind
State still Prevail in this country
that mindset will take years to go
because and it is not a mindset of
Common People trust me a mindset of a
common people is everybody wants to
become a dhani or a money in their life
it is it is it is what happens on the
new channels or on the political houses
where people think that everybody's
corrupt I don't see tatas are kind of
they carry the best things uh ever I
don't see builders they've created some
large companies in India they put the
best unemployments and UI everybody
wants to become in their life or do some
great startups or become a Google do
have do we have resources capability
intentions hard work that's a different
thing
okay so so do we
then Dr Kohli because we are so
used to it it has become something which
we sit upon comfortably upon a pillow
that corruption is there
you just say corruption and it will
appear because it forever exists
are we finding it then difficult as a
country to say maybe
corruption is going down maybe actually
that the ministers are not taking in the
money in the amounts that they have in
the past maybe indeed their crony
capitalism is not the woke
opportunism of the hour maybe something
different is going on is is that a
digesting factor that we now have to at
least try to sort of envisage
well Bishop you know if you think of the
electorate and this whole Narrative of
this 20 000 crores which is which is
just going on and on you know I think I
think the political parties some of them
feel that they can probably start
because when you asked about whether
people who are rich people who are big
people who are conglomerates
uh you know are they criminals just
because they are big because a common
man from this country you know because
of the inequality of income and
inequality of wealth and sharp
inequalities so anyone who's who's got
Surplus wealth or Surplus income or or
is reasonably big it is very easy to
form a kind of an imagination that this
person must have taken a wrong route to
reach that point so that is these that
is the emotion which the opposition is
trying to start but what they are
forgetting they're forgetting two things
one is that this narrative against this
government or the prime minister is not
going to work because prime minister has
already earned a reputation which is
beyond question that's my first point
second point the people who are raising
this question now this is an I mean I
come from an apolitical world the people
who are raising the question the old
saying people who live in Glass Houses
should not throw stones at others their
own reputation in the past for all the
scams that you name 2G Colgate you know
Commonwealth and so and so for all the
uh past the history is going to haunt
them forever so I think they are unfit
in my mind okay
so how do you how do you just as an
observer sir of course not of not a
direct participant in this and I just
want to edit on that thought how do you
then perceive that a Sharad pavar is now
who's a very very intelligent politician
he is seeing the pulse elsewhere
he is seeing that there is nothing to be
achieved here because nobody is buying
it is not sinking in Raphael didn't
achieve anything you said you know you
kept saying
and nothing happened that that this is a
pointless and a waste of time exercise
you can oppose and I'm sure there are
other reasons you can you know corner
and question the BJP but this is not it
why is seeing it but but others in the
Congress are not being able to see this
because I mean I'm not I'm not a Sharad
power fan uh rishabh but he's a veteran
politician he knows this is simply not
going to work what the opposition needs
to do is to get into constructive
opposition they are resorting to
destructive opposition which is not
going to work and I I mean I don't come
from a world of politics I I haven't
done any political science courses but
as a common Citizen and as somebody
being educated and you know you know
regularly speaking to the media I can
understand it is not going to work but
what I fail to understand ratio is that
the people who are on the track just do
not understand this this strategy simply
won't help you in getting the words so
for God's sake find a strategy which
helps you in getting the votes and
that's what knows I think he's a veteran
he spent all his life we have wasted so
much time like I said three months
the census is exactly where it was
George Soros
let the cat out of the bag when he put
out his tweet
strategic mistake from him because at
least then we knew
what his intentions were
its Max of a reality check
that the focus needs to be on Hindenburg
on Soros and what they were up to
the congress party which plays and will
play a very important political role in
this country
should at the very least
make sure Ensure
that for normal Indians
not even a smidgen of perception is
given that they are basing their biggest
political plank for a national election
on the basis of a Foreigner's report
or on the basis of what George Soros
would like to see happen that would be
the most obscene thing even if that
impression is given however false it may
or may not be
we have wasted too much time in
Parliament and we have caused real
economic damage to the shareholders who
have lost shareholder value
the company of the adani group are
running fine
the banks who have lent to them are
receiving their funds fine
but yet in the political Realm
this is going on and on and on and the
wiser politicians are moving away from
it
one would wonder what the Congress is
waiting on
that they are insisting
insisting to the point of Rahul Gandhi
coming out and saying that his
Parliament seed disqualification which
happened over a different kind of issue
would not stop him from speaking about
this that their parties are returned are
running organizations or people alike to
them
which are hunting adani watch hunting to
find problems
that impression is perhaps not the best
impression let alone what reality might
be for more such videos subscribe to the

that prime minister Narendra Modi will
on the occasion of Easter Sunday be
visiting a church in central Delhi this
is very next near the gold market next
to the Saint Columbus school this will
be the first time that we've seen a
sitting prime minister
visit the Saint Thomas Catholic Church
and this is going to be happening very
very shortly we're also being told that
he will attend the Easter prayers in the
church we are also being told that after
the Easter ceremony is over he will be
planting a tree in the courtyard of that
church as well so big developments
coming in and for obvious reasons that
this is going to become an intensely
important talking point
for the first time we are going to be
having a sitting prime minister
visiting a Catholic Church
for Easter Sunday I repeat this is going
to be happening in the next few minutes
I'm going to be opening up this
conversation very very rapidly joining
us now on the broadcast I can see
himanshu but is with us I'm trying to
get my reporter mahima kataria who's
reaching this gold market Church very
shortly let me quickly kick this off
with himanshuji himanshuji if you can
hear us and are able able to join into
this conversation uh we are showing file
visuals of Narendra Modi right now but
we're being told we get live visuals of
him arriving at the Saint Thomas Church
in in Delhi very very shortly imagine
your first reaction to this
whether the actual is you know India is
a peculiar country and uh PM Modi takes
care of everything
when is Diwali celebrate Diwali when
it's Easter is celebrating Easter what's
wrong in it and what's new in it
why do people get so much uh to ideally
go to church
who is talking that nobody's talking
anything sir uh we just it's unusual
this is the first time a sitting prime
minister will be visiting a church on
Easter Sunday it's obviously a good
thing to happen
um
how are you just responding and why he
would have chosen on Easter Sunday to go
to a church
the only one should go to a church
why not that's what I'm trying to say
you know it's unfortunate that it's 75
years ago Independence people have not
understood the real meaning of
secularism
okay
this conversation of secularism with you
just very shortly let's get an update on
actually what's happening on the ground
mahima my colleague is now going to be
tracking this mayama uh what's what's
the plan of action now I know uh for
security reasons all the scheduled
details are not shared with us uh we are
finding out these things as they are
about to begin to happen uh so we are
being told this is in gold market this
is Saint Thomas Church this is between
the convent of Jesus and Mary and and
send Columbus's school is one of the
oldest if not the oldest church in Delhi
and of course today is Easter Sunday
well absolutely should be correctly
pointed out this is the first time in
the history that the sitting prime
minister on the Easter that is on the
occasion of the Easter will visit to the
church and prime minister Narendra Modi
is all set to visit the Sacred Heart
Catholic Church in Delhi today that is
like you correctly pointed out it is in
the national capital in the gold market
and what is to be noted here uh Russia
base that the father uh Swami Nathan
stated and I quote that it is for the
first time that a prime minister is
coming to a church prime minister
Narendra Modi is coming to our church
today and we are excited about it I
think it is for the first time that
prime minister is coming to this church
is what the father of the church or the
priest has to say also tentatively what
we have got the itinerary is that Prime
Minister Modi will reach the church at
around 5 30. he will spend half an hour
in the church and prime minister will
offer prayers and will also plant a tree
in a park outside the church and the
Prime Minister from there will directly
leave uh for the BJP headquarters where
the ceces and today in the national
capital Mission okay uh so this is as
mahima is correcting us can I just get
my touchpad on our screens please very
very quickly to give people who are not
from Delhi and understanding of what the
church is uh this is uh to the best of
my knowledge one of the oldest churches
in Delhi uh this is what it's called
This is the Sacred Heart Church this is
as I mentioned very near Connaught place
in Delhi uh in between uh two of the
iconic schools uh which is the convent
of Jesus and Mary and Saint Columbus's
school to put things in perspective I
think if I'm not mistaken uh Shahrukh
Khan went to that school now the church
uh the Sacred Heart Church here which
you sing on your screens uh
has traditionally Easter Sunday
celebrations we are being told that this
will include a special service which has
been conducted for Easter Sunday Sunday
I've been to this church for uh
midnight mass a few years ago and people
from all over the city gather here it's
one of the one of the best churches uh
in in the national capital of course
built before independence where they're
having Easter Sunday and uh for people
who are following this Easter Sunday is
an important occasion in the Catholic
calendar comes of course after Good
Friday and I'm going to be jumping into
that conversation very very shortly so
so maima uh so what do we know I'm told
he's going to be planting a tree in the
church Courtyard I'm also being told
that he will attend the service is that
correct
he will offer prayers and after that the
park outside the church is going to
plant a tree there but also like you
correctly pointed out that Easter is a
very important Sunday in the Christian
calendar and also what is important here
to be noted that the father or the
priest of the church clearly stated that
it is for the first time that any prime
minister is coming but we all know that
he cares about all the minorities in the
country so that is what the church
priest has to say this is the first time
like you also correctly pointed out that
a prime minister is visiting
the church and this particular Church
like you correctly pointed out age in
the gold market in the national capital
and also
okay uh for some reason I've lost
mahima's audio they will get it back
she's on route of course to the Sacred
Heart
Church Cathedral as we speak uh uh
savior Rodriguez joining us on the
broadcast he's of course a member of the
BJP uh uh Savio uh uh to the best of my
knowledge I'm trying to do quick
research this is unprecedented this a
sitting prime minister of this country
has never visited a church
uh before to attend a service your quick
First Take
well I think it's very important to
understand that Prime Minister Modi is
the prime minister of India and not just
the prime minister of the Hindu majority
as many in the opposition likes to
portray what Prime Minister Modi is
doing is doing exactly what any prime
minister uh you know should be doing
which is which is integrating with
people of every Faith because he's
looking
looking at if individuals as a citizen
you know so today when he partakes in in
visiting the church and and being a part
of of the tree planting that's happening
outside the church he's sending out a
message of unity he's sending out a
message of peace and what a beautiful
day to do it on and a day of Easter
which is about salvation which is about
Resurrection which is about change okay
okay why don't you help us out for
people watching this broadcast I like I
said I've been to this church for
midnight mass a few years ago uh just
tell us a bit about Good Friday about
Easter Sunday why it's celebrated and
what kind of special service special
Masters organized generally on Easter
Sundays so So Good Friday is is a very
solemn day in the Chris for the
Christian Community it's the day when
Jesus sacrificed himself for the rest of
the world as per our Christian beliefs
and because of which on the third day
which is Sunday there is a resurrection
that happens and through that
Resurrection uh we we are all saved by
the power of of Jesus's sacrifice now
what does that mean in layman terms the
meaning in daima in terms is primarily
that you know life has a lot of
suffering life has a lot of ups and
downs life has a lot of downturns that
also happens but if you don't lose your
hope in good if you don't lose your hope
in God there will always be a time that
will come back for you to rise up again
and that's the message of Easter and
Easter is very significant because the
entire Christian belief is based on the
Salvation principle of the Catholic
Doctrine the salmon is the sacrifice of
Jesus for the rest of the Christian
Believers but there is a larger message
and the larger message is that life has
problems but life also there is hope and
can you have hope in God
stay with me I just want to give up
people watching the broadcast can I get
my touchscreen back up here just a
little bit of perspective if you're not
from Delhi and this is a
the fascinating beauty of Delhi as well
so ladies and gentlemen uh this is just
as you can see
uh southeast of what you recognize here
so this is the infamous uh or rather
famous Connaught place all right which
we all understand uh just Southwest of
that is the sarovar this is the Bangla
sahib Gurdwara and literally the Bangla
sahib gurudwara then you have Golda
Khanna in the middle which is the GPO in
the center here and towards the north of
that is the Sacred Heart Cathedral
really in this in this one screenshot of
just of Google Maps you can see both the
Bangla sahib Gurdwara which is uh you
know the place where people of the Sikh
community and many other Fates visit
it's a must visit site in in Delhi right
next to that of course is something
called The Sacred Heart Cathedral it's a
Catholic Church to the immediate
west of the church is the San Columbus
school
to the immediate right of the church is
the convent of Jesus Mary which is a
girls school it's a girls Convent and in
the center here this is the Sacred Heart
uh which we are being told that the
Prime Minister will be visiting they
have an auditorium uh on on on the side
uh you know brings me back to my younger
days where I have attended this
Auditorium and of course the school
buildings on have the tennis courts and
swimming pool which are part of Saint
Columbus School uh on the other side so
this is uh Golda Kana as I just
mentioned uh right next to Baba kadak
Singh Mark Ashoka Road right up across
the road from Bangla sahib Gurdwara
where you have the Sacred Heart
Cathedral let's get back to our images
uh I don't know Savio if you've ever
come if you ever had a chance in Delhi
to visit the sacred heartil is one of
the best Catholic churches in in Delhi
I have and it was very beautiful yeah so
like more importantly the Sacred Heart
Cathedral is also very solemn in its in
its Aura it's a very prayerful place
uh
the you know you believe it or not last
time I I and and this is uh the story of
India perhaps you should tell the last
time I in fact actually sat for a
service not the midnight mass but a
Sunday Services Sacred Heart Cathedral I
was with a Muslim friend of mine uh and
I'm Hindu and we sat for a for a for a
church service and it is of course can
be a very moving thing uh midnight mass
is a is a completely different
experience uh just as an experience uh
it's it's it's something something
special uh I was traveling around Delhi
uh uh during uh Christmas just last year
and saw a lot of people walking down for
midnight mass in various churches uh
across the capital to the best of my
knowledge this is the oldest one and uh
uh to again to the best of my knowledge
uh I'm just going to read out some
information for you as I mentioned it's
between
Columbus and CGM Convent of Jesus and
Mary that the total site of this is
about 14 acres and it was built in
foundation stone lead in 1929 and
construction began in 1930. Anil Anthony
joining us on the broadcast now member
of the bharati janta party uh Anil this
is the first time in the history of
Independent India that a sitting prime
minister is visiting a church on Easter
Sunday what's your first take
foreign
minister of the country do not
differentiate between any majority or
minority the prime minister of this
country only sees 140 crore Indians and
he is working on a very
very solid Vision to take all these 140
core Indians forward with her and he is
working with a vision to bring economic
and social Mobility to the Indian
population and this is all a part of the
prime minister's
policies to take everybody alone along
forward and the country
are
giving back uh and putting Faith back in
the Prime Minister also you saw the
recent elections that happened in
Northeast the three states all the
northeastern states all of them are
um right now governed by the bjpr the
BJP is allies and every single state
where even the minorities are a majority
in this country
party or his allies the Coalition they
are governing everywhere because the
people of this country has full faith in
the prime minister of this country and
the Barbarian party okay Anil I have to
ask you this question for for obvious
reasons uh
the what is the importance for uh for a
Christian uh on Easter Sunday now we've
just gone through Good Friday Sundays
having the same conversation with Savvy
just a minute minute across can you just
explain that for people watching the
broadcast please
see this is a very special day for uh
Christians across the world this is the
day where after the crucification of
Christ on Friday after three days Christ
Rose and uh he uh Rose from the grave
and he uh attained immortality and this
is a great uh very special day for
Christianity and it is a great
just there by the prime minister to show
to tell the minorities that in India the
Christian population as well as the
world but the Barbie as another party
stands with everybody in this country
the bhardi agenda party
and the government wants to take
everybody together
the Prime Minister do not differentiate
between any citizen in this country
there is no majority there is no
minority there are only Indians and
everybody will be moving okay
before I let you go now there is there
is a a Christian population in Delhi
there is a substantial Christian
population in Mumbai in the Northeast
and of course from your home state of of
Kerala so how how uh how would you and
and other people in Kerala be viewing
this visit by the prime minister
the prime minister is
right now the whole of country
irrespective of majority or minorities
Kerala has a huge minority population
also everybody has faith in the prime
minister right now across India people
are putting the faith in the Prime
Minister and his mission and the djpr
Allies are in power and vast major are
in the government and vast majority of
the States in 2014 and 2019 party had
come with historic Mandy even in Kerala
right now more and more people are
will be the best option for them to gain
Avenues of Social and economic
mobilities and for them to get new
economic opportunities for them to be a
part of India's nation building process
and transformation so more and more
people are joining the BJP and the party
is growing very fast in Kerala also okay
well uh
a very happy
Easter Sunday celebration to you Anil
I'm sure you'll also be having your own
service that you will be attending uh
accurately I would so quickly want to
describe to our viewers what so here's
an opportunity ladies and gentlemen uh
and let's make the most of it I I've
seen this church since childhood uh it
was very very near to where I went to
school uh not I didn't go to send
Columbus but my school is just on the
other side of Connaught place so I've
been there many many times as as a young
person I've done events here and of
course somebody who Anil knows very well
uh who was uh my mentor was a Christian
from Kerala uh and he was a very well
respected journalist and he uh uh when
you know when I was working with him we
did a lot of a lot of events in this in
in this church which of course I still
remember very very fondly let me just
show you on our screen once again our
visuals here I'm trying to get my
colleague mahima into this conversation
very quickly she's at the church when
you uh can okay so ladies and gentlemen
this is the inside of the Sacred Heart
Cathedral in in Delhi uh let me just try
to describe to you what it is uh so you
can see uh right at the at the center uh
where you have uh what is called the
apps the apps is uh basically a a dome
of the search you have right at the
center that is uh
a painting of The Last Supper
towards the right side of this there is
a statue of the Virgin Mary
and of course in the center of course
you have a
the crucifix the cross
and this gives you an understanding it's
not the one of the largest churches in
the world for show but is one of the
oldest ones in Delhi it's almost 100
years old
as as we speak my colleague joining us
on broadcast Mima I know you're on Route
reaching that reaching the Sacred Heart
contributor we're expecting the prime
minister to arrive there very shortly
maybe in half an hour 45 minutes
prime minister to visit the churches
somewhere around 5 30 but also or what I
noted rishab that you spoke about the
Christians in Kerala and what for our
viewers is important to note here is
that earlier on April 5th the union
Minister V Molly dharan has gotten the
Supreme head of the Orthodox Syrian
Church into the parliament to meet Prime
Minister Modi at his office inside the
Parliament and Matthew's third who was
visiting the national capital to lead
the Easter week celebrations in Delhi uh
stated and I quote that it was my first
wish to meet Prime Minister Modi after
uh he took over as the head of the
church and now after meeting uh with
prime minister he feels really happy and
he also stated that he inquired that
prime minister inquired about the
functioning of the church and explained
and then he explained about the details
and he was really happy that uh whatever
the church is doing but also what is
important is that uh prime minister
modi's visit to the church comes amid
the party's concrete
to the community including meeting with
the Supreme head of the Indian Orthodox
Church that is the Matthews 3. so yes
this is the first time that any sitting
prime minister is going to visit the
church is going to serve uh he's going
to attend the service there he's going
to offer prayers he's going to plant a
tree there so a lot of things that is
going to happen ahead of the CDC which
is also important uh leading it to the
Karnataka elections uh so but definitely
prime minister is reaching out to the
minorities here but also what is
important that's the priest or the
father of this church stated that Prime
Minister Modi was taking the country
forward on the principle of
it is very important to note that the
father of the church swaminathan has
clearly stated that prime minister is
concerned about the minorities and also
he's working on the principle
okay now
himanshu but is still with us in
himanshu you know imagine we know what's
going to happen very very shortly right
uh we know that the I mean is
predictable no the Congress is going to
say that why is he going to a church why
will he will he also go to a Masjid you
know what's about to happen right so I'm
staying away from that as long as
possibly because it's giving me an
opportunity to to talk about a church
that you know I've I've seen as a child
and I've visited several times so I'm
going to talk about that for a bit
but the political play out on this is
almost inevitable that this is going to
be perceived as as a stunt that this is
going to be perceived as okay uh the
Christian church I'll I'll I'll visit uh
because of course uh you know the uh uh
you know uh Northeast is important
Kerala is important the Christian
Community is important but the Muslim um
Masjid I will never visit uh should
should we be as as cliched in our
politics or can we really suspect
and expect the prime minister is trying
to do something larger here
doing something larger but before that
let me tell you one thing in ujjain
mahakal incident is to be reminded to
people
okay
Temple incident of Rahul Gandhi and the
way Congress went Gaga
of potatoes
who am I I'm not going to utter those
things yeah what I'm saying is this
so-called belief of the world not even
India in the opposition in India
so-called belief of the world that Hindu
secularist party has come to power in
India and India will never be said
that is the larger narrative here
one must understand this and so this
sort of strategical and tactical
messaging is very much necessary
okay so you might feel so many things in
your heart but you don't portray you
don't throw it at times it becomes
necessary to show some people what is
the truth okay and the truth is today
out of 25 23 seats are run by of
Northeast okay okay so I'm I'm going to
now have this conversation with with
Savion so because savior ladies and
gentlemen I mean some of you would be
aware who watches often and follow him
on social media uh the Savior joined the
BJP before the elections in Goa his
constituency from where he fought the
fought the campaign or fought the seat
uh is a is a largely Christian
constituency so I'm going to have this
conversation about perceptions of the
BJP in that Christian constituency it's
not a straight line but as I promise I'm
going to tell you a bit about this
church as well uh so can I just get come
back to my touch screen here please so
uh so the Sacred Heart Cathedral in New
Delhi uh
ah the parish priest is Father Francis
swaminathan
then the assistant Parish priest his
father John Britto
uh Reverend father Sunil prakash Rasta
is also an assistant Parish priest and
father alosius VR is also an assistant
Parish priest so there are uh the the
chief priest the head priest is Father
Francis uh swaminathan who's of course
there at the Sacred Heart I'll be
showing you a lovely image of it from
inside here it is this is what the
church or the cathedral rather it's not
like I said the biggest in the world uh
but uh it's uh it's the oldest one in
Delhi there were plans uh under the
British to build build a one near
Parliament but uh by the time the world
wars has started and it couldn't happen
shrinach with joining us on the
broadcast if you can hear me uh you know
I I know what the cynical argument is
going to happen very very later sir but
on the significance of the moment first
let's absorb it for a second first time
in history a sitting Indian Prime
Minister will be visiting a church for
Easter servicer your thoughts
he has been meeting people from various
works and he has been going around and I
don't find any things strange about it
we have no issues
uh but I mean basically we go to our
religious places and we respect our
religious places every other religion
also so we have not uh
I'm not surprised at all in what is
happening
but it is unusual there's always the
first time uh there is always the first
time but it is it is it is unusual we of
course are are used to seeing not only
this prime minister but previous prime
minister but especially this one you
know he's going to be he'll be doing the
ganga Artis and he'll be in Varanasi
he'll be visiting the temples we've even
we are even used to see him visiting the
gurdwaras but there's always a first
time uh uh visiting a church and let's
not kid ourselves it is Easter Sunday so
there is some symbolism that is to be
taken away what is the symbolism to be
taken away today
basically
I mean I know I don't say that it's not
instead of church at all
a symbolism is that he has gone he's
going there on a Easter Sunday I mean he
wants to be a part of that particular
activity he's going there that's it I
don't find any uh
uh
I mean basically you know one more thing
is this also gives message that
we all all together for the country so
you give the question of nationalism
which is trying to propose take with
this kind of thought process there is no
separation this thought has been uh
being uh put forth in different uh
spheres in the political area also so
there is no question of uh
uh trying to polarize our social
security we are a part of everybody
everybody is a part of whatever we are
that's how it is going

gjy83oPiTd0,FM To Visit US Along With RBI Governor | To Attend Spring Annual Meeting of WB &amp; IMF | Newsx,FM To Visit US Along With RBI Governor | To Attend Spring Annual Meeting of WB & IMF | Newsx To Subscribe our YouTube ...,2023-04-09T03:25:47Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gjy83oPiTd0/hqdefault.jpg,"Union Finance Minister nirmala Sita
Raman is to Embark today on an official
visit to the United States of America
she will be attending the spring annual
meetings of the international monetary
fund world and World bank finance
minister Sita Rahman will be accompanied
by RBI Governor
Das they will co-chair the G20 Finance
ministers and Central bank's Governors
meetings on the sidelines of the IMF and
World Bank meetings
will also have bilateral engagements
with her respective counterparts from
G20 countries and heads of other
delegations
around 350 delegates from G20 members 13
inviti countries and various
International and Regional organizations
are set to participate in this meeting
they will engage in multilateral
discussions centered around a broad
spectrum of pressing Global issues
during the meeting the key Focus will be
on issues such as addressing food and
energy security managing Global debt
vulnerabilities strengthening
multilateral developmental banks
mobilizing finance for climate action
and accelerating progress on
International tax and financial sector
issues
the meeting will take stock of the
progress made on outcomes and Visage
under India's G20 Finance track agenda I
have with me on the broadcast senior
Economist Dr Sharad Kohli we're getting
to know that Finance Minister nirmala
Sita Raman is set to leave for USA to
attend the spring annual meetings of the
international monetary fund and World
Bank of course these meetings are set to
address a broad spectrum of global
issues such as food and energy
insecurity and Global debt
vulnerabilities sir what do you think
can be the outcomes of this meeting do
you think any positive consensus will be
brought about
well we should not forget that the
meeting is happening in the backdrop of
the situation where India is leading the
G20 pack
so you know the discussions would not
just be confined to you know India
versus another country they will be con
they will also have a very wide-ranging
repercussions as far as the global
financial sector or global economic
Outlook is concerned so I think one of
the issues Prime issues which can come
up in the discussion would be the
multilateral development Banks because
the role of these banks in the recent
past has been highlighted and how they
have come to rescue especially after
kovit and the Russia Ukraine crisis that
will be one
second I think the the delicate
situation in the world banking system
specially after the interest rate hike
would also come up for discussion
because America in particular has seen a
bit of a Domino's effect although it was
uh you know you know sort of taken care
of by the American government
but then the vulnerability of the the
banking system around the world after
the interest rate hike will also be
under discussion as to how the world or
the governments around the world
especially the G20 can take action to
see that a 2008 life situation of Lehman
Brothers doesn't come again because it
can rock the whole financial sector
around the world I think then of course
the Finance Minister will not miss out
the opportunity of bilateral discussions
with various country Finance head
especially with Janet Yellen the U.S
treasury secretary I think she would
like to discuss a lot of issues as far
as India and us is concerned we should
also not forget that the Reserve Bank of
India Governor is also uh you know
traveling along with and there are
meetings lined up with other Central
Bank heads where I think another a very
interesting point in discussion would be
the interest rate hike we all know that
the interest rate hikes take place
around the world in a very synchronized
manner they start from U.S they trickle
down to Europe and then of course the
Asian countries have also to follow suit
because you cannot see a significant
difference in the interest rate so I
think uh the Central Bank Governor would
also like to discuss the issue of uh
interest rate hike whether the banks
around the world should take a pause now
because we are starting to feel the side
effects on the world economic growth we
all know that the three percent
projections of the world economic growth
by the imfc for the next five years is a
bit of a bit of a concern for the world
and I think the world is looking up to
India as because India is still amongst
the fastest growing economies India has
been termed as a bright spot India has
been termed as a shining star so I think
the world would be looking up to India
as far as the driving the world economic
growth is concerned IMF also said that
India and China will constitute the
major part of the world's economic
growth in the years to come so I think
the world would like to take cues as to
what magic is India doing to its economy
despite being 1.4 billion people around
what magic is it doing to make sure that
it is still growing and of course
another aspect which I feel will be
discussed with India's prowess at
Financial technology the fintech
progress which India has made with
regard to UPI with regards to digital
payment system with regard to financial
inclusion I think all these aspects will
come uh for discussion on the table and
the world will like to take some tips
from from the finance ministers to how
this magical achievement has been made
where so many people have been brought
under the digital system so I think I
think all in all it's going to be a very
useful D20 uh you know session with
multiple meetings lined up and World
debt is another thing which I feel will
come under discussion because uh after
covet the kind of borrowings which the
countries have made and you know the
debt to GDP ratio of G20 Nations is has
been a matter of discussion and the
world coming in the severe debt I think
is not a very good situation so I think
the the heads of Finance would also like
to discuss about as to how to come out
of this debt trap which the world has
been landed into after covert and Russia
Ukraine war and I think uh one more
aspect which I feel will be under
discussion is the geopolitical tensions
I meant the current geopolitical
tensions which are building around the
world as to how the world financial uh

Belfast and this is the capital of
Northern Ireland to Mark the 25th
anniversary of the Good Friday peace
agreement a huge Security operation is
already in place in the city for
President Biden's visit his visit to
Belfast will be the first leg of a
four-day stay in Ireland during which he
will discuss his Irish roots and meet
Irish relatives
President Biden is also expected to meet
the leaders of the five main political
parties of the Stormont Northern
Ireland's Parliament that is
President Biden's visit comes after
Monday's 25th anniversary of the Good
Friday peace agreement which was marred
by improvised bombs being thrown at a
police Land Rover during a republican
rally in Derry also known as the
Londonderry
Foreign Affairs expert Mr Sandeep
Sanjeev srivastav joins us on the show
to give his take on this Mrs I hope you
can hear me sir
what do you make of Joe Biden's visit
to Northern Ireland obviously it's
historic he was also greeted by Rishi
sanak as he stepped off Air Force One at
the Belfast International Airport but
definitely the stocks a bit of a
controversy as well for all those people
who've been asking for a separate state
in Northern Ireland
you know uh first of all good morning to
you good morning to all the viewers uh
it's a historic moment uh uh for uh the
northern Irish history uh when they are
you know celebrating the 25th
anniversary of the historic uh Good
Friday agreement and uh that is the land
that was the landmark agreement uh and
that led to you know restoration of
Peace in Northern Ireland and which was
heavily marked by the a lot of violent
acts before this uh you know a card was
signed and uh from the 60s onwards
territory was very much inaudible area
but uh after this Good Friday agreement
uh which is the United States of America
also helped broker you know the piece
was stood and now uh uh you know when
they are commemorating the 25th year of
this historic uh
bookside agreement
you know roots in our land and he is
also going to make some of his relatives
when he is going to Republic of Ireland
after this Northern land digit so I
think it's a very historic moment uh
personally also for Joe Biden but uh
overall he is to commemorate the 25th
year of Good Friday agreement and when
he was asked that what is the purpose of
this
got to
stand that he wants to
he attempting to emphasize the historic
importance and the relevance of the it
was Amplified agreement and uh and
obviously some people there are some
discontent youth uh people may be having
different opinions different agendas
obviously they are not happy with the
status of the Accord at this point of
time and that is why they are they have
some some kind of a turbulence out there
and they were engaged in some violent
acts Etc before this visit just to
emphasize the point that they are having
a different View and different opinions
so I think there must be having some
element of this thought or not happy
with it at course but if you look at the
you know significance of this Accord the
historicity of this record is enormous
it's still still very very significant
effort and I think it is this is going
to shift the the next 25 years of this
Northern and history and that is
precisely a lot of the Prime Minister of
Britain said uh and uh he is obviously
there so he was there to receive Joe
Biden when he arrived there so I think
uh just the Accord is a landmark
agreement and its relevance is very much
there I think it will continue the uh
shaping the history of and future force
of events of London Ireland but yeah
certainly there are some people there
are some elements and there are some
section of societies of Northern
elements they are not happy are not that
they want change they do not want their
status quo to continue and that is why
right they have appreciate you joining
us uh Wing Commander Prophet bakshi also
joins us this morning to give his
insights into this visit uh Commander
bakshi you know Joe Biden of course of
Irish origin he's also considered to be
the most most Irish of all the
presidents that have come and gone in
the United States but according to you
what is the cultural as well as the
political signal that this visit is
sending to the world as well as those
people who want a separate State uh in
Ireland
thank you we need
which has been which has been in the
center of discussions a number of times
the origin of Americans where do they
belong to their Roots lie in Europe
everybody knows and a number of
personalities have come from Ireland
including Joe Biden and a lot of film
stars and actors and leaders well that's
about all that's right but the question
here is that the 1968 peace agreement
that a good Friday agreement which took
place because there was a lot of you
know an Irish problem I will not go on
to this how there's a problem between
the United Kingdom and Ireland and what
are the reason what are the religious
intonations behind what are the causes
yes there are a number of causes the
Earth the fight has been tremendous
armies have been involved a lot of guys
have been lost a regular armies have
been involved in this and that is what
the example everybody gives to Great
Britain that please don't play in others
Internal Affairs because everybody
starts playing in your Irish Affair so
this aspect of Joe Biden when he has
gone there he has gone with a cost with
his older in mind they are very
interested in bringing out peaceful
negotiations between the dissident
groups and dissident groups are becoming
very violent they are resorting to Arms
forearms even legal weapons are there
and not only means of warfare but the
methods of warfare are becoming very
inhuman that aspect has been seen and I
know some British officers personally
who have got the better difficult end of
the stick from the island but but for us
I personally feel if this problem is
solved and
smelted down then most of the problem
around will start simmering down too
because thereafter the people will take
lead America has now taken this lead
America will have to walk the talk in
other places also and that's what is
required at the moment I personally feel
for the Peace of the world this would be
very nice step and a very nice gesture
on the part of American president for

editorial director of the Sunday

Professor nalapath you know it's
heartening to see that Ukraine has
indulged in this Outreach but at the
same time Ukraine has also been critical
of India buying oil from Russia how do
you think we should uh you know be
balancing our Focus towards Ukraine
well I think we're doing a good job of
it in the sense that we are not diluting
our relationship with Russia and at the
same time we have been providing
humanitarian assistance to Ukraine the
reality is this war is a tragedy for the
Ukrainian people and it's also proven to
be a tragedy for the entire
International Community so the sooner
the war ends the better but ultimately
uh there is a difficulty and that is
that the Ukrainian side believes that
with the help of NATO they will be able
to push the Russians out of every bit of
Ukrainian territory uh including in the
Eastern territories that since 2014 has
not been under the control of care this
is a slightly unrealistic perspective
and quite frankly it is unrealizable so
this is the difficulty in Ukraine I
think this war and this conflict is is
going to go on a little longer until the
Ukrainian side comes to a compromise
settlement uh in a sense a land for
peace settlement it's a horrible thing
to do therefore the Ukrainian point of
view but the fact is that realistically
speaking NATO is not going to enter the
war of the eukary side directly although
the ukrainians will like that that's out
of the question and given that they
don't have the muscle to throw Russia
out of the donbath and lugan so they
only went out frankly is to accept that
there will be a trade-off of territory

Biden visiting Northern Ireland
obviously it's a state visit but at the
same time Joe Biden has gone on to say
that he's also here to discover his
Irish roots
and good morning to you and all the
viewers
uh it's a significant reason in the
sense that it is a reaffirmation of the
American faith in the Good Friday
agreement uh reached 25 years ago which
actually has basically held all uh for
all these years with the minor
exceptions here and there and uh just
only yesterday there was a kind of a
student of violence other people died
but those are those are exceptionally
hidden I think for the first time we see
in the history that a regiment has held
on with the two opposal Camp sharing
power in the capital and I think Biden's
visit is a reaffirmation of faith in
that agreement very significant
Discovery Irish root on the on the other
hand also uh re-establishing the
connection between the USA and Ireland
at two states
absolutely and you know so Northern
Ireland of course has its own history

it's happened in the case of brexit and

that those those have not really created

Christina Scott has now debunked all
these rumors saying that free trade
negotiations between India and UK are
very much in progress the deputy High
Commissioner also said they take the
security of embassies very seriously and
are working to ensure that security is
maintained isn't it
now is calm but let me first of all just
extend and repeat the assurances that my
ministers have made that we take
extremely seriously uh the security of
the Indian High Commission in London and
we're working very closely with them to
make sure that their security is
maintained the situation right now is
calm but let me first of all just extend
and repeat the assurances that my
ministers have made that we take
extremely seriously uh the security of
the Indian High Commission in London and
we're working very closely with them to
make sure that their security is
maintained the situation right now is
but what I can say is that negotiations
are continuing on a 3D trade agreement
and we're determined that we can
continue to work together to try and
find a free trade agreement that
supports British and Indian businesses
and support our Collective Economic
Security
Sanjay Kapoor editor hard news is uh
joining us at this point on the
broadcast Sandra Kapoor your first
interpretation of this statement by the
British Deputy High Commissioner
I think there is a bit of a crisis when
it comes to a trade agreement between
India and UK If you go by the reports
which have appeared in the London times
and you would see that the agreement has
been put on hold primarily because India
has concerns about security to our high
commission especially from kalistanis
with the who last month or around that
time raided our premises and did all
kinds of nasty things which is that and
the security use come is handled
properly by the state by the United
Kingdom government I don't think India
is going to go forward in that
all right Sanjay stay with us in fact we
have Sanjeev shivastava also joining us
at this point International Affairs
experts sanjivastava do you believe that
there is trouble for the Free Trade
Agreement obviously the British Deputy
eye commissioner are denying that saying
that uh the talks continue as planned
but just read between the lines for us
yeah our UK featured agreement and I
think uh with regard to our strategic
partnership in that economic partnership
to play a very important role I think
that is quite in depth and I do not
think that uh this kind of uh you know
uh you know situation security related
issues will make much impact on The
Unwanted negotiations as as you know our
honorable uh Finance Minister nimula
Sita Raman had also mentioned and during
her talk at the Peterson Institute of
you know International economic Affairs
in the USA saying that uh some something
uh uh being built that uh uh India UK uh
State talks are not going in in the
right direction so I so see has already
clarified this and I do not think that
uh this kind of a security situation uh
will make any impact on the ongoing uh
any negative impact on the ongoing and
negotiation those are for the free trade
but having said that let me say that
that I think it's high time that uh UK
authorities are should you know respect
and should have uh whatever uh the
concerns and whatever the input which we
are giving with regard to our concerns
in the uh around our UK High commission
our high Commission in the London so I
think that kind of a security concerns
must be addressed and the proper
security has to be provided as quickly
as possible but more than that there
must be action against anti-india
Elements which are active on the UK
territory and that is the you know that
will be a very good thing if the United
Kingdom takes action proper action uh to
curb the anti-india you know activities
and those Elements which are obviously
supported by you know various
intelligence agencies including Pakistan
so I think a comprehensive action
against to curb anti-india activities
will be a very good thing for the uh
India UK strategic partnership and I
think this partnership is very much
intact it is robust and it has a very
you know Sound Logic for it to grow but
the security concerns must be addressed
and that is what India has you know
emphasizing time and again that we
cannot compromise with our security
situation and this uh so-called Pro
kalistani activities Etc is related to
our national security is related to
India's the vital you know code National
Security interest so that must be
addressed and I hope that UK authorities
will take you know proper action in in
quick time and has been as has been
assured by the one official of the you
know uh UK Embassy here so I think I uh
uh uh we hope and look forward to
further actions uh being taken action uh
to be taken against uh you know
so-called kalistani elements and
so-called whatever the ntnd activities
which are going on that must be curved
and that is the need of the hour I hope
that UK 30
a quick and uh no strict action against
such elements and that is uh quite
imperative uh for to maintain and to
grow uh this India's UK uh strategic
partnership
right Sanjay Kapoor also continues to be
with us Sanjay uh uh obviously you know
there there have also been questions
raised over India being very upset after
that uh attack on a high commission do
you believe that is also a reason uh for
this stalling of the agreement talks
even though the deputy eye commission
has also spoken on that saying security
off the high commission remains a
priority for us
I think there has been uh issues with
the British higher British government
over not just how the kalistanis have
been entertained and how they've been
it's been there for a while in a certain
way maybe this could be the straw the
last straw and the camel's back if you
say how these British government reacted
to it although there is a view that we
overreacted to the situation and we
could have let it pass like the U.S
embassy had been facing a lot of uh you
know demonstration and protests there so
they moved their the embassy to some
other premises so India should also be
mindful of it British is a society is
fear so you know there is a conflict of
how you perceive a situation the
britishers have a different way Indians
have a different way so uh Indians have
been telling the Europe UK government
that we don't take this slightly and we
think this is a violation of our
premises
certain way violation or every thing
that we hold here and that is why they
should react very strongly so if the the
biggest papers are saying that one of
the reasons why the Free Trade Agreement
has not gone forward is because of the
security concerns and also misgivings
about how UK reacts to our security
issues and how they meddle in different
ways so there are as I said far more
other reasons not just this but I think
they have to be resolved before the
trade agreement goes forward for more

Karnataka is most likely to be delayed
sources are also telling us that party
is set to ask kamul to pause its entry
into Karnataka with us on the broadcast
uh prakash the executive editor of the
ITV Network jaffrakash big news coming
in we've been given to understand that
in fact amul's entry into Karnataka
might just be delayed after the furod
that erupted yesterday what are we
learning with regards to the same well
see this is a successful Congress
campaign you can say I mean the time and
again the Congress has uh you know come
out with such narrative to show that the
BJP is an outsider party you know to
understand the Karnataka politics it's
quite essential the role of the
Karnataka milk Federation the kmf which
produces nandini milk every uh it's a
Cooperative Revolution that happened of
course India saw the in a white
Revolution under Korean and in Karnataka
the similar model happened but then it
was uh you know indigenized at the at
the grassroot level in Karnataka uh uh
you know Dairy farming is a huge economy
uh in the rural areas of Karnataka you
have about 30 milk Federation
associations across the state and
they together they produce and uh you
know meet the supply demand uh chain of
80 percent 80 to 85 percent is met by
kmf and there is uh you know Democratic
process there of electing directors two
platforms are there from where you know
politic politicians you know take form
and further their cost one is the gram
panchayat election the other one is the
diary and here they the BJP you know uh
according to Congress feels that they
want to throt the advances of Congress
is because traditionally they've been
very strong at these milk federations
and other allegation is that you know
amul is going to take over a kmf of
course the Cooperative Minister himself
has has said uh St swam Shaker that
there is no such move nandini itself is
a Big Brand they are selling a milk at
around close to 40 rupees whereas amul
is selling at 60 rupees a different
category altogether and there was a
shortage and that's the reason why amul
was asked to you know a chip in and
fulfill that shortage and Congress has
been alleging that it was an artificial
scarcity and demand which was created to
allow amul to come in so this is the
best case scenario to study how you know
politics can be played
hitting at the sentiment of the people
and you know this is quite a quite a
damage that happened to the bjp's
prospects and that's the reason why they
are going to delay it and it's in the
right Earnest too people will understand
the role of amul and nandi in the coming
days but for now it's election season
and people are quite sensitive when it

108.78 crores have been seized in

items include
37.24 crores in unaccounted cash
5.23 lakh liters worth of liquor which
somewhere sums up close to 26.68 crores
as well as 397 kilograms of illegal
drugs worth 11.54 crores and more the

were similar recovery that was made by
the EC now the big question here is what
does this truly mean for the elections
of Karnataka on the broadcast with us
still our executive director our
executive editor pardon me Jay
prakashram
what do we make of this EC seizure that
has taken place in what are you learning
well I mean 38 crores in cash close to
23 crores in liquor and drugs um amongst
other seizures in fact the election
commission of India when he was in in
Bengaluru to take on the preparedness of
the state election commission he had you
know informed and uh you know told the
officers there that don't wait for the
election code of conduct to kick in you
need to crack down on this kind of uh
you know freebies that are being you
know given to the voters especially
those economically weaker sections or
the slum dwellers there amongst the
other waterways who the politicians want
to keep them tied with elections around
the bend but compared to last year ah
this Caesar is almost double so this
this actually shows that the the stakes
are really high for all the three
parties more so for the the BJP and the
Congress the Congress is upbeat that you
know they are going to ROM form with the
majority because they feel that you know
this time around the Miss governance
corruption and all the bad Optics that
the BJP got beat the madal case beat up
the 40 charge against the bgp government
by the contractors Association uh be the
PSI recruitment scam several of these
scams have happened uh as uh you know
mentioned by aloksa that basuraj Bama
though has a clean image he was
surrounded by certain you know corrupt
elements and how the BJP will deal with
them in these elections will they give
them tickets this is going to be very
very important call and in that Pursuit
I think is is why the BJP has delayed
releasing the list but as far as these
seizures are concerned I mean this this
is election and it shows how you know
politicians are using all this test
activities to who the voters I mean this
is just a tip of the iceberg and just 10
days into elections 100 processor is a

list of candidates for the assembly
polls in just three weeks from now as
discussions between senior BJP leaders
are underway news X has had the
privilege of accessing exclusive
information regarding the partia janta
party strategy for the pole bound State
the BJP has outlined three major
criterias to select candidates including
reviewing the performance of sitting
mlas analyzing the image of the
prospective candidates as well as
gauging the opinion of both level
workers to decide on the candidate list
Meanwhile we're also learning that the
bhartiya janta party is likely to
release its first list of candidates
today or tomorrow and shall hold another
round of meetings before doing so
according to sources chief minister
maintains that the home minister Amit
Shah will be taking the final call
joining us on the broadcast now we have
Jai prakash Ramaya he's our executive
editor thank you so much Jeff prakash
for joining us of course Karnataka is
all the news
um the big question now sir is focused
on the bhartiya janta party's first list
what are we learning
well it's a long drawn process for the
BJP for almost two months the BJP uh was
gathering information from ground up uh
there was a survey which was being done
on various parameters they were looking
at the anti-incompensary they were
looking at the accessibility of these
leaders across Karnataka they were also
accessing about the image and the way uh
the the popularity chart basically so
these were some criteria which was
looked into on those reports within uh
discussed at the screening committee
meeting that have happened in Bengaluru
last week there was three day
back-to-back meetings which was attended
by the BJP core committee you have
stating charges also there the ministers
were the Union ministers also sitting in
that important meeting and then once the
list was filtered that list was then
sent to Delhi and uh you know as you're
aware for the last three days meetings
have been happening back to back up
strongman has returned to Bengaluru late
last night
this actually gives an indication that
there are some finalities today too
there is there are going to be some
meetings ultimately you know there are
two three people who have to take that
final call you have the chief minister
and also the chairman of The Campaign
Committee then you have JP NADA and
amitsha so the filter process is on and
uh probably late night or tomorrow is
when the the saffron party will release
its first and final list that's what my
sources are telling that polls are
around you know coming coming around
10th of May so you need at least a month
to campaign at the ground level and this
being the case there is no time to waste
for the BJP and the list should be out
the opposition of course he is attacking
Congress and JD are saying that there is
so much of uncertainty in the BJP so
much of corruption and Mal
Administration they are finding it
difficult to find winnable candidates
their take is that the surveys which was
done by the BJP has given as thrown up
surprises negative you know Impressions
about 40 to 50 of these mlas so the BJP
is finding it difficult to get
alternates there and that's the reason
why they are looking at Fresh Faces
young faces and also some popular faces
in those constances who can be you know
brought on board to contest elections
1600
candidates all together for 2 and 24
constances that was the first list now
boiling down to 224 list should be out
tonight but as I mentioned it was a long
drawn process simply because the BJP you
know you know when when it comes to
electioneering the BJP will leave
nothing to chance their election
mechanism is so solid that you know they
are they have some processes which they
use but this time you know it's been a
difficult proposition for the BJP they
have to retain Karnataka and in that
Pursuit the saffron party is going all
out
uh you know very interesting so that you
mentioned the bs5 you know BSC at
eurappa of course has been uh The Talk
of the Town when it comes to Karnataka
especially when it comes to Karnataka
BJP in Karnataka
um what do you think sir is going to
happen now that you know bsy has
returned to uh Bengaluru do you think
that this is to do with finalization of
the first list of candidates it seems so
and I was talking to a sources close to
bsy and he has said whatever he has to
say he is the Parliamentary board member
he's also the election Committee Member
here and he was here for three days
um of course he is also one of the
mascot of the BJP you've seen how uh
there is a there was an Outreach by uh
home minister Amisha who had a breakfast
meeting with the based Europe and his
son vijendra uh you know there were also
talks that vijendra would be contesting
from varuna Chief Minister also was very
keen on that but Europe put his foot
down stating that you know he should
contest from shikaripura although the
list was not out but he has officially
said that his son would contest from
from that constituency and as far as
party is concerned you know he's been
quite active Wherever Whenever the party
needs him in whichever role he is being
proactively you know engaging himself
he's volunteered in the know the
sankalpyatras of BJP he was there in
prime minister's events through and
through so as far as BJP and bsy are
concerned there is no problem as such
but him not contesting would be a big
factor and how will they uh you know
control the you know damage that could
happen since he is not there remember
pulling outs constitute more than 17
percent of the total you know electrate
in Karnataka it's a huge chunk and
that's the reason probably why bsy was
also given a long rope you know even
though he was 78 he was allowed to
continue for two and a half years
something which was uh which was not the
practice in the BJP and they made an
exception for bsy in this case yeah
with us
um JP store in fact on the broadcast now
being joined by a panel of political
experts BHP spokesperson shrina 2000 on
the broadcast we also have madhav
nalapath editorial director of the tsg
with US nagaraj yadav Congress
spokesperson with us on the broadcast
political analyst Raj Lakshmi Joshi also
joining us and last but by no means
um also with us on the broadcast if I
can just come to
um you first shrina ji as far as the
Bhatia party is concerned uh the first
list of candidates we're awaiting very
very
um curiously what is it looking like sir
who are the faces that we're expecting
to take the front seat
see basically uh comprehensive exercise
has is being done
and of course the nomination is from
13th onwards and much before that the
list will come out
and there has been a different kind of
analysis uh finally the question is uh
we want to hold the Gateway of uh South
comfortably with us with a good majority
uh to reach at that we need to make
various kinds of analysis taking the
incumbency Factor anti-income portion
performance use of the karyakartas
because the Grassroots level
functionaries for us who will carry the
message to the people and uh make them
come to us and that has been our case
from the last uh 75 years so to reach
that they have taken the opinion of the
bakari karta level also who are a choice
of three who should be the candidate
from those areas and maybe they also
because they have enough time they are
also double checking the whole process
whether we need to get some more data
from the candidates for some constances
not for all constituencies so it could
be a comprehensive list which will come
out
today tomorrow and I wouldn't like to
speculate on who would contest from
there and things like that which is uh
which which is the output of the data
Bank what we have and data what we have
created uh as a whole on that we will
take a final decision and I'm very sure
that it could be a very positive
decision towards meaning an absolute
majority for BJP in Karnataka so um you
know lots of talk has also been taking
place with regards to BS sun and his
entry in two um you know Karnataka
politics lots of speculations are also
being made that he might in fact be
given
um you know a very crucial ticket going
forward
um what is where does the Bhatia Party
stand on this
so far as
through this this time Mr edurappa has
said that he is stepping on he's not
contesting from shikaripur and which has
been meaning from last uh say since 80s
uh it's a question of uh decision at the
highest level uh to accommodate Mr
vijendra from that constituency and they
seem to be I mean it looks like an
almost a natural choice between the two
because fast is moving out and the
vijendra is also active in politics
since 2000 uh it's like seven period I
think it is that I mean and he's the
vice president of the party Karnataka
BJP so in all probability he would
like this but this will be a final
decision whether they want him to fight
a big week of Congress we don't know
okay that portion will open so they will
take a call and I think by I think we
need to wait for another 24 hours to
know what exactly is there in the mind
of that
we're also being joined by the executive
director of the ITV executive editor
pardon me of the ITV Network Mr alok
Mehta thank you so much Mr Mehta for
speaking with us sir
um what do you make of the fact that the
Bhatia janta party is all set to release
its list what should be their priorities
right now you know like chapter Castro
is also mentioning um lingaya it's very
strong whole somewhere to the Bhatia
janta party should probably be focusing
what are the focus areas search the BJP
um needs to think about right now
rightly said that at last minute the
finishing touch or the list they are
trying to do it and that's why they
clean image the problem is
the major issue about the corruption
charges against those who are in the
power or maybe two mlas or a few
ministers that's why in a very
ruthlessly they will clean uh those
people and that's why even yesterday I
think prime minister himself I just
discussed with CPR leaders
because you know they want a clean image
or the future and at least to show the
people that we want a clean and
administrative or Young Generation and
woman power what I feel that's why they
work what shinaji also mentioned because
the BJP and rsas normally they work for
long term it's not today they are
preparing list they must be preparing
since last one year or maybe earlier
also just review every time they had the
meeting with the RSS and BJP because you
know though normally in this kind of
Elections RSS people also support and in
the opposition side you see that's why
they are very careful
Indira Gandhi
after Rajiv Gandhi there is no
groundwork for the in the congress party
that's why this is the advantage of the
BJP even after the said it all they were
they want to just change the rotation
type of thing that okay today is the BJP
then next year there will be a congress
party maybe they will also keep in mind
that what alliance they can have
afterwards people will still have that's
why Kumar Swami interview with our JP
also mentioned that everybody wanted a
position with us so afterwards after the
elections one is BJP and Congress both
contacted uh Kumar swamiji it means
Kumar Swami also keep his door open our
window open I should call it not the
door at least at present so BJP is
keeping all the options and trying to
win over and depending on the Prime
Minister Modi as I said Burma is also
his image is personally good but even
then they need a support because the
inside the cast combination and they
also want to prove what they did in up
and other states they know that's
combination which we keep in mind we
give full respect those stability and
they much and all but even then we want
we were going above all this
Hinduism when he went to church also the
Prime Minister therefore yesterday uh
for uh and then for mosque also so they
are trying to win over every community
and showing that our schemes benefited
every Community that's why this is the
agenda of the BJP and uh maybe some
infighting always happen in any major
parties when I remember in Mrs Gandhi
days the whole after midnight we used to
get the last list and when sometimes you
see surprise last minute but in a new
list comes very interesting I think the
same thing yeah very interesting um you
know you've just talked about the
congress party
or concluding remarks I actually want to
rope in Mr nagaraj yadav a congress
spokesperson who's also joining us on
the broadcast now sir we've spoken a lot
about the Bhatia janta parties list of
candidates set to be released uh
tomorrow from what sources are telling
us but so the question as far as the
Congress is concerned also revolves
around the former Chief Minister Sidra
Maya whether or not he's going to be
given a seat from Kolar we've been given
to understand that there's a big
question mark there also where do we
stand so as far as you know Sidra Maya's
seat is concerned as far as you know his
contesting from Kolar is concerned when
can we have you know some sort of
confirmation on that
see one thing you should understand
ma'am they're all all this time we were
talking about BJP this is the first time
the Congress has announced his list to
first place to English well in advance
before the nomination dates could be on
and BJP is yet to play sending the
people for their survey means to
understand where they stand the people
of Karnataka have decided to defeat the
communal forces today they know for 40
sarkar is not performed anything not
kept up their promises 600 promises were
made in Karnataka and they're Manifesto
in 2018 they have not kept to prevent 10
percent of their promises and you have
seen Central uh Central Karnataka the
davangere area and all that when Mom
murdered was caught with eighth grade
rupees in his house the entire Santa
Karnataka was the best thing of BJP in
2018 not Karnataka you've seen that
delay lingard base was there and that
was the Western of BJP today there is a
huge problem between the deputy chief
minister electron Saudi and Ramesh
jerkovia today there is huge division of
are not happy because the demand was to
ask for more than 16 percent of
reservation which was not given to them
only two percent was given by taking
away from Muslims these are all things
were the reservations whether it's
development whether it is the matter of
working governance completely utterly
failed by the BJP government today that
having said that the BJP and the doors
of South India Gate of South India for
BJP has been getting close they are
worried about it so that they're doing
the exercises in such a way homework in
such a way they want to fight back with
Congress which is not possible and which
will not happen and minor said Europa
contesting in the in the field of uh
assembly elections it will definitely be
negative to the BJP and the way they
treated
community in Karnataka is completely not
acceptable to the link Community today
and coming back to the Congress
candidates has given the entire matter
of candidates candidature to the high
command High command can decide because
we already decide about two list of
candidates 162 107 decided to the matter
of whether it is
whether it's Bangalore anywhere wherever
I come and ask him to contest he is
ready to contest but as on today if his
name is been announced in varuna and he
is going to be a candidate in Verona and
we are we definitely know
together together and gone and he has
given the best of the candidates
available with us and we'll definitely
fight the terminal forces and the pseudo
secular forces called JDS in Karnataka
and we will get minimum 140 seats in
Karnataka State okay all right Mr Sheena
could you like to respond to that sir
the Congress of course you know this is
just moving in a completely different
direction but a very quick response from
you and then um you know we talk about
the next big story emerging from
Karnataka yeah my friend has been
putting forth a lot of arguments from
this side and uh I don't we don't
approve of all that the 40 has not been
improved and it is we know that it
doesn't
can you please finish can you please
finish and then we'll you see basically
uh we never you see the question is I
did not get into this portion of
argument because we were talking about
election today see we have a double
engine activity and we have done a lot
of activities in the state and he cannot
say it is devoid of development a lot of
development has occurred even with our
government it's only a question of
perceptional problem what these people
have created at some particular Point
without any base to prove that it has
happened it is only a perception that 40
talk and other things are not a
perception it is not a true fact so the
on the perception they want to fight an
election which is not going to be an
easy election for them and I am very
confident that our deliverables have
reached the lowest
segment and they understand that Modi
has delivered the state government has
delivered and we are very confident that
we will get a excellent support from the
people to get our absolute majority

MV0sADSNDow,PM Modi At Sacred Heart Cathedral On Easter | Historic Church Visit By Indian PM | NewsX,PM Modi At Sacred Heart Cathedral On Easter | Historic Church Visit By Indian PM | NewsX To Subscribe our YouTube channel ...,2023-04-09T16:05:52Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MV0sADSNDow/hqdefault.jpg,"it is a
pretty historically significant because
this is the first time to the best of
our knowledge that a sitting prime
minister
has visited
at a public ceremony a church this has
never happened before it's an excellent
thing that's happening what you're
watching shorts on your screens that
ladies and gentlemen is the Sacred Heart
cathedral in New Delhi we've been
talking about it lots of people on on
the broadcast with us I still have Savio
with us on the broadcast I believe
Professor Madame nalapath is joining us
as well alok Mehta is going to be
joining us very shortly as well when
we're trying to get more people
hopefully and my reporter from this
church up very very shortly I already
have reported the BJP headquarters where
also the Prime Minister should be able
to visit uh after this after this church
service is over so let me get back to
Savvy on the thought that we were
discussing right before I took a break
now Savio for people watching the
broadcast Savio joined the joined the
BJP he has contested from a constituency
in Goa in which the majority population
is christian ah
Savio there are been a lot of
apprehensions misapprehensions about the
bhartiya janta party in the past I am
sure you've come up with them people
would have raised them with you that why
have you joined the BJP why do you think
the BJP uh can you know service even the
Christian Community because we have a
you know religious fault lines in
politics uh
how is the perception of the bjb change
for you let's start with you why did you
join the BJP
well I actually joined the BJP Prime and
it was after late uh defense minister
the chief minister
manohar parikar and having watched him
haven't interacted with him I realized
that beyond the Hindu majority tag that
BJP normally carried a weighted self Mr
parikar was a man of extreme Integrity
he had a vision and he was working
towards a better Goa and a better India
and that was very inspirational so my
first understanding of BJP itself other
than reading the books of of Dean
dayalupate and nanaji Deshmukh and every
you know learning about them I think the
real inspiration came from Mr Manor
Parker
I realized that you know he was such an
open open book in in his interactions in
his relationships with people so there
was never a divide in his in his
approach to to certain aspects of of
governance or or friendship with
different people he was
the leader he was a BJP leader and he
looked at the Hindus the Christians the
Muslims everybody in the same uh
wavelength which was why in 2012 the
people of Goa gave him a thumping
majority
never before did you see constituencies
of which were predominantly Christian
dominated constituency which is the
salsit region in in gork actually come
out and support Mr Marvel Parker and
they did that because he was able to
break through to them through an
intellectual reasoning you see the
Christian Community per se
they are not to interfering the
community number one the car the the
allegations of conversions that happened
this was not the entire Christian
Community this is a section of people
okay okay so I have to ask you the
political question on this because there
is a lot of symbolism in this there is
no doubt about it okay and that's you
know you can argue the symbolism both
ways but there is symbolism in this
there's always a first time and the
first time has been done by Narendra
Modi like I said we've seen him visiting
uh you know the Artis and the temples
we've seen him visiting the gurdwaras uh
and now we're going to see him visited a
church for the first time now
for you know literally your friends and
neighbors Savio will they look at it
this cynically that this is some sort of
tokenism for the cameras
or you know will they actually perceive
this as as a positive symbol well I can
tell you to tell you about 70 of the
people will not look at it physically 30
of the people will look at this but then
that's the that's the choice people have
right for us what's the most important
aspect the most important aspect is that
you have a prime minister who's
inclusive this tag that you have BJP
Hindu majority party I think that's a
little cliche right now because what you
have is the prime minister who's
thinking India
you which is what I said my my leaning
this is the BJP happy because of Mr
manual tarika okay
form a stronger supporting family
okay I was if many many people don't
know I was a part of the Congress for a
very short time and I realized that this
is not the nationalism Spirit my family
brought me up
okay I know I I I I can I can I can you
know it is almost worryingly predict
what the political discourse on this
later in the evening and tomorrow is
going to be I'm sure you know and it you
know it's it's very predictable nice but
it's going to be oh you know this is all
you know all all symbolism uh he's doing
it because you know he's eyeing some
water Bank in Kerala or you know some
somewhere else uh and he would never
visit a a Masjid that the way he would
visit a church or why is he not gone to
Masjid instead that's what they're going
to say uh on the other side you know
then the brick pads are going to happen
and then the people of the BJP will be
saying okay we don't know what religion
Sonia Gandhi is this that this is what
political brick bats comes down to now
I'm not I'm a TV journalist I had to
accept that political big bads are part
of my life also I have to cover them you
know savior Rodriguez is also runs the
newspaper so we have to accept it but
there's a chance sometimes to rise above
that so I'm going to make an appeal for
people watching this broadcast just to
not miss that chance let's let's try to
rise above that for just a minute which
is why I've been talking about this
church talk let's talk about Easter
Sunday it's it's relevance why this is a
historic visit why this is good for the
country and and and the community at
large so let me get a Manchu but on this
before I come to my colleague himanshu
just a quick quick thought on this
because
the you know we you know what the
cynical argument is going to be
at this point of time okay uh you know
nine years into uh being being prime
minister
why do this now why why not go last year
you know why not go two years ago five
years ago why not do it as Chief
president of Gujarat why why now
no no why why now is not the question
why not now
see one must ask that because now when
you see the word equations changing
people looking at India in a different
manner you have to give a certain
message to the word also
see opposition here yes they have been
creeping as you said you know there's
going to be so much of political
backlash and what you can call it
whatever you want to call it you call it
that's going to happen because of our
politicians are basically you know
active and reactives that's all they do
they don't think rationally at times
see if you are viewers might do it
politicians will not
and that is the message that is why you
know this is the message you know in a
day a prime minister of a country he
goes to a tiger Resort and then to a
church also
gives a very very subtle message
it's a message of we have arrived and
you better look at it
you look at us in a very very
straightforward manner
now you know all those days are gone
when 1999 some U.S journalists or some
NRI in India will call him Hindu
nationalist party the days are gone
see as the time moves you have to
understand one thing people have to
evolve and those who evolve succeed
those who don't evolve are perished okay
okay so there's an evolutionary process
and that conversation is going to happen
in this country and it's going to happen
across the world because again yeah it's
it it's not a visit to the on a ad hoc
occasion it's on a significant occasion
which is Easter Sunday yes it's not that
he decided to just pop in for for no
reason there's a there is a special
ceremony that's happening
okay okay okay let me just put out I
think we have got from uh father Francis
swaminathan who is as I just mentioned
the the parish priest there he has said
this and I'm quoting from an agency PM
Narendra Modi is coming to our church
today and we are excited about it I
think this is the first time that prime
minister is coming to a church
uh so this is the information that has
been put out by the parish priest whose
names I've just read out to you all in
total okay so a whole bunch of people
are joining us on the broadcast let me
go first to my reporter mahima kataria
who right now is uh at the BJP
headquarters where the prime minister is
also scheduled to visit uh Ajit my
colleague is joining us now uh from the
Sacred Heart Katrina going to Ajit in
just a second mayama first over to you
so we are expecting him to go in the
next half an hour or so
well absolutely uh Richard the tentative
time that is given in the itinerary is
somewhere around 5 30 because prime
minister then have to leave for the BJP
headquarters because directly from the
church he's going to be here at the
headquarters where we people are and
like you correctly pointed out about the
priest that is of the very particular
church that prime minister is going to
visit today and he clearly stated that
prime minister is living on the agenda
all the principles
so it is also very important definitely
uh like you could actually pointed out
there is going to be a political slot
Fest uh when it comes to the community
but also there is Karnataka elections
there is the Outreach to the community
there is there are people who are
joining BJP we cannot deny deny the fact
that AKA Anthony's uh Anthony has also
joined BJP uh so there's a lot of long
way when it comes to uh Conquering the
Southern India so prime minister
somewhere down the line I was also
focusing on that but today it's a very
special occasion and prime minister yeah
also met one of the you know the chief
uh the chiefs no I would
okay my mother stay with me I'm told uh
uh a lobo Naga is joining us uh content
creator who hails from the northeast of
India Mr Naga thanks very much for
taking out your time just I just want
your first thoughts we'll be getting the
visuals very shortly uh it's uh it's a
notable thing I know you you sat in the
conversation you know what the cynical
argument is going to very shortly be but
are you happy that to celebrate East
Easter Sunday Narendra Modi will be at
the Sacred Heart Cathedral in Delhi
hi uh good evening first of all thank
you so much and yes why not why not it's
it's a it's a celebration day for the
Christians around the world and we are
so happy the Prime Minister forget about
politics I'm not a politician so I don't
know anything about that but then all I
know is as a Christian we talk about
love and we are so happy that prime
minister is coming to the church and we
believe that this will set an example to
all the other uh you know friends from
other feet also you know uh to to you
know it's a very good example for me and
I believe that uh uh it's God's
intervention and God is going to bless
our prime minister okay okay you know
you have nothing to do with politics uh
you know yeah so so uh so as you are
observing this just as a as as a
layperson uh do you see this cynically
that this is some sort of symbolism
tokenism uh you know or or are you
actually happy that this is happening I
am actually happy I mean they might have
their own reasons for coming it might be
political gimmicks whatever but then as
a Christian I am so happy you know
coming and celebrating with us and then
we we are sure that this is going to be
a blessing to a lot of people yeah
okay I was just mentioning uh to uh when
we began this broadcast that I this
church is of course place where I've
visited several times and uh the first
time I went to the Sacred Heart
Cathedral uh was with a Muslim friend of
mine uh the two of us were in in in in
Connaught place and we uh we we were
walking down and we walked into the
Katrina and saw it for the first time
and of course I've been there uh several
several times after that including for
midnight mass which is it which is an
experience it's just it's an experience
uh it's not one of the biggest
cathedrals in the world uh it's the
biggest one in Delhi uh to the best of
my knowledge I've lived here all my life
and I I'm pretty sure this is the
biggest one Delhi there are other
churches in Delhi but this is the
biggest one and I was just pointing out
uh if I can just quickly get my
colleagues to get my my touchpad back
here
okay so this is where the church is
ladies and gentlemen uh I know I'm being
a bit cliched in this but sometimes the
cliched story needs to be etcetera so
the roundabout in the middle of your
screen that's called Golda Khanna okay
is the central post office the GPU okay
uh immediately to the east of it is the
Bangla sahib sarovar so that's the
Bangla sahib
gurudwara which is the grandest Gurdwara
in the national capital and immediately
to the north of it is the grandest
church
in the national capital and of course to
the west of the churches selling Saint
Columbus school to the east of the
church is the convent of Jesus and Mary
uh uh I'm pretty sure uh uh somebody
will correct me if I'm wrong I think I
think I think Shahrukh Khan is I think
from Saint Columbus's School uh so there
you have one of the biggest Muslim stars
in this country went to a a Christian
College here I'm going to confirm that
just once that's what I remember okay so
this is it tells a lot about the
synchronicity uh syncretity of this of
the city which
we take a lot of pleasure to sit on
television and Bash actually uh
Delhi is a beautiful place from where I
live in Delhi uh I can I hear uh within
I would say 500 meters there is a mosque
there is a Gurdwara and there is a
mandir so I I get to hear at home
everything I get to hear the Azan I get
to hear the the bells in the temple
every day and and we just grew up like
that let me quickly uh try to get my
colleague I'm still waiting for Ajit
Ajit can you hear us joining us on
broadcast he's at the golden outside the
Sacred Heart Cathedral in New Delhi Ajit
show us around what's expected
foreign
security reason but can you just show us
around the church and obviously there's
heavy security there for obvious reasons
again
foreign
I don't know how close to the gate of
the church you can get but you head in
the opposite direction I'm coming back
to you in exactly two minutes so that we
can actually see the church live and of
course we're waiting for the Easter
ceremony there 5 30 is the approximate
time so now I'm going to quickly get
Savio back in before I can imagine but
back into this conversation we can free
you will come back after after this over
for when the PM's heading to the BJP
headquarters will be let's free maima uh
I'm gonna get Savio back in okay Savio
so I'm going to ask you the the larger
picture question while we wait for Ajit
to get closer to the church
now
you know you in in your under your
journalistic hat in your journalistic
after okay
have taken on some crucial issues that
the larger Church in India faces okay ah
crucial issues regarding abuse crucial
issues regarding the internal workings
of the church and oftentimes when
somebody is trying to investigate or you
know move for reform or tell the stories
of people who've been oppressed it gets
confused into an attack on on the
religion an attack on the institution so
these problems do happen so it is
important that when we are looking at
issues that the Christian Community
faces here they are not seen from a
religious Avatar they're not seen from a
defensive mindset how do these these
kind of interactions like we are about
to see today help in that
see a largely most most people in the
Christian Community whether there are
atrocities happening within the church
or whether there are crimes happening
within the church like the crimes of
sexual abuse that has happened within
the church or the abuse of Miners and
nuns it is I mean the community that's
raised the issue up if you look at the
case of Bishop where the nuns that
raised the issue the supporting uh
strength for the nuns were the Christian
Community itself so there are
conscientious citizens in the Christian
Community that just that believe that it
is necessary to uphold the precepts and
the teachings of Jesus Christ now
sometimes there are some people who
within Russian institution which are
some priests some Bishops that strain
and that strain brings a bad name to the
entire Community brings a bad name to
the entire institution and that needs to
be called out and there are people
within the Christian Community that
calls it out how does the church look at
it I believe and I have seen Pope
Francis taking very very strong steps
towards sexual abuse by trees to a
strong steps in Corruptions related to
Catholic priests around the world so
there is an attempting weight yeah in
fact in fact just I think yesterday he's
even welcomed lgbtq members and he's
spoken about uh about about some very
difficult to speak about issues for a
for for for a pope including sexual
relations uh so that that has happened
this past 24 hours so there is there is
there is a learning there is a there is
a transformation there's a Reformation
that's happening within the Catholic
Church itself because you're trying to
see the larger interest is always people
you have to understand what
and that's how
it can evolve so even the teachings of
Christ while the uh the the order of it
and the importance of it Remains the
Same it needs to be adapted and adopted
to situations that are there okay okay
what is the situation in India right now
uh savior to the best of your knowledge
and I know we've just we've just you
know plucked this out of thin air
because honestly ladies and gentlemen
this has come as a surprise uh nobody
was planning for this we just found out
an hour ago that this was going to take
place so what's the situation in in
India for people watching this broadcast
Savio uh you know so there is a there's
a Catholic Community there is a
Protestant Community uh you know there
are many other alliterations of of the
Christian faith that are also active in
this country how does that play out
which is the largest
see the largest population in this
country right now are the Roman
Catholics and then you have to protest
and then you have ways of the
denominations that follow the
non-catholic uh belief system but I mean
believe me sister you know
the most important thing to do now is
people even from the Christian Community
are looking at Prime Minister Narendra
Modi as a leader of India the so-called
tag attached to BJP the RSS sometimes
does not even a hamper modi's uh you
know the image Modi has because a lot of
Christian people want development they
want better life okay so aside from the
cynicism which we know is going to come
our way there's no running away from
that you know when you when when a high
profile person visits a a high profile
phase but in your native state Goa how's
it going to how is this visit going to
go down in an hour's time
I think many people are going to
appreciate it they're going to respect
it
as to the right body but I mean many
people I'm talking almost 70 75 of the
people in Goa okay will appreciate what
Prime Minister Modi is doing so let me
let me ask the completely exact opposite
question to uh to himanshu but of course
will there be another set of people who
actually might be upset
that ok what is this what is the reason
for doing all of this why all these
Church visitor visits why do we have to
be apologetic about you know making
Outreach to the minorities uh you know
so many atrocities have been done on
Hindus of course uh by by uh you can
argue that the British were Christians
you can have that argument will there
some be some people uh within the party
itself uh who are going to be unhappy
about this
no it's not going to be that there are
going to be a minuscule few now in
2023-24 since they know how the party is
evolving but uh if I'll get you very
very very very very interesting episode
when Modi was chief minister here rather
why was chief minister here and we had
some trouble in dance
about the so-called conversions
it's an old issue after 10 12 years it's
again racking up again you know by this
one visit that time Narendra Bhai was
the chief minister here
and the approach he took was
he just said one sentence
personally he said
see it means a lot you know on a on a
personal belief when I see
A party's president
by going by a chopper to a remote
Village in dark
that's on one side and on the other side
a chief minister clearly says
what does it mean
see what I'm trying to tell you is
the perception has always been wrong
from the beginning
but as you know the person as you know
the party as you know the man
has evolved
words well well I'm I'm not a cynic okay
by the nature of my job I have to be
look at people but I can tell you that
on on the on the straight up front of
this
generally news happens when something
has gone wrong okay right somebody some
incident has taken place some Clash has
taken place some killing has taken place
some Riot has taken place and then
becomes new so then you draw an
assumption that you know the Interfaith
relations are very bad everything is
chaotic because that's all that gets
covered so today we have an opportunity
to discuss the opposite now the reason
this is important is because we do not
want
persecution complexes in this country
because if you want to raise a serious
conversation let's say conversion is a
serious conversation it's not a black
and white issue it's a gray issue when
it comes to uh sexual abuse is what's
happened by the by the nuns in the
church which is a very very con very
difficult conversation
so an assumption is being made or a
convenient assumption is being made that
we can just
pigeonhole this as an attack on
Christianity as an attack on on the
Christian faith and not deal with the
issue on the merits of the issue so we
are having a different kind of
conversation and opportunity I mean I 15
years I've been doing this I've never
had the opportunity to discuss the
Sacred Heart Cathedral a place where
I've been to several times in this
length to discuss this architecture to
discuss his history I don't think father
Francis has has had will will or has or
will see these many TV cameras that are
about to show up at his door for Easter
for you know Easter Sunday
let me quickly hop across now to the
church itself now it's close to the gate
shows around
foreign foreign
on the broadcast as well I take a very
short break ladies and gentlemen within
one minute we are back and we continue
our live coverage on the other side stay
with us
[Music]
first about your journey you know you've
been a Convent educated girl uh who got
married into a political family politics
I don't think you'd ever thought to my
buddy okay I will become a Neta or
Mantra
so how did you feel about it let you
into a secret prayer the basis of me
marrying my husband was
like my father said it was an arranged
marriage he says
if the boy never comes into into
politics that two years later he would
become an MP in a couple of years later
Sobo died so I say it's all Destiny
nothing's in your own hands and forget
about ever thinking I hated politics
like a typical young Delhi I I think now
there are a lot more aware than what we
were there's a lot that you can do and
my aim was always to uplift women in
fact I started nanicha which was an NGO
to uplift women take one is to you know
marry into a political family second is
to be a politician yourself and will be
in Punjab how are you taken as a woman
in a way a woman coming there set the
bar for other women to follow as well
which is why I feel that a lot more
women need to come out but what is uh
you know the now we are seeing at least
the opposition is coming together
whatever the issue is do you see this
Unity lasting till 24 what is the road
ahead if someone came with domestic
violence or someone who was raped they
say when we go to the police station the
guy tells us
go back go back home so who should we go
to always when I told my dad in law that
at least there should be women there at
night who can she go to she can't go to
those drunk policemen in the police
station and tell her problem because
this is what they say to her
[Music]
okay welcome back we're gonna State go
across to the Sacred Heart Cathedral in
New Delhi where we're expecting Prime
Minister Modi to attend a special
service
on Easter Sunday it's it's the is the
oldest church in Delhi to my memory it's
100 years old or near 100 years old 95
years old and is definitely the largest
church in Delhi this is right next to
the central heart uh of Connaught place
next to the gurudwara bangla's Bangla
Baba kadak Sigma next to the Grand post
office Central post office my colleague
Ajit srivastav is there at the gates of
the church Ajit uh you know you were
showing us around please go ahead what
what's happening there now
foreign
uh and I and I know for the next 24
hours I've done this for a long time
you've been you've been reporting for a
long time
so this is going to happen right so we
accept that this is going to happen and
the ugliness of this is going to happen
ah and that's how democracy functions
these things happen but I want to try to
take on the larger picture we make an
effort here on news X just to uplift the
conversation rather than take the
conversation to the gutter okay so let's
upload the conversation alok Mehta who's
been doing journalism since before I was
born is joining us on the broadcast I
look better I didn't know this it just
it just come as a revelation
uh to think about it that no sitting
Indian Prime Minister has ever been to a
church
uh unusual
because only news X covered this kind of
serious discussion and I feel it show it
proved that what the rate Modi was
telling even in Gujarat and later on in
the uh in the Prime Minister always he
said that we feel and we respect every
religion but sometimes because his image
was from RSS and all people think that
because many go to kedarnath then people
say okay he's going for a vote if you go
to Varanasi they say oh he's going by
vote you know if he believe it is some
but here I would like to mention one
more interesting thing Dr Manmohan Singh
used to go to Gurdwara nobody talked
about it why he's going for a boat and
is he going to get some vote in Punjab
but not himself but for the Punjab
Congress was there so whatever but I
don't think because I following since
last almost 50 years and that's why I'm
telling you you are really right that no
other prime minister I remember but I
don't remember about the nehru's but I
remember but interestingly one point I
would like to mention here I can't tell
the exact year because it must be
don't remember the exact year but you
see Sonia Gandhi used to go churches and
because I was a intern so we used to
carry stories but somebody go to an
archive and one can find it because at
the time it's a chance on the Christmas
or something like that no it's not
necessary but I remember earlier the
family used to go to church but then
they said okay we are going to ganga
even with all regards
he was talking that known she become
fully and she believed in it I can
understand she must be all doing the all
rituals in Hinduism but why do you want
to keep secret about you if you believe
in a church you are born in a from a
family who believed in a Christianity
and your name was also there so if you
somebody go for your church you go to uh
Gurdwara
here also you have to go to an archive
even in some foreign visit uh in some
Gulf countries uh prime minister
Narendra Modi also went to uh and
recently a few uh two months back I
think Mohan Bhagavad ji also went into
this so as a mother's eye if you have
something a very auspicious and you feel
that one should go and somebody invite
here the father invited Prime Minister
Modi and he said okay if I have a time I
can come so why why we always correct as
journalist I feel sometime bad that we
always talk about the world
[Music]
that's why I feel is good at least give
a message that in India we are really
secular maybe we believe in a Hinduism
but even then we respect our religion
against terrorism and the name of the
religion
okay I'm just asking my team to pull out
those photographs as well we'll just put
them on your screen so yes so uh a look
math is right uh it uh 2018 was the
first time that Narendra Modi as sitting
prime minister uh this is the Borah
community in Indore he visited the
mosque he's of course been to the Sheikh
zayath mosque in Abu Dhabi that's why I
know for sure that's happened very
recently
we're going to get some information uh
why are we showing this this is me uh
just giving a good quick literation my
PCR group obviously is not being able to
follow what we're doing so I'm going to
request them to just follow up meanwhile
with us uh sumitra goenka joining us
uh and uh major Mohammed Alisha on the
broadcast with us on as well let me let
me come to you uh so it is Easter Sunday
I was just telling our viewers okay and
it's a it's a
sometimes we get lost and you know uh
car aren't able to communicate anecdotal
stories well which actually represent
our lives so the first time I went to
the Sacred Heart Cathedral I was still
in school and my school was nearby it's
not senka numbers but it's nearby
and I was I remember I had to go to San
Columbus to put some posters uh for a
debate we were organizing in school and
I was with a Muslim friend of mine who's
who's a daughter of a very well-known
politician and on the way out of Saint
Columbus we we stopped by to this church
so a Hindu and a Muslim went to a church
as as students right across the road
from this church of course is the is the
Bangla sahib Gurdwara where I've been
several times as well uh
you know we always find these topics of
conversation when there's some problem
going going wrong but actually on day to
day life these are all very normal
things a major Shah
absolutely
these are very very normal things and uh
I would like to recite one thing when I
was posted in the Northeast in nagaland
100 person Christian Street 100 I mean
being a Naga Mitchell means you're a
Christian and I used to go to mizoram
very often mizoram again 100 Christian
so it's a very normal thing I mean
people and what is
surprising is the revolution that no
prime minister has ever been to a church
I will have to ask this to myself 10
times are you sure when you spoke on
this I said no it can't be I'm I'm
aghast I'll tell you one thing of of a
video a photograph had got viral last
year when a lieutenant general Pandey
who was GOC 15 Co in Sri Lanka at that
time he was he was there in a mosque in
for a Namaz along with Sikh officers so
I mean it is a seek Hindu a Muslim every
single officer I think it's called
what's it called it's called the MMG
right if I'm not mistaken that's right
in fact so it's a very normal thing to
do and I am surprised why no no I will
give an answer to people who you are
talking about who would say it's because
election the coming of awards I would
say two things firstly it's a good sign
that he's gone there he's gone to a
church but well you can get into uh why
not a moss why not this why not that but
they're very fat is bad say that he's
going to church should be happy for that
should see it very very positively
secondly yeah amen come on people if I
got a doctor hey you would be curing
patience
you would be in the body or you would be
safeguarding our Frontiers
you would be doing a show similarly
so what firstly it may not be for
elections secondly to put everything in
back in perspective even if people say
it is for words
so what I remember when he was cleaning
a beach and uh they were photographs of
it I've been working fun of it that oh
he's cleaning a [ __ ] symbolic so so you
gotta expect the minister for God's sake
to go around being garbage if that
example of his if it's a photo shoot
people went on it fine I if I'm saying
even before the photo shoot as long as
it Bears good results okay okay let me
let me let me get Gotham Mukherjee into
this conversation I mean it's not just
any random day it is Easter Sunday okay
uh so it is or it is a it's a day of
significance uh so uh uh this is going
to be a a private ceremony for security
reasons obviously so there's not going
to be no congregation in the church at
that point of time but the parish
priests are going to be there and
there's going to be an opportunity to
plant a tree ah after the ceremony is
going to be it's going to be a quick
visit maybe about half an hour 45
minutes
is it is it uh to be looked at cynically
gothamukurji can you can you is is this
what is going to become coming coming
down to the next 24 hours
well I think it's part of the Outreach
that the RSS and the BJP are doing of
late
because much of their constituency is
now becoming not just Hindus but also
Christians the whole of the Northeast
which is now either part of the BJP or
Allied to the BJP is largely Christian
with the exception of Assam
and so a gesture like this which is
again it's interesting it's he's gone to
a Catholic church and Easter is
celebrated with greater forever amongst
Catholics rather than Protestants the
north is known for being Anglican
formerly Anglican and now the Indian
Church version of it Church of Northern
India but he went to a Catholic church
so it is aimed partially I would imagine
at Goa partially at the Northeast which
do have both Protestants and and
Catholics in in quite a proportion yeah
but but then there are you know there
are shivides and and vaishnavoids and
Ling you know lingayats and and vocaliga
so you know there are denominations
amongst all Faith uh in in Christianity
you can go on and they are you know
Jehovah's Witnesses and you know you can
go on in terms of denominations
the big denominations of course are what
gothamukher is referred to but
gothamukherjee no so so but but then the
obvious question remains no should we be
looking at it as there is always a first
time okay this is the first time we are
being told and I can't think of any
other occasion the Lok Mehta can't think
any like I said he's been doing this
before I was born of any occasion with a
sitting prime minister has gone to a
church should this be there's always a
first time great or should it be oh this
is tokenism it achieves nothing because
you know what's going to happen when the
opposition sings their teeth into this
well let us remember he went to visit
the pope and stayed with him for over an
hour it was a very cordial visit
recently when the pope was unwell Pope
Francis uh Narendra Modi sent her
message for uh for him to get better
which he has and he has conducted the
okay okay I'm sorry to interrupt you
prime minister is about to reach my
colleague there is there on the ground
Ajit go ahead
foreign
[Music]
will enter
there are plenty of side gates to the
sacred architecture I don't really know
this place so much so well I spend a lot
of time
playing and organizing things in Saint
Columbus school when I was in in my in
my younger days let me quickly get
sumitra going kind to this conversation
uh sumitra goenka now
this is something that plays out not
only in this country it is it is Easter
it is Easter Sunday
is it an opportunity for us to look at
the positivity of this visit because you
know what's going to happen once the
opposition thinks it's written to this
they are going to call it you know uh an
eye wash a Joomla tokenism and all sorts
of other nasty things
good evening rishab I think uh we should
not read too much into this because
Prime Minister Modi has always been
inclusive he has uh whatever policies he
has implemented all the policies have
been inclusive one of your families was
saying that this is a part of some
outreach program viruses and all I
completely do not agree with this
because see he is the citizen citizens
prime minister he has been uh you know
meeting people from different sections
of the society different religions
different caste recently uh he gave each
other uh for uh ajmer Sharif he has
visited the Pope Francis uh earlier like
you mentioned he has visited several
mosques so I think we are reading little
too much into this the opposition
naturally there are comments coming from
opposition for any and everything
including right now the latest
controversy about you know raising the
controversy about his qualification so
there can be anything moment he clicks a
photograph on a Jungle Safari there are
people who are commenting about it so I
think we should not look into uh those
people who have this constant habit of
you know criticizing the Prime Minister
on anything and everything that is
happening in the country or each and
every position if he goes into a gufa
and prays there then they will say okay
see how he is doing this if he clicks a
picture people will say okay see how
what clothes he's wearing so I think the
kind of criticism or the kind of
scrutiny that the prime minister is
under is really heavy and I don't think
it makes any difference to the people of
India people are seeing this as a great
gesture and I am really happy that first
time ever in in the history of India a
prime minister is going to visit a
church and uh this speaks a lot that you
know BJP is inclusive the nation uh is
together and we celebrate all religions
uh equally in this uh country and you
know there is complete Harmony but
that's the life that you and I lead okay
but let's not like I said this is always
the first time uh so I just want to show
an image here on your screens as both
sumitra I think and other guests were
mentioning this as well let's put our
pad on our screens here this was if I'm
not mistaken October of 2021 so about a
year and a half ago can we get the image
yeah so this is this is the meeting of
the Prime Minister with with Pope
Francis you can see uh Ambassador
jayashankar in the in in in the in the
backdraw back background and of course
this is uh the Prime Minister receiving
uh some books uh as a gift from Pope
Francis which he's putting you know a
politically uh putting uh to his head in
respect he's also uh on you can see that
there's a private audience that was
granted by the pope so there was 16
months ago okay there are plenty of
other images we've been pointing out uh
you know aloki was pointing out that
when he visited the Borah Community
mosque I know he's visited then mosque
in Indore I know for sure he's visited
the Abu Dhabi Sheikh Zayed mosque he's
visited others as well uh and it's up to
us to understand whether this is a
cynical approach or or otherwise so let
me quickly I interrupted before this let
me come back to him before I get in I
think Yoshi also joining us on broadcast
uh Gotham Mukherjee now
in the larger scheme of things as a
prime minister
the symbolism is important you can say
that I believe this you know I'm I
believe in real SEC tourism uh but
sometimes you have to wear it on your
sleeves uh is this a good thing a more
representative thing of what India that
you and I recognize looks like because
this would not be absurd this is what
our day-to-day life would be if you
happen to go for midnight mass uh with a
few friends for the experience of it not
for the religiosity of it it would not
be an an obtuse or an unusual thing to
do
well I I definitely think it is a fairly
recent broadening uh a sort of uh overt
broadening of the BJP RSS perspectives
uh there is a Outreach to asmanda
Muslims there is in an effort to blunt
the constant criticism coming
particularly from abroad that India is a
communal
country under this Administration as so
to take care of all this I I do think
there is a special effort being made to
reach out to minorities of all kinds as
well as to make
statements which are inclusive uh this
may be as sumitra pointed out something
that the BJP feels in their hearts but
it isn't apparent to most people and
most people do regard it as a Hindu
nationalist party uh with uh you know
blessed in their hearts if you like for
the minority okay so my question are
there still people in the BJP who still
regard themselves as the Hindu
nationalist party you will be saying
what's the reason for all of this stuff
yeah yeah you you've you've got a bit of
of that but you know uh doing something
like this is a policy decision and it
has been
um you know coming out more and more of
late whether it is aimed as the
elections or it is aimed at correcting
the perspective on the BJP RSS uh is
difficult to say okay as I was pointing
out I think several people have
mentioned this already the head of the
Syrian Christian Church which is the
denomination which you're seeing on your
screens uh which qualifies as the oldest
church that was uh built in India
also met the Prime Minister just a few
days ago and extended an invite for him
to visit this church in Kerala as well
let me quickly get in uh before I get in
Lakshmi Joshi also
my question to you is is going to be the
same
how do we then grab these opportunities
to represent what actually India
represents like I said you know
my first visit to this church was as a
as a a a young student in college with a
Muslim friend right across the road is
uh
Gurdwara Bangla says I'm sure you've
been there several times I've been there
several times these are normal this is
how we live normally right but we are
somehow perceived that we are always at
War amongst religions which you and I
know is not the truth
yeah you are very right because you know
the name people were working with some
extent with Gautam ji because I was
covering in Northeast what result uh got
or the BJP God just because the other
people working since the last 30 40
years there it's not today and most of
the Christian women just now our uh Mr
Shah also mentioned about the nagaland
so I remember when I visited in 9283 in
the Northeast area and then I know at
the time who were working in the RSS and
even the Congress regime was there but
he was there so I feel that there are
there are there were people who were
working behind the curtain maybe because
openly they accept is okay we believe in
hindustava and everybody we won't be
feeling but here they are both of these
right they abroad earlier also when
prime minister visited Italy or other
countries people were aware that he is
very open but you see in President Obama
or uh
if they take oath in a with Bible nobody
say okay why they are they are religious
in earlier years a few decades back the
church used to dominate in American
politics a lot so now if you feed the
teju because the majority is Hindu and
Narendra Modi is trying to convince all
our divide and especially the kalistani
moment or something like that if what is
happening in Canada
the people should know that India is a
real from heart as a Hinduism also you
say like to accept everybody
there's a problem here no there's a
problem here and let me get rajalakshmi
Joshi into this you know
uh
there is an Arthurian concept okay and
the reason I am referring it to because
you have the the Arthurian Knights of
the Round Table okay and with habitat
the chivalric codes then you have the
logic of good governance because they
have a very fair and just system so
there's an Arthurian concept of logic as
you're watching live shots of the
goldakhana uh where the church is in
Delhi on your screens so this Arthurian
concept
about good governance about chivalry
about good behavior is widely accepted
the story of King Arthur and the rights
of the round table are you know I mean
our children read these stories
but as soon as I say Rama rajya which is
supposed to be exactly the same thing
okay about good governance about
inclusivity we say no no this is a Hindu
fundamentalism so there is a
miscommunication a misrepresentation
that does happen now how do we fix this
how do we take opportunities like this
to fix that misrepresentation
a very good afternoon Richard
uh hit the nail on the head this is
exactly what even I was thinking that uh
you know all these Concepts which have
been borrowed or these kind of terms
that have been borrowed from uh Western
Civilization uh they actually uh you
know people think that they are some
kind of a modern or the they have I
don't know why they are easily
acceptable so that uh that kind of a
mindset has been purposely put into us
you know that has been put into us by
years of education uh hundreds of years
of education that the British have you
know they have created these uh this
term called as College children that is
what they have done so all those terms
that are that have come from the British
system that have come from the European
system we somehow tend to think that
they are superior and that they are
something that we need to be following
instead of we telling the world that
this is the so the conceptive concept of
ramraja which meant an a system of ideal
government and we take it to the whole
world instead of that our own people
keep bashing it down they keep saying
that this is something outdated and this
is something that is going to be biased
etc etc which is very unfair okay so how
do we yes finish your thought finish
your thought yeah
yeah like alok mataji was talking about
the Northeast you must have seen in the
recent uh election result you know a
completely Christian majority state has
voted for BJP it means that BJP is not
their only bandrant to the Hindus or you
know or that any Christians they feel
that it is anti-christian or anything of
that sort the kind of ideology is India
first you must have seen what Modi has
been talking about right from the start
he speaks about India first his idea of
secularism is India first which means
that you know in the earlier time the in
the earlier government they used to talk
about how the minorities need to be
given more important I I don't see
anything wrong okay okay okay yeah yeah
so yeah so when more more importance and
that line between uh real secularism in
appeasement it's a debate that's
continuing you're watching live shots on
your screen ladies and gentlemen uh we
have been told that the PM's cavalcade
is on its route and you can see the
advanced cars that are arriving there
the PM of course is just just landed in
early he was has spent the past near 48
Hours inaugurating
projects all over the south of the
country he was at a tiger Century just
before this announcing this Global big
cat Alliance Forum uh I think that's the
PM's cavalcade arriving at Ajit my
colleague is there on the ground Ajit
take it away
foreign foreign
what should we take away from this about
what has just happened how do I absorb
this
I think it will be a good good will for
the government also because in the party
at government because we need a peace in
cooperation with all communities and
that that's why the Prime Minister
Narendra Modi hard-working person and
all the time he was traveling in Tamil
Nadu also there are Christians in Andhra
Pradesh you remember yesterday for
yesterday Kiran Reddy also joined and at
present the Andhra chief minister is a
Christian from Christian Community so
indirectly it gives a confidence to the
people that this prime minister is not
for any one community and the majority
is there certainly he respect with every
religion and that's why this beating it
will go a long way for party for
government and for the society because
you know as you are very rightly said in
the school days we used to go and those
schools
and never felt about it in different
religion same thing prime minister
Narendra Modi wanted to give a message
what I feel so
what is this then the so
the the Pope Francis has respectful
meetings with Narendra Modi uh Muhammad
bin Salman has respectful meeting
Narendra Modi the sheikhs of the
Emirates Abu Dhabi Dubai they have
respectful meetings in Narendra Modi uh
but in this country we are told that
there is going you know this it's
anti-minority Muslim genocide you know
Christians are in trouble
how is the how is that happen because
now if you look at the larger scheme of
things the paragons of the faith the
heads of these Faith have all now met
Narendra Modi and at least uh you know
the the the people whom we all recognize
have an access to our prime minister
who's very respectfully I was showing a
photograph receiving gifts from Pope
Francis giving him a hug
uh why have we created for ourselves
this mindset that something is wrong in
India when actually nothing is wrong and
until we make make a crisis
Frankly Speaking this is a political uh
I think the level everybody tried to do
it that's why I was mentioning the
common people also they used to go to
when Sonia Gandhi used to go to prayag
and then foreign
they are trying to convince because
maybe the perception by the political
and some extent sorry to say by old
Community the media also we create a
hived at all because the election is
doing this because if you don't go in
the the background I don't meet the top
person then you always feel that there
is because there are paretic people in
every party I am not talking about in
BJP they are not everybody is very open
or they are even you will find some
people may be criticizing why he's going
to use the mask
because I had a very I had a very very
interesting conversation it was live on
television so this will be on record or
I'm sure you can find
so you know it wasn't a question I asked
is a story that she wanted to tell as
well
she said look uh you know I was made
minority affairs minister
and the immediate objection was that how
can somebody from the Hindu majority
become minority affairs minister
she said because you look at uh
the post from a religious point of view
you don't look at the post from the
point of view of what needs to get done
what needed to get done was that for the
first time
uh about four and a half thousand Muslim
women could go and visit the Hajj
unaccompanied with a male relative which
has never happened before
that there is now transparency in the
Hajj waiting list of the process has
been automated you know favoritism and
you know somebody cutting the line
doesn't work because everybody gets an
automated number on when they when their
turn comes in this is for the uh they
brought down the prices of the Hajj
travel they've removed the subsidy but
everything has become cheaper because
more competition is coming so the
Monopoly has gone so why can't we look
at the work that is being done rather
than the religion of the person who's
getting that done is there some sort of
thing that rest should resonate in that
oh well uh about that rishabh that is I
feel the society will not change unless
and until we change our own selves the
change has to begin from within and uh I
totally conquer with the points of Mr
alokmata especially I'm thinking he gave
a very very balanced uh very very
neutral and a very rational view I mean
uh so most certainly if you have to look
at the performance at the delivery of
what a person can deliver I mean not
just the person's religion is so and so
and so and so and I totally concur with
uh
as well and uh sumitraji also I think
she was fine I mean but there are
certain points which I maybe I I wasn't
very clear with what Smith conveyed like
for example she said she spoke about the
prime minister's qualification I don't
think it's got anything to do with his
qualification at all you need a
qualification to enter a church in the
first place secondly it's not about
history of RSS because the people I
think it's a very normal thing for
anyone to do today I can go to a church
I can
of course an Outreach is is to be made
and of course uh uh major Shah's father
is part of that process and there's no
reason we should be shy away from saying
that that's an important process Nadeem
has been part of it right he's been part
of it others are also taking the effort
uh because there is a lot of
misapprehension and miscommunication
some people who don't want to be
convinced and are and want to tell you
that it's been guys it's also almost 10
years of Narendra Modi now okay
for 10 years we've been told there'll be
Muslim genocide that the minorities will
be wiped out the minorities are thriving
in this country there are a lot more
needs to be done let's not assume that
things India has stopped all sorted
tomorrow we can wrap up because job done
obviously things need to get done but I
am telling you that I have grown up in
Delhi
which is a very syncretic culture it is
as if not more syncretic than any New
York and London where also I've lived in
London as well and I can tell you it is
perfectly normal for a person in Delhi
to visit a church to go to a Gurdwara to
go to Jama Masjid to go to the
nizamuddin darga listen listen to the
Sufi music and stop outside to have a
kebab It's Perfectly Normal it's routine
but we are told that these places are
all broken down and Hindus and Muslims
are at war with each other
within 500 meters of my house there is a
there is a there is a mosque I hear the
Azan there is a Gurdwara and there is a
temple
across the road from where this
Churchill which is the largest church in
Delhi is the largest Gurdwara in Delhi
this is perfectly this is how we grew up
and I have not
in until the Delhi riots happened during
Trump's visit I had not seen a riot in
the national capital
since I don't know the mandrel days okay
which is early 90s
so for 20 plus almost 30 years you know
a single riot in the capital but we are
told that Hindus and Muslims this
country are tearing each other apart
they're not tearing each other apart and
that's a conversation that needs needs
to be had let me quickly get in sumitra
goenka into this conversation back in we
are waiting now for the prime minister
to exit uh after this uh meeting that
he's having it's not per se a high
profile meeting he's not meeting you
know one of the you know archbishops or
Catholic Bishops or Cardinals and there
are cardinals in India he is just going
to the local church to meet the parish
priest
on Easter Sunday uh if they wanted they
could have you know organized something
and said okay we will only meet Cardinal
this is as normal as it would it would
get if you were a Christian today on
Easter Sunday
I just wanted to say a couple of things
from uh whatever I was hearing others
speak so first thing is about Northeast
I would like to come first on that point
that uh people are saying that you know
in Northeast uh Christians have voted
for BJP but actually you have to know
that there has been a silent amount of
work which is happening for 35 to 40
years one program is like a student's
exchange of Interstate living I have
been a part of this program because I
have got uh several guests coming from
Northeast who come and stay in my house
you know for many years they come home
they spend a day here they eat what we
give them they understand our culture
and again students from Mumbai Delhi and
other parts of India they go to
Northeast and understand this and this
program has been going on for 35 40
years so this kind of uh relationship
which is built many people are not aware
that this is a silent effort which has
been going on it is not that because
Prime Minister Modi has met the pope or
he is going to a church that the
Christians are voting for him I think
that bondage has been builded over time
and we have to realize this second thing
is uh if you if you talk about symbolism
there are so many people who are doing
symbolism we know readers who wear a
dhoti sometimes and where to uh and go
to visit temples you know that is
symbolism it is not like somebody who
has a long relationship uh modiji has
been going to gurudwara he has uh you
know halted his speech when the Azan was
going on I remember those things he has
visited the dowdy poras in Mumbai
recently earlier he has met them so
these are some very natural and normal
things it it always doesn't have to be a
symbolism and okay like you rightly said
we all are in Delhi we know that this is
a church which is visited by many even
modiji going for a small event like this
so it is not not something which we have
to you know read that okay this is an
outrage because it is only because of
the elections or something like you said
there are always elections in the
country somewhere the other the next
election is in Karnataka there's always
an election somewhere or the other in
the country okay so everything you do
can be seen from that lens
and it's okay in a democracy you should
see everything from whatever lens you
want to I have no objection to that I
have a fundamental objection
to us creating a global globalized
perception that India is at war with
India that the two Nation theories still
exists and we can't live in peace we are
not a syncretic culture when that is an
abject lie I live here and if I say it's
an abject lie I am bhakt I'm godi or if
I'll if I'm telling you I've been to
this church I'm a Hindu I've been for
midnight mass in this church it was not
a big deal I've been to the same church
with Muslim friends we walked in just to
see a service out of curiosity and
experience you know the lovely choirs
that happened on on midnight mass it's
an experience uh and this is normal for
me and if I say this is normal for me
and India is doing fine no we are not
doing some Muslim genocide then we are
supposed to be godi bhakt that's not the
case so this is where the irritation
hits and unfortunately
a lot of people
in in the opposition especially the
Congress need to understand that that's
why it's irritating if you just sing
what it is okay
uh and you've been told no no no you're
saying this because you know you are you
are all sold out and bribed and brow
beaten or bullied or whatever none of
that is true we can call us pay this
paid because you can see in front of you
what is the truth and what is simply uh
not the truth let me quickly get a look
back into this conversation now
as we now walk a walk on okay and it's
not an easy thing to break okay this
perception which has been created since
I don't know since pre the division of
Bengal by kurzen in 1905. that we are a
country that cannot live in peace with
itself I am going to quote you know Mark
tally I don't know whether whether it
was a book India in slow motion or is
one of his one of his other bookmark
tally ladies and gentlemen uh was the
was the BBC correspondent in New Delhi
and he's he's chosen to live on here and
he said it's not the surprise that there
are riots in in this country they're
surprises there are such few riots in
this country given the sheer scale of
the populations that are involved you
know any lump and element anywhere can
do something but it never happens come
on I mean until the Trump visit riots
happened uh you and I haven't seen riots
in Delhi in 30 years
years
[Music]
there are more people killed in those
rights so he this is the problem in our
country because we don't when they want
to just uh think in our own after
Independence and you are very right
since last 10 years also even in Bihar
recently some incident happened
otherwise you see in Bihar up
Maharashtra
madhya Pradesh renor was a very
sensitive uh City I belong to those
areas and that's why I'm feeling that
nowadays in last 10 years the perception
because the projection by the I am not
blaming some foreign either in Western
countries are the Chinese or Russia
because there are some forces who just
criticize because otherwise the gulf
countries how many Islamic countries
investing in India it proves money from
Jammu Kashmir to Kerala Kerala to
Maharashtra and the number of people
they were invested in Gujarat also they
are invested so much money so it proves
that after Narendra Modi came in power
and that's why perception about the
Christianity about the Muslim or the
sick because if you want to rule in
India I think prime minister Narendra
Modi was from down to earth and that's
why he knows that for every Community
but but because he doesn't want to say
okay I forget about Hinduism I don't
believe I just want to do secularism
what the Congress used to do so
certainly he's a different person he's
not a congress person in the same way
okay just just stay with me uh Kennedy K
president of the Christian Church
Council in Kochi joining us on on the
broadcast uh Easter greetings to you sir
and if nothing else has given us an
opportunity today to have an extended
conversation on Easter Sunday now I I
know that there is a a progressive
visualization of this I know you can
have a cynical visualization of this
where do you stand Kennedy
uh see
um Let me let me share a happiness with
you actually uh this is a totally
relevant day for with this issue
whatever you're talking now uh today uh
our Global Chief I mean the zero Malabar
Church Global Chief uh major Archbishop
George Island Jerry he was he was he has
expressed uh his opinions in uh in a
Indian experts today and it's it's just
been it's came out and I am in one of
the China studio now we are you know
most of the channels you know in the
evening they are debating in the same
kind of issues actually uh we we are you
know how to wholeheartedly we are
welcoming uh the uh Modis and bjp's
approach in this issue and uh I know in
Kerala you know it's actually I would
say A revolution is going to come here
we are going to expect we are we are
just sort of keenly watching what is
going to happen because they already
they've never done you know same like
this and this time they are moving
social they have joined with our pregame
places they are sharing our prayers and
they are really moving fast and BJP is
going to make something in Canada we
don't know but like I said the cynics
will you know we'll see this as you know
just as as symbolism okay do you see
this as symbolism or do you really feel
that look we are a country in which we
have Hindus we have Christians we are
Muslims and to the large part of it we
get along just fine there are other
issues that we need to take on and and
the BJP might be something in the past
but today it is misrepresented as some
Hindu fundamentalist party
let me let me uh tell you some truths
actually as far as concerned about the
Christian they have not at all a
religious Fanatics they are they're not
at all running after this religious you
know atrocities and all kind of things
when we come to the National policy when
we come to discuss the national
development nationalism and all those
agencies these uh you know some some
people are here they are running after
the conflict theory you know they're
they're basically that party made up of
the conflict theory that the friction
their need always the problems and you
know everywhere they are expecting some
kind of conflicts those people are
opposing these moves actually what they
have they have done a wonderful job they
have already started to talk with the
Muslim organizations and here in Kerala
they are talking with the Christian
leaders and they are on the right path
and we are wholeheartedly we are
supporting and we expect something
miracle in this next election it's a
good move we congratulate the total
leadership of the BJP especi
I mean this is important right sometimes
you have to say it some you know like I
said sometimes you have to do it
sometimes you have to be seen doing it
as well is is this important are these
kind of visits important at least it
gives people a a talking point which
they can you know touch and feel I was
just showing our viewers uh you know uh
re-showing the viewers rather uh when
Prime Minister Modi met with Pope
Francis that was you know in 2021 so we
get an opportunity to express these and
you know does that help the messaging at
least
sure of course of course it's going to
make difference this time it will it
will it will it will work it will work
that's why I'm saying I'm I know we're
just we're awaiting the result uh you
know to come out in the next Parliament
election so there there was you know
they never you know got even a single
seat in Carolina but this time uh you
know the expert some kind of miracle in
Kerala and they are moving in that way
they you know they've got a Unity some
kind of good colors uh good okay good
feelings are coming out okay that's an
interesting perspective coming uh yeah
sure sure from Kennedy that's and of
course he's in Kochi right now ah in in
Kerala itself let me quickly get in ah
major Shah into this conversation major
Shah I know
that
black and white conversations are a
disservice where we think that one is or
the other is always much grayer is
always a lot more complex and
complicated as it as it well should be
but you and I can predict what is going
to happen next right this is going to be
trashed as some sort of cynical
symbolism some Joomla some belated
Enterprise to hide real intent all of
these pettiness is going to come out do
you genuinely feel that the public
appetite for this is now for the
pettiness and the cynicism is now slowly
dying
for his craftsmanship
and he had been hoping for the reward
for the last 10 years he applied five
times and when after 2014 he says he
stopped applying completely to he felt
that the BJP government would not do
anything for Muslims so there's no point
he had given up hope he got the award
and after that there was the opposition
came about and saying he was tutored by
BJP to say this
I mean isn't it disgraceful isn't it
yourself goal by the opposition isn't it
ridiculous that you are doubting The
credibility of an artist of a Craftsman
who is exceptional not outstanding
neither excellent he's not good he's
exceptional he's better than the best in
his job and then you say after he is
being rewarded if you are unstoppable no
if you are like really good at a job no
one can be dealership no one can stop
you no one even if you want even if you
wish to stop someone who is unbeatable
who's Unstoppable you cannot so that's
why Allama iqbals who wrote is
so that is why it holds good and now
with the very fact that you said earlier
also Outreach is always good so now the
perception the Brahm that the my
minority that oh anti-christian
anti-muslim at least that's broken it
sends a message loud and clear to the
entire country to the entire world that
now listen minorities have nothing to
fear just about a month back my father
also had gone to Mumbai where Prime
Minister Modi had inaugurated
institution educational institutions
acknowledged the presence of my father
as well over in that meeting so now tell
me one thing rishabh is as you said
earlier being rational being moderate
being very pragmatic and if someone
points a finger at you someone accuses
that oh you are taking that side no
nothing anyone sides you don't have to
deal with sides because we don't owe
anything to anyone we don't owe any
religions to any political party or to
any political ideology what is what is
that okay okay now
have we then
reach that stage
where you can have the pragmatic problem
solving conversations rather than
immediately build up the fences of
religion I'll give you the examples you
you say interlock is a problem no no
this is anti-muslim you say madrasa
reform needs to be done no no that's
anti-muslim you will say board reform no
no that's anti-muslim uh you eventually
you will go and say okay the conversion
issue we need to be looked at and these
conversion laws no no that's anti-anti
Christian so we get into this
Zone immediately if we say look in
mathura there was an issue regarding the
the Krishna Temple oh but no no no no no
no okay uh it's uh it's uh it it's it's
a polarization polarization plot are we
able to are we reaching the spot where
we can have this conversation without
immediately going oh my God this is
anti-sum minority or the other
well I I as far as the diminished and
further diminishing opposition goes the
answer is no because they will just be
flush down the toilet and
Ajit
a problem foreign
Channel
okay yeah so what do you feel about it
very good on this yesterday it was very
kind of him to pay a visit to the
Christian Community and I think it is
for the first time that the prime
minister of India visited the Christians
on the day of Easter so what do you feel
is the first time PM Modi will reassure
in Catholic Church in Delhi so do you
think it is a right time to talk to PM
okay we are not afraid we are not any
such kind of persons
no why should we be afraid it was a very
welcoming initiative that he came to our
community
we did not request this it was on his
own uh initiative so do you request to
uh to visit for the some other Church
like Kerala and some other places
we have not invited like that okay yeah
so first time you will meet them what do
you discuss between the U and PM Modi
nothing
nothing when he came to greatest on
yesterday it was not a moment of
discussing discussion no
he just came and wished us a happy
Easter happy Easter Bunny no nothing
else nothing else is
um
what do you feel
foreign
foreign
I'll let you carry on with these
conversations you carry on okay let me
quickly open this up I still have all my
guests with me I'd interrupted uh Gotham
Mukherjee just a good chance to speak to
the to the parish priesthood and other
members of the congregation I could
support at least 40 50 people there over
inside who had a a brief greeting 25
minute conversation there with the prime
minister they said that he came wished
us happy Easter and has has given us a
good wishes and and a good message and
we are very happy to have received him
now your thoughts on what's just
happened now that you've heard from
inside sir
yes as I was saying that no you are
going to see criticism from the hardcore
opposition
uh who will call this a Joomla a photo
opportunity a attempt at PR publicity
Etc however
at PJP and the RSS is
and actions are being implemented along
with the rhetoric now this if it
convinces more and more people then uh
we do get the concept of one India a new
India in actual terms it may not happen
overnight it may not even happen but uh
you know 2024 but if this policy is
constantly used okay then it will reduce
these sort of binary which has been the
kind of basis on which the politics has
been conducted okay all right let's
quickly hear across from it from from
our panel that you've heard from the
parish priests and the other members of
the congregation who were there inside
your thoughts
I think this is a good gesture actress
because this was not the part of the any
political message or something that's
why uh father said that he just gave us
uh the happy Easter so I think this is
kind of a gesture and when we go we
never talk about the politics what you
are doing or what will do for society it
give a message to all the community that
okay prime minister himself went there
to greet all the community he said
symbolic and he's going to the church
but it give a wrong right message and
that's why I feel that it was a very
good question but he did and maybe for
coming elections because what he is
doing for the long term uh for the
society you see even after five years
ten years other people like yesterday Mr
engineer also joined the academy so
these kind of people also joining the
party and the minority people all people
were nominated in the up legislature so
I think this kind of gesture always give
the confidence to the people the
conclusion created by the congress party
and others that BJP is Untouchable
because they are very much against the
minorities so I think this kind of
occasions either but even if you
remember in Monkey but also he mentioned
about Easter it's not for today it's not
for the Karnataka or for the Kerala
elections but I think Whenever there is
a occasion he just mentioned also when
you talk about any speech when you go to
outside and I think this is the right
time because in the this time people are
very creating most of the confusion by
Rahul Gandhi himself because he said no
no this is a terminal we have to fight
with RSS and BJP because the baby we are
fighting the 50 years back with the
congress party but even in the garden BJ
people were also fighting but then then
also over the Congress people also
worked with them
example for this a number of people the
Congress people were used to hide get
help from the RSS
foreign double so this kind of because
they wanted RSS always wanted they
should convince the people that we are
not biased with any other community and
the political any government they should
not feel the currency is working hard
but here one point is there for the
conversion or some foreign forces work
in the name of the religion either from
church or from other community and then
they say okay just create some confusion
or create some terrorism that's why the
government okay this government is very
against this kind of any okay any
extremism in any particular okay let me
say same image I think we're just seeing
shots of the premium he's now arrived
the BJP headquarters uh just your
thoughts that you've heard you've heard
the congregation inside mitasha
right uh I think it is I think the prime
minister is a great leader let's accept
it let's accept the fact and uh no one
can deny the fact that he connects with
the masses he connects with the classes
he connects with people and no one can
deny that it's not about being a pro
bjpo and tbjp pro Congress
anti-congratives what are the fact of
the fact one cannot deny it the very
fact okay they're very fact even if
people say that okay it's uh it is
symbolic or it's this I mean I'm saying
I don't know whether it is or is not I
can't comment on that but even if it is
so so as long as it is getting good
results as long as the country is moving
forward as long as the India has a
standing in the global community in the
global country that people overall they
are looking at India India Today India
can stand tall on its own feet India is
no more what it used to be earlier as a
fever at one point of time right agree
now that's the mid 17th century
thereafter we were looted by britishers
but now when we are regaining our lost
glory in every way possible you know
I'll conclude by saying just a few days
back I was in conversation I was
interviewing a former Service Chief and
he what he told me was something very
interesting he said that when I became
the chief I did not see that I belong to
so and so regiment okay I prompted the
entire yes and that's a point well made
you know Point well I was doing the same
thing we're doing a series on the real
Sikh Heroes of India saying exactly the
same thing okay we try to now doing
Hindu versus seek new concoction they've
come up with now in in Punjab how
horrible shots on your screens that's
the Prime Minister uh interacting with
uh uh the the the parish priests and the
members of the choir some of the nuns
the congregation uh uh there is having a
quick chat he's wish them happy Easter
inquired and I think you can see father
Francis right behind the camera person
says there and you can see the Prime
Minister here and the other Parish
Priests of course a decked up this is in
the apps uh you can see of which is the
Dome of the of the Sacred Heart
Cathedral uh in uh in New Delhi that was
the Prime Minister photographs which
have just come out this was from about
about yeah about 15 minutes ago I'll
just take the same thoughts from Raja
Lakshmi Joshi Joshi that you now that
we've heard people from inside who've
met the PM your quick quick thoughts
you know he there is no question about
uh his bride in his Hinduism and at the
same time he always believes in
I think that is a very easily visible in
all his schemes and all his policies and
the way he approaches them and he has
spoken the about uh getting rid of uh
reservation on the basis of religion and
instead you know it is always focused on
making sure that even every even the
last person in the line uh gives the
benefit of all the skin so that is uh
that is something that I think that
actually has made a lot of difference
okay so it has ensured that everybody is
in on no one the same page okay okay I I
don't know if himanshu but is still with
us Sandeep Chandra I think is with us
now that you've had a chance to hear
from people who met him the Prime
Minister inside what what do you what do
you make of this
you see
um thank you this is a very very
important question what I make of this
is that Mr Modi is not a reactive prime
minister he's not an active prime
minister he is a very proactive prime
minister countries blessed to have him
as a PM number one number two true
secularism is being only practiced and
it has been practiced by The bhakti
janta Party The Decade of 2004-2014 was
a decade of Lost Years today Mr Modi is
responsible for making making India or
International if not a regional
superpower he has sent out a message
that India belongs to everybody
everybody belongs to India irrespective
of caste Creed or color and this is
borne out by the fact that unlike pseudo
secular Prime Ministers of the congress
party Mr Modi is a truly secular person
he is the first sitting prime minister
to go on Easter to uh you know you you
think you you know that that almost
sounds strange and unusual but like I
said there's always a first time better
better late than never uh it almost
sounds unusual that in 80 years no prime
minister has ever visited a church let
alone on Easter not visited a church
period in office while in office uh
himanshu but now that we've heard so
from from the parish priests and the
members of the congregation that the
Prime Minister has met your thoughts sir
yeah my thoughts are very very simple
you know I might have so many things in
my heart but if I don't show it if I
don't express it somewhere people will
not know it
and that's what exactly is happening in
Indian politics
people have been casting aspersions on a
party
to be a communal which actually it is
not
now for that it is it the owner says of
that party to show
that they are not true they are secular
they are really total sense secular
party now what do what do they do
they have to show it by their actions
in a space of nine years we have not
seen anything
which will not call them a real secular
party
this is one of those things and as you
said I was surprised
that no other pm has gone to this
particular Church
yes I was surprised
is that so that
so that's mine but but you know when
they live in India with a Hindu majority
the easiness at which the other people
live also has to be shown and that is
generally shown the symbolism this types
of ads on the day of Easter or the time
of Christmas or whatever it is at the
time of week you know you will see that
[ __ ] purma
it's true that government has stopped if
there are parties
government doesn't do that but that
doesn't mean there will not be Shield
kumas
people will enjoy it it's the wasteful
expectation which has been stopped now
paying off over here during your step is
something you know which for the word to
see he does things you know she listens
to one thing listen one thing before I
stop Narendra Bhai is the person a very
attitude politicians at the politician
at that and everybody knows it now okay
he will not do anything
which is not uncalled okay
let's get a contrarian perspective uh
Professor shastri on the broadcast with
us also profession uh Happy Easter and
here we are sir uh the Prime Minister
just paid a paid paid an Easter visit uh
for about 25 minutes to this church
Sacred Heart country till you and I
would recognize it your first thoughts
[Music]
as a
and of course it is very important for a
leader like him to visit uh dharmonic
that is what the entire country needs
and I am very religion equal and
important and uh even though he
understands things about the Hinduism so
powerful but at the same time he
realizes that it's equal and he
exhibited and it is a welcome step for
the country there is no doubt about it
okay uh so you're seeing the visuals on
his twins that was the Prime Minister of
course who has sat through a choir there
was a full congregation that was present
in the church during this time and a
statue of uh
Jesus Christ has been gifted by the
parish priests
to the Prime Minister and so yes it was
indeed a full congregation it wasn't
just a private visit and that you've
seen that he sat through a choir
rendition on Easter and met with members
of of the of the parish and the
community and there you can see the
choir girls
singing as we were listening as the
Prime Minister was listening to that
okay so so let me let me just get
himanshu but
yeah back back into this conversation
okay uh himanshuji aware for from here
okay so uh do we need to see more
visualized
outreaches like this or you know or
is that honestly not really required
people get the message now
hey now people will have to get the
message you know
activities
this type of visuals will send the
message across
see there must be something here I'll
give you a very simple example of our
social life
some young boy falls into love with
falls in love with a young girl unless
he tells that or shows some expression
shows up by some expression how is she
going to know it
it's as simple as that
the social fabric turns into politics
it's a very simple political agent that
till now what we have been calling so
many things taboo
are not the doubles now today we are in
31st Century people are progressed
further people have gone apart and this
probably those who realize as I said you
know before also okay those who realize
that was potential and work accordingly
okay so sometimes you have to do things
and sometimes you have to be seen to do
things as well and that's that ends if
your heart is in the right place if your
effort is in the right place uh
sometimes you need to make that that
extra step should be visualize better
politician understand that Narendra Modi
for sure understands that uh but uh let
me just now just to hit the
hit that subtext of why we are having
this conversation
major Shah
it's been 10 years almost since Narendra
Modi became prime minister of this
country for 10 years both within India
and outside India we've been told that
democracy is dying
that India is in trouble Hardline
fundamentalism takeover is imminent
Muslim genocide is imminent all these
are nonsense but there are still those
who are feeding it how do we now more
actively counter this attack which we
are under because you and I well know
that not no such thing is taking place
uh rishab you are right but you know I
totally concur with the palace who spoke
earlier who said that whatever is there
in the heart it should be expressed one
should uh tell what is what you mean
because then what happens then there is
a communication error activities for
example coming from the Army background
that's why I'm giving the example of
Agni wheel is actually a very very good
scheme and my short service also myself
I joined to serve for five years only
but then there is a commit communication
they have a lot of apprehensions to
change people who are very skeptical
about it initially they were protests
they were what what not there was
Rampage there was vandalization there
was violence in the beginning but now
people have slowly begun to accept it
because they is communicate when you
communicate when you express people will
know what's there in your heart how it
is then what happens it only clears the
air people who want to spread rumors
about you people want to spend stories
about you that will not last for too
long they have been a lot of
communication gaps one has to admit that
and that must be rectified
the very fact that people can say
therefore democracy is dying in India
the minorities are in trouble the very
fact there's democracy in the country
the very fact that democracy is still
alive that is why people can't okay
there's a reality check no no now these
images hopefully will circulate not only
in India but also circulate across the
world
ah which would be the the right and
appropriate thing to do let me quickly
get uh Sandeep Chandra into this Sandeep
Chandra but like I said there is a
broken record okay
there are Indians part of this broken
record there are members of the
opposition part of this primarily I
would say of the Congress Party part of
this broken record
who are into this Feeding Frenzy for 10
years we've been told
that there is chaos
that this is you know the the tip of the
iceberg you don't know what's going to
happen to the minorities in India and
absolute hell will break Clues and
genocides will take place none of those
things have happened are happening or
are going to happen sir
is the broken record now
over is it is it is it is it time to
shut up now on these matters
very very
invalid powerful Point made by you you
what has happened is the record has been
set straight it is for everybody to see
and I'd like to expand the context and
like to tell you that India is the only
country on the planet which has got so
many religions languages people of
different cars speed and color existing
very peacefully together Mr Modi is
proved by his actions he leads from the
front he walks the talk and he has he
has it is for everybody to see it's like
a sky on a you know clear sunny day that
through secularism has been practiced by
the bhartiya janta party opposition is
just putting false charges they are a
bunch of headless chickens they don't
know where to hide today people of it's
the eye opener of people of Kerala Tamil
Nadu no but it's not just the opposition
here Mr Chandra you know there are there
are people who have you know their their
clothes in a Twist uh in you know in in
the U.S there are people in the labor
party in the UK within their and their
peers in the house of House of Lords who
are talking about oh my God oh my God
India is is India is a disaster
minorities are going to be massacred by
their Millions uh you know genocide
means by definition genocide means that
we will have to kill about three four
hundred million people in this country
to to uh to for genocide all of this is
utter sheer nonsense but this happens
all of the time
both within and without
is is that game over now sir
now what has happened is
that it is now this this genocide Bogies
all over it is for everybody to see that
Mr Modi has transcended from being a
politician to a world Statesman Mr when
Mr Modi talks the world listens and this
is truly a path breaking example you can
make out by the fact that so-called
pseudosecular party no prime minister of
the Congress ever visited a sitting
plans to ever visited a church so this
is for everybody to see that Mr Modi is
practicing
because and most important okay he is
one the hearts of people by this very
good guest okay okay maybe maybe some I
I can't say suggest that it is going to
be all and the answer is never black and
white alok Mehta is this then a step
forward in in winning sabka vishwas
because there are some people who will
never be convinced and there's you know
there's no point after a point trying to
convince them
yeah actually here I would like to
mention that the other leaders of the
BJP
hope and wish that they will also follow
the same type of tradition in their own
States like in madhya Pradesh or
Rajasthan or Maharashtra because
everywhere the Prime Minister message
was not only for those Community but
even the political and his own party are
allies also because during sometimes
there were some confusion and you know
even from the up people say he will
always only serve for the Hindus but
earlier also we have seen he was working
for the minorities he also have the
ability Minister but after the Prime
Minister this kind of President I think
this will give a long message for the
their own party people and the even the
people who just uh sometimes talk in a
very poetic way against uh even the old
uh sometime alleged everybody so I think
this is also a message for his own party
people he just LED for his own party
meeting also so I think this is not the
only political purpose for the other
parties are their position this is a
message for his own party they they
believe in Hinduism they go to temples
but they should also try to convince
those people who are from the other
communities and give countries and some
this kind of occasion either for Eid or
Christmas or the Easter or any other
occasion and mahavir jayanti people try
to do something but here this is the
right message from the prime minister of
India because first time you visited to
church okay that's why I say give a
message both and for his own party too
okay all right uh jivya shastri
almost 10 years now of Narendra Modi for
10 years we've been told longer during
the campaign before that so 2013 2023
we've been told that this inevitable
Hindu majoritarianism that there's going
to be a genocide that minorities are you
know they're finished in this country as
long as Narendra Modi is there and this
sabka saath is all just a political
slogan
has has opinion now changed now
is that why this reading it is not the
International Community reading
the kind of because I agree with
immediate what is that you know there
are leaders in the you the up and now
there are so many BJP leaders and RSS
leaders are clearly seeing every time
indoor asked him we are not interested
sorry
we are not
our Constitution doesn't say that
sorry we one should not there's no need
to call
even I am from Hindu Hindu major
organization I am also a general
secretary
this makes a massive disturbances
that's what I feel Narendra Modi has
felt
that is what he felt
and the message is loud and clear to the
oh no the message is important but Divya
shastri do you really think that that
that that Hindus are
are somehow bent on genocide that Hindus
are that if somebody says Hindu rashtra
thy by default means
minority should be afraid
take its own course of action as well as
the Constitution is concerned
a chief minister no need to say in the
assumpty standing in assembly
what is the meaning of it are we I as he
playing a role of Judiciary okay all
right so I have another question
you know there is a you know if you
I'm sure you've read about this I've
certainly read about it in school and we
were taught about you know
King Arthur and the Knights of the Round
Table okay that they were very nice
people we were taught about you know
Robin Hood very nice people who were
very chivalrous
had a judicious and just form of
government
and we were taught about these stories
knowing full well that all these were
the Knights Templar they were the people
descendants of those who fought the
Crusades very much Christian
but an Arthurian concept of governance
was considered as good governance and
nobody really had a problem with that we
all aspire to it yeah they sat in a
round table because they're all equal
group of peers very good well done but
here if we put the similar context of
ram rajya we are told it is
majoritarianism why
say what is International Community says
that is irrelevant that is not required
because if they say so many things they
say so many things to so many people as
per their convenience the world order
now Russian president wants a whole new
order as per the New Order only he wants
a negotiation so anybody said say end of
the day what is exactly you are
but I am very happy that prime minister
said this said this said everything
equal
he cleared every manner okay
he really did a good thing by visiting
this church today I'm really happy okay
all right I'm I'm short of time himanshu
but before we take a break sir uh the
Prime Minister very recently in fact in
in Parliament I think it was the uh end
of end of the budget discussions uh when
he pointed out and he said look when it
comes to the awas yojana uh the mudra
loans the building of the of the toilets
the building of the highways
that this is a real secularism
now it's not an easy concept to embrace
sir because
as politicians and you covered politics
for again longer than I I I've been
doing this provision sir
these are not easily emotive issues it's
much easier to get people angry and and
charged up about dharm and other kind of
issues
is real secularism is is the concept of
sabka vishwas do we now as Indians
understand these things better and as
Modi become what uh Mr Chandra just said
not just a politician anymore he's a
he's a Statesman of a different
different different level
yes I would say one thing see in 2002
Narendra Bhai was a state politician and
a chief minister 2014 he became a prime
minister that is his own statement he
had said it took me few years
foreign
words
and then he started his work
so what you are asking me today
a prime minister becoming a world
Statesman
will have certain qualities and that is
what he possesses so it should not be
seen unnatural for anyone that how is
that progression taking place
this is happening because he sits in you
know the top four
with the top four
top four respect him it's not he
respecting people
respect him okay so so that is why okay
so so canards and Bogies okay so let me
uh last word
when it comes to the frustrated cliched
canards and Bogies okay one of them was
that of course uh uh you know we can't
act up with Pakistan because you know
they have the nuclear bomb we can't
solve Kashmir
uh that we can't uh
do anything about ayodhya to 500 years
300 years controversy going on that we
will forever we be a developing country
because you know it's impossible to do
anything how will you build a highway
without riots and protests and you know
dharnas it's not it's not possible then
of course the biggest one of them all
that we are not even one country we are
two countries two Nation Theory which
has been subsisting are we seeing this
generation and with some leadership
credit to Narendra Modi but a lot of
credit to the people of this country are
we seeing this generation that will
break out of these lashes of the past
yeah you should be this was the change
for the society in last 10 years is a
miracle like a historical change in the
Indian Society Indian system Indian
economy because Liberation was there but
how we see the in aviation in nuclear
energy in solar energy in the
infrastructure so and for everybody
that's why prime minister people say why
he is speaking in London or in America
everywhere we go and talk about how much
uh bank accounts but you see when people
listen in the United States or even
including China if they get some message
at least that India is not what it was
in 62 so that's why now I very rightly
said that everybody the top four
countries are even I should say that the
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a real
most powerful Democratic prime minister
of the world because nobody is like in
the same in Democratic manner is working
since last 10 years and these are
popular in the buses and the same thing
even the other countries also they
respective a lot because of the Good
Will of the Indian Society because
Indian Society also cooperated then he
says okay
period you go away in the 24 hours you
are you are in the home for three months
and so on so people accepted just went
for thali bajao and everybody go for a
so this kind of uh gesture what prime
minister is doing and I think it's a
very good message for the future of
India okay so uh
we've had an opportunity to have a a
larger conversation over what was just a
25 minute visit and it should be routine
it should not be a big deal but it is
both isn't and is uh to visit the Sacred
Heart Cathedral in Delhi uh for Easter
Sunday and for people watching this
broadcast
a very happy Easter we've had a chance
to discuss it at Great length
and we will now have to look within okay
and take the proof of the pudding in the
eating take the evidence for what we see
and touch with our own eyes
and
a lot of people in this country
I have to say
we'll have to
let go
of the sheer animosity
the sheer absolute irrational illogical
approach
which with which they see current
affairs
there is no muslim genocide happening in
India Hindus and Muslims are not at each
other's throats anybody who lives in
Delhi knows that we are a very syncretic
City we move from one to the other I've
been to this church with Muslim friends
I've been to the Gurdwara across the
road It's Perfectly Normal for people to
do this it was normal 10 years ago it is
normal today it will be normal 10 years
from now
and that's what India represents
we have other challenges and we've taken
up too much of our energy too much of
our time has been wasted
first by the people who wanted to break
us divide us and fight and then by
ourselves
fool us once
shame on them fool us twice
well shame on us

that we have to have the ability
with a great sense of responsibility
purpose and gravitas
that sometimes what we wish
were to happen because it would be
convenient for us to happen
simply
is a ghost
it's not the truth
and it takes a maturity and an ability
perhaps
with a mindset of Truth and
Reconciliation the concept of satyagraha
that if you stay on the side of Truth
you will be able to make your point
more vociferously
perhaps you'll have to work harder
somebody very senior
asked me this a few days ago
that you sit on news X and you abjure
tamasha there's no screaming and
shouting and name calling
so how do you get ratings which is what
we are supposed to be right rating
hungry people
and my answer is I have to work twice as
hard
my team has to work twice as hard
we have to make an effort to be more on
point more engaging
to provide greater perspective because
yes if I start screaming and shouting on
the roadside a crowd will gather to
wonder why I'm screaming and shouting
but I do it every time
Cry Wolf
eventually the crowd will just
call me a maniac
I'll become a meme a joke
so yes sometimes you have to work twice
as hard
there is a duty that oppositions perform
in a democracy
and the duty is
that no matter what the government is
doing to run a fine tooth comb and take
out all sorts of issues
to keep government on its toes
and I respect the need
and it's the need
for the congress party of current day
modern day the Rahul Gandhi day of
Congress
looking back at what happened
how his father was maligned with buffers
how the previous government of Manmohan
Singh was maligned by 2G and Colgate and
and Corruption to to find a Cause
that is very similar so you're sitting
in a room and you're sitting with
advisors and looking at what are the
causes for the election campaign next
time around last time we took a profile
poof Rafael disappeared all the 36
planes have arrived and they're
currently performing an important duty
on the frontier with China
so now let's come in
something new
but in that process
we somehow get disconnected from reality
it's been four months since a foreign
quote-unquote Think Tank
with profit motive
came out and did a hit job on one of
India's biggest conglomerates ladies and
gentlemen it is important for us to
think of the antidote of socialism for
which you need to do the mudra loans the
toilet building the road building but we
also need large conglomerates why could
we go Gaga or Microsoft and Elon Musk
and Tesla and SpaceX but give Gully to
our own people
so all these guys the billionaires in
the U.S are all honest hard-working
Geniuses like Bill Gates but our guys
are all chores we have a great sense of
racism against ourselves which needs to
be chronically
abjured in the future it's been four
months
The Head of the State Bank of India has
said that for four months the adani
group of companies have been paying back
their loans just fine
in those four months
209 Billion Dollar Bank collapse of the
Silicon Valley Bank 59 billion dollar
collapse of the Credit Suisse in Europe
in between right before that there was
this Sam bankman freed and his and his
crypto Empire again a multi-billion
dollar collapse that took place wherever
the Hindenburg reports on this
nowhere
so Hindenburg and George Soros George
Soros who thought he could destroy the
British economy by by causing a run on
the pound George sorosu contributes 140
million dollars to the Democratic party
in just the midterm elections he feels
that he can teach us a democratic lesson
and we are supposed to say yes sir
well we don't and for the congress party
now to be seemingly coming across
as they listen to Hindenburg
they listen to Soros were still the
impression given that they connive with
these individuals and then sit in
Cambridge and lecture us is a disconnect
which is very damaging
and he made a very simple point to me he
said that when Mahatma Gandhi came to
Delhi whose house did he stay in in
birla's house no so was Mahatma Gandhi
corrupt not necessarily
said that this JPC demand is just
political posturing what was achieved in
the 2D JPC
and that's for the BJP also to
consciously say what was achieved
nothing
where is the 2G case now nowhere
so gosh sake what is going on in this
country let's open up this conversation
joining us on the broadcast I have
Sharad Kohli appreciate your time sir
let me also get in jeji bhattacharya
also joining us very shortly
Dr Kohli
it's been four months
since this all almost four months in
this Hindenburg report
while the companies under the adani
group are doing fine they're paying
their loans they have in fact prepaid
some of their loans they have repaid
whatever fund Revenue that they were
doing for this fpo
but there has been a loss in share all
the value there are millions of ordinary
people who had bought sheds in in adani
and 100 billion of dollars of that
shareholder value is gone real damage
has happened
and in between
there has been a actual bank collapse in
San Francisco there has been an actual
crypto Scandal a a stinging thing of one
of the oldest banks in Europe Credit
Suisse which has gone under
but we are still doing adani bashing
what what is disconnected Sarabi are we
living in an alternative reality what's
gone wrong
well rishabh uh you know stock markets
are a very vulnerable platform I mean I
must tell you and you know it's very
easy to swing stock markets and what
surprised me here was that you know
stocks coming down in stock markets
being raised by the opposition I'm I
don't come from the political fraternity
but I'm just giving it an overview
and when they found that talking too
much of stock markets talking too much
of LIC you know SBI giving loans LIC you
know investing in adani group when they
found that the the general public is not
going to be misled and they are not
going to understand I think the recent
hopping that we are hearing is and I'm
literally bored of that sentence
where is this 20 000 crore coming from I
mean where is this 20 000 this belongs
to so and so this belongs to so and so I
mean I mean at least come out with a
with a narrative which is easy to
comprehend which is easy to believe for
a moment Trisha let me even take a
situation
well let's say you know a lot of a lot
of businesses they may be resorting to
this is called round tripping you send
money from here it goes to Mauritius it
comes around probably it's called round
tripping under taxation laws or under
the transfer pricing laws or under the
money laundering laws whatever
now you know linking road tripping to
the ruling government without any basis
evidence I think it sounds absurd and
then on top of that when a Supreme Court
committee is formed which consists of
people with very very credible
background technically competent you
know a JPC is what JPC is a is a group
of parliamentarians who would have
anywhere taken help of technical experts
they could not have you know done
anything on their own because they don't
understand the technicalities here is a
group of people who understand like Mr
kamath you know they understand banking
they understand money movements they
understand stock markets so when people
like these are in the committee I fail
to understand
and the time given was time span was two
months if I'm not wrong so what I fail
to understand is that this whole
campaign this whole narrative could have
been postponed for at least two months
God say wait for the wait for the
findings of the Supreme Court committee
then you form an opinion now uh the
logic given is that the the committee is
is beyond you know the Nexus between the
government but you know but yeah but Dr
Coley come on it's none of us are naive
okay is is crony capitalism does it
happen it happens all over the world I
mean you just look at at the at the arm
twisting uh the Amazons of the world do
in deciding in which city in which state
in the U.S they'll put their
headquarters and what all uh tax reliefs
they want they want to pay no taxes the
biggest companies in the US are all held
offshore they don't pay a penny on on
billions of pounds of profit so all all
the offshore territories are run by the
by the Brits and then they say that we
have no you know we have no control over
them there all you know you know
semi-autonomous
I mean look at Hong Kong Singapore I
mean these guys
the city of London provides Bankers an
opportunity that as long as the
transactions are of offshore entities
they come under zero scrutiny nothing no
scrutiny no regulation is required as
long as not a it's an offshore
transaction so God knows what is going
on but the bottom line in this is let me
get Dr jages bhattacharya
now I understand you I'm sure you
understand also that there is a
political lead for making a case and
let's put that aside for a second
but in the course of that political lead
had we subsumed to it the last time
around we would not have had the refire
aircraft right now okay
let me even go to say that it was the
beaufort's gun the Swedish gun that
saved lives of our soldiers during
kargil because if he didn't have that
artillery police that could be carried
to those inclinations we would have been
in a whole lot of trouble so thank God
we have the refile aircraft because all
of them have not been delivered
and while we have to provide the mudra
loans and the toilets and all that the
Grassroots level we also need big
companies to be able to operate in this
country and why should we feel that only
Elon Musk
is honest and all of our people are
chores
yeah
so uh I think I'm just stealing my words
in that sense this is exactly the words
I've been using for over a decade that
um their business people are tycoons and
our business people are Crooks that's a
mindset that we have been operating with
uh that's clearly not acceptable uh I'm
not an expert in politics so I'll stay
out of politics but
um you know um the the Dharma of a uh of
an opposition leader obviously is to
find issues to take a bone with the
government
um as long as that does not compromise
on India's security or on India's
industry and its economics and therefore
the prosperity of the people uh those
are not fair Targets in my uh limit view
um coming to the issue of uh the the
whole Ruckus around the Hindenburg
report and adani
um it is up to the adani group to defend
themselves if they're strong enough if
they have the braces they will defend it
there's no need for the government to
step in unless there are many many jobs
in the line uh which might be hit we
haven't seen any jobs being in the line
and therefore we haven't seen the
government stepping in either uh there
should be least interference of the
government in um in the running of
Industries
and that's what the government has been
trying to do to stay to to move out of
uh business and only provide the
conducive environment for larger and
larger Capital to flow into India the
larger place to provide the mother
platform
I have to ask you this because our Focus
for the past several weeks and months
has once again been both internally
externally and and maybe George Soto
should not have tweeted out because I
think he gave the game away maybe you
shouldn't have put that tweet or maybe
you should have kept shot but he could
nothing couldn't resist himself or he
felt that he's such a you know such an
influencer that if he says it then the
rest of us will of course bend over
three times backwards
but we lost Focus that in the interim
period while Hindenburg was doing a
great investigation into adanis which
they were convinced on the base of their
hypotheses
nothing happened here everything's
running just fine there has been a stock
market valuation loss which is a very
real economic loss
but the companies are running fine the
SBI chairman says that their own
payments are fine some some in fact
prepayments of borrowing against the
shares have already been made is the
bank in Silicon Valley under their noses
is the one that collapsed it's Credit
Suisse that collapse is is sank bank
print freed and is crypto Scandal that
is that has staggered them
why did the Hindenburg guys not see
these coming
yeah no absolutely uh there were other
short sellers who did predict uh in Jan
that the Silicon Valley Bank is
collapsing but there was no Hindenburg
involved uh in fact the string of events
that you see uh without sounding
parochial uh have been um you know the
the Jewish Community involved because
even the journalists who first broke the
Hindenburg report uh was of the same
Community uh again as I said with the
underlining that not wanting to be a
parochial
um uh there is the question that you
raised uh begs to be answered let me
also put another question because what a
doubt about the
um about the scandals around
um military Imports the scandals somehow
have the tendency to come up only when
the procurement does not happen from
Russia America or Israel whereas 95
percent of our procurement if not larger
happens from these three countries the
moment you you move your aircraft
platform away from Russia uh and you
know you procure anything from Sweden or
France or Italy you name it you will
have a Scandal coming in okay and you
know okay so I can understand and and
and I I you know I I let's let's not
even try to go into in some sort of
community conversation into this at all
but we have to accept that there are
some forces out there okay
who have decided
that they will going to do a hit job on
India
okay they feel that they are fully
capable of manipulating India's markets
they feel that they are fully capable of
manipulating India's politics
and I would like to believe that this is
not true that the politicians here in
India don't actually feel that Cambridge
is a better spot because there the
people agree with you
because you are telling them what they
want to hear by in your own country the
people are disagreeing with you because
there's something fundamentally wrong
and broken let me get Ankit into this
conversation Ankit
in a very real sense
the JPC on 2G achieved absolutely
nothing
we are having no conversation and that's
very equally for the BJP to answer
so should we accept
that the demand for a JPC on the issue
of the Hindenburg report
is just for the sake of political
posturing the economic or policy or
legislative benefit on it would be
absolutely zero
uh I agree and disagree on this uh JPC
uh started on uh 2G because there was a
cad told about it that there is a scam
related to vivet and everything was done
without an auctioning process which was
just given first come first Services
which is against the natural principle
of giving national resources to private
parties and that is how the JPC in the
2G scams happened the government could
not recover any money because the scam
definitely happened and it has never
happened in any scam uh the money has
been recovered it has never happened in
history the second in this case there's
a third party which is saying something
and issued a report
do we have any conclusive evidence which
they have submitted to government of
India or any regulatory uh compliance
companies like sebi RBI or Ed or
something that adani has done something
wrong you will start something when
there is a criminal Administration which
needs to be done and privileged in
restriction doesn't have to happen that
I say to you you are a criminal that we
start the investigation
it has to be something something has
happened somewhere Hidden book said in
the entire stock market of adani Crash
that does not lead to any conclusion
that radhani has done something wrong
and the JPC has to start it JPC is just
a political phenomena to do it and okay
so let me let me ask you then
has the day of the Assumption gone okay
that we in this country can look at
big corporate guys
okay
and call them chores we assume
that they're criminals
but we aspire to be Google
Microsoft trillion dollar companies in
the US are a great aspiration and a
motivation wow look at these guys are so
amazing
but somebody makes it here whether it's
100 billion 200 billion dollars hundred
percent is a chore how does this mind
State still Prevail in this country
that mindset will take years to go
because and it is not a mindset of
Common People trust me a mindset of a
common people is everybody wants to
become a dhani or a money in their life
it is it is it is what happens on the
new channels or on the political houses
where people think that everybody's
corrupt I don't see tatas are kind of
they carry the best things uh ever I
don't see builders they've created some
large companies in India they put the
best unemployments and UI everybody
wants to become in their life or do some
great startups or become a Google do
have do we have resources capability
intentions hard work that's a different
thing
okay so so do we
then Dr Kohli because we are so
used to it it has become something which
we sit upon comfortably upon a pillow
that corruption is there
you just say corruption and it will
appear because it forever exists
are we finding it then difficult as a
country to say maybe
corruption is going down maybe actually
that the ministers are not taking in the
money in the amounts that they have in
the past maybe indeed their crony
capitalism is not the woke
opportunism of the hour maybe something
different is going on is is that a
digesting factor that we now have to at
least try to sort of envisage
well Bishop you know if you think of the
electorate and this whole Narrative of
this 20 000 crores which is which is
just going on and on you know I think I
think the political parties some of them
feel that they can probably start
because when you asked about whether
people who are rich people who are big
people who are conglomerates
uh you know are they criminals just
because they are big because a common
man from this country you know because
of the inequality of income and
inequality of wealth and sharp
inequalities so anyone who's who's got
Surplus wealth or Surplus income or or
is reasonably big it is very easy to
form a kind of an imagination that this
person must have taken a wrong route to
reach that point so that is these that
is the emotion which the opposition is
trying to start but what they are
forgetting they're forgetting two things
one is that this narrative against this
government or the prime minister is not
going to work because prime minister has
already earned a reputation which is
beyond question that's my first point
second point the people who are raising
this question now this is an I mean I
come from an apolitical world the people
who are raising the question the old
saying people who live in Glass Houses
should not throw stones at others their
own reputation in the past for all the
scams that you name 2G Colgate you know
Commonwealth and so and so for all the
uh past the history is going to haunt
them forever so I think they are unfit
in my mind okay
so how do you how do you just as an
observer sir of course not of not a
direct participant in this and I just
want to edit on that thought how do you
then perceive that a Sharad pavar is now
who's a very very intelligent politician
he is seeing the pulse elsewhere
he is seeing that there is nothing to be
achieved here because nobody is buying
it is not sinking in Raphael didn't
achieve anything you said you know you
kept saying
and nothing happened that that this is a
pointless and a waste of time exercise
you can oppose and I'm sure there are
other reasons you can you know corner
and question the BJP but this is not it
why is seeing it but but others in the
Congress are not being able to see this
because I mean I'm not I'm not a Sharad
power fan uh rishabh but he's a veteran
politician he knows this is simply not
going to work what the opposition needs
to do is to get into constructive
opposition they are resorting to
destructive opposition which is not
going to work and I I mean I don't come
from a world of politics I I haven't
done any political science courses but
as a common Citizen and as somebody
being educated and you know you know
regularly speaking to the media I can
understand it is not going to work but
what I fail to understand ratio is that
the people who are on the track just do
not understand this this strategy simply
won't help you in getting the words so
for God's sake find a strategy which
helps you in getting the votes and
that's what knows I think he's a veteran
he spent all his life we have wasted so
much time like I said three months
the census is exactly where it was
George Soros
let the cat out of the bag when he put
out his tweet
strategic mistake from him because at
least then we knew
what his intentions were
its Max of a reality check
that the focus needs to be on Hindenburg
on Soros and what they were up to
the congress party which plays and will
play a very important political role in
this country
should at the very least
make sure Ensure
that for normal Indians
not even a smidgen of perception is
given that they are basing their biggest
political plank for a national election
on the basis of a Foreigner's report
or on the basis of what George Soros
would like to see happen that would be
the most obscene thing even if that
impression is given however false it may
or may not be
we have wasted too much time in
Parliament and we have caused real
economic damage to the shareholders who
have lost shareholder value
the company of the adani group are
running fine
the banks who have lent to them are
receiving their funds fine
but yet in the political Realm
this is going on and on and on and the
wiser politicians are moving away from
it
one would wonder what the Congress is
waiting on
that they are insisting
insisting to the point of Rahul Gandhi
coming out and saying that his
Parliament seed disqualification which
happened over a different kind of issue
would not stop him from speaking about
this that their parties are returned are
running organizations or people alike to
them
which are hunting adani watch hunting to
find problems
that impression is perhaps not the best
impression let alone what reality might
be for more such videos subscribe to the

Fh7ftuoElGg,PM Modi To Visit Sacred Heart Church In Delhi | 1st Church Visit Of A Sitting PM | NewsX,PM Modi To Visit Sacred Heart Church In Delhi | 1st Church Visit Of A Sitting PM | NewsX To Subscribe our YouTube channel ...,2023-04-09T14:38:18Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fh7ftuoElGg/hqdefault.jpg,"we've just heard in the past few minutes
that prime minister Narendra Modi will
on the occasion of Easter Sunday be
visiting a church in central Delhi this
is very next near the gold market next
to the Saint Columbus school this will
be the first time that we've seen a
sitting prime minister
visit the Saint Thomas Catholic Church
and this is going to be happening very
very shortly we're also being told that
he will attend the Easter prayers in the
church we are also being told that after
the Easter ceremony is over he will be
planting a tree in the courtyard of that
church as well so big developments
coming in and for obvious reasons that
this is going to become an intensely
important talking point
for the first time we are going to be
having a sitting prime minister
visiting a Catholic Church
for Easter Sunday I repeat this is going
to be happening in the next few minutes
I'm going to be opening up this
conversation very very rapidly joining
us now on the broadcast I can see
himanshu but is with us I'm trying to
get my reporter mahima kataria who's
reaching this gold market Church very
shortly let me quickly kick this off
with himanshuji himanshuji if you can
hear us and are able able to join into
this conversation uh we are showing file
visuals of Narendra Modi right now but
we're being told we get live visuals of
him arriving at the Saint Thomas Church
in in Delhi very very shortly imagine
your first reaction to this
whether the actual is you know India is
a peculiar country and uh PM Modi takes
care of everything
when is Diwali celebrate Diwali when
it's Easter is celebrating Easter what's
wrong in it and what's new in it
why do people get so much uh to ideally
go to church
who is talking that nobody's talking
anything sir uh we just it's unusual
this is the first time a sitting prime
minister will be visiting a church on
Easter Sunday it's obviously a good
thing to happen
um
how are you just responding and why he
would have chosen on Easter Sunday to go
to a church
the only one should go to a church
why not that's what I'm trying to say
you know it's unfortunate that it's 75
years ago Independence people have not
understood the real meaning of
secularism
okay
this conversation of secularism with you
just very shortly let's get an update on
actually what's happening on the ground
mahima my colleague is now going to be
tracking this mayama uh what's what's
the plan of action now I know uh for
security reasons all the scheduled
details are not shared with us uh we are
finding out these things as they are
about to begin to happen uh so we are
being told this is in gold market this
is Saint Thomas Church this is between
the convent of Jesus and Mary and and
send Columbus's school is one of the
oldest if not the oldest church in Delhi
and of course today is Easter Sunday
well absolutely should be correctly
pointed out this is the first time in
the history that the sitting prime
minister on the Easter that is on the
occasion of the Easter will visit to the
church and prime minister Narendra Modi
is all set to visit the Sacred Heart
Catholic Church in Delhi today that is
like you correctly pointed out it is in
the national capital in the gold market
and what is to be noted here uh Russia
base that the father uh Swami Nathan
stated and I quote that it is for the
first time that a prime minister is
coming to a church prime minister
Narendra Modi is coming to our church
today and we are excited about it I
think it is for the first time that
prime minister is coming to this church
is what the father of the church or the
priest has to say also tentatively what
we have got the itinerary is that Prime
Minister Modi will reach the church at
around 5 30. he will spend half an hour
in the church and prime minister will
offer prayers and will also plant a tree
in a park outside the church and the
Prime Minister from there will directly
leave uh for the BJP headquarters where
the ceces and today in the national
capital Mission okay uh so this is as
mahima is correcting us can I just get
my touchpad on our screens please very
very quickly to give people who are not
from Delhi and understanding of what the
church is uh this is uh to the best of
my knowledge one of the oldest churches
in Delhi uh this is what it's called
This is the Sacred Heart Church this is
as I mentioned very near Connaught place
in Delhi uh in between uh two of the
iconic schools uh which is the convent
of Jesus and Mary and Saint Columbus's
school to put things in perspective I
think if I'm not mistaken uh Shahrukh
Khan went to that school now the church
uh the Sacred Heart Church here which
you sing on your screens uh
has traditionally Easter Sunday
celebrations we are being told that this
will include a special service which has
been conducted for Easter Sunday Sunday
I've been to this church for uh
midnight mass a few years ago and people
from all over the city gather here it's
one of the one of the best churches uh
in in the national capital of course
built before independence where they're
having Easter Sunday and uh for people
who are following this Easter Sunday is
an important occasion in the Catholic
calendar comes of course after Good
Friday and I'm going to be jumping into
that conversation very very shortly so
so maima uh so what do we know I'm told
he's going to be planting a tree in the
church Courtyard I'm also being told
that he will attend the service is that
correct
he will offer prayers and after that the
park outside the church is going to
plant a tree there but also like you
correctly pointed out that Easter is a
very important Sunday in the Christian
calendar and also what is important here
to be noted that the father or the
priest of the church clearly stated that
it is for the first time that any prime
minister is coming but we all know that
he cares about all the minorities in the
country so that is what the church
priest has to say this is the first time
like you also correctly pointed out that
a prime minister is visiting
the church and this particular Church
like you correctly pointed out age in
the gold market in the national capital
and also
okay uh for some reason I've lost
mahima's audio they will get it back
she's on route of course to the Sacred
Heart
Church Cathedral as we speak uh uh
savior Rodriguez joining us on the
broadcast he's of course a member of the
BJP uh uh Savio uh uh to the best of my
knowledge I'm trying to do quick
research this is unprecedented this a
sitting prime minister of this country
has never visited a church
uh before to attend a service your quick
First Take
well I think it's very important to
understand that Prime Minister Modi is
the prime minister of India and not just
the prime minister of the Hindu majority
as many in the opposition likes to
portray what Prime Minister Modi is
doing is doing exactly what any prime
minister uh you know should be doing
which is which is integrating with
people of every Faith because he's
looking
looking at if individuals as a citizen
you know so today when he partakes in in
visiting the church and and being a part
of of the tree planting that's happening
outside the church he's sending out a
message of unity he's sending out a
message of peace and what a beautiful
day to do it on and a day of Easter
which is about salvation which is about
Resurrection which is about change okay
okay why don't you help us out for
people watching this broadcast I like I
said I've been to this church for
midnight mass a few years ago uh just
tell us a bit about Good Friday about
Easter Sunday why it's celebrated and
what kind of special service special
Masters organized generally on Easter
Sundays so So Good Friday is is a very
solemn day in the Chris for the
Christian Community it's the day when
Jesus sacrificed himself for the rest of
the world as per our Christian beliefs
and because of which on the third day
which is Sunday there is a resurrection
that happens and through that
Resurrection uh we we are all saved by
the power of of Jesus's sacrifice now
what does that mean in layman terms the
meaning in daima in terms is primarily
that you know life has a lot of
suffering life has a lot of ups and
downs life has a lot of downturns that
also happens but if you don't lose your
hope in good if you don't lose your hope
in God there will always be a time that
will come back for you to rise up again
and that's the message of Easter and
Easter is very significant because the
entire Christian belief is based on the
Salvation principle of the Catholic
Doctrine the salmon is the sacrifice of
Jesus for the rest of the Christian
Believers but there is a larger message
and the larger message is that life has
problems but life also there is hope and
can you have hope in God
stay with me I just want to give up
people watching the broadcast can I get
my touchscreen back up here just a
little bit of perspective if you're not
from Delhi and this is a
the fascinating beauty of Delhi as well
so ladies and gentlemen uh this is just
as you can see
uh southeast of what you recognize here
so this is the infamous uh or rather
famous Connaught place all right which
we all understand uh just Southwest of
that is the sarovar this is the Bangla
sahib Gurdwara and literally the Bangla
sahib gurudwara then you have Golda
Khanna in the middle which is the GPO in
the center here and towards the north of
that is the Sacred Heart Cathedral
really in this in this one screenshot of
just of Google Maps you can see both the
Bangla sahib Gurdwara which is uh you
know the place where people of the Sikh
community and many other Fates visit
it's a must visit site in in Delhi right
next to that of course is something
called The Sacred Heart Cathedral it's a
Catholic Church to the immediate
west of the church is the San Columbus
school
to the immediate right of the church is
the convent of Jesus Mary which is a
girls school it's a girls Convent and in
the center here this is the Sacred Heart
uh which we are being told that the
Prime Minister will be visiting they
have an auditorium uh on on on the side
uh you know brings me back to my younger
days where I have attended this
Auditorium and of course the school
buildings on have the tennis courts and
swimming pool which are part of Saint
Columbus School uh on the other side so
this is uh Golda Kana as I just
mentioned uh right next to Baba kadak
Singh Mark Ashoka Road right up across
the road from Bangla sahib Gurdwara
where you have the Sacred Heart
Cathedral let's get back to our images
uh I don't know Savio if you've ever
come if you ever had a chance in Delhi
to visit the sacred heartil is one of
the best Catholic churches in in Delhi
I have and it was very beautiful yeah so
like more importantly the Sacred Heart
Cathedral is also very solemn in its in
its Aura it's a very prayerful place
uh
the you know you believe it or not last
time I I and and this is uh the story of
India perhaps you should tell the last
time I in fact actually sat for a
service not the midnight mass but a
Sunday Services Sacred Heart Cathedral I
was with a Muslim friend of mine uh and
I'm Hindu and we sat for a for a for a
church service and it is of course can
be a very moving thing uh midnight mass
is a is a completely different
experience uh just as an experience uh
it's it's it's something something
special uh I was traveling around Delhi
uh uh during uh Christmas just last year
and saw a lot of people walking down for
midnight mass in various churches uh
across the capital to the best of my
knowledge this is the oldest one and uh
uh to again to the best of my knowledge
uh I'm just going to read out some
information for you as I mentioned it's
between
Columbus and CGM Convent of Jesus and
Mary that the total site of this is
about 14 acres and it was built in
foundation stone lead in 1929 and
construction began in 1930. Anil Anthony
joining us on the broadcast now member
of the bharati janta party uh Anil this
is the first time in the history of
Independent India that a sitting prime
minister is visiting a church on Easter
Sunday what's your first take
foreign
minister of the country do not
differentiate between any majority or
minority the prime minister of this
country only sees 140 crore Indians and
he is working on a very
very solid Vision to take all these 140
core Indians forward with her and he is
working with a vision to bring economic
and social Mobility to the Indian
population and this is all a part of the
prime minister's
policies to take everybody alone along
forward and the country
are
giving back uh and putting Faith back in
the Prime Minister also you saw the
recent elections that happened in
Northeast the three states all the
northeastern states all of them are
um right now governed by the bjpr the
BJP is allies and every single state
where even the minorities are a majority
in this country
party or his allies the Coalition they
are governing everywhere because the
people of this country has full faith in
the prime minister of this country and
the Barbarian party okay Anil I have to
ask you this question for for obvious
reasons uh
the what is the importance for uh for a
Christian uh on Easter Sunday now we've
just gone through Good Friday Sundays
having the same conversation with Savvy
just a minute minute across can you just
explain that for people watching the
broadcast please
see this is a very special day for uh
Christians across the world this is the
day where after the crucification of
Christ on Friday after three days Christ
Rose and uh he uh Rose from the grave
and he uh attained immortality and this
is a great uh very special day for
Christianity and it is a great
just there by the prime minister to show
to tell the minorities that in India the
Christian population as well as the
world but the Barbie as another party
stands with everybody in this country
the bhardi agenda party
and the government wants to take
everybody together
the Prime Minister do not differentiate
between any citizen in this country
there is no majority there is no
minority there are only Indians and
everybody will be moving okay
before I let you go now there is there
is a a Christian population in Delhi
there is a substantial Christian
population in Mumbai in the Northeast
and of course from your home state of of
Kerala so how how uh how would you and
and other people in Kerala be viewing
this visit by the prime minister
the prime minister is
right now the whole of country
irrespective of majority or minorities
Kerala has a huge minority population
also everybody has faith in the prime
minister right now across India people
are putting the faith in the Prime
Minister and his mission and the djpr
Allies are in power and vast major are
in the government and vast majority of
the States in 2014 and 2019 party had
come with historic Mandy even in Kerala
right now more and more people are
will be the best option for them to gain
Avenues of Social and economic
mobilities and for them to get new
economic opportunities for them to be a
part of India's nation building process
and transformation so more and more
people are joining the BJP and the party
is growing very fast in Kerala also okay
well uh
a very happy
Easter Sunday celebration to you Anil
I'm sure you'll also be having your own
service that you will be attending uh
accurately I would so quickly want to
describe to our viewers what so here's
an opportunity ladies and gentlemen uh
and let's make the most of it I I've
seen this church since childhood uh it
was very very near to where I went to
school uh not I didn't go to send
Columbus but my school is just on the
other side of Connaught place so I've
been there many many times as as a young
person I've done events here and of
course somebody who Anil knows very well
uh who was uh my mentor was a Christian
from Kerala uh and he was a very well
respected journalist and he uh uh when
you know when I was working with him we
did a lot of a lot of events in this in
in this church which of course I still
remember very very fondly let me just
show you on our screen once again our
visuals here I'm trying to get my
colleague mahima into this conversation
very quickly she's at the church when
you uh can okay so ladies and gentlemen
this is the inside of the Sacred Heart
Cathedral in in Delhi uh let me just try
to describe to you what it is uh so you
can see uh right at the at the center uh
where you have uh what is called the
apps the apps is uh basically a a dome
of the search you have right at the
center that is uh
a painting of The Last Supper
towards the right side of this there is
a statue of the Virgin Mary
and of course in the center of course
you have a
the crucifix the cross
and this gives you an understanding it's
not the one of the largest churches in
the world for show but is one of the
oldest ones in Delhi it's almost 100
years old
as as we speak my colleague joining us
on broadcast Mima I know you're on Route
reaching that reaching the Sacred Heart
contributor we're expecting the prime
minister to arrive there very shortly
maybe in half an hour 45 minutes
prime minister to visit the churches
somewhere around 5 30 but also or what I
noted rishab that you spoke about the
Christians in Kerala and what for our
viewers is important to note here is
that earlier on April 5th the union
Minister V Molly dharan has gotten the
Supreme head of the Orthodox Syrian
Church into the parliament to meet Prime
Minister Modi at his office inside the
Parliament and Matthew's third who was
visiting the national capital to lead
the Easter week celebrations in Delhi uh
stated and I quote that it was my first
wish to meet Prime Minister Modi after
uh he took over as the head of the
church and now after meeting uh with
prime minister he feels really happy and
he also stated that he inquired that
prime minister inquired about the
functioning of the church and explained
and then he explained about the details
and he was really happy that uh whatever
the church is doing but also what is
important is that uh prime minister
modi's visit to the church comes amid
the party's concrete
to the community including meeting with
the Supreme head of the Indian Orthodox
Church that is the Matthews 3. so yes
this is the first time that any sitting
prime minister is going to visit the
church is going to serve uh he's going
to attend the service there he's going
to offer prayers he's going to plant a
tree there so a lot of things that is
going to happen ahead of the CDC which
is also important uh leading it to the
Karnataka elections uh so but definitely
prime minister is reaching out to the
minorities here but also what is
important that's the priest or the
father of this church stated that Prime
Minister Modi was taking the country
forward on the principle of
it is very important to note that the
father of the church swaminathan has
clearly stated that prime minister is
concerned about the minorities and also
he's working on the principle
okay now
himanshu but is still with us in
himanshu you know imagine we know what's
going to happen very very shortly right
uh we know that the I mean is
predictable no the Congress is going to
say that why is he going to a church why
will he will he also go to a Masjid you
know what's about to happen right so I'm
staying away from that as long as
possibly because it's giving me an
opportunity to to talk about a church
that you know I've I've seen as a child
and I've visited several times so I'm
going to talk about that for a bit
but the political play out on this is
almost inevitable that this is going to
be perceived as as a stunt that this is
going to be perceived as okay uh the
Christian church I'll I'll I'll visit uh
because of course uh you know the uh uh
you know uh Northeast is important
Kerala is important the Christian
Community is important but the Muslim um
Masjid I will never visit uh should
should we be as as cliched in our
politics or can we really suspect
and expect the prime minister is trying
to do something larger here
doing something larger but before that
let me tell you one thing in ujjain
mahakal incident is to be reminded to
people
okay
Temple incident of Rahul Gandhi and the
way Congress went Gaga
of potatoes
who am I I'm not going to utter those
things yeah what I'm saying is this
so-called belief of the world not even
India in the opposition in India
so-called belief of the world that Hindu
secularist party has come to power in
India and India will never be said
that is the larger narrative here
one must understand this and so this
sort of strategical and tactical
messaging is very much necessary
okay so you might feel so many things in
your heart but you don't portray you
don't throw it at times it becomes
necessary to show some people what is
the truth okay and the truth is today
out of 25 23 seats are run by of
Northeast okay okay so I'm I'm going to
now have this conversation with with
Savion so because savior ladies and
gentlemen I mean some of you would be
aware who watches often and follow him
on social media uh the Savior joined the
BJP before the elections in Goa his
constituency from where he fought the
fought the campaign or fought the seat
uh is a is a largely Christian
constituency so I'm going to have this
conversation about perceptions of the
BJP in that Christian constituency it's
not a straight line but as I promise I'm
going to tell you a bit about this
church as well uh so can I just get come
back to my touch screen here please so
uh so the Sacred Heart Cathedral in New
Delhi uh
ah the parish priest is Father Francis
swaminathan
then the assistant Parish priest his
father John Britto
uh Reverend father Sunil prakash Rasta
is also an assistant Parish priest and
father alosius VR is also an assistant
Parish priest so there are uh the the
chief priest the head priest is Father
Francis uh swaminathan who's of course
there at the Sacred Heart I'll be
showing you a lovely image of it from
inside here it is this is what the
church or the cathedral rather it's not
like I said the biggest in the world uh
but uh it's uh it's the oldest one in
Delhi there were plans uh under the
British to build build a one near
Parliament but uh by the time the world
wars has started and it couldn't happen
shrinach with joining us on the
broadcast if you can hear me uh you know
I I know what the cynical argument is
going to happen very very later sir but
on the significance of the moment first
let's absorb it for a second first time
in history a sitting Indian Prime
Minister will be visiting a church for
Easter servicer your thoughts
he has been meeting people from various
works and he has been going around and I
don't find any things strange about it
we have no issues
uh but I mean basically we go to our
religious places and we respect our
religious places every other religion
also so we have not uh
I'm not surprised at all in what is
happening
but it is unusual there's always the
first time uh there is always the first
time but it is it is it is unusual we of
course are are used to seeing not only
this prime minister but previous prime
minister but especially this one you
know he's going to be he'll be doing the
ganga Artis and he'll be in Varanasi
he'll be visiting the temples we've even
we are even used to see him visiting the
gurdwaras but there's always a first
time uh uh visiting a church and let's
not kid ourselves it is Easter Sunday so
there is some symbolism that is to be
taken away what is the symbolism to be
taken away today
basically
I mean I know I don't say that it's not
instead of church at all
a symbolism is that he has gone he's
going there on a Easter Sunday I mean he
wants to be a part of that particular
activity he's going there that's it I
don't find any uh
uh
I mean basically you know one more thing
is this also gives message that
we all all together for the country so
you give the question of nationalism
which is trying to propose take with
this kind of thought process there is no
separation this thought has been uh
being uh put forth in different uh
spheres in the political area also so
there is no question of uh
uh trying to polarize our social
security we are a part of everybody
everybody is a part of whatever we are
that's how it is going

Raman is to Embark today on an official
visit to the United States of America
she will be attending the spring annual
meetings of the international monetary
fund world and World bank finance
minister Sita Rahman will be accompanied
by RBI Governor
Das they will co-chair the G20 Finance
ministers and Central bank's Governors
meetings on the sidelines of the IMF and
World Bank meetings
will also have bilateral engagements
with her respective counterparts from
G20 countries and heads of other
delegations
around 350 delegates from G20 members 13
inviti countries and various
International and Regional organizations
are set to participate in this meeting
they will engage in multilateral
discussions centered around a broad
spectrum of pressing Global issues
during the meeting the key Focus will be
on issues such as addressing food and
energy security managing Global debt
vulnerabilities strengthening
multilateral developmental banks
mobilizing finance for climate action
and accelerating progress on
International tax and financial sector
issues
the meeting will take stock of the
progress made on outcomes and Visage
under India's G20 Finance track agenda I
have with me on the broadcast senior
Economist Dr Sharad Kohli we're getting
to know that Finance Minister nirmala
Sita Raman is set to leave for USA to
attend the spring annual meetings of the
international monetary fund and World
Bank of course these meetings are set to
address a broad spectrum of global
issues such as food and energy
insecurity and Global debt
vulnerabilities sir what do you think
can be the outcomes of this meeting do
you think any positive consensus will be
brought about
well we should not forget that the
meeting is happening in the backdrop of
the situation where India is leading the
G20 pack
so you know the discussions would not
just be confined to you know India
versus another country they will be con
they will also have a very wide-ranging
repercussions as far as the global
financial sector or global economic
Outlook is concerned so I think one of
the issues Prime issues which can come
up in the discussion would be the
multilateral development Banks because
the role of these banks in the recent
past has been highlighted and how they
have come to rescue especially after
kovit and the Russia Ukraine crisis that
will be one
second I think the the delicate
situation in the world banking system
specially after the interest rate hike
would also come up for discussion
because America in particular has seen a
bit of a Domino's effect although it was
uh you know you know sort of taken care
of by the American government
but then the vulnerability of the the
banking system around the world after
the interest rate hike will also be
under discussion as to how the world or
the governments around the world
especially the G20 can take action to
see that a 2008 life situation of Lehman
Brothers doesn't come again because it
can rock the whole financial sector
around the world I think then of course
the Finance Minister will not miss out
the opportunity of bilateral discussions
with various country Finance head
especially with Janet Yellen the U.S
treasury secretary I think she would
like to discuss a lot of issues as far
as India and us is concerned we should
also not forget that the Reserve Bank of
India Governor is also uh you know
traveling along with and there are
meetings lined up with other Central
Bank heads where I think another a very
interesting point in discussion would be
the interest rate hike we all know that
the interest rate hikes take place
around the world in a very synchronized
manner they start from U.S they trickle
down to Europe and then of course the
Asian countries have also to follow suit
because you cannot see a significant
difference in the interest rate so I
think uh the Central Bank Governor would
also like to discuss the issue of uh
interest rate hike whether the banks
around the world should take a pause now
because we are starting to feel the side
effects on the world economic growth we
all know that the three percent
projections of the world economic growth
by the imfc for the next five years is a
bit of a bit of a concern for the world
and I think the world is looking up to
India as because India is still amongst
the fastest growing economies India has
been termed as a bright spot India has
been termed as a shining star so I think
the world would be looking up to India
as far as the driving the world economic
growth is concerned IMF also said that
India and China will constitute the
major part of the world's economic
growth in the years to come so I think
the world would like to take cues as to
what magic is India doing to its economy
despite being 1.4 billion people around
what magic is it doing to make sure that
it is still growing and of course
another aspect which I feel will be
discussed with India's prowess at
Financial technology the fintech
progress which India has made with
regard to UPI with regards to digital
payment system with regard to financial
inclusion I think all these aspects will
come uh for discussion on the table and
the world will like to take some tips
from from the finance ministers to how
this magical achievement has been made
where so many people have been brought
under the digital system so I think I
think all in all it's going to be a very
useful D20 uh you know session with
multiple meetings lined up and World
debt is another thing which I feel will
come under discussion because uh after
covet the kind of borrowings which the
countries have made and you know the
debt to GDP ratio of G20 Nations is has
been a matter of discussion and the
world coming in the severe debt I think
is not a very good situation so I think
the the heads of Finance would also like
to discuss about as to how to come out
of this debt trap which the world has
been landed into after covert and Russia
Ukraine war and I think uh one more
aspect which I feel will be under
discussion is the geopolitical tensions
I meant the current geopolitical
tensions which are building around the
world as to how the world financial uh
sector can prepare itself on other
war-like situation for example in China
Taiwan what will be its impact on the
World Trade what will be its impact on
the world's uh you know borrowings and
the financial sector I think that will
also come up for discussion this is what
IPL uh so she's going to have a very
busy time in the next few days while she
travels apart from multilateral there's
going to be bilateral meetings as well

Narendra Modi and the BJP because this
is the southern push wherein prime
minister Narendra Modi has already
visited Telangana he has launched a slew
of projects and laid Foundation stones
of projects worth closing crows of
rupees he has now arrived in Chennai he
is also now inaugurated phase one of the
integrated terminal of the Chennai
airport which is worth some thousands of
crores of rupees you have on your
visuals on your screens is MK Stalin the
DMK Chief and the chief minister of
Tamil Nadu who is accompanying him while
the Prime Minister launches this Mega
integrated
Aviation Minister who's also alongside
prime minister Narendra Modi
now this is a stage of the art
terminal
that is being launched
phase one of it has been completed there
are several others which are going to be
integrated as months pass by
and this is a detailed
description of the site that is being
given to the Prime Minister currently
well unlike
the
problems or sort of a face saving that
had been initiated by the Telangana
chief minister uh K Chandra shekhar Rao
who refused to even meet the Prime
Minister when the projects were being
launched by him here we see that MK
Stalin the Tamil Nadu chief minister
shaking hands with the Prime Minister
he's accompanying him of course for this
Mega project launch so that's the
difference in politics that is being
played by the Telangana chief minister
versus the
editorial director India news it's good
to have you on The Telecast with us sir
it's interesting that the crows and
crows that have been put in by the
central government
have impacted and benefited particularly
the southern states whether it is
Karnataka Chennai Tamil Nadu what does
this indicate
yeah thank you madam certainly you know
this first time in India prime minister
Narendra Modi modernized the Air Force
from South to East even Northeast also
and recently the Bangalore airport you
see international airport it's a unique
when I even all over the world people
would like to see the Bangalore airport
same thing is happening in Chennai and
South India or in Telangana the
development projects
I feel that as a prime minister and as a
government of central government they
are trying their best to develop the all
sections of the society all parts of the
country and that's why normally it used
to be that if you are from Western uh
side you will not ignore the South or
you are from North mostly blamed without
looking in the South and the same thing
if Southern leader is there was there so
sometimes people used to say oh he will
governor
some issue controversial issues are
there but even then he is
from a good family of karnality family
and that's why even prime minister take
taking all the dynasty politics in South
India or not India but even then he went
there but the Chandra shekar Rao I think
because he still feel that he's a
activist what he used to do for
Telangana and he's eyeing for the Prime
Minister ship and ignoring even the
Prime Minister it's a very uncultured
way what I feel very sorry to say in
this sense because the NT Rama Rao and
all the tradition of the Andhra Pradesh
and so many leaders even the Prime
Minister was from there in the same
reason or the president were also from
this region
was also the same reason but at the time
the Telangana was not there but even
then I think what suddenly
India prime minister Narendra Modi
launched so many schemes today also
inaugurating Chennai airport is also
very important earlier you see in Kerala
[Music]
not just in South but across the country
and in the Northeast region as well
keeping in now has strategically
important it is for the country ah
let's quickly get in jivia shastri also
on The Telecast with me is this a
political pitch or this is welfare and
development that India is seeing under
the leadership of the BJP at the center
no it's absolutely enough BJP is trying
hard in Telangana because Telangana is a
completely a different uh and separate
uh way of approach because the people
are different the way they think and
thought rates are completely and
comprehensively different and the BJP is
trying so hard they know ambiguity
because if you see that prime minister
just inaugurating
he all the way travel to Hyderabad
that's a story that's a kind of because
they are very trying hard that shows
that the BJP leadership top leadership
is saying so key to get into the
Telangana region and that's what they
are doing it and but at the same time
they have a tough acquisition tough
position with what they've you know they
faced with Bengal mamata energy similar
kind of situation it is absolutely in
the Telangana that's what kcr is giving
a tough fast now you know tough way
towards the BJP and that's sir in any
case it is going to happen but of course
developmental programs is concerned of
course there are some trying centers and
the modernization of secunderabad
railway station and these are the things
of course it is a duty it's not that the
you know kcr or a prime minister motive
BMS Modi the prime minister is a model
Mr premium we should call we should not
call the names you know we should call
the Prime Minister prime minister and
the chief minister of the state whoever
it is the Prime Minister and the chief
minister must meet and the chief
minister must respect the honor the
Indian Prime Minister and the Prime
Minister must respect the the chief
minister of the state it should like
that and because these are the way of
approach and as far as the Constitution
is concerned in the Central State
relations concerned so we should not get
away with that and these kind of issues
uh we should not be brought into the
culture because you know people are end
of the day people are development and up
placement is the main motto of kcr or
Narendra Modi it is not you know every
political party is uh demotivist
development and upliftment of the people
if at all there is a program government
of India program then that obviously
must be there but that's the reason that
that is visible in the ground where the
prime minister is inaugurating
everywhere they they mentioned the name
of Chandra shekhar when they all boards
so that he was there he was a protocol
he was given and uh even he was given a
chair that's what I heard 21 I saw there
was a child on the name of Kate and the
Prime Minister okay okay
or the lack of it that has been shown
several times Time and Again by K
chandrashekar out to prime minister
Narendra Modi in contrast to which we
have MK stalinu's shaking hands who's
meeting the Prime Minister and there's
never been an occasion when the Prime
Minister has visited Tamil Nadu and
whatever may be the difference of
opinion of the DMK party they have
always greeted prime minister with open
arms
how how do you how do you then dissect
the politics that is being played by
Telangana government which is led by kcr
versus MK Stalin's politics
say that kcr and MK Stalin are facing
the same problem with the governor there
the governor Ravi and here it is uh in a
governor Madam is there and both are
just placing the same kind of tough
situation between the government
governments are feeling a tough with
regard to government Tamil shall we is
concerned in Telangana but what I'm
suggesting is
kcr Casey are supported this number of
bills in uh in the parliament along with
the BJP and even kesel met so many times
the prime minister in Delhi but after uh
recent you know he was reaching the
completion of his time for uh five years
from nearly maybe another six seven
months uh eight months so he maybe he
took such a kind of position that you
know he is straight away taking and he's
also announced that TR has converted
into BRS Bharat samiti and he's launched
it and across the nation and he is
recently visited Maharashtra also
Maharashtra is having a public meeting
the huge Gathering and is his Ambitions
are clear that he wants to be a national
political party that's what he wants to
make it and that's a kind of situation
and at the same time the central uh if
you see that our daughter is involved in
liquor scam and uh you know that's what
uh we are hearing with the news reports
and television reports that he has been
called for so many times in uh you know
enforcement director so these are so
many issues are emerging and uh if you
see that our local uh politics are so
heat up that uh yesterday was yesterday
that president of bharti janta party
State president
were arrested on the uh paper leaks Camp
pepperly scam that what the government
claims that you know preppers are
intentionally leaked by the uh bharti
janta bharti State president and uh he
is
governed government uh in in place of
the public okay so that's what they are
the government delegation and he was
arrested he was got they just got Bail
before devour yesterday and no the story
is simple the story is simple the guns
are out and the BJP and the Congress PJP
and the TRS BRS they are very tough
stands at this R and uh but at the end
of the day it is not correct being the
prime minister is is attending the rally
along with a completely in a protocol of
the government of India and there there
is critical aspect is fair enough
right he should have followed protocol
okay
again coming back to you now I'm going
to particularly raise this issue now
today
uh in a major shift see gopalachari the
first governor general of our free India
uh his Grand great grandson has decided
to jump ship from the Congress to the
BJP there was uh Kiran Reddy who's the
former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh
who has also decided to join the BJP
just couple of days ago it was Anil
Anthony the son of AK Anthony who's been
a congress veteran and a Gandhi loyalist
he has also decided to join the BJP is
this a trend that is now going to be
more of uh more of a pattern than an
anomaly keeping in mind that there is
likelihood of the BJP winning the 2024
elections as well
everybody felt that the Congress ruined
Congress is no leadership nowadays
because the leadership is very poor
because of Rahul Gandhi and that's why
from chakravarti Raj gopalachara to
Karen Reddy or uh
he written also the book the whole
theory that how it was going on so I
think because this area earlier either
with the Congress or DMK DMK are the
Andhra Pradesh also congress party and
some reason
emerged and then afterwards the TRS is
also there now they call it Bears so I
think the everybody is feeling that the
BJP is future because they are very open
to accept a clean image people normally
what I feel they are their allegations
but everybody one can say even from
narrow days to Indra Gandhi and all one
can just talk about this but here we
were they are trying that the people
should come who wants to accept the
ideology of the BJP and especially the
welfare program and the development
program of the nation apart you see
number of people even the Christian
Community are the minorities they are
also supporting nowadays in the election
time so everybody Kiran ready is the
example that even he was a chief
minister he was very senior person and
uh
Anthony son young so it's a mix old and
young both are joining BJP because they
think the future with the BJP
for themselves and for the
um Nation that's why because everybody
wants a regional development National
development and they want to see India
more strong so I feel this is like a
wave earlier people used to go published
maybe in Karnataka they claim that few
BJP people also shifted from BJP to
Congress because Congress is coming to
power depends how it goes always risky
nobody can predict what will happen in
Karnataka right but the process should
go on and that's why the page is going
on okay uh Raja Lakshmi Joshi is joining
me on The Telecast me what are your
inferences of these big developments Big
Show that the BJP is putting up in the
southern states there has been in fact a
lot of support that is being shown by
the Earth while Congress leaders from
the south to the PJP will this will this
then translate to votes
I definitely uh you know I see makeup
you know we cannot see the kind of
inroads that BJP is making uh in the not
just in Telangana but also in Tamil Nadu
you know in Tamil Nadu the organization
has become extremely strong and even
though right now uh you know they may
not be in a position to uh maybe form
the government as such you know
immediately but then I think you know at
least you know by the next two elections
I see that the Tamil Nadu BJP has
definitely a lot of potential and they
have a lot of chances to come into
actual government or at least play a
very important key role in it because
the kind of development projects that
are happening in Tamil Nadu the the kind
of uh changes that are happening there
and the kind of support that you can see
that that is being given out to a PM
Modi ji so uh even though uh you may see
that you know there are some people who
have been trying things like go back to
Modi you know on Twitter but that is a
very limited thing but if you see on
ground you can see that there is a huge
power there is a huge enthusiasm for pm
modiji and you can see why also because
uh you know uh even though uh this is
not a BJP rule state but then uh PM Modi
has always been giving support to uh all
the uh whatever uh you know uh MK Stalin
has been actually asking for even that
he has been actually giving support to
even though MK Stalin has been he has
not really been a very supportive or a
Cooperative uh chief minister like you
have seen the kind of face-offs that
he's been having the kind of standoffs
that he's been having with the governor
of Mr Navi
um even in spite of that uh you know PM
Modi ji has already supported him
whenever he has asked for help now uh uh
you know in stark contrast with that you
can see what is happening in Telangana
foreign
be able to make inroads in the southern
parts of this country particularly for
the Lok Sabha elections Professor
jeeviya shastri uh would this be going
out on a stretch and saying that BJP
could win Kerala or Andhra Pradesh or
Tamil Nadu Karnataka is a different ball
game altogether but but it is still yet
to make uh an indelible Mark in the
minds of the voters to be able to win
elections in these three important
states where BJP has never been in power
in the past
I don't think because you know if it is
really because
you're teaching the people of Kerala and
Karnataka Andra Tamil Nadu these state
is quite difficult it's not possible
it's not possible and uh that's what the
feeling the hate is visible as well as
the Karnataka is concerned for the BJP
and Kerala is completely you know it's
not so not at all easy not at all easy
and it is not going to because if we see
in Andhra Pradesh assembly BJP doesn't
have even one number either mlc or MLA
and the name of BJP individuals on the
election
so it's very we of course it's done
there is a long way to go and it's a
very very long way it's not so easy two
three elections I don't know that by the
time the way of approach of BJP manner
may change may not change and maybe
difficult to say that that much because
the politics can't be a longer in
politics it's always short-term and the
people uh decides every five years down
and that's what the Constitution says
but he's saying that you know saying uh
Kerala this Telangana and these will
change immediately I feel doubt and
that's what countries are and the people
are different way of approach and you
know in North Belt it is completely
different in the software it is
completely different okay okay
let me let me get alok Mehta uh back on
The Telecast
now in in Tamil Nadu particularly uh
BJP was taking the help of AI DMK up
until the last assembly elections it has
decided to go It Alone it has distance
itself from this infighting that is
taking place between Ops and uh and the
uh and the other guy now uh
will will BJ be able to fight it alone
and still make a mark in Tamil Nadu
where DMK in Congress are in close
standing and have been able to win
election after election
Mela is still there is a time for the
Lok Sabha election what will happen how
the the closed door what they speak we
don't know but even then what I feel
when I uh just continue with the
strategy you see Northeast there was no
uh BJP 10 years back but what is
happening is Assam the strong chief
minister and tripura the chief minister
of BJP so slowly because what I feel in
politics is not a long term but I think
the politics for Narendra Modi or bjpr
RSS are earlier the congress party they
had the reason for the long-term
politics and that's why Modi and BJP
they are not thinking that tomorrow but
in the next few months or in a year they
will come to power in the whole northern
southern state but even then talang
Telangana because so much corruption and
the charges and chaotic and he is also
very something like a under viswasi what
we call it because we always think that
okay we should have a building here or
we should go to some other City and this
kind of uh
and ambition also for the prime
ministership that's why BJP have good
chance to have a pollution with some
Regional other forces in Southern India
and that's why the Kiran ready joined so
maybe tomorrow because I do was there in
the BJP and a number of people from
South India they are also part they are
sitaraman she is a finance minister and
a woman prime minister and then she is
also originally Tamil so in Tamil Nadu
also she went there speak in Tamil also
talk in Tamil so they walked in the long
term they think that after five years
after 10 years situation change and
because of infighting and Dynasty and
Corruption charges the all parties are
losing ground with the people okay fair
enough quickly Raja Lakshmi Joshi then a
Viewpoint from you Tamil Nadu politics
particularly
will the BJP be able to make inroads
come 2024 Lok Sabha elections and also a
more intriguing question that by the
time BJP makes inroads in the southern
states will it still be able to stand
tall and gather the entire nation's
momentum because there's likelihood of
in and incumbency also to creep in
Omega you know the BJP has always been a
canada-based party and uh if you have
seen you know the kind of organization
that the BJP focuses on that is its
biggest strength so here in Tamil Nadu
uh by what I have heard of the reports
is that uh close to 75 to 80 percent of
the booths they have the entire
organization ready so that is how they
function so you know every Booth every
Booth is taken care of so that I mean
that is the kind of an Outreach then the
bjpa cadder has with the voters and it's
not just about looking at votes like
alok mataji was saying that it is a very
long term Vision so it is not about this
very
um the next election that is coming up
like in the Northeast what they did is
they have been there have been dedicated
people who have been looking at the uh
at the welfare of the States from so
many years and that and you can see the
result today so similarly in the in
Tamil Nadu also this organization is
becoming stronger and they are taking up
all the right projects they're taking up
all the right issues and that is how
there's this Outreach and the inroads
are happening in tamilnadu for more such

details on this story mahima a big
meeting there at JP nada's residence has
it began who all are present
well absolutely they like to correctly
pointed out leaders have started
arriving at JP nada's residence as we
all know that the Karnataka Assembly
Election are just a month away and the
political atmosphere in the state is in
uh but it is since the JDS has already
released the first list of the 93
candidates by the Congress has released
two lists uh so far 166 candidates
however the ruling party that is the BJP
has not released a single list so far
and a meeting in this regard is being
held at the residence of BJP National
president JP NADA the meeting was also
there what is to be noted was held on
Friday night as well where Union Home

charge

co-in-charge of the Karnataka uh was
also present there and today uh Arun
Singh is present there Manchester is
present there former Chief Minister has

in Karnataka they're hoping that now bgp
is somewhere down the line This is the
core meeting that is happening at JP
nadas residence somewhere down the line
BJP might finalize the list of the
candidates which is not yet released but
also to take a note that that modular is
sent there's a lot of allegation that is
going on whether it be the congress
party or the JDS that currently said the
congress party is currently stating that
djp is trying to delay the list to be in
the in the election so that is why the
core meeting is taking place or I would

with the whole three days of military
exercises around Taiwan starting from
Saturday the people's Liberation Army
announced the day after Taiwanese
president Tsai ingwen returned from a
trip to the U.S China would hold combat
Readiness patrols and exercises in the
Taiwan Strait into the north south and
east of Taiwan has planned the Army's
Eastern theater command said in a brief
statement
defense analyst is with us on the
broadcast meditation take us through
these latest developments coming in what
is China trying to convey
well although you must have heard the
saying barking dogs seldom bite
so China basically was unhappy with size
visit to us and they had also issued a
statement but those statements hold no
value they had given a lot of big talks
when Nancy Pelosi was coming to Taiwan
as well that they will not let the
aircraft land in Taiwan they will blow
it up mid-air they have threatened a
whole lot of things they had put Jammers
their electronic Jammers and they are
really uh ahead and they have very
different technology I'll give them
their due over there but yet they
couldn't do anything at all when Nancy
Pelosi came with a big tight slap on
their faces now when they again when Psy
goes to us they received statement and
now they plan to do uh upper three-day
War drill at the time on the United
sharp sword it would be called from
April day age to April 10th that's for
the combat preparedness the most welcome
to do everyone is prepared everyone is
welcome to do what they want to do up
alert command I preparedness whatever
they wish to do it's their right their
army no the taiwas defend Ministry said
that it had detected 13 Chinese
aircrafts and three warships around the
island so they had already they were on
the way of trying to scare Taiwan but I
don't think Taiwan is going to get
scared by China because they know
China's tactics their war games and
their their deceptive games and their
psychological warfare they're propaganda
their projection their lives their white
lives their bitter lies
would you connect this directly to that
United States visit of the Taiwanese
president
oh yes I would I uh I I would corrected
this way that uh China threatened that
they would do this but they cannot do
much I will I will definitely connect it
because just on her return they have
announced this uh three day one exercise
so because they had issued threats now
they have to carry out something halfway
they may not be able to see it through
the threats to what they had promised
and what they had alleged and what they
had threatened but yes they will try to
keep some of their fees to show some
credibility that they had steam in what
they said earlier by uh my size with it
I'll connect it there

attack on Israel by Lebanon now there
are reports of retaliatory Fire by
Israel
defense analyst is uh joining us for
more details on this story when
Commander bakshi how do you react to
these uh latest developments coming in
data development as it is the tension
has been rising and they're having a
problem
which has come from Lebanon probably
Lebanon was waiting they had the
intelligence report already on that so I
personally feel that this aspect is
going to become more serious and there
has a serious intervention is required
from the American side and both Israel
and America they are on the other
parties have to sit down and decide
otherwise this is going to soon flare up
and as it is the tensions are which are
mounted due to Ukraine war the effect is
being felt out here and there's a lot of
but counterpro polarization taking place
to get the
in order I personally feel Israel has
found when America has to intervene and
they have to bring this simmer down the
attention at that moment
okay so you are calling for U.S
intervention now uh we Commander bakshi
but reportedly what will uh of course
complicate this situation is the fact
that reportedly Lebanon is claiming that
the Rockets fired from its territory but
by Palestinian groups absolutely that
the Palestinians will always be in the
picture they will try to break them in
the picture you know even if they are
not there so question arises here that
until and unless the whole thing is
simmered down then only a joint party
can get you know a white flag party or
or a negotiation party in fact a number
of times the Red Cross bodies have
joined in together to bring in a
reproach and then you know collect the

Minister former Chief Minister a person
who is being active in politics since
before I was born now the founding
president of the democratic Azad party
and now an author of The Autobiography
thank you very much for joining us on
musics welcome
sir you know it's a I read the book
overnight it's a very honest emotive
book some things that
a human being can relate with and I
would recommend people judge the book
not on these interviews but on actually
reading the book
but let me ask you a little bit about
the past before we come to the present
uh at a very important time
with Rajiv Gandhi so and you write in
your book
and I'm just going to quote a couple of
lines
that when it came to Rajiv
from that day Rajiv and I worked closely
till his death he neither interfered in
my working nor did he suggest any names
for appointment at any level in the
organization he remained respectful to
the chair of the president a post I
continued to occupy till I became a
union minister in the middle of 1982.
although Raji when I had differences of
opinion on a number of issues and would
argue for hours one of us would
eventually concede after being convinced
by the other Rajiv never took offense
whenever I deferred with him is this
written for Rajiv or is this written of
what Rahul Gandhi has not been able to
do
together
one is the
era when I was youth congress president
and he became the youth congress leader
the function organized by me under my
leadership
under my presidentship in Bangalore on
29th and 30th of December 81. he took
over
as the leader of the youth congress so
he was Final formally brought into the
youth congress though his appointment
was made by me one year earlier on 23rd
June from chernail press conference
but then from that day he became the
leader like Sanjay Gandhi didn't held
any position in youth congress but he
was the leader of the youth congress
so that is mentioned that he remained
leader for
one hour one year more or I remain as
president of uh organization one year
more even after taking her his
leadership so he never suggested any
name and never interfered but the other
thing is the other part is when he was
the Prime Minister President and I was
the General Secretary
so that time we differed on number of
issues each with each other because that
time we are looking after the entire
country
and the parent organization so we were
both in parent organization he was the
president and prime minister and I was
the General Secretary of the parent
organization so on that on that third is
during that period that we used to
discuss we would discuss four hours I
still remember on one day we had a
discussion for eight hours and he has
prime minister cancel all the meetings
official meetings and continue with the
discussion and the agreement was either
he would satisfy me or I either I will
satisfy him on number of issues
so he never used the uh writ of prime
minister of president to overrule me
unless he would totally get satisfied
try to convince you not overly or you
tried
in his book writes that you know perhaps
you were the first person that indraji
discussed about bringing back of course
whether he should join Politics on the
stage you were the one who took him on
stage immediately held his hand to take
him his brother he should join the
politics or not he Mrs Gandhi was the
first in the congress party to uh in the
youth congress or Congress to consult me
and she is a matter of fact told me to
make the plan how he should be okay so
this this consultation uh this
disagreement and debating and coming to
a conclusion mutual respect you say is
this something that you saw declining in
the last no decline in totally this
extent
declining one can understand extinct
non-existent it is it high it is nowhere
there so what what was the experience
the experience was that if you if you
had a meeting sometime if whatever he
has to say it has to be carried whether
it's practical or not whether you like
or not whether it can be whether it will
harm or help is the material you have to
carry on so much different to to what
what your experience with Rajiv was I'll
come back to this let me just uh touch
upon another interesting aspect of this
uh at the time of
indraji's death and you write in your
book sir about the succession issue and
it says that it was rumored that wanted
to become the PM and he had even lobbied
for the position
but you say that not a single senior
leader at MP would have backed pranabda
that's right
there was a reason for that because
unlike
any other person
she was he was already groomed for it as
I said is as early as 80. maybe just
one and a half
month after sanjee Gandhi's death when
Indira Gandhi told me where we should
bring Rajiv Gandhi in into politics so
that means almost four and a half years
before indraji's death Rajiv Gandhi is
taking over prime minister it was
decided to bring him and he may make the
future need her that's why he was made
the youth congress leader which is why
he was making the General Secretary of
the parent organization in 82 which is
why he was member of the made working
committee and parliamentary board member
so he was being taught the uh you know
text of that but but the grooming part
or the training part or the experience
part is not always a guarantee you one
can argue that Rahul has also been given
exposure Sonia's tried for so many
decades and yet natural leadership has
not necessarily emerged no it depends it
depends the it is being said in politics
there are two types of politician and
leaders
one are born leader
and there are major and there are
leadership thirst upon
so I think he was not born leader but he
was made later and once he accepted he
was the most reluctant person to join
the politics but once he joined politics
it was 20.
it was 24x7 but there were some that
argue that this is exactly what the
problem even today is as was then it is
assumed that it is going to stay in the
family that other senior people in
cabinet being one of them narsima
robbing the other would be discounted at
the get-go
but I think that was a time that was
appropriate time that number one
everybody in the senior everybody you
know in congress party knew that he's
been groomed for that and he was General
Secretary of the party so he'll become
already a member of the Parliamentary
board David Mrs died so he had already
become the part of the high commands
Okay so even though it might be dynastic
but it will deserve what you're saying I
said and the sentiment was the
circumstances under which Mrs Gandhi was
killed
in general rule had Mrs Gandhi died in
normal's death maybe he would have known
that claim there would have any Clements
okay but the circumstances under which
Mrs Indira Gandhi was I assassinated
okay that time to make somebody or to
suggest somebody
uh I would have been just inviting it
but Robert was a grudge held against
pranabda some people say that he was
never given an opportunity later on to
become Prime Minister because it was in
the memory of the family that he had
aspired to bpn no I don't think I don't
think that it went against him at all
that went against him at all because
for some time that but then he quit and
ultimately he made his own party yes he
set up his own candidates and
unfortunately himself and his entire uh
you know countries lost the deposits
they didn't get more than few thousand
votes and ultimately he himself was very
keen on it as him to join the Politics
As a matter of fact for uh
quite some time for me who few months
Rajiv Gandhi abided him to not to join
the party ultimately he used to come me
I was much senior but at that time I was
General Secretary of the party so then
he used to come to me then I persuaded
Raju Gandhi now since he has been closed
in Raji and worked with indraji uh we
should bring him in and then I made him
to join the party as a general secretary
okay uh you're very charitable and
nostalgic about both Sanjay Gandhi and
Rajiv Gandhi you're not so charitable in
the book about narasimha Rao you often
write that he used to interfere and seem
disinterested in certain matters in
ticket selection no and even on the
issue of the 84 riots you say that you
know he had the guilt upon him uh no
this is true I have been I have been
very charity but to him if you say when
I vote of no confidence against him I
have said in that and it's quote unquote
that you are one of the best prime
minister of the country I have used one
of the best prime minister of the
country but your worst president of the
party because you had no interest and
you had no aptitude and that why he had
no interest interest and aptitude that I
have narrated in my entire book on
different occasion in the working
Community how me and some my colleagues
in the workings what is is that is that
a clinical objective assessment because
people would argue that narasimha Rao is
the man under whom the Finance Minister
Manmohan Singh brought the reform got
the changes
that no that credit I have given if you
read the entire book that credit I I
have not given to that credit to one
more thing you have given that credit to
uh PM nasimara that's why in my uh you
know when we remove or when we removed
him the time he said you're one of the
best so one of the best was for that
only but it became controversial there
was the the story that even when he died
uh the morning in the party office was
not allowed is it positively principally
because but that was wrong you should
have been allowed so you should have
been given the same respect as other
prime minister but unfortunately I
wasn't in Delhi that day when this all
happened I was out of station and maybe
out of country and this unfortunate
event happened he should have been
allowed
I should have been given the same
respect as other Prime Ministers because
he was one of the Freedom Fighters he
was he stood by Mrs Indira Gandhi in
worst times
uh 77 78 he was member of the
Parliamentary board with Indira Gandhi
during that period where about the
working committee he was part of the
high command and was again foreign
minister of Indira Gandhi he was with
Rajiv Gandhi and very good portfolios
and there was no and ultimately he was
the Prime Minister of the country yes in
whose tenure party may have suffered but
parties now suffering also well today so
let me let's come to today because you
you were saying that there might have
been success in one place but as party
president
ineptitude now
you were very much there when Rahul
Gandhi was party president
was it ineptitude or some of his
supporters feel he was not allowed to
function no I though I the difference
between Rao Saab and uh
Rajiv Gandhi is that
Gandhi would take equal interest in the
party of years
if he was working 18 hours
so he was giving
eight hours to party also
eight hours minimum per day
and he was compelling also like a party
President should okay
so what about what what what were the
issues then when Rahul Gandhi became
president was he also was there
ineptitude was there disinterest was his
bad advice well I think that was
mother-driven decision rather than party
decision and of course that everybody
had to fall in line
brought him
in the parliament it was only her
decision it was not discussed at any
form
I was genesecti I was member of the
election committee also when he was made
generosity it was also our decision when
it was he was made by a vice president
here aicc session which was next day
we're supposed to discuss the resolution
but at midnight the working committee
members were told in the morning no
resolution discussion will take place
tomorrow will be announcement of vice
president and celebration
so so it was a home driven having seen
Rahul literally grow up
it was of course difficult he had seen
his his grandmother
assassinated in a brutal way then has
lost his father in a horrible way I'm
sure it wasn't easy for a child
but did you your assessment of Rahul
Gandhi before he became a member of
parliament before he came into the front
line of national politics what was your
assessment of him as a young as a young
man I know I have not seen any work if
you've seen like Rajiv Gandhi we had
seen him at least for four years working
in the organization who stayed in the U
First youth congress and then General
Secretary of the party
before taking over a prime minister in
that but we had not seen him
yeah nowhere not enough to make an
assessment how how was he as as a
president was he was he effective
ineffectual was a leadership style what
was the issue there the the expected I
think I need to discuss that because my
book is not on him my book has 18
chapter I think in one chapter it is one
tenth of it
so 99 book is other other episodes and
I'm so sorry that all the media person
uh for ask question or him for obvious
reasons as it looks as is his
autobiography isn't it but I'll have to
ask you on the issue of the ordinance
before we move on uh it is of course
ironic that the ordinance that Rahul
Gandhi told which did not become a law
is the issue of the disqualification
today uh had he not
turn it off today he would have not been
victim of the same uh thing why did you
leave sir the congress party what was
the last straw
himself
the days long raised Mrs Gandhi was
there there was some consultation may
not be the same as that of Raju Gandhi
type or Indira Gandhi's time but at
least there's a reasonable consultation
with colleagues and Senior leaders but
ever since he took over he doesn't
believe in consultation
he says okay all people should retire
after 60 to 60. that is his and that is
his thinking right from the beginning
the 60 plus 60 should sit at home and we
feel that after 60 Only You mature
particularly and people will take you
seriously but but you could you could
have left and and you know you you write
in your book because you answer this
that people accuse you of taking juicy
posts but you've sacrificed a lot for
the party I read that part in your book
you know time away from family time away
from children you know and which is a
very real thing you could have chosen to
to take that time now but yeah
but for past one year we've seen you
campaigning all over no no we took four
or five years how many years isn't it
you take it took four or five years so
is gulam nabias are still an active
politician from what we see I was in the
DAP I was earlier 18 hours working for
18 hours I am today working 18 hours on
the other aspect of um the one who tells
me plus 60 should go go home he works 18
minutes
you work 18 hours what is then
for a younger generation of people who
lead this book what is the lesson that
they should well listen I have said
somewhere that yes in between the book
only that this book is dedicated
actually to the younger generation yes
it's in the forward yes yeah yes people
think those the young generation feels
okay we will have become MLA will become
a minister maker can be
it's not that easy
and they may become by flu once but that
will be only once
first and last time they will not if
they want to stick and it's not only
politics if they want to go into any
profession
uh they will have to work hard okay and
if they have work and for to be in
politics they have to work okay very
hard that's which is why I have cited
the example what all through I had to go
even in spite of being having worked
with three three prime minister I would
have said pretty uh well easy I should
sit at home I have been I had been a
minister
should I bother but I worked again even
after that as Like a Block Level office
where you're still going because we
cover your rallies and and people are
attending you're still active in in
politics now with your party so I wanted
to ask you about that you know uh time
as chief minister when of course you
write me a broken great detail in in the
in the ticket distribution at the time
of narsimarao you know at the time of
Mufti Muhammad said how is politics from
your experience of campaigning on the
ground of holding your rallies how is
how is it different today than it was 20
30 years ago well I used to get as the
minister ten time less crude I am
getting today 10 times more crowd
so as
independence party
yeah I am getting 10 times more traction
than being in congress party hmm
are you hoping and still in the game sir
for electoral politics I will get at
least
20 times more seed than the congress
party in Jammu Kashmir I I have to ask
you the question sir because uh you know
in terms of
your feedback from the ground and you
know the honest feedback
article 370 you were in opposition of
its revocation I still support three
article 37. in all my interviews even
today I said it was blender on the part
of the government to aggregated
there was a Sentimental attachment
but now three years have gone I usually
assessing yeah yeah that sentimental
attachment we remain there but is
progress happening to someone nothing
India
after the application it's very
difficult to fulfill that but the
government says look the security
situation is improving the stone
fighting is disappeared yeah we're
building the highways and the tunnels
they were already going on highways were
in our time we started it started on
this time
there those are being completely when
you start it as the boat logical
conclusion
are you hopeful of Elections soon
perhaps maybe with the Lok Sabha
election next year maybe we are hoping
the elections much before
you had a very resounding send-off from
Parliament a very emotional speech which
you made you were almost in tears the
Prime Minister made an equally
respectful and
emotional speech some of you are now
former party colleagues say that you are
riding on the crutches of Narendra Modi
is that true
actually they are riding another class
they are making him
I have said today also is not I'm
supporter of Modi the congress party is
the greatest supporter of the god as a
matter of fact the Modi and entire BJP
is praying that this party should
continue under the type of leadership it
is going because as long as this present
leadership and the way Congress is
working if they continue as long as they
continue knew the working and the way
Congress is working
well it will increase the longevity of
the bgp government what is gulab Nabi
azad's hope for the future both for both
for Kashmir your politics there for the
DAP and for the country
first of all I want
the Congress to survive
provided the those who are running the
Congress they wish
Congress to survive I don't think that
any of them wish
few of them maybe
some Outsiders working from somebody
else
ah I can see
because no effort is being made for the
comeback of the Commerce party
so as an old Congressman first of all I
want the Congress to be strengthened by
the congressman
if at all any of them is interested in
spending the Commerce organization
and naturally the street level I wish my
party to come
forward and get more strength Congress
will never survive there is a matter of
fact it never survived
but things are looking difficult I mean
just as we speak uh Anil Anthony's son
has left he's of course in retirement a
lot of people murbers are more might
leave do you think the prospects of the
congress party in 2020 which is why I'm
saying because most of the Communist
leaders workers and of a age group most
worrisome is not is that it's not the
people of my age
the people of Rahul Gandhi's age the
people much younger to Rahul Gandhi they
are leaving the Congress
because they don't see any future there
which is very very some
and those who are running their fears of
the Congress they are not bothered
because few of them they think okay we
alone should be there so that uh
whatever positions are left we'll have
double positions
there are they are more interested in
saving their position
now whether there will be 10 people left
in Congress or 20 people left in regards
the less the people left in Congress
they will be more happier Mr Azad many
people
uh at this stage might have considered
taking the retirement taking a break but
you have chosen not to and it's great to
see your energy in in in politics and
the campaigning and rallies you've been
doing and hundreds of kilometers a day
we get to cover them for people as I
mentioned at the very beginning it's a
very good book to read very educative
it's been
uh an eye-opener for a person like me
because uh as RG of course has been at
the fulcrum of politics before I was
born it is a pleasure to host your news
X wish you all the very best sir thank
you very much

M0ESZ1mQrKM,Labour Party Deselects Indians In Leicester | Anti-India Sentiment Growing in UK? |  NewsX,"Seven Indian-origin labour councillors, six of whom are Hindu and one Christian, were deselected after the labour national ...",2023-04-06T14:08:41Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M0ESZ1mQrKM/hqdefault.jpg,"a big shocking development that has
taken place in Leicester where the labor
party has deselected every single one of
its Hindu councilors in Wake of the
Hindu Muslim attacks that have taken
place the desecration of the temples the
attacks of the Muslims of the islamists
against the Hindus in September 2022 why
has this action been taken why is the
labor party involved is labor party then
pushing forward the agenda of backing
the islamists backing islamist Terror
and spreading Hindu phobia let's open up
this discussion Ambassador Ashok sajanar
my very pointed straightforward question
if this is not the rise of Hindu phobia
that is being pushed forth by a
political party the opposition the main
opposition party in the United Kingdom
then what is
yeah thank you very much Mika for having
me on your show a couple of things one
is that the labor party has
traditionally been opposed to India we
have seen you know its uh former uh
presidents of labor party the You Know
Chief opposition leaders Etc they have
always been uh you know ideologically
they have been opposed to India to
India's rise and so on so forth uh
secondly uh you know in the recent uh uh
violence also we've seen in Leicester
that there have been the Islamic
terrorists who have been involved and
people who had raised their doubts and
who had raised questions about the
manner in which this whole violence was
dealt with by the mayor of Leicester I
think they though those are the people
who have been targeted and they had
spoken about how action had not been
taken on time and very uh you know what
needed to be done had not been done much
stronger stricter action was required
but that was not taken the third point
is I think going Beyond this as we have
seen you know there have been a number
of reports that have come out
in the U.S media there is also the
prevent report and the uh Home Secretary
of the United Kingdom herself has come
out openly saying that it is only
political correctness that has stopped
the British establishment from taking
action against Islamic terrorists okay
and so it is high time that you know the
country woke up to that and I think this
message needs to you know it is not only
in the United Kingdom but I think in a
large number of other countries whether
it is the United States Canada uh
Australia New Zealand you know wherever
there are large number of the Indian
Community whether it is uh you know uh
it is uh you know six or otherwise there
is this element of Hindu phobia and it
is basically being fueled by the Islamic
terrorists and it is being funded and
supported by the isi so people need
really to wake up to this reality okay
all right
um Pandit Satish Sharma your view you're
joining me from Britain uh what's
exactly happening and there has been a
collusion of the isi perhaps and the
Pakistani politicians that are picked up
by the labor party and put up as members
of the parliament in the opposition and
if that's not if if this Leicester
violence that had taken place attacking
the Hindu temples the Hindu people uh
and the Hindu phobia that is being
spread uh is there massive lobbying and
funding that takes place which is being
pumped in by the isi perhaps being
supported by the Chinese for a targeted
attack with the political lineage also
being put in to ensure pressure keeps
building on
[Music]
to everybody who's celebrating it as
well a pleasure to be here with you I
think you've hit the nail on the head
with one of your statements just there
and that is that this has been present
in the labor party for a long time I
made a public announcement in 2013 where
I said that Hindus voting for labor is
like turkeys voting for Christmas and if
you have a look on the internet you'll
see that there were so many
condemnations I was called everything
from islamophobic and all sorts of
nonsense and now a decade later what
we're seeing is the truth of the labor
party being revealed the labor party has
no desire to look after the interests of
its Hindu Community Leicester is one of
the largest urban areas where Hindus
have invested over four generations of
effort and community building and yet
what happened in Leicester we saw
clearly that it was of no value
whatsoever to the political parties the
attacks were on Hindus and what the
labor party did was they actually
flipped the narrative they tried to
convince everybody that the victims were
the perpetrators where was John Ashworth
Member of Parliament who has so much to
say about Kashmir and other issues and
yet on this issue he is Leicester Member
of Parliament he was silent Claudia Webb
the one who was parachuted in from
London into Leicester denying
leicester's Hindus the opportunity to
pick a Hindu as their own representative
where was she she was silent on this
issue you know we have pointed out so
many of these factors as um Debbie
Abrahams who is a parliamentarian for
the labor party she received thirty
thousand pounds directly from the
Pakistani consulate and she was the one
who was encouraged to go to Kashmir and
talk about atrocities being inflicted by
the Indian army so the labor party has
very clearly laid out that it has
absolutely no friendship with the Indian
government certainly not the BJP and
that it has no loyalty whatsoever to the
British Hindu voting public okay this is
Stark and clear and I hope Lester's
Hindu voters and indeed the other voters
of Leicester look at the labor party and
decide does it really want the best
interests of those people who live in
Leicester I don't think so okay okay I'm
going to come to you and I'm also going
to bring about a linkage to the
kalistani attacks that took place in
various parts of the world and
particularly outside the Indian High
Commission in London now we also saw
that pierce cobbin who is the brother of
Jeremy corbyn who used to be the labor
party head he has been removed from his
position since then has also been
backing the khalistani agenda so every
single event that is anti-india
anti-hindu is then being supported by
the labor party can there be action
brought forth in terms of Revelations
and exposes that can be done that this
illegal unsubstantiated funding that
comes from the isi which is a terrorist
organization is then being
harboring his intentions to create Hindu
phobia and allow for islamist terrorism
to exist in the soil on the soils of
United Kingdom uh Mika in this case we
also have to I think understand about uh
the demographic kind of the voters who
vote for the labor and from whatever in
fact we had published a research and
report from London uh some time back I
think two three years back saying the
Indian voters are gradually because they
are more educated they have some kind of
you know the income bracket is going up
as a result of what is happening is that
sorry excuse me
they are shifting away from the labor to
the conservatives and the thing is you
see can I speak a little later because
my okay and I'm gonna give you a break
like that let's get joyita a glass of
water but another same question to you
Islamic terrorism that is being
supported propagated openly by the labor
party opposition party of the United
Kingdom and there's not a finger that is
being raised there is not an eyelid that
is being blinked can there something be
done
uh as uh first of all I want to thank
you for having me here as a free Ashok
ji right in the beginning said that
labor party has never been very cordial
to uh India actually labor party has uh
left leanings also and uh through labor
party this uh Islamic polarization in
London they wanted they want to
destabilize Indian
voting behavior Indian voting system
they also want to
influence these these Kashmir uh issue
they also want to uh hear uh want to
want to change the Mandate for the 24
also which is uh in recent years recent
months it's going to be there so they
are solving so many problems with just
uh with this one uh action of them but
uh I would also like to draw your
attention towards what I what had
happened in USA 21 two zero to one when
they organize a seminar this mentaling
Hinduism so uh this uh issue or this
Intrigue is not very new it's very old
and it is at the same time being uh
perpetuated in Australia then New
Zealand and Pakistan Bangladesh now in
Bhutan and so many other countries that
they want to denounce us so that we
would uh we could leave this Muslim
polarization its impact here on Indian
politics at the same time
we may lose our reputation in
international relations they want to
Brand us as a willing community and also
they want to support less than one
percent of uh the group of Rajasthani
who are not favoring India through the
same action so it's a very big plan and
we need to understand that strategically
also they are actually budgeting the
islamist powerful Nations they are
visiting a new kind of asymmetric work
through this action labor party is one
of the components of that a very
important point is going to seek a
response from you polarizing politics
and that's what the West blames India
and the BJP government when polarizing
politics has been played by the United
Kingdom for years before
of the megha who started you know who
launched who kind of initiated the
policy of divide and rule in India who
which country uh initiated the policy by
their two Nation Theory whose brainchild
was it it was not just Jinnah it was and
when we were talking about divide and
Rule it all came from Britain you see
and that is what we are witnessing in
Britain also so you see I'm going to
quote from some uh in 2019 a
london-based think tank called Running
meat trust had shown that the
conservative vote shared among British
voters of Indian origin is steadily On
The Rise while labor support among
British voters of Pakistani and
Bangladesh she origin has risen even
further in recent times and this was
particularly ahead of what Jeremy corbyn
was when Jeremy corbyn was there he was
openly asking for sanctioning Mr Modi at
that time and I mean they had completely
gone off the rails so you see when
you're looking at them increasingly when
it comes to the voting pattern and
voters from with origins in the
subcontinent the labor is increasingly
moving towards Pakistani Muslims and
Bangladeshi Muslims now this is because
also primarily over I think one of the
reasons being that the demography of it
the economy economic heft of these
communities because when you are looking
at the Indian Community in Britain what
we are witnessing is that they have kind
of they are gradually gradually they are
kind of their economic power is
increasing as it is happening in the U.S
also
but that is not the case with the
bangladeshis and the Pakistani is who
are there in Britain because they are
all into their blue-collar workers
absolutely and the Indians are in the
White Collar jobs they are more
prosperous they are Traders as a result
of which I what has been happening is
that this uh this pakistanis and the
bangladeshis they tend to identify with
the labor much more than they would be
identified with the conservative party I
mean I would say around 2017 18 years
when Jeremy corbyn was the leader about
85 to 90 percent of this community they
were voting labor
now when that kind of movement happens
that's a consolidation what exactly
happens in our country as well people
think that the Muslim Community can be
wood and they will be I mean voting as a
block okay that is the same reason it's
the same logic that is working in the UK
so because the number one the Hindus are
increasingly getting identified with the
conservatives interestingly and think of
educational is um
I mean after all he's a conservative so
you see all these things are coming into
play and as a result of which what we
are witnessing is that now these small
small things that happened on the ground
it's a reflection of a bigger malaise
okay okay all right uh a master sajan
are quick a quick response from you for
the second round of responses that I
seek from all my panelists uh what must
India do Hindu phobia On The Rise
whether you see Australia whether it's
UC UK Canada America
can action be taken can political clout
be shown can diplomatic Cloud be shown
for a quid pro quo and pressure being
put on the governments of the day
yeah thank you very much Mika for those
questions and you know one comment on
that I think increasingly particularly
in the United Kingdom we see that it is
World Bank politics that is driving the
labor party to sort of identify and
align itself much more with the uh you
know with the diaspora population from
Pakistan than from India and we have
seen in the current case also those who
have been denied tickets by the labor
party they are either standing as
Independents or they are moving over to
the uh conservative party now what can
India do to your question I think India
can do a great deal India is already
doing a great deal and you know in terms
of pushing back against the
establishments where these sort of
incidents are happening you would recall
megha that when these incidents had
taken place uh outside the high
commission Indian High Commission in
London just a few weeks ago and then
India had sent out a very strong message
that this this indifference of the UK
authorities in safeguarding Indian
establishment Indian Personnel Indian
diplomatic territory that is
unacceptable I think that's a strong
message our relations we need to
recognize megha with all these countries
are growing by Leaps and Bounds you know
we are looking at a UK India FDA also
with Canada with Australia we already
have one we have signed one with the
United States our relations are at an
old time high so I think it is a
mutually
advantages uh situation that these
countries also take very serious note
and cognizance of what we are telling
them because I think the underlying the
Subterranean message Omega can be that
if our people are not their welfare is
not safeguarded or Embassy Personnel or
consulates their welfare and their
security is not fully assured then there
is going to be price to pay there are
going to be consequences okay and this
message goes out I think it will
definitely have an impact okay Pandit
Satish then uh is there any Solace that
Rishi sunak is at the helm of Affairs as
the prime minister of UK does that help
the cause of Hindus living in the
country
well with it being um Hanuman genti I
think the phrase
should spring to mind and I think that
the fact that Rishi sunak is a Hindu by
label is more powerful than anything he
will do by virtue of being a Hindu I
don't think there is anything
um tangible that he can do either as
prime minister he has to attend to the
interests of this country first and
foremost and I think that's what he will
do but I'd just like to conclude very
quickly on one point please note that
the rise of hatred against Hindus is
something that has been seeded for a
long period of time this hatred doesn't
just manifest over a period of months it
has to be seeded it has to be watered it
has to be nurtured it has to be
protected and then when it begins to
bear fruit it's being harvested and what
we're being we're seeing now is the
beginning of that long-term program of
seeding hatred against Hindus to be
being harvested and you know in our
tradition every child is born without
malice is with this born without hatred
and so if you want these things to
literally transfer and survive over
Generations you have to institutionalize
them okay the question we have to ask is
who has been seeding hatred of Hindus
for such a long period of time the labor
party is one such institution and all of
the institutions which use this and
leverage it for political Advantage we
have to scrutinize them and hold them to
account okay now a quick response from
your 30 seconds how does in the how
should India tackle this whether if it's
kalistani islamist terrorists if they
are being given safe harbors in all
these countries uh how difficult does it
become a task for India to bring down
this anti-terrorist anti-sectionist
activities against India
so far UK is concerned because this is
the time for elections there so I don't
think that the conservative party would
jump into this matter the second thing
is diplomatic channel is the best way to
represent the sentiments ideas and
emotions of uh people of India that
second the third strategy may be media
if media is very vocal as you have
picked up the show so media is vocal
this will be registered there and the
next one is people there people from
India there and here should also they
raise their voice so that it could be
noticed well uh throughout the world
because we are large in number and we
are really very genuine people so we
will definitely be heard so if this is
done I think we will be victorious okay
quickly before I wrap this conversation
up uh in how how do we Safeguard our
borders because of the social movements
whether it is the kashmiri separatists
or the kalistani secessionist movement
that has been given impetus in all these
countries especially in United Kingdom
how do we stop it
I have I've been saying this for a very
long time and that is these people can
do zilch to India zero okay the Indian
Mainland I'm talking about you see they
can only uh go after the soft targets
the high commission which is not
protected at the particular time the
temple the Hindu families may be
isolated homes and that is what we are
witnessing in uh England the UK we are
witnessing in Canada also in this thing
is so it is ultimately the
responsibility of the country's
concerned to ensure that the least
that they can do is that they maintain
Law and Order but yes we should be very
very Mindful and watchful how the
situation develops now because there is
a strong Buzz that the labor is going to
sweep the next elections in the UK so
what happens then because you see here
is a party which is dependent on when it
comes to voters of South Asian origin
they're dependent on pakistanis and
bangladeshis they have got MPS like the
tanman something Desi guy yeah okay who
are basically out and out khalistani
although I don't know in spite of being
that what he was doing at Rahul Gandhi's
Parliament meet that he had in the UK
this guy was there then you would be
surprised to perhaps not be surprised
because because during the farmer
protest he had made a visit to Punjab
and it is being suspected that he was
meeting these kalistani supporters I'm
completely out of time I thank all my
panelists for joining me on The Telecast
but we are going to take up this
campaign we are going to put the media
pressure on the labor party and expose
it we've already done that today but
this remains a sustained campaign in the
hope that there are going to be anti
labor party forces in United Kingdom who
are going to take up the cause of the
Hindus and stop the Hindu phobia from
further spreading thanks for watching

Hindu temple the baptistry swaminarayan
mandir in Windsor in the province of
Ontario Ontario in Canada was vandalized
with anti-india graffiti on Tuesday
night in an email to members of the
Hindu Federation in Canada a
representative of the baps organization
said the incident was reported to the
local police for the for for the
immediate necessary action images
attached to the email show slogans
against India and prime minister
Narendra Modi this is the fifth such
incident where a temple has been defaced
with such graffiti since July last year
on the broadcast with us is joaita Basu
on the phone line yet another hate crime
Hindu phobic attack in in Canada the
fifth such attack in recent times
uh yes I mean we have been hearing about
all these attacks coming I mean
happening in Australia and of course we
saw what happened uh in England as well
the UK and Canada of course has always
been you see there are two uh possible
uh suspects in this case this could be
the islamists or these could be the
kalistanis so uh even it is Ontario even
it's a hotbed of kalistani activities
that there are many of these places
where these are you know these people
are anti-india they try to Hound people
of Indian origin even though most even
though all of them are of Indian origin
even then they believe that you know
they can actually by sitting in Canada
in Ontario they will be able to
carve out kalistan from India so these
people have been responsible for a
series of hate attacks not just in
Canada also in the U.S also also by the
way it has been happening we all also
how these people attacked the San
Francisco Consulate of India and
gandhiji's statue has been defaced so
many times so the thing is you see the
problem is
not uh it it I would say the problem is
not so much that khalistanis but the
problem is actually on
accountability is missing when it comes
to Law and Order the problem is with the
local police with the law enforcement
agencies with the politicians and what
happens in Canada is that they turn up
they are very wary of taking on these
basically semi-terrorists if you ask me
they are taking them on because they are
worried about that having an effect on
their votes well because these people
can kind of gather maybe 100 000 people
meaning one lakh people for one
particular
program so these Canadian politicians
they are all very wary of taking them
head on as a result of which you see as
a collateral I mean because of the
increase in this problem that is
happening in a radicalization of a
section of the diaspora as I said these
are all people part of the diaspora now
as a result of which they are angered
against India their anger is against
Modi is getting reflected in this way
they are targeting the soft target you
see they can do zero to India but the
problem is that the soft target can uh
affect it and this is what exactly it is
so it is until and unless the law
enforcement agencies take action unless
and until there is serious action taken
I mean this will continue and that is
why we have our government has to okay
constantly ensure that this is made up
part of any dialogue that takes place
with any bilateral with any country
where any attack on Indians Hindus and
Hindu temples take place for more such

headgear former Pakistani prime minister
Imran Khan appeared before an
anti-terrorism Court in Lahore seeking
bail in three cases registered against
him in connection with the clashes that
took place between his supporters and
the police outside his residence in
Lahore last month by opting for this
attire the PTI Chief highlighted the
bursting security situation in the
neighboring country amid averaging
economic crisis remember viewers these
claims of assassination threats come
after the former prime minister was a
tracked last year in wazirabad during a
political rally
all right we have Sanji srivastava and
shrivjan Singh continued to be on the
broadcast with us Colonel saying how do
you view this because it looks comical
almost what is happening but it is also
a very serious situation for Pakistan
there seems to be a complete uh
turmoil internal crisis Brewing
see it shows what kind of internal
crisis are there in Pakistan
Pakistan is already suffering with
financial crisis at the same time
internal security is not very good there
there is lot of uncertainty
because of which Imran Khan is wearing
that kind of headgear which you are
telling
so he is scared for his life
and he had already said
that while appearing in the court he
might be assassinated
by terrorist groups which are operating
on behalf of army
so in Pakistan internal situation is
very very bad
there is a lot of uncertainty masses
nobody knows whether he will see
tomorrow or not
Imran Khan being a former prime minister
had clarified and screwed to the world
that bad kind of internal situation is
there in Pakistan
is also on the broadcast with us Mr
srivastav uh now on the one hand you see
a complete turmoil politically going on
there's a security situation with the
TTP as well uh there is an economic
crisis in Pakistan as well uh amidst all
this we have seen these claims being
made by Imran Khan over and over again
uh especially after he was attacked at
the rally last year uh all in all where
do you see this going for Pakistan from
here on well well you know Imran Khan is
there very
the political personality in Pakistan
and Imran Khan you know has been
challenging not only the Sabbath Sharif
government but he challenging the real
rulers of Pakistan
that is Pakistan Army and isi and if you
recall uh in recent times uh dgisi had
to you know organize it generally uh
intelligence agencies do not carry out
this kind of exercises they do not
appear into press conferences but the
dgisi had to you know come for a press
conference and in those in that space
conscience he had in a criticized Imran
Khan and his party Pakistan carry cancer
that shows that's a real rules of
Pakistan they are also under special
because of the challenge and criticisms
which are being you know pushed by you
know Imran Khan and Imran Khan is
obviously having a serious stretch on
his life in my assessment he should be
careful and uh the kind of you know
precautions he's taking while appearing
in the court I think he's taking a right
a decision uh because it has been a
history of Pakistan that if a leader
becomes very popular and and if the
leader becomes a kind of a challenge to
the establishment of Pakistan then the
person is likely to be you know
eliminated assassinated Etc we have seen
the case of Benji Bhutto we have seen
the case of her father uh Joseph in the
past so I think uh Imran Khan is taking
right action as you mentioned that uh in
November and vajirabad uh one attempt
had been made on his life and he
narrowly survived and a lot of cases are
going on around about 80 cases are going
on on against him so I think all sorts
of hurdles are being put before him to
stop him from coming back into power and
in that process it will not be a
surprise that if any assassination
attempts is taken against his life yet
again so I think he's taking away right
action and I think is uh his security
must be on the very very high alert and
that's what precisely is doing uh and uh
when appearing in the court he is having
fear that he might be assassinated and
the way you know we have seen the
footages of how Benji Bhutto was
attacked he was a short on her head so I
think uh the head gear when he is
wearing obviously he's taking a right
step in my assessment uh and uh because
he's become a big Challenger to the uh
entire establishment of Pakistan that is
why his life is in the set at this point
of time and I think he should take care
uh in the future also while appearing in
courts for more such videos subscribe to

been planned take us through the details
ah
my Ramadan to everyone and
today the
Blissful Blissful day of each and every
worker and above all today is Hanuman
jayanti Israel so I wish
all the good things in the life of each
and every sanatani or the rambhat and
Hanuman Bhatt as well and definitely
into this if we talk about bharti janta
party it is the only political party in
our country which works on the
Democratic line and it is the biggest
largest river
so definitely a it is something to
cherish and the confidence and the trust
which has been bestowed on us by the
people of this great country
reflects in the elections as well when
we when any election definitely it is a
momentary uh celebration for us because
we start working again to win the
confidence of the people to keep their
expectations uh from bharti janta party
upright as well so definitely the
leadership in today's date of bharti
janta party is a leadership Which is
popular not only in India but brand
world this is not the bhatijanta party
spokesperson thing but different
agencies which do survey they reflect
the characteristics that yes is the most
popular leader in the world and the way
he we filled our country through the
trauma time of covet it is an example in
itself so definitely if we talk about
the economy if we talk about any of the
verticals on human development index I
think uh central government in India is
doing fantastic job and we are blessed
to have a leader like Narendra Modi ji
and our party bharti janta parties
is doing fantastic job the the way he
takes the organization I am so strongly
so that the party can become strong and
the way we work I think it is an example
in itself and the other parties should
also take a lesson because they all
believe in China crazy nepotism but
bhatijanda party definitely believes in
democracy right a short while ago ma'am
the PM also addressed the party members
when certain projects for the BJP party
members were launched including
residential complexes he of course made
several important statements uh today
also he's expected to address the party
members uh what are your expectations uh
from the speech today
see whenever a senior leader from our
party or the party's leadership for the
president of the bharti janta party
whenever they address the nation or the
party workers it is always
in the
um in the way that how we can benefit
this great country people living in this
great nation of ours so for us the motto
is Nation first party next then yourself
party Bharat is above everything so you
are going to see that whatever whatever
the speech is going to be delivered by
the leadership or the party president it
will definitely going to encourage the
party workers to work more for the
nation to devote their life for this
nation so this is the motto this is the
Asian that this is the Mission Vision of
party janta party so is
uh given that we are heading towards a
national election now uh what is the
environment within the party office uh
amid the workers right now
then definitely I'll say it is a party
of very humble workers because again I
will say that we take inspiration from
our leaders senior leaders in the way
they take their life from the prism of
Simplicity that is the motto and uh you
can like you have to serve the nation

right reasons for the very first time a
former United States president has been
arrested Donald Trump has been arrested
over allegations of paying hush money to
an adult movie star the big question is
where are all the self-proclaimed
saviors of democracy Now the India
Bashers who have a lot of say and
discuss in the American Parliament when
it comes to Indian Affairs are now
silent about Trump's arrest where is uh
in fact rokanna who said rahul's
disqualification is the death of
democracy is what is happening in the
U.S now not the real death of democracy
where are Greta thundberg and Rihanna
who are quick to share toolkits during
the farmer's protests where is pramila
jayapal and all those from the U.S
Congress who took off upon themselves to
discuss Kashmir where is their fight for
democracy and human rights now that a
former president of their own nation has
been arrested no comments from them or
on an unprecedented arrest on U.S soil
this is the hypocrisy that we're going
to expose and talk about with our guests
joining me on the show at this point in
time is
former diplomat
Global strategist with us on the program
as well editor of the Sunday Guardian
also joining us on the program
Ambassador you've been following these
updates for uh for a while now Donald
Trump uh you know has made history in
the wrong Reef for the wrong reasons
but the fact of the matter is you know
this exposes the hypocrisy with which a
number of people operate around the
world you know if India even makes an
iota of a decision to mind its own
internal business you know their guns
and swords out against uh you know the
sepois if we can call them of democracy
but when such a big thing happens you
know the former president is arrested
arraigned indicted for for you know
crimes are which are immoral as well as
illegal you know there is hardly any
reference to it on social media what do
you think is going on here
yeah you're absolutely right vineet when
you say that you know there is uh a
great uh dichotomy you know in terms of
the responses that uh the global
Community particularly as far as the
West is concerned you know two
developments two events that take place
in India and uh to events that take
place in the west so to say and I think
uh this should be really uh a wake-up
call as far as all these champions of
democracy are concerned to look uh you
know inwards to look within and find
that you know what has been going wrong
as far as their own system is concerned
I think they
what the external affairs minister has
said and I would uh you know tend to
agree with him and you know this has
been evident in more cases than one
number one what uh Dr jaishankar said
that the Western countries uh think that
it is their god-given right that they
can comment in the internal affairs that
they are the guardians of democracy of
human rights of rule of law so they have
uh all the uh you know the authority to
comment uh adversely on whatever is
happening particularly in developing
countries that is number one number two
you know taking it forward these
countries do not do their homework at
all they don't find you know they don't
see uh what is uh uh how the processes
have been followed how they have gone
through and this is true not only as far
as individuals are concerned but this is
also as far as media houses are
concerned you know just to give you the
few examples in this as far as this case
is concerned you know anyone if this had
happened in
any developing country in India you know
the whole world would have risen saying
that this is the principal opposition
leader and he has for you know some
misdemeanor right it might be a
misdemeanor but does it really call for
the uh arrest of the individual and this
would have been you know what Donald
Trump has been saying that this is a
political Vendetta this is a sham this
is uh you know all of them working
against him to stop him because he is uh
you know one of the contenders for the
presidential election next year but of
course there has been nothing now
similarly you know whatever uh the two
instances in India as far as Rahul
Gandhi's case is concerned you know
whatever is the law the law has been
followed to the t uh you know to very
meticulously and without going into the
merits of the case without going into
the processes of the case there are
people who sort of you know
jump out and say that you know democracy
is being threatened and there's death to
democracy similarly you would see even
as far as the BBC documentary that we
have discussed on your channels some
time ago there are also what has been
the background of the case how the case
has evolved in India and for the BBC in
terms of its timing and in terms of its
determination how very fallacious it is
but that is not taken on board so I
think definitely uh this is something
that needs to be brought to the the
so-called Protectors of democracy in the
west and they should be made to realize
that unless they do a little bit of
number one soul searching number two
when they are commenting on anything
happening in other countries
particularly a country like India which
is uh you know the Bedrock of democracy
where it is very robust democracy with
the Independent Media and fearless
Judiciary Etc uh you know they should do
their homework otherwise people in these
countries are also going to
start commenting on whatever is
happening in these countries in the
developed countries and they are not
going to like it and this we have seen
has already happened whether it is the
president of El Salvador who has
commented adversely on these
developments or the prime minister of
Hungary who has commented adversely and
maybe we will find more voices also
vineeth
all right great points there jothabasu
with me in the studio as well well you
know Donald Trump is saying that this is
a Witch Hunt against him and obviously
the law is being tweaked you know it
sits it's being uh twisted uh you know
to accommodate his failures but the fact
of the matter is that there are a number
of people who jump to the slightest of
issues in news coming off out of India
and making them an international problem
uh where are those people when it comes
to their own country
well the thing is you see when you are
looking at them they think this is
Justice being served in fact but I mean
I would say the whatever is happening in
the U.S right now is Trump being
punished for daring to become the prime
I mean president of the United States I
think it has more to do with that than
actually law uh taking its own course
because uh if you are I mean we are
following lots of these news websites
and all which are conducting a lot of
investigation and as it is being it is
being found that this particular judge
for example he has strong connections
with the Democratic Party in the sense
that this guy was donating this judge
who has passed this uh I mean who is
kind of presiding over the case right
now now he has been donating to Joe
Biden's
um campaign campaign apart from that he
has donated money to a particular outfit
which says that Republic Republicans
should not be allowed Trump should not
be allowed to be anywhere near the
presidency yes his daughter has worked
on Kamala Harris's vice presidential uh
I mean when she was basically there she
had worked under Kamala Harris so you
see there is a lot of conflict of
interest going on here then this
particular district attorney this brag
Alvin Bragg now it seems now he is going
around deleting all the profiles of his
personal from his Twitter and from his
website because all of them are found to
be extreme left people not even
Democrats they had extreme left people
who are all involved in throughout their
career or for the last few years they
have been continuously involved in terms
of uh tweeting against Donald Trump uh
acting again in issues and cases and
being part of groups which are
virulently anti-trump now you see what
happens when you know I am constantly
whenever I am raising the listen I am
not pro-trump I'm not providing I'm just
an outsider
we are just on Lucas we are just
observers but the fact of the matter is
that when you are picking up this issue
of democracy and you see legal where
apparently legal the Judiciary is and
the whole legal system is supposed to be
one of the pillars of democracy if it is
seen to be compromised right at the
beginning if this Alvin Bragg guy is
seen to be pursuing a case which is
entirely possible it's just not one case
it's 34 felony counts yes two which
said that he is not guilty number one as
you would as you would right yeah but
then you see that is the whole point we
are not we are not here to support
s Donald Trump right
now of course there are 34 cases but
then there are lots of voices coming out
of the US saying ultimately this thing
will not hold because they are all
frivolous all right and you have opened
old cases all sorts of things they have
done so it is all politically motivated
and the sad part is you see the U.S
which claims the moral leadership of the
world as the world's most uh as the
world's oldest democracy quote unquote
oldest democracy and apparently a
democracy where everything functions
beautifully what is the U.S proving to
be that it is a legal system its justice
system is compromised it's political it
is totally politicized I mean the U.S is
polarized to such an extent that you
cannot even have a proper investigation
and then think of it like this these
people have the goal to lecture us
think of it like this they have the goal
to talk about what Rahul Gandhi case and
that case is by the way still going on
okay Rahul Gandhi is not in jail Mr
Trump is in jail okay that is Richard
what has happened is Richard so the
whole thing is that these people they
say that we are the world leader we
always write the high horse all of you
are guilty of human rights violations I
think that they came out with some 52
pages of uh India's human rights
violations in in that particular uh
indexment they did not mention the U.S
anywhere so when you have people like
this sitting on this so what we are
going to witnessing as an outsider as an
Indian I would say we are seeing what
the US is itself is a sham do you think
do you think this should be discussed in
the Indian Parliament as to what's
happening with Trump and should be
admonished and rebuked and criticized
should why not right no the thing is
that you see no at least our ministry of
external life we should have a stand at
least we should have a standard exactly
our ministry of external Affairs should
at least give out a statement saying
that you know let us hope Justice does
not fall victim to partisan politics
absolutely but will our Emir do that
maybe you can draft that statement for
them maybe you can draft that statement
to them yes why not Mrs Dev what do you
make of this you know from what joyita
says you know it seems like the
Americans have made maybe even
temporarily so a Banana Republic of
themselves you know the former president
being you know paraded like this the
justice system you know taking him to
court for uh allegations we are not sure
how serious they are but if he does get
convicted he's going to jail for 136
years
that means if he's going to jail for 136
years if he dies and he comes back he
has to go back to jail
well karma is a dash dash dash okay uh
uh okay
ambassadors are very well captured you
know and the nuances out there uh I
absolutely much agree with them I'll
look at it from another perspective one
who said that the world is fair
why why people pick and choose what they
want to for their own biases third see
the U.S has
or had a lot of credibility
and its eating off of that credibility
account you know since you have a bank
account or balance why are we shocked
about this you know it's the month of
April uh in 2023 you've already had more
than 100 shootings in this country so
why are we surprised that this is
happening in the United States people
are feeling people are killing
themselves yeah absolutely I mean the
U.S is in very difficult and challenging
times one quick point on Judiciary yes
you see the nature of Judiciary in the
U.S is that these are either elected
that is either supporting by Democrats
or Republicans or they have nominated
political nominees now we may be saying
that Trump is being hounded by the
Democrats right what about the abortion
bill in the Supreme Court of the U.S
which was overturned because
in the Supreme Court Donald Trump
appointed a republican kneeling or not
one he's appointed more but he got to
appoint one more Supreme Court Justice
which turned the balance in the Supreme
Court
so all the judgments of the Supreme
Court which are now coming are coming
which are aligned with the Republican
conservative ideology
so it's happening I mean it's a fact of
life in the U.S that a Judiciary and
judicial system
is structured in a way that the
attorneys are elected and you know
another thing that has happened today Mr
says Dave Stormy Daniels has been
instructed by a court to pay Donald
Trump uh 120 000 yeah that's in the
ninth circuit and in fact the lady who's
contesting the case for Trump hermit
till now we know her reasonably well
she's been a member of her committee
also so she put out a tweet actually
last night when this was going on in
fact the news channels were running you
know misleading headlines some of them
last night when Trump was being
arraigned they were saying that this
judge in New York has ordered Stormy
Daniels to pay 132 000 to Trump so that
was pretty confusing but later on as
you're rightly saying it came out that
that's a very different totally
different case of deformation in which
in California 9 circuit I think where
stormy and Alice has been asked to pay
the legal fees of the Trump uh of the
Trump side so to say of trump you know
which he anchored so the point is the
judicial system the Judiciary in the U.S
right up to Supreme Court
is political
okay and the huge battle in the Supreme
Court he would know very well our
viewers would know and our esteem police
would know of course the importance of
one Supreme Court Judge being appointed
is he a Democrat
does Obama get to appoint him or does
Trump get to appoint him or does Biden
have opportunity to appoint the retiring
or dead quote unquote unfortunately to
use the word Supreme Court judges so
they picked their partisan judges and
the judgments comes that that way so
that's what's happening in the uh you
know district attorney case he is
definitely abided uh supporter or his
worldview alliance with the liberal what
who Biden feels so that's the way the
American judicial system is structured
now coming back to what they are saying
and where they are what I feel has
happened is that the U.S has let's give
it to them yeah but but you know the big
question but the big question is
Ambassador You know despite all of these
Oddities and these issues why censure
India
no absolutely right uh uh vineeth you
are absolutely right vicentia India and
uh this is exactly what you know Dr Jay
Shankar has said that they seem they
consider it to be their god-given right
to criticize developing countries and
particularly India you know meaning
which is uh they should realize that it
has uh uh you know and as the uh the
president of the United States has also
said it is a democracy it is a very
vibrant democracy it's a very robust
democracy and it is a role model for a
democracy because India has demonstrated
that it uh democracies can deliver
otherwise you know the challenge that
the democracies have found is that fine
at the political level the elections
take place there is rule of law human
rights protected freedom of speech
expression media etc etc but when it
comes to delivering a better life a
better standard of living to its people
they have not really been successful and
that is why you have you find you know
these uh autocratic and authoritarian
systems like the Chinese who will come
around and say you know that our system
is better because we are able to
have discipline we are able to have Law
and Order and we are also able to give a
better standard of living to our people
and which democracies are not able to do
and they sort of point fingers at the
sort of thing that happened in the
United States at the U.S Capitol Hill on
6th of January 2021 when there was a
complete breakdown of the systems there
but India is uh uh uh you know an
entirely different case because
notwithstanding its challenges it's a
huge country 1.3 1.4 billion people so
much of diversity so much of poverty you
know when India got independence we had
about 12 percent literacy rate in our
country today we are much above 70 so
you know over all these years how India
has moved how India has
progressed how India has grown that
should really be a role model and
democracies like the United States like
Western Europe should be embracing India
as and projecting it as a role model for
the other developing countries you know
whether it is in Africa or it is in
Latin America rather than going around
and casting Expressions on Indian legal
system Indian judicial system so I think
basically it is they consider it uh you
know what earlier it was said that they
suffer from some sort of a colonial
mindset you know I would not lay their
charge at the door of the United States
because they were never a colonizer so
to say but the mindset seems to be of a
similar nature that you know if it is a
developing country then obviously there
must be something going wrong as far as
they are concerned all right well Greta
thunberg 20 years of page has spewed
poison against India on a number of
occasions and you know this selective
outrage uh you know which we have seen
from some of these uh environmentalists
and activists part-time activists like
Rihanna uh and uh Navratilova you know
it's it's becoming an irritant for India
because if you're talking about balance
if you're talking about uh you know
picking up the right causes you know it
has to be done under the justification
of it is to be done wherever the problem
is the thing is you see let's first of
all say ah it's not so easy to quote
unquote irritate India okay they are at
the most flies which you just flick away
when they sit on you you just flick them
away frankly I mean that is the kind of
value they have and anyway we all know
Rihanna and what Greta Thornburg are all
about when they were talking about that
Farmer's protests and we also know who
recruited them and the only thing that
has not come out is how much money
Rihanna was paid to talk about the
farmers by the jagmeet Singh whatever
jagmeet Singh kalistani guy who sits in
Canada so I would not talk about them
and but the my problem is you see it is
we know we know very well you know even
that abortion thing was totally wrong on
sitting in India we found it absolutely
appalling so there were lots of mistakes
that Trump made or deliberately did to
appoint the kind of Judges so it's not a
question of just you know what the
political parties do in terms of
appointing judges the problem starts
when you know you built the whole
intention there are two things that I
see in this particular case happening
number one as I mentioned Also earlier
it's about
punishing Trump for becoming the
president okay so and number two it is
about to ensure so that Trump never ever
dares to uh uh contest all right and
that is the fundamental problem you are
basically
politicizing a process you are muzzling
somebody he could be bad let the voters
decide he could be awful terrible
horrendous let the Republican members
them you know their people they decide
whether he is fit to be their candidate
or not I personally think Trump is unfit
okay they should move on to somebody
like Ron DeSantis or someone may be
equally energetic and a little sane
Trump has landed in this trouble because
he comes across as very
uncivilized uncouth that is the reason
why he has landed himself in trouble
but the fact is that just because you
hate one fully one personality okay does
not mean that you will use means and
methods to ensure that that person that
is not even given a fair chance to do
what is his what his right is because
that is undemocratic and that is the
fundamental problem that you know this
is the problem that I have say for
example and lots of other people also
have but the charge is that he paid
Stormy Daniels this amount of money
under the Garb of saying it was legal
fee and this legal fee was then again
given by Michael Cohen to Stormy Daniels
so in a way if Michael Cohen has gone to
prison for three years why is Donald
Trump still out is what the prosecution
is saying the thing is that when you are
looking at it like the courts decide we
are not sitting here to decide you know
what the case is about for all you know
Trump may come out with come up with
certain things which will actually hold
in court okay that you cannot do it so
what happens I mean to me the U.S seems
to be making a caricature of all the
values it stands for in fact I wrote I
tweeted today not only the caricature
part that the U.S is starting to
resemble a sad cartoon and who benefits
in all this
there is only one country there's China
actually sitting and watching enjoying
the chaos they would love the U.S to
slide down sooner or later U.S is going
to be number two in China and it's
laughing its way back to the Wuhan lab
yeah that's what China is doing well
we're going to take a break on this note
but uh we're going to continue to talk
about how you know this double standard
is uh being propelled by a number of
people and in fact continents and

Central Bureau of Investigation and of
course the enforcement directorate
against opposition leaders and seeking a
fresh set of guidelines governing the
arrest Rahman and bail the opposition
parties will have withdrawn their plea
from the Supreme Court as the top Court
refuses to entertain the plea
all right well the opposition parties
disappointed at this point in time the
Supreme Court has
said that this is something that it
cannot entertain and what's going to be
Plan B for the opposition parties who
have continuously alleged that agencies
have been used against them especially
the opposition the enforcement
directorate the income tax department as
well as the CBI
but the Supreme Court has dismissed this
plea in the opposition parties or
perhaps in a hurdle once again
to figure out what's going on over here
my colleague joins me on the broadcast

hmm
all right well the Supreme Court has
dismissed The Plea which was filed by

also basically indicated that they need
to go back and go back to the drawing
board and figure out how they can
counter the BJP right before the 2024
elections

Court did not deem fit to be entertained

cvD-LAIWcYQ,Australia Bans Chinese App Tik-Tok | Step Over Security Concerns | NewsX,"To Subscribe our YouTube channel ""NewsX"" click on the link below:- https://www.youtube.com/user/newsxlive/ Watch More ...",2023-04-04T07:52:00Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cvD-LAIWcYQ/hqdefault.jpg,"the Australian government of course said
that it would remove the tick tock from
all federal government-owned devices
over security concerns becoming the
latest U.S Allied country to initiate
action against the chinese-owned video
app now the move underscores the growing
worries that China's government could
use the beijing-based company owned by
by turns to harvest users data to
advance its political agenda now
undermining Western Security interests
as well we've seen earlier as as soon as
the U.S banned Tick-Tock on all
government devices and uh and government
official devices as well as some
government provided devices in federal
agencies in the White House and several
other agencies as well for security
forces now Australia is following a
similar path they are also going to be
banning tick tock on government issued
devices and for government officials
earlier of course we saw that China was
provoked by this particular move by the
U.S and had said that unfair action was
being taken against Chinese companies is
what
China had said
joining us on the broadcast Nikita take
us through these developments uh now
we're learning that after the U.S
Australia is now uh going to be banning
Tick Tock yes RT we are getting as we
are getting to know that Australia is
now going to ban the Chinese
entertainment haptic talk but um but the
important thing that is to note is that
Australia is going to be the 13th
country to ban Tick-Tock uh you know
before this Afghanistan India U.S
Belgium Canada
um Denmark among other countries have
banned Tick Tock except for that we also
are getting to know that all of this is
uh
to ensure that China does not get to
harvest other users data and does not
get to use it against the countries it
is just to ex although all the Western
nations are taking this step to ensure
that there's no political agenda that
China is trying to run uh behind behind
having Tick Tock being run in the
different countries and this is just to
safeguard their security interests and
therefore Australia has also taken this
step right Nikita also take us through
what exactly Australia is going to be
doing in terms of banning a tick tock is
it just on government devices or like
some U.S states are there looking at a
blanket ban no so they are definitely
not looking at a blanket ban for now
they are mainly going to focus on the
government officers all the government
officers are to definitely uninstall a
tick tock from their devices and this
has to this comes a while uh Anthony
Albanese is all set to return to power
in May while uh all of this is going on
the ban will come into effect as the
eternalian Attorney General of Australia
has said that it will try to make sure
that this comes into practice as soon as
possible because uh the exemptions uh
can only be granted on case-to-case
basis otherwise this is for security and
this has to be applied to all the
government devices right so thank you
for joining us Nikita and sharing those
details on the story I'm also being
joined by International Affairs experts
Sanjeev srivastav on the broadcast uh
sir we're talking about how after the
United States Australia is now looking
at Banning Tick Tock earlier we saw how
China had retaliated after that saying
that it was unfair action being taken by
the United States and it also warned
against retaliatory action now we have
also seen some points of contention
between Australia and China already
existing now after this particular Tick
Tock ban that comes into effect for
government officers how do you see China
reacting
well I know China will react uh the
weight has been reacting saying that it
will take counter measures Etc but the
fact of the matter is that a tick tock
is uh appears to be a a spy Tool uh by
uh China you know on the various data uh
which is uh uh which Tick Tock uh
collects uh through its app uh uh it's
quite uh possible it's at a high
possibility that it is uh it gets access
of the Chinese Authority and they keep a
close watch on the various activities
around the globe by this app and you
know uh recently what we had also seen
that the in the uh you know one of the
hearings The Tick Tock CEO the way he
was uh you know ambiguous in his replies
by saying that uh whether the tick tock
data is accessed by Chinese authorities
in the complex in a question complex
matter and then it was whether any when
it was is interested upon that you say
as oh no he said no then I think this
kind of uh you know uh ambiguous
responses which I think talk to you had
given uh clearly you know uh uh clearly
pointed out that the uh not uh not uh
Fair practices are being done by The
Tick Tock company and they just dance
bite and the entire app is uh very much
was another question and now Australia
has taken this decision the attitude of
America has debated it and also before
that India had already banned it so I
think the tick tock must not be allowed
to function in a democratic country
because it is a spying tool it is being
used by Chinese authorities to collect
data around the globe and China is known
for for spinal deputies and so which
they try to weaken adversities because
they believe in the Soldier's philosophy
that to win a war you have to first
weaken the uh adversary and the best the
outcome of any work could be that this
war is one without a fight so this kind
of a notion China is having and uh
should ask me to follow and that is why
entire world is alarmed you know
Democratic countries are alarmed about
the Chinese inspiring activities and
that is why such measures are being
taken I think Australia has taken a
writer step in the right direction I
think other Democratic countries should
also follow the same thing the kind of
balloons against especially we have seen
the same kind of tick tock is also
trying to do in other words through
these apps so I think uh we must be you
know alarmed about Chinese Espionage
activities accordingly no measures
should be taken and Australia has taken
a right decision for more such videos

judge has issued a ruling that no video
cameras would be allowed in the
courtroom where the former U.S president
Donald Trump will be arraigned and he
had given a nod only to a handful of
photographers who will be allowed to
take pictures inside the premises of the
Court while the arraignment is taking
place
I have foreign policy expert joining us
on the broadcaster by learning that of
course the arraignment is something that
all eyes are on people are definitely uh
going to be several media organizations
definitely going to be covering this but
now the courtrooms have been bought for
all media organizations there are only
certain media organizations especially
photographers only that are being
allowed inside this particular court
premises while the arraignment is taking
place uh take us through the
significance of this sort of an
arraignment taking place is the first
time that a U.S president has criminal
charges against him
yeah yeah I think it's a very
embarrassing uh situation uh obviously
for the entire United States of

the entire episode which is being you
know witnessed at this point of time uh
appears to be a kind of a high a
political drama being played out there
and uh uh this uh charges which have
been leveled against Donald Trump the
former US president is a low felony
charges trials will go on but the you
know United States of American
Constitution does not bar any person uh
who has been indicted or has been
convicted from contesting appreciation
elections or even holding president's
office and I think that's the freedom
United States in America give and uh you
know the presidential former president
Donald Trump is treating this entire
case as as a political Witch Hunt and he
is you know launching a campaign using
this uh you know uh this episode and he
is going to address his supporters uh in
Florida very soon after this kind of
arrangement so I think uh because
actually this the entire episode is a
highly I know politically charged event
so I think I think Court when they have
decided to disallow any video cameras to
be placed uh when the arrangement will
be done I think that shows the courts
are taking all sorts of you know uh
precautions while hearing this case
because they must be realizing the fact
that it's a it's a highly profiled case
very very high profile case a former U.S
president is being you know arranged and
so that is why courts are taking uh full
precautions while hearing this case uh
but uh but only thing is that uh this
kind of indictment or this Arrangement
today uh uh will you know Galvanize more
uh Trump supporters and they will and
president Trump uh is likely to
consolidate his uh support based in the
Republican party and he will launch his
campaign from here on in a more
aggressive manner as I said that in
Florida he's going to adjust his
supporters and from here on you might
see the more Trump supporters will be
coming and in a aggressive manner so I
think uh entire political you know
campaign of trump uh will be you know
much more you know galvanized much more
strengthened from here on that's what I
see and it's uh it appears to be a more
of a political you know Affair than
being a legal Affair for more such

the Charisma that has created and helped

nine years and in 2004 you were uh there
with him and uh despite of that now you
are questioning on his degree people
have not voted for Narendra Modi seeing
his degree but for the work that he has
done for the country this is what the

other issues we are free to concentrate

with me is a
this particular book that we are going
to talking about Atlant this is the
China Nexus and with me is the author of
the China Nexus we're going to know all
about it it's good to have you on the
show Benedict Rogers I also have with me
the publisher of the book Dean baxendale
it's good to have you Dean on The
Telecast as well I'm going to start off
my conversation with Benedict Benedict
uh the reason behind writing up this
book uh how long was your research and
what all did you find out well the
reason for writing the book is that the
Chinese Communist Party clearly is
committing some of the most uh egregious
atrocities in the world to its own
people but is also an increasingly
serious threat to the Free World and I
wanted to document that the evidence of
that in a holistic way putting together
all the different parts of the Chinese
regimes repression at home and its
threats to Freedom abroad it took me I'm
the actual research process and writing
process took me the best part of a year
but of course it's based on many years
of work on China living in China
traveling around China living in Hong
Kong and being banned from China and
Hong Kong wow that's quite the journey
and and since you've been banned have
you also been facing threats because
that's a difficult situation scale
situation to be in I have received more
threats than I I can count I've received
Anonymous letters postmarked and stamped
from Hong Kong at my home address in
London some of my neighbors in the
street where I live in a suburb of
London have also received letters uh
asking them to watch what I'm doing even
my mother who lives in a different part
of the UK has received letters telling
her to tell her son to stop doing what
he's doing and perhaps most seriously
last year I received two letters one
from the Hong Kong National Security
Police and one from the or ordinary Hong
Kong police telling me that what I do
violates Hong Kong's National Security
Law even though I'm based in London I
have no presence in Hong Kong and they
threatened me with a prison term in Hong
Kong wow that's a lot to take in uh has
there been support from the government
of UK to help you tide over this threat
that you have been witnessing the people
across across these are new neighbors
your mother your family has been facing
uh how have you been has has the
government been accommodating and
Cooperative in terms of the issues that
you've been facing I would say the
government has been very supportive
morally and politically so for example
when I received these letters from the
Hong Kong police force the foreign
secretary at the time issued a very
strong statement similarly back in 2017
when I was denied entry to Hong Kong and
I was probably the first Westerner to
have that happen at the foreign
secretary at the time also made a very
strong statement they haven't done so
much at a practical level but I can
understand that because it's very
difficult to trace actually where these
letters are coming from they're they're
Anonymous but I would say more
importantly I I the government has not
done what it should to speak out for
Hong kongers for uyghurs for others uh
who are uh who are suffering far worse
repression than me Dean I'm going to
also ask you about uh why you decided to
go about publishing this book or so we
talk about human rights violations and
human rights violations in China not
just against the Tibetan Buddhists not
not only just against the uighur Muslims
but also against Hong Kong The Tyranny
that happened the lockdowns that took
place the imposition of laws that were
then uh removing the judicial
independence of Hong Kong we talk about
Taiwan which has been facing something
similar uh what was the motive mind you
joining hands with uh Benedict and
coming out with the book well I I had
been engaged on issues around China and
the Chinese Communist parties uh
infiltration operations and influence
operations around the world
going back to
2018-19 so I had a great deal of
interest and then I started to
understand the intersection of what they
were were doing globally in each of our
democracies to undermine the democracy
and that also included what they were
doing in human rights and naturally the
protests that started to take place the
original umbrella movement in Hong Kong
and then the uh which was 2014 in in
Hong Kong and then the protests that
happened in 2019 stirred World interest
in this and and I saw you know once
again the China China's Chinese
Communist party not adhering to any of
their agreements that they were a
signatories too and and I was introduced
to Ben through a mutual colleague from
Hong Kong and we really started hitting
it off on the issues around human rights
and during the pandemic uh we held two
Global conferences that we did it online
to discuss human rights in in Hong Kong
and human rights in in China which we we
drew a great world-class group of
academics and politicians to to that
stage uh and to which the Chinese
Communist Party really really had a
problem with uh and and took us on in
their newspapers so that inspired me and
then Ben came to me one day and said uh
sent me a note saying I'm thinking of
doing this book on China uh and human
rights and and the groups that have been
affected and uh he sent me that note and
and by the time he woke up I had said
I'll I'll do it so that's that's how
easy it was that's how easy it was
because I I knew there this this story
needed to be told and people really need
to understand just how far how wide the
repression of the Chinese Communist
party goes and they're all attitude
besides in India ah well well Ben why
don't you uh why don't you take that on
well we first launched the book in in
London
um in October last year actually on the
very day that Rishi sunai became prime
minister we wanted to get a copy to him
but I guess he was a bit busy that day
but launched in London then we were in
Canada in um in Ottawa in Montreal in
Toronto then in Washington DC and New
York I think I did I think we did uh 16
events uh in five cities in 14 days
and uh I've also been in Brussels did
two events in Brussels and now here in
India well fantastic and how has the
response been this far it's been
extremely encouraging um I've had
nothing but positive feedback from those
who've read the book it's starting to
get some some positive reviews and I
think people recognize it as actually
quite a unique book because there are
thousands of books on China out there
but very few if if any really that put
the human rights picture together uh
comprehensively in the in the way that
I've done and and in a non-academic way
I mean I hopefully exactly academically
credible but it's written in a style
that aims to engage both those who are
already following these issues but also
those who are new to the issues and and
can be drawn in further okay uh Dean
also understanding from you the fund
that you run it's called China democracy
fund yeah what is it all about so the
Chinese Democracy fund was formed again
Benedict was part of this uh we got a
group of academics uh journalists Joey
de Basu from the guardian here is is on
our board
and we were there to take on a very
important issue and that was Professor
Anne-Marie Brady from New Zealand who
had written a paper that was published
in the United States and it it showed
the direct links between the transfer of
of uh military uh
um research and information being done
in universities directly to the PRC
ultimately stealing uh intellectual
property for use by by the regime to
enhance their military strength and
ultimately not to invest in the billions
of dollars that it takes to actually
build the kinds of technologies that
China now has today and a number of
professors from other universities took
you know on bridge with what Anne-Marie
Brady had had said and and wanted her
removed from her position in New Zealand
so we formed a group to raise a funds
for her legal defense and we also
started a media campaign globally where
we made uh people around the world aware
of this case and then we also did a
significant lobbying to various people
at the highest level within the U.S
Administration in New Zealand and
Australia in the UK so that people were
aware and they would put pressure on on
the government and ultimately their her
University backed down she had to have a
hearing I think she had to had to change
about 10 words in the document to uh to
to uh to save face if we can say that
but really uh you know this is the kind
of transnational repression through the
united front works department that the
Chinese government has been engaged with
for the better part of 50 years but
certainly more so since uh Xi Jinping
took over in 2012 where they've
increased the number of people in the
ufw by I believe over 50 000 new uh
employees uh globally okay interesting
uh
I'm also very interested and so my
viewers about your
very highlighted visit to the his
Holiness and you just come back from
dharamsala how has this experience been
and how has he received the book well it
was uh obviously an enormously special
experience an enormous privilege for
both of us
um I think both of us have um for a long
time like many people have been
extremely inspired by his Holiness I
followed his Holiness particularly
closely because I've had the opportunity
a little bit to have contact and to work
with Archbishop Desmond Tutu and of
course their friendship is very famous
and I've seen many of their videos
together and read their the book that
they wrote together so meeting him in
person it was a short short encounter
but it was immensely special and the
look on his face when I presented the
book to him you know he he immediately
noted the Tibetan flag on the on the
cover uh and uh and was very willing to
take a photograph holding the book and
it was very special it was yes uh and uh
one of the one of the uh people that was
interviewed in the book was a gentleman
by the name of Senator uh consiglio
denino who uh actually helped set up the
parliament in Exile and actually helped
write uh the documents and uh for the
process by which they could hold free
and Democratic elections around the
world and he has met with his Holiness
on a number of occasions and when I told
his Holiness that that he he had a a bad
hip and he had to have a hip replacement
but that he would soon be coming he lit
up and said oh yes please tell him
please come so it was it was a it was
quite an experience and and to have the
Dalai Lama contribute to the book and
talk about his middle way approach uh
and how we can how they could have
autonomy with inside China and make it
work for everybody uh and it was quite
quite special
okay the Tibetan cause has been fought
for a really long time decades and
decades together I'm also going to talk
about the persecution of the minorities
that has systematically been initiated
by the Chinese uh we saw very recently
that the pandemic spread across the
globe China has to be blamed but are
there any real consequences that China
is facing because despite the sanctions
that are imposed by European nations
America India there has really not been
any uh reduced interaction with regards
to trade associations that all these
nations have with China
I I think the you know the ability to
unwind the rather large uh Capital
position uh in China by uh Global
economies from Germany to uh to the UK
to to the America uh Canada uh anybody
in in the Free World were engaged with
China in a significant way there's close
to a trillion dollars worth of assets so
to be able to uh move offshore and and
divest ourselves from our the direct
economic links to China will be very
difficult but it is a process that is
starting to take shape and certainly we
are seeing a more uh militant uh
approach certainly within the U.S
Congress uh with both Democrats and
Republicans coming together in the UK
which has been very very China uh as uh
Centric for men for many years and and
many politicians were certainly uh very
friendly towards China as they were in
Canada and the United States uh I think
we're starting to see that finally
um unwind and thaw as people people like
Ben pointing out the atrocities that
have been taking place and the uyghur
genocide and cultural genocide of the of
the Tibetans for 70 years has been
taking place people are finally
listening
where they hadn't been before because
there was too much money to be made and
just to add to that if I may you
mentioned uh sanctions I mean actually
in terms of concrete sanctions I believe
it's only the United States and then a
handful of token sanctions by the UK and
Canada in relation to the the weaker
genocide that have been imposed so my
first point would be we need many more
uh targeted sanctions to be effective
but we also need a really coordinated
United approach among democracies I I
think that democracy is not just Western
democracies uh European uh the United
States Australia Canada but also
democracies in this region not least
India but also Japan Korea and others we
need to stand as much as possible
together and actually form a a united
front to counter the ccp's united front
oh okay all right are we going to talk
about this but also about the military
invasion of China when it comes to
associating itself with Myanmar and
North Korea and manma something is
something that is of
uh concern for India because it directly
impacts Us in the Indian Ocean in the
indo-pacific region uh you've also
mentioned about this in your book uh
what is it that you've been able to
decipher well I've spent many years
working on Myanmar I've traveled
probably more than 50 times both inside
the country and and to the neighboring
countries and and the Border regions and
it's first of all it's tragic what has
happened in Myanmar you know there was a
decade where things seemed to be opening
up where there was some transition to
fragile democratization and all of that
has been set back by the military coup
two years ago and there's no no doubt
that China is complicit with that coup
and complicit with the atrocity crimes
that the military regime is uh
perpetrating against its own people
China is the biggest supplier of arms to
the military uh it's uh the biggest
economic Lifeline to the military and
it's its biggest diplomatic and
political protector and the same is true
of North Korea and those two regimes
that are in beijing's Pocket that
Beijing is propping up are part of this
picture of not just the repression
within China but the regime's
facilitation of repression uh Beyond its
borders okay Dean the same question but
also uh from the angle of the Ukraine
Russia War
there are also critics of of the West
and NATO that say that because Russia
has been cornered by NATO that is led by
America that there has been close
associations and one Army that is being
witnessed between China and Russia and
there seems to be an axis which includes
Iran as well in building this yeah so I
I think the the uh the Iran China
Russian Nexus is something that there's
a number of books that I publish and one
that is is going to come out very soon
where we really demonstrate globally how
this Alliance has been working with
criminal networks with terrorist threat
financing uh all to prop up and support
these regimes the China Russia situation
vis-a-vis the Ukraine uh you mentioned
being cornered why I think it was uh
Putin who was aggressive you know who
had taken Crimea uh you know a number of
years ago America's response to that was
tepid at best we allowed him to gain
power there I think as we probably all
though the Bri the Belton Road
initiative its actual physical
infrastructure the road runs between
through Ukraine to Europe so controlling
that Corridor would have been very
important for China's Ambitions and
Russia's Ambitions and of course the oil
and gas fields that are there and Russia
would then be able to turn the gas and
oil right over to China so I think we
have to look at this this was not
something that that Putin planned on his
own he certainly consulted with Xi
Jinping and certainly before the
Olympics of course they said well let's
not do do this during the Olympics we
should have a good Olympics and then
afterward you can go in and invade so uh
you know um we could always put on a
great show but I think this Alliance is
is quite frankly I should be a worry to
everybody in India everybody throughout
the world because this is an alliance
that really is pitting now to rather
large trading blocks and and now we're
looking at two Global hegemonies that
are that are now fighting and clashing
okay uh
Benedict uh we also take a look at how
there has been a belligerent approach by
the Chinese in the indo-pacific region
uh Taiwan has also been in the Crux of
things with regards to the military
enhancement that America has done and in
retaliation that has been witnessed uh
by the Chinese uh
and then there are the asean Nations
that are largely dependent on the
Chinese and they even if they would want
to raise a protest uh they were perhaps
not unable to do so because their
economies are completely dependent and
there has been invasion of the maritime
Waters of these countries including
Philippines Indonesia and Vietnam uh how
does the military
stationing of the United States and UK
missiles and ships ballistic missiles is
finally then going to is there a
possibility of going to stop China on
its tracks well I think the uh
positioning of of military uh uh
hardware and and and vessels in the
region
um and particularly the formation of the
orcas uh Coalition and of course the the
quad uh um is very is a very important
first start and it does hopefully send a
message to Beijing that uh they should
think twice about any military action
against Taiwan but I think we need to
continue to send that message and
accompany that message with with clear
signs for Beijing that the consequences
for them for an invasion would be
enormous for them as well as it would be
for Taiwan and the rest of the region
and and the world and I think the only
way to prevent uh a uh a war over Taiwan
is first of all to stand which you
Ukraine and make sure Ukraine wins for
freedom and democracy against Putin's
Invasion because if Ukraine Falls you
know we all fall
um but uh secondly to uh to to prevent a
war over Taiwan by making it very clear
that we stand with Taiwan and that there
would be consequences
um in terms of the rest of the region I
I think the solution for the rest of the
region and I recognize this is easier
said than done but it's the same
solution for all of us and that is to
diversify to reduce our dependence on
China and that means encouraging the
rest of the region to strengthen
economic ties with the UK with Canada
the US other European countries um and
Beyond and if I could just add on of
course approximately a third of the
world's uh uh container traffic runs
through the strike right and so China
wants to have a control of that uh and
ostensibly they can then uh exert
pressure on India and all the other uh
you know nations in the region by
controlling that and that's why the
Americans add Australians the Japanese
Canadians have been participated in the
free uh you know uh free movement
Maritime movement which is which is an
international law to which China is also
signatory however as I've probably said
earlier on is sometimes their signature
isn't worth the paper it's printed on uh
but this is very important Geo uh
political and geostrategic uh element
that that we must defend and make sure
that we do have access to the the free
water uh and movement free movement of
goods around the world yes of course we
had signed the quad and during the Bali
Summit of the G20 they were also uh
secondary Association associations and
cooperations that have been built which
India was part of you know America was
part of UK was part of all these
important first of all nations were also
part of it uh looking at G20 which is uh
being held by India with its presidency
and the summit that is going to take
place in September and we're going to
witness Russia we're going to witness
China both these economies that are
going to be present with their heads of
the states uh what do you think are
going to be the talks conclusions are
they also then going to be dominated by
the Ukraine Russia War wow I wish I had
a crystal ball to uh to predict that we
have a president that has been said bye
Bali yes SEO summons that have taken
place so yeah so no I know I I what I
mean by that is it's to know where we're
going to be at with the Ukraine war by
that time let's let's hope that we're
you know able to push back and and and
and Russia
um you know uh ultimately sues for peace
uh in that situation we're not dealing
with that in the same way I do think
that Summit will be filled with this
tension that is going to move forward
which will be the two
um as I say hegemonic
structures the Free World the
democracies uh working together against
you know China and Russia I don't think
it has to be that way I think that we
can find uh middle ground and we can
find a way forward but they're going to
have to recognize that that the world is
not going to run by their rules we have
a set of international rules that we
have uh abided by we've been flexible on
this front they have not been I think
there's a great opportunity though for
India uh moving forward uh economically
I think there's a huge potential that I
think that many of the people that I
speak to in business are wanting to
invest here in in South Asia in India uh
and I think there's that it will provide
great opportunity and that should put
great pressure on China and Russia to
think about how they move forward
economically okay from economics again
geopolitics and the line of action
control and loc on the Western Front and
on the Northern front which India finds
itself in a very vulnerable position in
terms of threats that come from Pakistan
and threats that come from China
the world knows and acknowledges that uh
Pakistan is a protectorate of China
there is funding that comes forth the
cpec which is part of the Bri is also
something that India has resisted to uh
Health protests against but it continues
to build in terms of the projects that
are taking place over there in terms of
construction that is taking place over
there uh why is there still a resistance
from the world to take action against
Pakistan we saw that the fataf fetf gray
list was lifted uh we see that you we
see that I think was it Germany EU as a
whole has gone about lifting Pakistan
from the high risk Nations now and the
reason they give about is saying that
it's it was difficult to do business
with Pakistan with the lifting because
of the fact that they have a lot of
sanctions that were imposed and there
were more rules and regulations that
they had to follow now is there a
solution to this why is it that on one
hand China is being restricted across
the globe but Pakistan being given in
free reign
I think that's an extremely important
question and the first thing I would say
is to really acknowledge that India is
on the front line of of these these
issues quite literally and uh sometimes
resulting in in military exchanges as
we've seen uh with China and I think
that means that the free the rest of the
Free World should really strengthen our
relationship with India
um uh not least as uh as a as the
largest democracy uh in in this region
um to answer your question about
Pakistan I mean I think I I would pose
the same question to our governments
because not only does Pakistan have a
long track record of uh of exporting uh
extremism and and terrorism
um but on in relation to China
um as a uh as a Muslim country it's it's
extraordinary that they have not only
been silent on the genocide of the
weaker people in China
but gone further than that and actually
defended China's policy and and uh and
essentially our accomplices to the
genocide of the uyghurs so I think the
International Community should take a
much tougher line uh on Pakistan and
strengthen our relations with with India
okay I'm also going to pose this
question about the human rights talk
about uh Vega Muslims talk about uh East
turkistanis you talk about uh the
Tibetan Buddhist and and and uh when you
went on the ground were you were also
able to converse with these people to
talk to these people you did you went to
the entrenchment camps did you went to
the re-education camps and they're
called you know the kind of atrocities
or human rights violations did they have
to witness
so unfortunately I haven't been able to
go on the ground into the the Wego or
Tibetan areas and first of all because
access is almost impossible for for any
uh Foreigner
um but secondly I myself am effectively
banned from China since I was denied
entry to Hong Kong back in 2017.
um previously I traveled across China
very widely but not to those areas so my
research on those issues have has been
drawn from the testimonies of people
who've got out uh uyghurs and Tibetans
in Exile including some who've got out
you know relatively recently in in the
last few years as well as secondary
sources uh some brilliant researchers
who've documented the extent of of the
camps and the existence of these camps
is not in doubt they've been well
documented by credible well-established
uh human rights organizations and just
last year the United Nations uh
published a report
um and I think the scale of it the
United States has recognized it as a
genocide there was an independent
tribunal in the UK the weaker tribunal
which also recognized it as a genocide
and I think in the case of Tibet
although the term genocide is not used
as widely as it is in relation to the
uyghurs what what we heard just in these
last few days from Tibetans in
dharamsala points to certainly a
cultural genocide and and probably the
signs of a genocide against Tibet then
how do we go about mounting pressure on
the United Nations and because China is
part of the P5 in the UNSC could there
be action taken that China gets removed
because of the violations that it has
committed uh the rules-based order has
been completely destroyed by China the
dependent Nations that are being played
by China by way of its uh salami slicing
tactics or debt diplomacy that it plays
out whether it's Sri Lanka the the
subcontinent region asean nations are
now also reaching out to other parts of
there's Africa than South America as
well it's it's reaching out its
tentacles fast and wide uh would there
be a strong uh action that could be
taken to remove China from P5 UNSC or
would we would we ever see the light of
the day you know I
you know if there was an objective
criteria and process in which to
evaluate and actually expel a member uh
that would be great except the United
Nations doesn't seem to work that way uh
and is very much unfortunately uh
corrupted by uh by China
um you know certainly the African
nations in terms of voting for China on
on key issues uh you're certainly around
uh trade around the uh the genocide uh
in in East Turkestan so I think that the
other issue about removing China though
it then isolates them even more and I I
think that we need to be pragmatic that
we need to engage China and try to work
towards Solutions but we cannot
acquiesce to their pressure that they
continue to put on Nations throughout
the world using their economic club uh
against us and of course you have many
people in high positions throughout the
world in democracies here in India as
well who have been deeply influenced by
China's money uh and uh process and
they're whining and dining as we all
know so
um I think it takes people changing
their attitude people within the United
Nations recognizing that they have a
duty to humanity and a duty to humankind
and to to put more and more pressure on
China but in terms of actually coming up
with approach and banning them at this
point no I don't see that that coming
it's too weak okay I wish I could talk
to you for a longer period time in this
discussion wouldn't end but thank you
Dean and thank you benedict for joining
me on this telecast and coming up with
this wonderful book and I'm going to

Shanghai cooperation organization is
hosting a meeting of the National
Security advisors in New Delhi where
India's national security adviser Ajit
doval has made the opening remarks at
the meeting now NSA ajitwal has
commented on terrorism terming it
unjustifiable and additionally is also
remarked on the need for international
cooperation via respecting sovereignty
and has highlighted the importance of
connectivity now the meeting was
attended by the representatives from
Russia from Iran Tajikistan Uzbekistan
and Kazakhstan who are members of the
SEO meanwhile it was Pakistan and China
that attended this SEO NSA meeting
virtually
all right let's listen into some
reactions
terrorism in all its forms and
manifestations and its financing are
amongst the most serious threats
to International Peace and security any
Act of terrorism regardless of its
motivation is unjustifiable it is
important therefore for all countries to
fulfill the obligations and shine in the
relevant counter-terrorism cooperation
protocols including U.N security Council
resolutions called 67 1373 and successor
resolutions for the purpose of
identifying and implementing sanctions
against Global terrorist entities the
charter calls upon member states to have
mutual respect for sovereignty
territorial Integrity of states and
invalability of state borders non-use of
force or threat of its use in
international relations and seeking no
unilateral military superiority in areas
connectivity means a key priority for
India We Stand ready to cooperate on
investing in and building connectivity
in the region while expanding
connectivity is also important to ensure
that such initiatives are constitative
transparent and participatory and
respect the sovereignty and territorial
Integrity of all
right so there you have it from the NSA
Ajit who opened up the meeting with the
introductory remarks he spoken
particularly about counter-terrorism
mechanisms that Nations and
organizations across the globe need to
implement to ensure terrorism is rooted
out across the globe joining me on The
Telecast is Wing commandering Commander
uh important points that have been
raised but most particular ah was the
absence of China and Pakistan physically
in Wake of the targeted veiled attacks
that have been made by NSA ajith over
Terror activities that need to be
curtailed and counter-terrorism
rules and sanctions that need to be put
in place by SEO members against the
culprit States and also the
International Community altogether
absolutely right I personally feel
has hit the nail on the head and that is
why probably China and Pakistan we don't
want to face the crowd and they want to
be uh available only on a virtual meet
question out here is that terrorism
has pointed out actually can flow from
one border to another any time because
they can find their loopholes they can
find their supporters in all territory
and terrorism actually is against entire
Humanity so what SRI Ajit said that
there should be not only mental
connectivity on this issue of physical
connectivity jointness joint operations
so that the operations if they have to
spill over onto the region other region
the collectivity must help them out to
fight the terrorism collectively yeah
and also also an important aspect that
has been raised by NSA Ajit doval was
about respecting territorial Integrity
now this is a direct attack on China
that has Simon again attacked India
tried to invade India along the line of
action control
that's right China is has been pointed
out China not only uh trying to cross
the line of control uh on the Indian
border they are trying to carry out the
similar activities of South China Sea
and tell us why what SRI Ajit dewal when
he says directory points out to all the
17 countries which in the around the
South China Sea which are affected by
China it is a message to them and this
is a general message now going to the
indo-pacific area that this is what we
must all join up together have proper
connectivity Brothers Road rail or
whatever the case may be and we must be
on the same page mentally that is what
actually he is trying to draw out and

there is a presumption of guilt and that
there is no evidence that has been
presented that Tick Tock threatens its

been made by the Chinese foreign

now this is what China China has to say
China is saying that U.S should respect
Fair competition and stop suppressing
foreign companies this is what China
claims is happening in the United States
as a U.S continues uh to uh
a band Tick Tock and ensure that Tick
Tock is not being used by government
officials as well in several states in
the United States have completely banned
Tick-Tock as well whereas in some states
they can be used by civilians but
government officers and federal officers
are not allowed to use tick tock on
government provided devices or devices
that are used for governmental work now
of course as China says that Tick-Tock
Banning of tick tock is being done
without any evidence that it threatens
National Security there is of course no
evidence provided from the side of the
Chinese company as well that is
transparent on how Tick Tock works and
and to prove that it is not in fact
endanger National Security of course
this comes at a time when
there are suspicions of spying that have
come up uh from tick tock
I have a cyber expert kushboo Jain
joining us on the broadcast thank you
for joining us uh this morning we're
talking about how what China has hit
back and said that Tick Tock uh the
Banning of tick tock is being done
without any evidence uh that it actually
does threaten National Security and this
of course is coming at a time when there
are a lot of allegations of data leaks
through Tick Tock to the Chinese
government
if you can hear me yes so um uh C1 has
to understand
this has not come out of out of uh just
out of blue that you know some some
Banning has to be done there have been
evidence and there have been evidence
continuously being seen whereas Tick
Tock shares data with with its parents
come you know parent company better time
and better better dance is one where
Chinese involvement is there a Chinese
government has an involvement I'll I'll
you know tell you in detail that what
all laws are are the ones which mandate
uh the companies which are Chinese
origin to you know share data with the
Chinese government one the second is uh
there have been a lot of evidences
across globe and you can see that these
platforms are being utilized for
spreading of misinformation this
information or running for you know
computational propaganda or algorithms
are in such a manner that suppresses the
voice of uh you know people but in a way
amplifies
something which is saving the agenda of
the government for example if you will
see anything which is which is to be
said about Chinese government or or the
province or any any of those things
related to that would not be available
on the talk or on the other hand
anything against any other government or
any other thing I've been only fight and
putting so these are not the voices of
people when you talk about freedom of
speech and expression that means that
it's equally available to people and
it's people who are you know putting
their their
but but here what happens is you really
don't know whether they are Bots over
there who are amplifying those views or
you know calling it on you making it a
news or that's actually people's voice
you know so so the contradiction is some
other the reason which they are thinking
about you know that
um freedom of speech of freedom of
speech and expression of people is that
amount and First Amendment will be hurt
if such ban happens uh because you know
a large amount of people are there on
tiktok and its popularity has green and
that goes against the Democratic setup
of of the U.S but you have to understand
that when you talk about Democratic
setup something like that which spread
misinformation this information which
runs on the agenda one second uh when we
talk about security aspect of National
Security aspect
Indian jurisdiction on the aspects of
National Security the same has been
found uh even U.S took a stand few
months back calling that none of the U.S
U.S government officials are allowed to
work to be on tick tock on the on the
phone because there are there are some
security threats which are uh which are
being observed on these these platforms
and if I may quote uh it would not be
wrong on my path to or not and you know
extra thing to say about
things like for example there are three
laws which is the 2017 National
Intelligence law 2014 counter Espionage
law which gives the state agencies of
China
authority to demand disclosure of data
in connection with investigations and
they can have all the data they can
cancel licenses right if the data has
not been shared with the with the
Regulators or with the government
authorities over there so that's where
you know
uh data privacy comes in place that
practically all the data uh vulnerable
or protected by the government foreign

long Satya gray today in solidarity with
Rahul Gandhi in front of the Gandhi
statues at all states and District
headquarters to protest against his
disqualification from the Lok Sabha the
satigraph will begin at 10 am and end at
5 PM the Congress feels that travels can
eviction from the Lok Sabha poses a
serious threat to the world's largest
democracy
our zoo is joining us live for more
details on this story arzu Congress is
one day satyagraha scheduled for today
take us to the plans that the congress
party has in Delhi and other parts of
the country
well absolutely the congress party will
be holding a nationwide protest
not only in Delhi but in all the states
also at the headquarter and this is uh
coming after the Rahul Gandhi has got
disqualified from the post of the MP in
the Lok Sabha so the congress party will
start this at around 10 a.m and this
will will go for the seven hour the
satyagrave will end at 5 PM so this is a
long satyagrah which the congress party
is going to hold here in the national
capital Delhi along with the other
states we will see a big faces not only
the Congress Delhi leaders and workers
but from the central Congress also we
will see Malika Arjun we will see
Priyanka Gandhi the National General
Secretary of the Congress prinka Gandhi
will be seen in the satyagre so this is
the attempt to save the Democracy this
is what the Congress is saying and on
this the blame game has also started uh
very highly the BJP is saying that the
Rahul Gandhi is doing this to gain the
cheap popularity from the people to gain
the sympathy at the same time the
Congress is saying that this is the
conspiracy against the Rahul Gandhi and
uh we are seeing that the opposition
parties seems to be with the Rahul
Gandhi uh the the comment from the Mamta
Banerjee they come in from the akhilesh
yadav they come in from the Delhi chief
minister arvind kejriwal has also came
on this issue after the disqualification
of the Rahul Gandhi as the Lok Sabha MP
they are also saying that the Rahul
Gandhi is being defamed this is the trap
for the Rahul Gandhi as he was raising
the voice as he has given the speech on
the adani issue against the Prime
Minister Narendra Modi has raised the
question on the relationship between the
uh between the Narendra Modi and the
adani group so this is what the
opposition is saying that this is a trap
which is being
expended by the central government women
for the Rahul Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi is
clearly he also holded the press
conference yesterday where he said that
uh whether the central government sent
me to the jail or disqualify from my
post but I'm going to fight for my
country I'm going to fight for the
democracy and will continue to do so
even if I am in the jail so this is
clear and today the Rahul Gandhi and the
congress party is going to hold this
satyakray at the Rajkot in Delhi and
this will start at around 10 years Rahul
also expected to participate in the
satigre or will it be uh mainly the
senior leadership of the party
well it is said that the congress party
is going to show the unity and they all
together the all the workers the big
faces the leaders will be there at the
delhi's rajghat where they will raise
this support they will show their
support for the Rahul Gandhi so it is
expected that the big faces of the
congress party the Priyanka Gandhi and
the malkajan Ramesh and the other big
faces will be seen at the satyagrah
holding the protest against the uh
disqualification of the Rahul Gandhi uh
as the Lok Sabha MP
yes and as far as of course now arzoo
the BJP is concerned how have they been
countering these claims of the congress
party of Rahul Gandhi of these charges
of selectivism in his disqualification
the BJP saying that
made from the Rahul Gandhi that this is
the conspiracy of the bharti janta party
this is the conspiracy of the Prime
Minister Narendra Modi the BJP is very
clear they are saying that this is the
Judiciary who has convicted Rahul Gandhi
for the two year of jail it's not the
BJP or the Prime Minister Narendra Modi
this is the Judiciary and the BJ the
Congress is raising the question against
the Judiciary also the
Ravi Shankar Prasad has said that the
Rahul Gandhi has got three years this is
the case of 2019 when the Rahul Gandhi
has commented on the cast Modi he said
that the all the thieves have the Modi
in their surname the Ravi Shankar Prasad
this clearly said that he have got three
years to apologize for what the
statement he has given about a
particular cause but the Rahul Gandhi is
not guilty he doesn't feel anything that
he has said anything wrong about any
community so he earlier also we have
seen that the bharti janta party is
calling Rahul Gandhi as the Arrogant
leader and he he doesn't speak after
after thinking so this is the attack
which is being made by the bharti janta
party and they are saying that this is
under the Section 8 3 of the
representative of the people act in
which the Rahul Gandhi is being right
qualified from the Lok Sabha MP not the
conspiracy is being made against him for

not caring about the lower cars not
caring about dullets that sort of
archaic understanding uh is now being
broken by people from those communities
sharing their stories sir
oh
I don't think uh there are two things
first of all yeah India is a huge
success story of the growth of the
people who in the earlier time were the
uh you know disadvantaged because of
where they were born being born a
schedule tribe gandhiji call them but
there was a lot of discrimination
against people uh who were born in those
uh obcs right
and India is a great
story in terms of how how those
communities have been lifted not whole
scale but partly lifted from where they
were to become part of the mainstream
India please recall the story of Babu he
was a defense minister he was there
there have been Baba ambedkar there have
been so many people who commit from the
economically backward classes or the
backward classes OBC Etc have made a
good story uh
you mentioned about the Western
countries narrative on India
uh the story of obcs and the schedule
India is not that of black and white
there are huge success stories and I
think for the success stories the
institutions in India must be thanked
upsc
the number of people from the SC and SC
classes who get into the IES and the
Foreign Service and the income tax every
year and they make it good from there
they become part of the empowered
classes so India is a story such a story
of how people have been lifted from
their paste at the same time in the

the Supreme Court now all said to her on
April 5th a plea filed by 14 political
parties led by Congress alleging
arbitrary use of the enforcement
directorate and the Central Bureau of

so the center versus the opposition
reaches the top Court of India and the

this crucial matter on April 5th just
couple of days from now viewers this
essential hearing to take place in
India's Top Court
joining us on the broadcast now
Advocates Sanjeev yadav thank you so
much Mr yadav for speaking with us we've
of course been given to understand that
a very crucial hearing is to take place
in the Supreme Court
um if you can help us understand sir how
these hearings usually work the fact
that there are at least 14 political
parties that have now knocked the doors
of the Supreme Court does that put you
know the center in any sort of fix does
that put the center in a sticky
situation
hello
are you getting me yes sir we can hear
you did you get my questions out
all right I'll just all right Mr yadav
Mr yadav I was just asking you that
there's a there's a plea that is going
to be heard on April 5th in the Supreme
Court Now The Plea has been put out by
14 political parties led by the Congress
and um they're saying that the center is
misusing Ed as well as the CBI so how do
you view this hearing that is said to
take place
are having something in their hands then
only they are after those parties or
their leaders they find something
amazing
that's all they did their job they're
doing their job so I don't find any
Merit in this place but let the
honorable Supreme Court decided it
okay all right so there is no infirmity
like this but after all if they raise
the free files by any of us or I do
political party if the honorable Supreme
Court is ready to examine the matter
that's like the prerogative one of the
Supreme Court if we found something in
the marriage it can be but after all it
will be decided by the weather we are
misusing or not misusing so the fact
that you know the Supreme Court prama
Facey has at least agreed to hear the
matter has at least agreed to hear The
Plea that is being filed by 14
opposition parties is that in any sense
um you know a silver lining for the
opposition knocking the doors of the top
Court
well like the it's not like something
that gives silver Landing for something
there
is an approach on level Supreme Courts
for the devious big events if they have
something having against the center of

discussion a discussion on kashmir's
transformation in Washington DC's
National Press Club reportedly a
Pakistani can be seen heckling the
attendees on video youth leaders from
the Kashmir Valley were at the national
Press Club in Washington DC to talk
about the development peace and
prevalence of Grassroots democracy in
India's Union territory of Jammu and
Kashmir the International Center for
peace studies invited Mir Genet and Tosi
freiner from the valley for panel
discussion titled Kashmir from turmoil
to transformation and at this very event
we've been given to understand that
reports are now emerging of Pakistani
that is said to have heckled with the
attendees on the broadcast with us now
Yana Amir Yana really appreciate you
joining us on the broadcast what more
details can you get us as far as this
event in Washington DC is concerned and
the reported heckling of attendees by a
Pakistani akansan
you Mega you are finding this and our
viewers are finding this heckling
something new and something shocking
that how can two speakers who've come
all the way from Kashmir to speak in
front of an American audience be heckled
openly like this right you guys are
finding it shocking but it's nothing new
for us kashmiris it's nothing new
because this is the kind of heckling you
can say that has been happening even on
ground anybody who tries to speak for
India or in you know tries to appreciate
in the Indian government for whatever it
has done in Kashmir they've always been
hackered like this to the point of the
point of suppression has gone that
they've been heckled to the point of
being killed
the point of Separation a suppression of
speech had gone to that extent and they
were suppressed in one way or the other
either they were killed and killing was
the large uh attack first they were made
to you know they were either they were
there were attempts done to socially
ostracize them you know so that they get
fatwas from the local Masjid or
something or they were attempts to uh
you know humiliate them on ground in the
society where they live or on social
media by calling them names like either
murtaz or sellouts monafics murtaz the
people who leave Islam sellouts are
called munafix or you know more recently
terms like Stooges
just because we appreciate our country
so we've made to hear all this this is
the kind of heckling we've always faced
by a handful of people who were sell out
to Pakistan now apparently uh the
sellouts to Pakistan's isi it's okay to
be sold out to Pakistan's isi but it's
not okay to speak for your country
if you speak for your country every
second person who speak first country is
a sellout
and that is what happened that is what
the world witnessed at the Press Club
that what we've been speaking about for
so many years that every time you speak
about a country we get silent and this
is exactly what happened at the Press
Club why doesn't and this is a very
simple question why don't pakistanis
ever interfere with a handful of
violence seeks try to get take the you
know humiliate the Indian flag outside
the British Council
no because they don't interfere in
anything where India is getting
humiliated
you know by a handful of sellouts but
when the majority tries to speak for
their country they you know they will
try to silence them and use every tactic
in the book to silence why this
Obsession then do you think with Kashmir
as far as you know Pakistan is concerned
in the past you know it's not just um uh
this one isolated incident but in the
past also we've seen Pakistan's
Obsession so to speak with Kashmir why
that in your opinion
sorry I did not get your question you're
asking me why this obsession with
Kashmir yes well it's very it's very
obvious they are not able to get over
the fact that we help Bangladesh free
itself from their clutches they they're
still you know waiting to avenge that
and another thing is that they believe
that Kashmir belongs to them they
haven't been able to swallow all the you
know humiliation of losing every war
that they try to initiate with India and
uh it's also that you know on a global
level it helps them you know it's a
begging bowl of a country Pakistan so it
helps them take more uh financial aid
from the World by saying that you know
we we're trying to keep that part of the
Border uh you know peaceful and for that
we need fun and another thing is as you
are already aware the politics of
Pakistan is is Ghost directed by its
Army and the Army has to show its
importance and the importance can only
be justified by saying that the Army and
the politicians under influence are
trying their best to free the kashmiri
Muslim brothers and sister from the
clutches of authoritarian India so this
narrative is very necessary for Pakistan
to exist as a country and you know Jana
rightly you've said quote unquote
authoritarian India um so then Jana why
is it that we're not discussing what is
happening in Pakistan occupied Kashmir
why are we not discussing the fact that
the cpec
um continues to uh you know misuse the
powers in Pakistan occupied Kashmir why
are we not talk about what is happening
in guadal why is that something that is
not being discussed
aware that in fact the people of Pok
themselves are talking about it now the
earlier they used to be scared to come
on uh you know in front of the camera
and actually speak out their woes but
now they're doing it and they've started
comparing there have been so many videos
surfacing from poke where the people
have started saying that Prime Minister
Modi is such a blessing of a prime
minister and you know we are left with
nothing you know we made a mistake by
going with Pakistan and things like that
but the unfortunate thing is Islam has
been weaponized to such an extent uh you
know they feel that okay no so so so
there are people who have asked them
would you like to go with India in that
case if you get an opportunity they said
no no we won't do that why because India
is an authoritarian country so yeah we
are suffering with Pakistan but we'd
rather be like a separate a separate
country but we won't go with India so in
fact we need more mere junaids and more
salty rhinos to go uh to overseas
missions and speak about what India has
done for Kashmir this needs to come out

JHUIPqcSZ64,Gurdwaras made Londonistan HQs | Londonistan Files Part 5 | NewsX,We keep our investigation going and bring you more clinching evidence. We have zeroed in on the gurdwaras in cities ...,2023-03-23T14:14:02Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JHUIPqcSZ64/hqdefault.jpg,"now we keep our investigation going and
bring you more clinching evidences we
have zeroed in on the gurdwaras in
cities that surround London including in
Derby in Leicester in Coventry and many
others that are the breeding grounds of
the kalistani secessionist movement
there were Cowboys of the kalistani
protesters that were bused off from
these many gurdwaras with one single
agenda in mind to deface the Indian flag
to spread chaos and violence let's
quickly take a look at a number of these
gurdwaras that surround London and have
been like I said the breeding grounds of
the khalistani secessionist movement
we'll also try to identify these
suspects some 100 to 200 of them that
were gathered ah outside the London High
Commission of India and this was on
Sunday when the attack took place where
the flag was brought down the Indian
tricolor was brought down and the
khalistani there was an attempt to put
the khalistani flag now several of these
suspects we have already discussed about
there was one particular man from the
khalistani movement who was also seen
shaking hands and meeting with the
Pakistani High commissioners
first Secretary political we've showed
you the pictures of those but there are
others who have still not been
identified their names their occupations
their profiles have still not been
occupy have been find out deciphered but
I'm going to put this image of this man
in the black topic and this is the man
from Dal Khalsa UK outside the Indian
High commission
is a prominent organization under the
kalistani movement that was
spreading the message of hate against
India right outside the Indian High
commission last Sunday and they were
also part of the massive protest that
took place yesterday outside the Indian
High commission thankfully there was the
Metropolitan Police this time around to
barricade the area and provide security
to the Indian High Commission
now the very same man if we take a look
at just a few days ago he was also
spotted at Gurdwara Singh sahib in South
Hall in United Kingdom so once we put
two and two together we find out that
the very same people that were spotted
in various of this gurdwaras weeks or
months before were all congregated
together at the UK at the Indian High
Commission in in London
uh there's another individual by the
name of gurjaran Singh he's spotted
outside the Indian High commission this
is on the day of the Indian flag being
defaced uh Guru Chand Singh Is seen
inciting the mob outside the South Hall
Gurdwara as well now this this incident
has taken to the gurudwara inciting
incidents to take place some days ago
before the Sunday attack that took place
on the Indian High commission so there
you have it you put two and two together
and you understand what is the modus
operandi who these people are and which
gurdwaras under which they all function
ah this is gurdwara's Sir SRI govind
Singh Sabha now it is painted in the
color of the khalistani flag which is
yellow this is proof that the
khalistanis gathered at the Gurdwara SRI
Guru Guru Singh Sabha before the Sunday
attack that took place outside the
Indian High Commission
uh rally started from the Gurdwara
govind Singh Sabha in Leicester this
these are Leicester Flags these are
flags in Leicester that are being that
are being hoisted they are being raped
by the kalistanis and we have the start
time of this rally that took place from
Gurdwara govind Singh Sabha
and these the entire list
of gurdwaras
in London surrounding London that are
actually the epicenters or the
or the breeding grounds of the
khalistani secessionist movement I'm
going to quickly take you through the
names this is the gng Willen Hall this
is 8 AM which is the time that all the
kalistani secessionist protesters were
asked to gather together
to reach to to reach London at the
Indian High commission to perpetuate the
attack this Guru Guru nanak Singh
Gurdwara
segli Street at 8 AM gng Smithwick at 9
00 am Gad Dhabi at 9am catering Sikh
sangat at 9am from the train station GNP
Coventry at 9 30 am Khalsa Darbar
Southampton at 9 30 a.m gng Leicester at
9 30 am GTB Leicester at 10 AM Singh
Sabah Hitchin at 10 30 thinks about
Watford at 11 A.M seven Kings at London
East at 11AM lewton Gurdwara at 11 A.M
at 11 30 a.m so these are all the
headquarters where the secessionist
activities take place there is a huge
bindrewala poster right outside the
Gurdwara Guru Singh Sabha
and there you have it over here
and and we can and we understand where
this entire protest where this entire
violence where this entire Mayhem is
coming forth with the modest operandi
that has been created
this is on August 15th 2022 when Indians
celebrate their freedom by denying
freedom to Sikhs in kashmiris this is
this is been put out as a poster uh in
villain Hall Gurdwara this is to spread
hate about India against India this is I
think one of their Twitter accounts
where they have put out this hate
message against India uh this is a
kalistan event that is organized in
sadly Street Gurdwara in 2004. now there
is a
Sikh convention that's what they say
this is an event back from 2004 actually
there is uh in fact there is going to be
the book is what they mentioned
etc etc then they're going to be leading
six speakers from UK and abroad these
leading politicians on major political
parties so there you see it now these
gurdwaras are not for just religious
congregations what they're actually
doing is they're making it a meeting
point and why is it easy because the
large Sikh community living in United
Kingdom and various parts that surround
London within London as well they will
they congregate over there so it's easy
to reach out to these people it's easy
to brainwash them over there it is easy
to radicalize them and not only that
these become breeding grounds to have
meetings to have these sermons to have
these seminars of a number of local
politicians uh and when these local
politicians gather speak to the people
speak to the locals in a bit to seek
their vote when elections come and in
return uh provide this service to the
khalistanis by not doing anything and
giving them space to spread their
hateful propaganda against India
this is the smithwik Gurdwara calling
the khalistan Declaration day in 2017.
now these are all Twitter accounts uh
this is the Gurdwara Singh Sabha in
Coventry holding kalistan referendum
voting so this is November 21 Sunday
location is Gurdwara Singh Saba
Crossroad Coventry and this is
referendum voting we have seen this
referendum voting take place in UK and
and in Canada several number of times it
has shifted its focus to Australia as
well but it has been a commonplace
practice in in UK uh this is the
ramgaria Gurdwara in UK holding the
khalistan referendum in 2021
there are Sikh worshipers being beaten
and denied entry at UK Gurdwara for not
backing khalistat in fact I like I
mentioned before there was an attack on
a Sikh entrepreneur he had he was a
restaurant he's been attacked because he
does not support this violent kalistani
protest Gurdwara
Gurdwara Singh Sabha this is in slow it
displays two banners with khalistan
written on them so there you have it
I've given you a list of these gurdwaras
there there must be many more as well
but these are the headquarters of the
kalistani secessionist movement uh that
is emanated out of United Kingdom we are
going to point by Point Break Down all
these developments uh join the dots and
their voters operandi behind this
massive anti-india campaign that has
been initiated it has not just happened
in UK this is simultaneously while
amritpal Singh was being chased by the
Punjab police and the central government
authorities there has been a concerted
simultaneous effort by these khalistani
backers supporters lobbyists to spread
this anti-india propaganda in the
biggest cities of the world it has
happened in UK it has happened in
America it has happened in Canada in
Canberra it has happened in Australia as
well
in Canada and Canada in in Australia as
well so so I'm going to I have broken
this down for you there is enough
evidence and if I and my team sitting
over here in the newsex office in New
Delhi can join the dots give you all the
information and tell you the modest
operandi it's not difficult to put two
and two together why is it taking the UK
government and the UK police and the MI6
and the MI5 and the Scotland they are in
Metropolitan Police so long to find out
who these instigators are which are the
organizations they work for why don't
they close down and crack down on these
gurdwaras are the big questions I'm
going to ask let's quickly get in my
panelists on The Telecast kuldeep Singh
shakawat joins me from UK kuldeep
the big question
why is
why is the UK government and the UK
police feigning ignorance I'm going to
start off with mother nalapath while I
wait for kuldeep singhawat to join me on
The Telecast Professor the same question
uh look uh Mega first of all I'd like to
tell you that uh it you know to use the
term seek to describe these individuals
is a travesty of the truth a guru nanak
Dev preached Universal Brotherhood he
talked about a sarba Khalsa Bala in
which everybody everybody in the whole
world would get benefit he talked
against the five evils anger hatred
greed ego and you know
the five evils of character and yet you
have individuals who have captured
places of worship who claim to be
members of this very Noble way who
frankly have not understood the
fundamental tenets of this Faith you go
into the tenets of this faith and you
will find that their activities are
completely contrary to that and it's not
a surprise because their gurus their
teachers are the grand children of those
who basically massacred the Sikh
Community innocent seeks you know
terrible things to seek women horrible
things to seek children way back in 47
48 46 and afterwards as well in what is
now Pakistan so these are the people who
are their trainers and it is not it's
not only the the isi that doesn't know
anything about the Sikh religion uh not
of course these individuals who claim to
be speaking on behalf of the Sikhs
obviously the British authorities also
know nothing about the Sikh religion and
they persist in saying that these people
are quote unquote representative of the
Sikh religion and even more ludicrous
representative of peaceful movements
when you have seen Mayhem violence
bombed their threats and so many attacks
by these same elements you track the
money you track the travel you track
their links with Pakistan and with
another country that is basically now
controlling Pakistan and you can track
it very well the only conclusion I can
draw is that the British authorities
simply have no regard for the Safety and
Security of the world's largest
democracy they don't care about it and
if they did care about it they would
ensure that you don't have places of
worship dotting the United Kingdom
wherever Diplomat you know the
Ambassador is here if a fellow Diplomat
go to enter one of these places of
worship he would be killed he'd be
beaten to death if a Hindu were to enter
these places of worship he would be
beaten up yeah it was equal to enter
this place of worship who truly believe
in the Magnificent teachings of Guru
nanak dev then that person would be sent
away or beaten up so the fact that
nothing has happened from frankly is a
disgrace it's not only a disgrace to
Britain it's also a disgrace to India
that we were not able to name and shame
the British and the British authorities
so far into acting in line with
democracy freedom of faith and all the
tenets that every day Ad nauseam British
politicians you know preach to the
entire world okay uh Ambassador Voda I'm
going to come to you now now I listed
out at least a dozen of these gurdwaras
that act as
uh places
where not only these kalistani elements
congregate but also plan their modus
operandi and their next steps to
orchestrate attacks against India like
the one that happened on Sunday this is
not the first time it has happened and
it is perhaps not going to see Community
safe in London right now from the
khalistani attacks
see
majority of these people are live in
West London and the the restaurant that
was that was the story of uh attack
yesterday yes it was from Hammersmith
and Hammersmith is literally the Western
suburb of London
what is actually
disturbing is the way things are moving
in UK and the way the authorities are
behaving I'm I am not only concerned we
are all Disturbed that Indian Community
is being targeted Indian businesses are
being targeted one of a Gujarati person
who went to the South Wall Gurdwara was
physically and mentally and he was
abused
very very badly by one of the protesters
and this guy gurjaran Singh he is a
protester who always go to High
commission and create request so we are
really really concerned about the
situation here now okay we have to we
have sorry
yeah no I all I want to ask is that uh
you know you really think it's enough to
just remove the barricades at the
British High commission and be done with
it and do nothing about it and just be
sitting on our seats and saying that
this is the action that we've done and
we've been reciprocal enough and now we
are happy that the Metropolitan Police
has put out the barricades and his
surrounding and circling the Indian High
Commission in in London and and be done
with it because I just listed out at
least 15 to 20 goodwaras where the
anti-india secessionist movement has
been carrying on not just for the last
couple of years for the last couple of
decades perhaps
exactly
see this gurdwaras or most of the Sikh
gurdwaras are Center of
advocacy of khalistan and
what British government should do is
look seriously at their business
models are getting a lot of money from
the public in the name of Guru in the
name of sikhi and then that money is
being utilized for anti-india activities
here they have no right to use that
money first of all in these kind of
activities but they are
they are yesterday in fact six or seven
gurdwaraj did not participate because
there were no takers buses were empty
and people didn't turn up at the high
commission otherwise they had an aim of
having more than two three thousand
people coming to the high commission so
I think British authorities had to look
at them in a very serious Manner and I
can tell you the authorities in UK are
now waking up after the action that has
been taken by the government of India in
Delhi and by the High Commissioner of
India things are literally being looked
at right from the word go means it has
just started to look the way things
should have been earlier High commission
security has been beefed up things have
been well they are in contact with the
high commission team and at the moment
situation is quite calm but what we are
worried about is if this kind of
propaganda Will Carry On from the UK
soil against
as has been the Precedence that has been
set okay I'm completely out of time I
thank all of you for joining me on The
Telecast uh we have napped down and
zeroed in these hotbeds of kalistani
terrorism that operate out of United
Kingdom in several parts of the country
under the Garb of being places of
religion the gurdwaras are where the
target of the UK government and the UK
police needs to be how soon can they
start taking action and build a
Crackdown against them is something that
India needs to pressure them to allow
for significant change in terms of Civic
Safety and Security of the Indian
diaspora and the Indian High commission
and diplomats has to be taken forth I

joins us this morning to talk more about
this Commander bakshi a very good
morning to you sir
Commander bakshi what do you make of
these attempts on you know Indian High
commissions across the world being made
by kalistani supporters and how should
India crack down on this
uh thank you
this aspect what you're talking in here
we have mentioned Also earlier this has
become very serious now we must
understand this is suddenly not cleared
up you know it's not as just a spa spark
somewhere it is all well orchestrated
because this position of India is
becoming very strong all around the
world India is in a position to call the
shots diplomatically called the shot
economically and our trout is increasing
so much so that our diaspora is becoming
very strong all over to curtail other
Indian does for us the best method which
the people find is that is the division
or the fault sign in religion and that's
what this try to infuse and that's how
they do whether it is it is between
Hindus and Sikhs whether it is the
Christian or Indian Hindus and Muslims
whatever the fault nine weeks this is
very easy now because it is very up all
over the Kazakhstan movement and that is
why you will notice Canada Great Britain
America Australia wherever the Indian
diaspora is becoming strong those
governments are now that the opposition
in that the governments and they are now
trying to get us down of course we are
playing hip service they praise India
otherwise but otherwise what they do is
totally different you see that where all
all those are not gold all is not
everything Which business Is Not Gold
and that is what is a fact and that is
why we are being now the pursuit by all
these countries in a very very oblique
Manner and this is the manner which they
have taken our question our question
with us is what does India do we must
first take out the roots within our
country
or wherever they are their support is
within our country first we must make
their hooks weak out here and then only
the things you're absolutely right so
group Captain UK devnath also joins us

no security guard outside the house of
the Alex at least the British High
Commissioner so this is all being done
after the uh the Indian High commission
was attacked by the pro kaliskani
supporter and also the government is
saying that there's no threat to such
Embassy the British Embassy in India so
that's why there's no need of such
security such large Security in India to
the British commissions
yes and now is this
you know is this something that you are
seeing outside just the UK High
commissioner's residence so has this
happened outside the embassy as well
these barricades removal are Zoo
there is no such security has not been
pulled down for in the official Office
of the British commission but the
security is pulled down outside the
residence of the British High
Commissioner as of now so this is the
visuals which I have shown you that the
berry Gates the sets of very Gates there
were six very gates from out which was
established outside the house of the
British High commission but now it has
been removed there is no security
outside the residence of the British
High commission as the barricades is
being removed the there's no security
guard and this is being done to the
following the attack which was done by
the pro kalistani supporter after the
Punjab police was before the uh the pro
kalistani supporter Amrit pal so this is
being done to tell the British
government that if the Indian High
commission is not safe in London then
the security will surely will not be
given to the British High Commissioner
in really
all right arzu stay with us in fact let
me uh quickly draw an ambassador Manju
said former Diplomat also at this point
on the broadcast Ambassador Manju said
we are clearly seeing how barricades
have been removed from outside the high
commissioner's residence uh your first
reaction to this development
I think uh we had been quite uh you know
uh we were not very prompt earlier but
this time I think we have sent a very
clear message that uh we will uh scale
down uh the earlier you know it was a
kind of barricade and this kind of you
know access was not allowed uh because
uh of this recent incident and uh an
attack on the UK hiker sorry
and the message needs to be sent very
clearly to the UK that you know you you
have to give to do uh cognizance to our
request to get hold of the perpetrators
and to provide adequate security to the
Indian higher commission and Indian
Missions in the UK so it is a very clear
message and I think uh it is a measure
of reciprocity that these parakeets have
been removed from outside the uh High
commission residences and High
Commissioner and high commission Genesis
and the residents
right and as far as of course now the uh
you know this this this uh signaling is
concerned it's more about messaging and
signaling isn't it Ambassador said
because at the end of the day of course
we are learning that uh this number of
security personnel has not been reduced
uh but obviously the parakeets removal
is about signaling and messaging isn't
it
yes it is about signaling and messaging
but also because up till now nobody was
you know like the protesters who uh yeah
there was a protest in front of the high
commission uh I think a couple of days
ago by other Sikhs in India in Delhi
protesting against this kalistani attack
uh in the UK uh a pro kalistani attack
uh by the pro kalistani so this is also
uh you know now there will be no these
barricades did not allow people to go
beyond a certain point and get very
close to the high commission so this is
not also not only a messaging but also a
measure to to indicate that there
were available to you up till now that
people were not allowed to come too
close to the to the to the high
Commission in in Delhi but also the
residents but now with the removal of
these barricades there is no barrier now
so it is also a messaging but also an
actual measure uh to to uh to uh to uh
to ensure that or to indicate that there
will be now nobody stopping you somebody
wants to get close to you okay let them
get that for more such videos subscribe

JrWHONkP-jE,Protests in France as Macron wins Confidence Votes | Protests over Pension Reforms in France | NewsX,"To Subscribe our YouTube channel ""NewsX"" click on the link below:- https://www.youtube.com/user/newsxlive/ Watch More ...",2023-03-22T06:30:49Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JrWHONkP-jE/hqdefault.jpg,"made ongoing protests in France the
French government narrowly survived the
vote of no confidence which was
triggered when it forced through an
increase in the pension age to 64. now a
second no conference motion later tabled
by Marine Le Pen's far right National
rally party also did not pass after the
failure of Both Worlds the controversial
Bill to raise the retirement age from 62
to 64 will now become a law
we've of course been seeing protests in
France go on for a couple of months now
at this point we're seeing that the no
confidence motion of course was stable
for a second time after which of course
the failure of both votes has taken
place and now this particular bill of
raising the pension age or the
retirement age from 62 to 64 in France
is going to be
etched into a law
this is of course what we know so far
we're also learning that angry protests
continue in France of course as this
development comes in some demonstrators
have clashed with the police officers
were learning and they've been blocking
streets with debris fire in central
Paris and cities around the country have
been marred with protests
I'm being joined by a defense expert UK
devnath uh group Captain devna thank you
for joining us this morning we're of
course talking about the protests in
France that have taken place uh for
quite some months now and at this point
they've become more violent as we're
seeing that the second time around no
conference a motion has failed and this
controversial bill is going to become a
law which the citizens are of course
against and they've been protesting
across in several cities in France
for a long time French people had been
striving very hard to make their
lifestyle comfortable and there is a
tradition of friendship between you know
doing a work-life balance with the hard
work they do French people are very
imaginative people they know how to live
life well
we all can remember that France was one
of the first few countries countries
which encouraged only four days week
work they have a tradition where they
work very hard they earn very well their
GDP is very high per capita domestic
production is very high but
simultaneously they uh Leisure Life very
seriously and they love to enjoy their
life
uh they like to spend their quality time
with their family members friends and
relatives now what happened in this
instance that uh the retirement age that
is the age after which they can leave
their work and enjoy pensionally benefit
by given by government was being
increased from 62 to 64. it is a huge
amount of protest but yes but now this
legislature has been accepted by the
Parliament and it will become a law yes
I think it is a good development uh many
countries will so follow this protocol
in future decades to come yes thank you
group Captain debnath for joining us and
sharing your thoughts I'm also being
joined by Major Mohammad Alisha uh major
Shan are talking about these
developments we've just heard the group
Captain they've not talk about the
French mindset when it comes to work
it's quite different the work culture
there is quite different when it comes
to uh perhaps in comparison to Asian
countries they of course uh have like he
said four day work weeks and there was
these produce immediately started as
soon as the discussion of increasing
retirement age to 64 became a discussion
and now it's going to become a law uh do
you think uh the the people in France
would be accepting of this law after
they understand uh perhaps the increase
in productivity that it put early to or
do you think the culture or work culture
of for the French people is quite
etched and they're holding strong onto
that and the protests might continue
okay that's a very very good question
but before I start I would like to if my
my friends in France were watching me I
would like to tell them bonjour
and if case you are protesting over
there keep certain things in mind that
any government which uh takes a decision
Which injuries a policy it's always in
the best interest of the people of the
nation of everyone they can be a
communication problem they can be uh
same things happen it happens everywhere
same thing happened in India as well
when they are protest anti-government no
government will form any policy which
would work against the favor of the
country in the favor of the interest of
their own people no no government will
do that and so and protesting is
everyone's uh fundamental and Democratic
right fights as long as full as long as
there's no hate speech as long as
there's no vandalization as long as no
one takes a law in the hand as long it
doesn't come violent now the very
factors as a group Captain
earlier explained
the special powers the opposition of the
country which would happen in any
country in fact the opposition of any
well straight away be up in arms they
will come and provoke they come and uh
oppose it so it was opposed by people
saying that no this is a new pension law
that you have brought it and the whole
thing it was opposed but now the very
fact is when it goes through the
parliament once again so see they are
certain things whether I like something
which
beat okay let me give you a very simple
a micro level case for everyone to
understand normally tell me one thing
aarti in a company people who work jobs
how many people would be actually happy
with their boss have you ever heard
anyone actually out builds it from the
heart saying good thing about the boss
no people are always very no matter how
hard the boss Works No Matter What
policies they form no matter what the HR
form but they would be always a growth
always the policies the same way I am
correlating over here for people to
understand now the very fact is any
government which has the best interest
of the people
if they come to a wood Indian democracy
where they say it's a dictatorial law in
a way they like for okay now otherwise
Chancellor you have an executive Council
you have a proper board committee who
will take a decision but when you
exercise your special emergency Powers
at a time when you could have gotten
done through a voting system as well
they would be opposition the same right
right and I hope the protest over there
remain peaceful man no one takes a law
in the hand are they for more such

Security advisor to the United States of

president has commented on the attack on
the Indian Consulate in San Francisco he
said an echo that United States of
America condemns the acts of violence
against the Indian Consulate in San
Francisco they are committed to the
Safety and Security of these facilities
and the diplomats who work within them
the state department is in touch with
the local law enforcement on the next
steps in the matter this comes after the
U.S earlier termed the attack on the
Indian Consulate in San Francisco as
absolutely unacceptable
it may also give me details obviously an
unfortunate incident that has taken
place to protest has been raised by the
ministry of external Affairs and the
Indian High Commission in Washington
over the consulate that was attacked by
these kalistani radical elements in San
Francisco
in San Francisco and said it was
absolutely unacceptable this came a day
after the protest a protester shouting
through kalistani slogans grows through
security barriers to install to
khalistani barrier inside
premises and also the the ground can be
the National Security Council
coordinator for this strategic
Communicator at the White House said
that the vending system is not just
acceptable because all the protesters
were seen breaking the doors and the
doors of the consulate so this is what's
happening and after they upload right
all right thanks arzoo I have with me
Ambassador Manju said Ambassador it's
unfortunate uh this is a Despicable act
of violence committed against the
Consulate of India in San Francisco but
to do these commentaries that are being
made by the ministry of external Affairs
or for that matter the U.S state
Department are going to be of any
resolution to the problem that has been
repeating very often in these areas
whether it is UK or U.S or Canada and
now Australia as well
yeah absolute absolutely not acceptable
this kind of uh attack or not indices
and our uh Indian Missions it is
something that we have communicated to
them and we are communicate communicated
it very strongly and we have to now
ensure that they implement it and
adequate security is provided to all the
premises of the Indian Mission so that
this kind of
um
are not permitted and not allowed they
have to secure the Diplomatic premises
it's like an attack on you know on India
as such in a way and because these are
properties of the government of India
and they cannot be treated so lightly by
the local authorities they have to
absolutely ensure that uh full
Diplomatic Security is provided special
security required and in given that
these um you know attacks have been
taking place across countries uh and
especially in these three countries the
US UK and Australia and sure a message
would have gone to the local authority
to provide extra security because we
could anticipate uh the embassies could
have anticipated this kind of attack and
so uh
adequate security should have been
provided and I think uh we will have to
put more pressure on these governments
to ensure this and uh at the same time
if there is too much of escalation in
all this I think maybe in reciprocal
measures would have to be invoked
okay uh also Ambassador would like to
get an understanding of from from you as
to what your opinion is with regards to
is is the reaction that is coming in
from the Indian government offer that
matter uh the London mayor or the UK
government in tackling this despicable
act that has taken place at the Indian
High Commission in in London with the
kalistani elements that were present Who
removed the flag who defamed the flag to
fame the country uh is has has the
reaction been lackadaisical particularly
from the UK government
from the government yes it has been a
little uh unexpected and uh which we
will be sure that there we would have
expected a much more
stronger action but the plus point is
that they have said that they're
investigating it and they will uh punish
the guilties or guilty persons and they
will not allow this to be though it was
not a very large number but whatever
number it is they said they would take
action and and we can only wait and see
whether they take that action or not and
especially in in in in in the UK case it
was absolutely amazing how this person
got onto the onto the premises onto the
balcony of the Indian High commission I
think that is something where there has
been a kind of success
by the local Authority yeah they should

the Australian parliament in support of
fugitive and kalistani sympathize
sympathizer amritpal Singh I'm being
joined by uh
J bhardwaj the editor-in-chief of the
Australia today thank you for joining us
sir we're talking about how kalistanis
are now continuing their protest outside
the Australian Parliament and this is
not the first time that we've seen such
kalistani attacks on not only Hindu
temples but several diplomatic spaces as
well and now we're seeing this over the
situation with amritpal
uh what is happening today is happening
globally and is a Consolidated effort of
Palestine supporters uh uh I was preview
I was previewing one of the groups uh
where kalistan supported stop is a
WhatsApp group and uh they were talking
almost whole night yesterday uh where
and when and what to do and this the
local Group which was present yesterday
in Brisbane
um for uh that uh propaganda referendum
three of those people this morning were
at that uh Canberra Parliament House and
their offshoot local Gurdwara committee
they were the one who took permission
for this uh protest at Australian
Parliament and the same was happening in
New Zealand also uh the same uh group uh
uh kind of a day they were sending
posters I could see uh the prints of
posters they told them what to print uh
uh on the both Australian and the New
Zealand group both printed the same
posters and then uh they were labeling
them on the vehicles and running them
around the city uh to uh to provide the
propaganda photo for these young kids
who are here at International students
they get agitated that there is a
Crackdown back home so that's why we
could see a number of youngesters were
there in the Canberra protests and the
New Zealand which they were doing on the
streets so uh we can't see them as
isolated local support towards uh
kalistani supporter amritspal Singh or
anybody actually is a it's a gang of
people who is working globally in
different countries and then guiding
local foot soldiers to do what they
actually want and it needs
a UK USA they are there is five eye uh
group and India has to uh kind of uh
work uh together with them somehow to
crack down on these people otherwise
it's kind of very difficult to work
alone if India thinks they can do it
alone
do you think any action is being taken
against these elements because we've
seen such attacks in the past as well
and of course Australian prime minister
did say that he's going to be taking
action against people who uh desecrated
uh the Hindu temples but not only that
there's been several incidents of uh
kalasani attacks on Mahatma Gandhi
statues and such as well and India has
been time and again raising the fact
that not only in Australia but in
several other places like you had
mentioned these elements are becoming a
real threat
they are real threat to uh not only
Australian Hindus but as well as
Australian six also so in totality if we
talk about Australian Indians uh I can
take you back almost a year uh from uh
today
um uh one of the Gandhi statue was
inaugurated by Australian goddamn
Australian prime minister and the very
next day kalistan goons in the light
tried to decapitate it so uh uh the
people responsible for that act have not
been arrested till today we don't know
who those people were uh I mean there
are CCTV cameras all around the city if
police wanted to unnap them they would
have
um imagine uh Indian Prime Minister in
our Grace anything and the next day it
is vandalized uh how Indian police will
respond to it and in Australia it was
vice versa uh and then fast forward to
last few months from December to now uh
uh seven uh Hindu temples have been
either threatened or uh
vandalized by these kalistani goons no
action has been taken against them how
uh uh there was a big violence I mean a
number of almost a group of 40 uh
um men and women were attacked by
kalistari guns on 29th of January and
the Heart of Melbourne City where one of
the biggest calendar event Australian
opens final was happening that Sunday
and is still for the last seven months
police could not do anything they have
not arrested but somehow uh today there
is a breakthrough Victoria Police has
kind of released uh pictures of six men
sick kalistan supporters who they are
are interested in talking to regarding
this violence
this is happening after a lot of
community pressure it happened after
Indian and Australian prime minister
together have said that these kalistan
supporters will face full force of law
so it has it took the biggest or the
highest office in India and Australia to
respond then only Australian police is
responding to whatever we are seeing
little bit uh at the moment and why they
were not doing it uh there is the same
reason is in New Zealand in Canada or UK
or in Australia that these people
provide muscle and money power to the
local politicians and in return
politicians either choose to look away
or try to defend them in Australia the
situation is not as bad as it is in UK
or Canada that politicians have started
defending their ex however in Australia
politicians and authorities who are
responsible for the Safety and Security
of all Australians are kind of looking
away and not calling the these wounds as
what they are
Mr bhardwaj thank you very much for
joining us on the broadcast let's move
on to more breaking news coming in
a mob is attacked the Indian Consulate

GC8NEepkn2s,RCB Finally Opens Their Account In WPL | Special Women&#39;s IPL Coverage On NewsX,RCB Finally Opens Their Account In WPL | Special Women's IPL Coverage On NewsX To Subscribe our YouTube channel ...,2023-03-16T06:28:13Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GC8NEepkn2s/hqdefault.jpg,"it might have taken six games but it's
finally happened yes Royal Challengers
Bangalore have finally won a game in the
Women's Premier League yes it happened
last night capping off an intimate start
to to the tournament with a fine five
Wicket win over up Warriors in the Navi
Mumbai Mumbai last night while smriti
mandanas perform continues and it's a
problem for the team it was the 20 year
old Kanika Ahuja who was shining with a
30 ball 46 runs with the
Divine kicked it off by taking both the
openers early on and Parry later grabbed
three wickets but again it's a big
question whether they're going to make
it to the to the cutoff or not we'll
have to see we are joined by an esteemed
panel today but more importantly we have
uh James King the cricket commentator
from South Africa who watched women's
game very closely in the Cape Town for
the World Cup welcome to the show James
James finally the good news is on RCB
has opened their account and how
yeah some great news there coming out of
Mumbai there with the RCB opening their
accounts and it was up to the youngster
wasn't it uh Anika huji just the
incredible Innings there from from the
youngster and yes another example of how
these uh amazing young women are coming
through and they're soaking up pressure
to deliver in The Cauldron that is now
the wpl so it's fantastic to see and you
know all these big name stars but uh
these youngsters you know soaking up
that pressure and it's just great to
see that coming up from the from the
youngster and the comments off the game
really really I think was fantastic well
let's talk about the positives what do
you think actually went uh rcb's way was
it the Ellis Paris uh four over 16 runs
and three three wickets or Sophie
Devine's all on performance and for
almost for 22 runs 23 runs and two
wickets what do you think is going are
the old foxes coming together in a in a
pack of wolves
yeah I think I think you just hit the
nail on the head you know it's not about
um we had individual performances May
ultimately get you out over the line but
if you do look at the contributions that
you're talking about there it's not just
one person or two people it's not the
big names necessarily that are all
contributing or one or two that are
contributing to the video have
contribute to the victory for ICB right
it's finally a team effort that's got
them over the line so it's the
combination of of experience and youth I
mean you look at the main scorers for
RCB and it's the the youngsters that
have come through the Indian youngsters
that have come through to get them over
the line it's your experience as you
were mentioning that's taken the wickets
and restricted uh UB Warriors to the
school that they got so you know it's
coming together and it hadn't happened
for them before then and even though you
might have had the failure up front yet
against
just you know not able to buy a run at
the moment it looks like but you've got
the depth there and the contributions to
stabilize them after they were in
trouble and you know get them over the
line in the end which I think yeah
really good for the tournament you know
they have actually got over the line
there's now some competition for that
playoff place and it's going to be
interesting to see what landforms Jim's
I'm going to just hold your thought
there you mentioned you briefly
mentioned that smriti Mandana is causing
a lot of trouble despite being the
leader ah smriti mandana's scores are
bismally low according to our standards
35 23 18 4 8
and perhaps a zero what do you what do
you make of an 88 run at an average of
14.
uh is that the smriti Mandana do we know
nothing it's not is it it's not you know
it's not a person that we normally see
leading from the front and consistently
getting getting the runs and you know
you can't really put your finger on it
can you in in these situations it's
almost a a decline if you look at the
you know looking at the scores and just
trying to think okay you know what sort
of happened
um the important thing I think smarty is
that it's just that the team got over
the line yesterday so you know despite
the fact that she hasn't contributed and
maybe you know it's good for her not to
have that pressure that she has to take
everything on her own shoulders as the
captain and as you know the the one of
the lead batters and uh that she's she's
able to announce that right right
I didn't make it but we made it sure
made it finally but we're going to talk
about an interesting performance last
night on RCB because RCB is one of the
uh the most sought after team when it
comes to fans and they're swarmed with
the observations and counter
observations and and some jibes as well
but the good part is yeah we've got
Kanika Ahuja scoring for 36 let's spare
thoughts for the youngster in fact she
is the
highest score by an uncapped player in
the Premier League earlier it was in IPL
by Paul walletti 120 and last night it
was Kanika huja your thoughts 30 ball 46
runs were you impressed with the kid
yeah I think you know that's a it's a
very good slime it means that the
youngsters are coming through in the
precious situation I'd love to comment
afterwards saying yeah she's taking
inspiration from we're at Coley that he
came to see them and and said you know
don't treat this pressure treated as
pleasure and go out there and basically
do your thing and she said that really
run very strongly in her head while she
was making those runs then as she said
she felt earlier on in the tournament
when she got that very good 22 that
she'd maybe giving it away she's focused
on her strengths and and a lot of people
there that are you know rooting for her
and have really talked her up
um maybe even before and now with this
inning I think very good comment from uh
Grace Harris around how well she played
and her grace obviously on the opposing
team but I think that just tells you a
lot about what this IPL means to so many
or wpl sorry it means to so many any
different people which is uh and those
you know established players and the
young players coming through that it's a
breeding ground for future talent and
that can only span not just Indian
women's Cricket but you know women's
crickets around the world in good
spirits so I think it's very exciting
well let's spare a thought for the fans
because uh the fans are an intrinsic
part of any franchise when you have got
uh in the in the auction room when you
had
what did you think of it and when you'll
suddenly look down after five games you
will staring at the barrel of the gun
with no Victory altogether your views
how would a fan feel from that moment to
last night
yeah I think you know you're looking at
it and you're thinking you know when are
they going to actually fire you know
they've got all this Firepower in there
got all this experience you've got uh
some of the youth coming through with
the you know capped players as well as
uncapped players and you're starting to
think well no one of these guys going to
come good when are they going to repay
our investment you know and not just
from a not from an owner's point of view
but from a from a Fan's point of view
and and fans invest so much I think we
mustn't underestimate the amount that
fans invest just in emotional and you
know the emotion of it and supporting
your team and just you know the the
probably getting distraught when they
just don't get over the line and you
know having lost five in a row it's just
it it's sort of almost defied logic that
that could happen with the lineup that
they have you look at and we like Dennis
who you know is not even really been
part of what they've been doing so
you've got you've got a backup as well
in in the hutch you know that it's not
that you've just got
um these players that are out on the
field or the team that's out in the
field so it's um it was puzzling and now
that they're back in it almost I mean
you look at the blog and because you've
got two teams that are Germany I'm gonna
just hold on to your thoughts I'm just
going to hold on to your thought you
said it's puzzling because you've got a
wealth of talent sitting inside the hut
trying to take over but where is the
problem is the problem with the
management uh certainly the coach The
head coach or the operations the cricket
operations guy at the RCB who's
supposedly one of the highest paid uh
IPL and franchise Cricket official he's
getting everything wrong year after year
do you think think he is responsible for
the entire team not settling it
well I think you know it it's you know a
hard one to to call but you have to say
that you know this far into the
tournament
you would have you would have expected
that the the you know all the
component parts of this would have come
together to to give you a performance
and to identify where it's perhaps just
not going right and that you you're
looking at and and looking at it and
saying okay how do I get these
combinations right what's the input from
the you know the team what's the captain
what's the input on the other coaches
how do we take what's happening how are
we comparing or you know you look at
your own performance first obviously
right but it is important to understand
what's happening with the opposition and
how do you you know plan for each game
and and try and look at how do you get
over the line take the conditions into
consideration look at the team that
you've got the players at your disposal
and how they're going do you feel
they're going to perform best and the
best combination for that particular
time and event so it's uh it's it's a
tough one to call I mean I I don't
necessarily think I'm a I tend to be a
bit of a fan stitch on some of these
things unless there's the evidence there
that shows that it's one individual or
not you know that's that's really making
um a difference either way but it's hard
to understand how you have a situation
where so many good players are not able
to get you over the line you know in
five in in in five uh matches and then
yeah you come good but on the back of a
standout performance from metal to stand
out performances with juice
let's flip the situation you've got
shabnam Ismail which is the fastest
bowling uh bowler in the world right now
you've got Lola Laura wolvard who's the
highest scorer at the World Cup just a
fortnight ago or three weeks ago I mean
both the players one was not picked for
the the auctions and the second is still
warming the benches if horses for
courses if shabnam is smile
is sitting in the bench and not being
able to play because she could not find
a way into the team and there are a
couple of other examples as well like
you mentioned uh do you think it's time
that the youngsters will put on the heat
on on the for on the big names as well
is it going to start or has it already
started
I think it has already started certainly
but yeah you've also got to give the you
know some of those players
it gives them a chance I mean I think I
think you can't underestimate the value
of experience right and match situations
tend to you've got two extremes here
you've got people who that have been
around for a while can read a match that
can plan within a match how to play it
you've got the maybe exuberance and
fearlessness of Youth that comes in and
sometimes that'll pay off for you and
sometimes it won't you know it's just
how do you get that combination right
it's the coaches or you know and and
captains the I think it's their
conundrum always is how do you go in
with the team that you've got with the
almost the menu that you have in front
of you that you know what dishes are you
going to choose almost in some way to
say how do we put the right combination
together that's going to actually make
sure we we can get over the line satisfy
our our fans keep everybody happy and
keep our team happy that we're in the
hunt uh for all that and and sometimes
you have to make the tough decisions
around who do you leave out who do I put
in but you know I do think you you've
got to give those uh experienced players
also need a chance to get in with the
condition into the conditions play and
and be able to actually you know run
with that and go with it I mean you you
think that somebody plays six Innings
and and you're yet to really make any
kind of contribution you know do you
actually make a tough decision and and
say to the captains sorry you can't play
in the next game because you're just not
contributing well um and and it's not
yeah which is the captain who's uh LED
from the front and who has impressed you
because our next couple of questions are
based on your answer
yeah so you can't really look much
further than the two top teams can you I
mean if you look at Harbor Freight and
you look at Meg Lanning and you
understand what they bring to their
teams and I'm not saying that you you
know you're not that's not a disc on on
anybody else that you know on the on the
other captains that are there but if you
just look at the experience they bring
from International captaincy and you
look at how the deal with pressure
situations and time after time they they
stand up they read the situation and
they they're able to help get their team
over the line just have to look at the
player of the match performances
do you understand that James you you've
very nicely put the name of Harman preet
Kaur the Mumbai Indian captains she's
got 65 of 30 11 of 8 53 of 33 and 51 of
30. she is leading from the front you
you were there at the Cape Town when
India I lost the semi-final match and
there was a brutal comment made by Nasir
Hussain at that point of time post-match
ceremony he said that it was a lazy
attempt and a schoolgirl Cricket that
happens do you think Harman preeth Kaur
has finally silenced her critics this is
a tough one for you James but let's bite
the bullet do you think it's a
Redemption time and harbanpreet has
resorted to and reverted with her
performance
you know I I'm sure she's not going to
see it that way is she but uh but the
the thing is that
yeah you know that was
it was that it happened you know what
happened in the World Cup semi-final
happened her reaction to what happened
there and shows that just what it meant
to her what and she realized you know
when you have somebody's experiences
that you don't actually have to tell
them that what they did you know was you
know maybe what necessity you don't have
to tell them I mean everybody's entitled
to their opinion and to say you know as
a pundit or a an expert what they think
but the thing is that she's answered you
know from a quality she's showing in
this competition the you know what she's
about she served that in the semi-final
of the World Cup I mean she wouldn't
India wouldn't have been in the position
they were in yes to get over the line in
that semi-final if it wasn't for her and
so one moment of Madness if you want to
call it that and it does happen you know
it happens to so many players and you
know I don't want to even go back into
the to some of the history of of those
key moments in right in pressure moments
things that happen and you know it
that's that's the way it sport Works
absolutely that's the way how it Sports
was and it is very brutal we all know
that James one last quick question
before we wrap up our show which is your
favorite team as of now as of today
well I I'm I'm president as president
biased uh but yeah MRI for me really uh
are just fine in Top Gear at the moment
um being challenged significantly by
daily capitals clearly I think that
you've got
combinations though if they start coming
together for the other teams I mean I I
think RCB if they can put together two
more good performances they've got a
very strong choice of being in the
playoffs and then it you know then if
you turn it around and you've got
momentum on your side the other teams
start to sort of flag a little bit and
they they're not continuing their
winning ways necessarily
all right so about who takes momentum
into the playoffs often that's going to
come out on top not necessarily who
starts well unfortunately in a lot of
these uh tournaments and tell us the
situations so ma'am anything can happen
but yeah I read I rate I mean am I have
just been incredible so far and uh Karma
Greek continue to lead from the front
it's going to be very difficult to see
them being beaten for more such videos

offensive against the government once
again MPS of like-minded opposition
parties are going to March to the Ed's
office to register a complaint against
the adani scam today at 12 30 pm
from the Parliament House
mahima kataria my colleague is joining
us at this point in time to give us more
updates mahima an unlikely scenario
raghav chadna and some of the members of
the congress party in the same room for
a joint cause
well absolutely beneath it is the 16
like-minded parties as we all know that
today is the third day of the second leg
of the parliament session or I would say
the budget session but both the houses
have been adjourned and like you
correctly pointed out all the parties
are going to march from here so these
are the bad the visuals that we people
are showing you massive barricading
police force deployment paramilitary
deployment that has been done in the
area of the parliament and the marches
and escalation on the part of opposition
in the middle of the standoff in the
parliament beneath in a bid to escalate
its offense against the Modi government
the opposition planned the march to the
office of the investigative agencies
that is the Ed and the CBI over two days
to highlight AI should also probe into
the adani issue sources said that the
opposition MPS belonging to the 16
parties and that is what we people
believe that also that in the Malika
Arjun office 16 like-minded parties met
and the 16 political parties which are
coordinating in the parliament are
likely to lead a March from this very
road that we people are are showing you
the visuals though the opposition party
is agitating over what it calls is the
misuse of agencies by the governing BJP
to Target anti-bjp political parties and
leaders the marshes are likely to demand
that the agencies launch a probe into
the adani issue so that is what we
people are learning that any moment from
now the political parties that is the 16
like-minded political parties are going
to come and start with their March to
the enforcement directorate but beneath
one point I would like to make here
which is very important that this entire
move was mooted by none other than
Congress MP Casey venugopal he gave an
idea about this particular March that
now the agency should probe in the adani
issue so they along with the JPC they
want now the agency to probe for more

I just came from Mexico and we have now
taken a new home in the Yucatan in the
very very bottom of Mexico and we invite
you all to come and join us there
where it seems that people are coming
from all over the world
and you ask them
why did you come and they say we don't
really know we were just drawn here how
long will you stay well I came for three
weeks and that was three years ago
so it reminded me very much in 1977 when
I
put my feet first on the soil of India I
came from USA
to be part of the 400th
birthday anniversary of Guru ramdas in
Amritsar
and
India
became my home
and we would travel here two to three
times every year remaining in Los
Angeles for 40 years
and
[Music]
doing all these last
53 years really that I've been
practicing this science of Kundalini
Yoga and teaching it all over the world
I'm still amazed every day when I get up
before the sun comes up to be reminded
that my feet have touched the Earth one
more day and I have one more day that
perhaps I can share and do something
useful in this lifetime
and so far so good I believe
a story
I'm always reminded of
is a story that Osho used to tell and it
was her name was
it started with an R I can't quite
remember her name if she's Persian or
Indian but she would be found up on the
road
looking for something and she was an old
lady that was leaned over she kept
looking and looking and the neighbors
would come and they would say Rubina
what are you looking for and she says
I'm looking for my needle I lost my
needle
I was like a sewing needle so the
neighbors would all gather and try to
find a needle
by the roadside
needles are really small right so they
finally said to Robina
this is impossible do you have any idea
where the needle is
and she says yes it's in my house
and then they really started talking
she's gone mad well they knew she was
mad anyway but she was a prophet and
they said then why are we looking up on
this road if you're
needle is in your house and she replied
because this is where the light is
there's no light in my house
it was a story and it was a parable
to say that our light we live out here
but we've lost the light
on the inside and we're in darkness
and one of the stories one of many that
I heard along the way another one was it
was when I was 20 years old and it was
in 1960 something and we had heard that
there was a woman in Carmel Valley in
California in Carmel because I lived in
La for 40 years that she
seemed to know something that we didn't
know at that time I was 22 years old and
we didn't know anything we didn't know
yoga we didn't know meditation we did
not have any
inside steps because our parents hadn't
done it most of us and they were just
looking for the light on the outside
which is called materialism
but there was a special old lady she
probably was 50 years old but at that
time when I was 20 that was old and so
we hitchhiked to our house and it was by
the ocean
and we went in we heard it was free
because no one had any money then and
she was a small lady
and she was on this box that played
music we didn't even know what a
harmonium was and there was a keyboard
like a piano and we came in quiet and
there were candles lit and she sat there
and she sang and she welcomed us all and
the song that kept in my mind for years
and years was a Yogananda song who is in
my temple who is in my temple all the
doors do open up wide all the lights do
light up high who is in my temple
and I had no idea what she was singing
Temple was she talking about lights
what's she talking about what's the
outside what's the inside I was so
struck
with her
and with the Osho story
that I spent years
trying to find this light or trying to
find what they were talking about
and that's when I got blessed to enter
when I was 26.
an ashram that did Kundalini Yoga
and after one class and getting up at 2
3 in the morning with sadhana
and becoming a very devout vegetarian
and also starting to cook and serve
hundreds of people every day on the
streets then I started understanding for
the first time
what real happiness is what real Joy is
and whenever I get lost
if I go back to
all of that I'll remember why I am here
and people ask me when are you going to
retire
and I said well probably I'm my exhale
meaning if God grants me the power to
keep helping and keep serving in any way
I can why would I do something else it
doesn't make any sense so I'm so honored
to have been divided been invited by
Sangeeta and I I'm amazed at how many
friends Sangita has
everybody you know she's my cousin she's
my best friend when I was a child I've
known her 20 years everybody's rallied
to come to this place to be part of this
it's small today but I believe something
has been birthed right here today and
you're all witnessing it this will
transfer to many cities because people
want to in the way the world is now how
do you
how do you grow old with Grace how does
your brain still keep working
how can your body keep working there
must be a way because marketing tells us
pretty much the opposite just take a
pill just do this just do that rest rest
always rest and um
so I'm here today hopefully tomorrow
you'll all come to the 10 o'clock class
of Kundalini Yoga everyone can do it
there's not a soul who still has a
heartbeat that can't do Kundalini Yoga
and if you'll join us tomorrow at 10 I
think that'll be great I thought today
I would do just some very short little
things to give you the experience of how
fast you can find your joy how fast you
can heal how fast you can let all your
troubles go so if you'll sit up straight

joy to be with you all I
actually have to leave in just a few
minutes to go catch a flight back to
rishikesh for which I apologize but I
am so happy to spend just a few minutes
with you
this wonderful conclave that Sangeetha
and all of her team has put together I'm
so so glad to be here I'm so glad to be
here with my beloved sister gurmukti
especially at her 80th birthday just
before we come together next week in
rishikesh at paramarthnicathon for the
International yoga Festival
as we're here talking about aging
blissfully and just just the few minutes
that I have I was thinking you know
yesterday
I was at a beautiful event here in Delhi
at the Constitution club
by Vicky and I had the great honor of
sharing a stage with a 95 year old
athletic champion her name is bagwani
Pago
that one seemed to go out no problem
here we are
looking uploaded
her name was bhagwani
Devi dadiji
95 a small little beautiful woman from
haryana who is now a world champion in
100 yard dashes shot put throws not
that she was a champion when she was
young and now she just happens to be 95.
but right now just having started in the
last couple of decades she's become this
world champion
and as I sat next to her on stage
yesterday
I got
some beautiful tips from her not given
directly in terms of bullet points of
anti-aging but just through talking to
her and they were things very simple
she doesn't use any potions or pills or
powders
no special tonic
but she's asleep by 8 30 every night and
she's awake long before five
she eats very simply Japanese
and she loves just just see me later it
was amazing just to simulate first thing
she did
hello everyone
this has been such a revelation you know
sometimes you come because you're asked
to by
your friends
but I am so happy to be part of this
wonderful conclave and sagita this is
absolutely beautiful what a great
Ambiance and you're going to go very far
with this because I really feel that
more than anything else in the lives
that we lead today
you know looking after Self
um you know your own well-being in the
hecticness of life that we lead is
really possibly the most important
um you know thing that we should take
into our daily considerations and you
know in our lifestyles which sometimes
is quite unhealthy I feel our topic
today
is to create the life we deserve
the bigger picture of course is
aging blissfully well I'm just trying to
age gracefully
not trying not to lie about my age
anymore but uh God forbid anyone asked
me that question but uh yes I think this
is um such an amazing platform to bring
together
um our modern day lives and the reality
of the kind of life that we are leading
but what we really need to inject into
it is I think self-care
I'm going to be reading a lot because
out of my phone which I've scribbled
notes on because I can't remember a
thing and I have to stop blaming covet
three times and praying Fork because of
which because I this is just age I mean
to be honest and uh today I have these
two incredible people with me
who I have known on a very personal
level sunit who I have known ever since
I have come into Delhi but more than two
and a half decades ago I have always
admired him of course for his creativity
I've also been in fashion
um most of my life and I I have loved
fashion since I was a kid and
um sunit I mean he's the original Glam
slam you wanted to look for anything
glamorous uh you went to sunith Varma
and he's been actually through so many
stages of his journey uh professionally
and personally
um and I and
somebody mentioned his humility and I
think that's that for me is my friend
sunid and of course talent in like which
has no bounds
and then there's this lovely Dr Gita
prakash my GP Perils of her profession
who does answer my call at all kinds of
orders with the weirdest of things that
I come up with I have always been the
opposite of a hypochondriac I mean
almost childlike I've never finished an
antibiotic course and really I'm very
very careless and lackadaisical about my
health so if I go to a doctor means I'm
almost dying or I think I'm dying and
there is uh Dr Gita prakash on call 24
hours with me whenever I need her which
is incredible when the kids were born
and I had to be here on my own because
my husband was in the Navy so they sort
of grew up I I used to always tell him
I'm giving you ready-made children
because sort of I looked after them nine
years now but whatever it was I had
great fun in the sense we always found
something fun to do with that but
everyone goes to their tiles and
tribulations I went through my own I
lost my mother my mother-in-law my
husband recently about a couple of years
ago that was a big shock but my children
are so supportive and not only them I
always say my in-law bacha's also who
have now become my bachchas I mean I
think that is what's helped me to go
through everything plus my work like I
said they enjoy what I do and it was the
biggest strength to be able to help
people to realize I'm still privileged
the other thing I always say is keep the
faith there's nothing you cannot do if
you put your mind to it so you just have
to stay positive and say this is what I
want and this is what I'm going to do no
matter what everyone you will find so
many roadblocks but they happily sort of
move away you Slither through them if
you really want to do what you want to
do so just remember you only live once
do whatever you can whenever you can if
opportunity strikes like it did for me I
mean I did three years of being a radio
jockey as well I used to talk on radio
shows also on medical issues basically
Medical but in the sense somebody just
said why don't you do this and I said
why not and today somebody said why
don't you model I said I'd love to so
when somebody calls me this before they
say what it is I say yes because I'm
sure I want to do it so much fun I mean
it's another aspect of you that you
learn about so I think what you do is
you just keep growing till you die I
suppose I think covert taught a lot of
us a lot of things
I'm sure many people who have had some
personal tragedies and stories I lost
two very close young cousins overnight I
mean one died within three days one died
within seven days much younger than I
ten years younger than I am 15 years
younger than I with little children and
I think I was always
um
a little bit more optimistic about life
even as a kid and growing up it may have
to do something with my upbringing or my
family but I think post covet
everybody's had a new sense of living a
new sense of the moment because you're
here today you may not be here in the
next 10 minutes I mean there's there's
20 year old and 30 year olds who are
falling ill and passing away within in a
gym I I'm sure everybody read that
recently so
I think for me I've decided
um I actually decided that long back
that I was going to live my life to the
fullest I'm not a very typical
Punjabi boy who kind of you know was
going to grow up and become a banker
like their parents
um and and thank God I do what I do
because I'd be so bad at everything else
I I almost don't know anything else to
do but to do what I do so because I like
doing this I celebrate that every day
and I enjoy literally every day of it
great and that's where you get your yeah
yeah that's where I decided that you
know this is the one gift that God has
given me
and more than the gift this is the one
opportunity that God has given me
because a lot of people are very gifted
a lot of people are very gifted but they
may not have the opportunity they may
not have the support system I'm very
happy to be here
um I got this opportunity I think we
call it the drama
you know the drama which happens
and I'm happy to be amongst all of you
um
I was given I when I was reading this
aging
gracefully and you hear the word
blissfully
I feel connected in terms that it's very
spiritual notion
it's a very spiritual lifestyle which we
are talking about
I've been practicing meditation for the
last 20 years a little introduction I'd
give about myself
I got introduced with the teachings of
the Brahma Kumaris just casually because
I just wanted to have a little more
concentration
um and that's how I got connected with
meditation I had no inclination to wear
a white saree like this and be in front
of you my whole purpose was very selfish
very focused to get some good marks to
focus on my studies
and it really did help
and
I've been born and brought up in Lucknow
maybe you've been there
it was a very good
introduction which helped me and
As I Grew in my college and then I did
an MBA I went to Bombay did my MBA
because I was ambitious
and yet I found that no matter what
you're doing no matter what you're
achieving
you need to be connected with the self
um you need to experience that Bliss
Within
if you want to actually experience
anything outside otherwise you just go
with the flow and you don't know where
your life is going
so I was connected with and practicing
the Raj yoga meditation which was just
next to my college actually they studied
in NM and is a very beautiful center of
the Brahma Kumaris just next to
um you know just walking distance
I came back to gurgaon because Delhi and
gurgaon where my family was settled and
I started working I worked in an MNC as
an analyst for some time
but even there
we had people who were meditating
and of course I was a meditator I
started working practicing
and then I had the opportunity
to understand and actually go to a
retreat center where I'm now putting up
I'm coming from we were talking about
nature and I was just connected to the
retreat center where I stay it's a 30
acre campus and I take this opportunity
to invite all of you
um you know it's called Om Shanti
retreat.org you can check our address
where we have peacocks and birds and
flowers and trees and it's open for all
um
it was built 23 years ago but which was
a Barren land but now it's of course a
different story
so you're all invited there for the last
10 years and serving there as a Raj yoga
teacher
so while I was working as an analyst
um every weekend I used to spend my time
there and go back to the corporate world
to the world and come back
and I did it for about a year and a half
every weekend
which gave me this understanding you
know the contrast of what's happening
and you know what I want
and it became very clear with my friends
uh you know finding a life finding a
partner going abroad settling somewhere
um I had to figure out what I needed to
do you know you were talking about we
had a woman in white hair you had you
know we're talking about people in your
60s or 70s but you know aging is a
process which happens every moment
because even a teenager is trying to fit
in especially a girl
if you're choosing anything maybe you're
choosing to do a job maybe a I mean I'm
sitting here if when I chose that I
would like to lead a spiritual life what
do you think was it easy or difficult
we are talking about inclusivity but how
about inclusivity of spirituality
how about women being allowed to choose
whether they want to lead a spiritual
life or not
because
and I'll tell you an experience when I
was
10 years I mean I chose about 12 years
that I'm gonna be in this 10 years I'm
at the center
I was younger
a Slimmer
and you know my friends and my
colleagues
family relatives and so-called well
wishers
it was very difficult
they can't accept a fact that I would
like to lead a life which is close to my
heart
and you know what they said to me what
would you say
foreign
and what else what do you think what
else
yes you have not this is not your age
you know this is not your age you are
too young to do that
now aging gracefully meaning there is
nothing too young or too old
let's take that into consideration there
is nothing like you're too young to do
that or you're too old to do that
if you are convinced if you are having
an experience if you are sure what
you're doing it's absolutely fine I
think
so I'm just bringing another perspective
of spirituality
I'm happy now that uh I'm happy because
I'm standing here and sharing it in
front of you I'm happy because I got
connected with my friends who counseled
me
who were getting married settling
everywhere and counseled me you know
they said you know
just
take it easy do what you have to but you
should have a life
I said you know I have a life
I have a life believe me I have a life
they said just do everything but you
should also have a life
now
of course I faced certain of these
Challenge and I remember a particular
phone call from a very good friend of
mine who had gone to Canada she settled
there she's still there Married With
Children
um and she called me and said you know
and and my friends called they had a
little meeting they had a meeting and
they said you know we've had a meeting
and we think
we just don't accept what you're doing
it's just not accepted uh you should not
leave your job you should be financially
independent doing something nice great
with a you know nice package and then
you do whatever you have to
and at that time I felt a little
betrayed I'm opening up here I felt a
little betrayed why because these were
my school friends they were my friends
which I thought were like my family and
I felt they also can't understand what I
really want and so if I have to be on
the path of anything I think you have to
be alone
you have to walk alone your Life Path
it's a joy and an honor to be here today
with you all
when sagita asked me to come here to
join you
and talk about overcoming the fear of
death as we age I said huh let me think
about it I haven't really talked in such
a
Enclave like this
but not only death but we have we also
fear age aging
but we need to face reality
we're getting older
second by second hour by hour
and we cannot run away from old age nor
from death
can we we cannot run away
I have gone through many challenges in
my life facing death too which I try to
overcome through positivity
I had cancer
and thought that was the end
and death was so close to me and my
family
I recovered and managed quite well
during that difficult uh
couple of months
and
as a practicing Buddhist
we do not run away from Death in fact we
are
told to
think about aging and death at all times
it does sound depressive once I was in
America I lived in America and I was
traveling in a bus to work and then one
I was reading a Buddhist book and
somebody said what a depressing book
you're reading but then I I didn't say
anything I just smiled because I was
just studying also but
it's not depressing it's a part of life
we age uh we die and we have to accept
it understand it and die gracefully and
peacefully
first of all I think I should share with
you some a glimpse of my background I
was born in Hasa Tibet
and now it is as you all know it's
occupied forcefully occupied by China
and I came out to India before
1950 to study in Darjeeling
and uh
nine years
when I came to India to study in
Darjeeling to a modern School in fact my
Grand aunt she could have been the first
Tibetan to study out of Tibet
in the 1920s
and
I was very fortunate to have a family
in an isolated and conservative country
with a very open broad mind to send me
and my siblings to school in Darjeeling
it was a missionary school where I
learned so much also
well
my first challenge in life
was of course when I lost my country I
was in school and some students came and
said oh there's a Revolt in Tibet
there's a fight in Tibet we saw it in
the Statesman so I went to the library I
must have been about 12. went to the
library and read the article and I
thought oh
what's happening my country is
a sort of a war there people rewarding
my family were there and it just struck
me especially my family members I was
more worried about and later certainly
dawned on me that oh maybe I'll lose my
country
whatever
uh I was in Darjeeling in school and it
took us 21 days from my home in harsa to
come to the border of India in Sikkim on
Horseback and he's doing a fantastic
work now going all over the world
teaching the Dharma and also working
especially in go organic Go Green in
ladakh where they planted a million
trees in The
Nomad area where it's a very dry and
they had to irrigate and sort of make an
ice stupa you must have heard about the
ice stupa he financed it and he's busy
so anyhow he came from Tibet very late
and did more work than any of us did
having been caught into college and so
on
then in 59 there was a handful of
Tibetans like us who spoke English I had
just finished my senior Cambridge and I
had a scholarship from an old friend of
my family
uh actually he was the grandson of Utah
the great writer so Elia came to India
to see his son his Dalai Lama and the
refugees and came wanted to see my
family
so he said what are you doing I said I
don't know because in Tibet women
after hardly had education get married
that's all or you become a nun
so I said I don't know he said are you
good in maths in art so I said that's
one of my best subjects he said I've got
a scholarship for you in New York in
Pratt's Institute but I got married and
then I got
settled in work
being a translator at the Tibet Bureau
in Delhi and on the rehabilitation of
Tibetans
next challenge was my husband was posted
to Switzerland
so with two toddlers we lived in
Switzerland for five years we had over a
thousand Tibetans resettled there the
Swiss government was so kind to invite
them and many children adopted studying
there
so after that we went to
America to migrate migrated there and so
everything was new country new Customs
new languages but we managed to be
managed
I think we Tibetans being so high up in
the mountains 12 000 feet was where I
was born and life was not easy really
tough life so I think that sort of gave
us some inner strength to go forward no
they're not spoiled like my children now
you know how easy going in the cars and
having everything go to the grocery stop
Supermarket get this get that uh we went
through a hard life I mean many of our
people went through a hard life I was a
little fortunate but anyhow we managed
but then in 1979 we decided I have a
daughter and a son we decided that they
were getting too Americanized
they needed some Eastern
Customs tradition to know something
about our Eastern culture so we brought
them back to India we've had a family uh
you're an entrepreneur you're into
Wellness you're a columnist you're in
media you're in social media everywhere
so how do you uh embark on this journey
with successes after successes and
knowing fully well that there are a lot
of stresses that will pull you down each
step of the way it's a difficult Journey
but a successful one and is it just a
facade and what goes more behind the
curtains whoa all right firstly hello
everybody and welcome to the next few
crazy minutes on this roller coaster
ride so uh let's start with saying yes I
have donned many hats over my entire
career
having said that my mother prathima bedi
there's a book time pass
and she says that there's birth and
there's death
we know these two exist
in between birth and death there is this
little tiny amazing journey called life
and all we have to do is time pass
and all we do is mess it up
and all we do is think about the social
constructs of what we are told we should
be doing how we should be studying how
we should be learning what we should be
becoming how we should marry who we
should marry the right way to dress the
right way to eat we're so busy following
set patterns set by Society we forget
what life is actually about all the
journeys that I've traversed personally
and professionally
for me have just been life leading me I
have enjoyed every challenge that has
been thrown my way I was studying in
school my best friend Samaya sitting
here we've known each other since we
were 12 years old in boarding school
Lauren schools are now I was a class
topper she's Witness
[Laughter]
I was headed to Wall Street to become
part of the moves and shakers of the
financial world and I toppled into
Bollywood in my red dress flew
ever since then it's been a Non-Stop
Journey that I have allowed life to lead
me on and I have always
said to myself at every point of time
that if it feels wrong
it won't be and at every point of time
no matter what the journey has been it
could be professional going into
becoming a housewife going back into
being a professional and then a wellness
entrepreneur and I look back today maker
and I see that every single aspect of
who I was then it could it could be for
example
um
being famous okay that has led so many
eyeballs today to my entrepreneurial
journey into Wellness today uh it could
be the fact that I write a relationship
column with the times of India which has
been it's 18 years now helping people
helping them solve their problems
helping them analyze uh their lives and
and I grew up in a very different family
in the sense that we grew up
with our minds free there was no social
construct ever thrown upon me it was
always a yes you can do this and the
repercussions will be a b and c
and you better get prepared for either
of those repercussions if you should so
choose to go about the path in the way
you're planning to do so so
we learn to look at life very
differently and everything in my life
today has led me to this Wellness
Venture I'm not sure how many people
here know I know um Mr namgal who was
here earlier and also uh some you know
people who are from Tibet in the Tibetan
world and the Buddhist World here today
uh they know my grandmother very well
and she was a Buddhist now the highest
ordained Buddhist nun there are three
books written on an incredible life
journey of my grandmother my mother has
her book out everybody knows her
incredible life my father has this book
out
um I'm the my grandfather was a
spiritual healer I'm the 18th direct
descendant of his Holiness of of of Guru
nanak sahib so I mean there's a lot that
goes into a person being who they are
today and and allowing life thoughts
processes genetics
um certain character traits certain
energies that we carry with us to come
through us and to guide us and to take
us forward and to be open to it so many
of us are so closed to Opportunities we
don't even recognize opportunities when
they come our way and we're so scared to
take that leap of faith we're so we're
so we're so constrained in what we think
that we are powerless
and at the same time don't recognize
that each one of us has an inherent
power so the same thing can happen to
two different people and they both will
react so differently to the same
situation one will just drown and one
will just ride the wave one will get
crushed and one will go from strength to
strength so your attitude determines
your altitude which is what we're
talking about today which is the way you
see things is the way your life is and
if you don't like your life all you have
to do is change the way you see it and
everything changes automatically Okay so
said than done no and you're you
you're taking these meditation sessions
and you are allowing people to look at a
perspective which is then going to
further enhance your capabilities and
then help you reach your capabilities
the goals that you want to reach out to
uh what is how is that messaging going
across whether to your children to the
people uh through your Venture the
wellness Venture how are you propagating
that message so meditation is very
different and changing your mindset is
very different it's worse you have to
recognize that we are nothing but our
programs so for example we are all if I
ask you who are you
uh
well I'm a woman and taking on this
journey independently with uh
various hearts that I've known first of
personally a daughter a sister a
professionally a journalist a television
news anchor executive editor of the
channel but but more individually
somebody who's a free spirit okay uh
somebody else who who you I'm I'm Somaya
somebody say I'm a woman somebody say
I'm a daughter I'm a mother I'm a
professional you are nothing but the sum
total of your Seer programming s-e-e-r s
is your social programming so from the
time you're born you're told
this is the way you should behave this
is the way you should dress this is the
way you should eat this is the way you
should respond to the opposite sex this
is your attitude towards sex this is
your attitude towards education this is
your attitude towards your career all
your social programming e is your
economic programming which is your
programming towards money a lot of us
especially in India brought up to
believe
the rich people are bad people the
excesses are not good for you you know
I'm simple I'm you know my simple life
is good for me the point is what is
wrong with abundance what is wrong with
money when I do my money manifestation
programs people are like yes yes because
everybody wants money you need money to
have a good life you want a good life
for your children you want a good life
for your family and I'm like okay how
much you want it's like 10 crores I'm
like okay what about 10 000 crores no no
no no I I don't need 10 000 crores I'm
like why not why is this block towards
more no no but I don't need 10 000
crores I said but if you have 10 000
crores
and you want only 10 crores you can do
9990 crores worth of charity
you can go out there and change the
world you don't have to keep it for
yourself you can share you can care you
can give you can do so much so why are
we blocking abundance from coming into
our life because the attitude of
blocking abundant the attitude of being
scared of abundance the aptitude of of
not wanting abundance stops the
abundance from flowing your way because
everything is energy so economic
programming is now the rich people are
bad people money doesn't grow on trees
we've all heard that as we were growing
up rich people are surrounded by fake
friends rich people have chomchas
um you know all sorts of negative
implications and attitudes about money
the other is experiences experiences
your experiences teach you either to to
dislike to be jealous uh to be
untrusting or to be loving experiences
teach you so much not to go near dog
with the dog bit you to be fearful
and R is a religious programming because
religion tells us so much about how we
should be what we should be doing Heaven
and Hell good and bad do this ritual
this will happen to you do that ritual
this will happen to you so all of us are
nothing but a program of a Seer
programming and if you learn what is
going wrong with your programming if
you're unhappy it means there's
something wrong in your programming that
is preventing you from changing the way
you look at things to make yourself
happy it's as simple as that so what is
it that is preventing you from changing
your programming you who's getting in
your way you who can create an issue in
your mind you who can change that issue
you so so it's really very simple when
you think about it that you have created
a program you uncreate your own programs

this was just moments before the rajya
Sabha was adjourned the Vice President
in fact he's left the chair and he's
moved away because there is too much
Ruckus In the rajya Sabha we could not
hear what any of the ministers were
saying piyush goyal there was demanding
that Rahul Gandhi must come to the
Parliament and apologize for the
statements that he has made in the
United Kingdom remember just days ago
Rahul Gandhi gave several speeches
across the UK and in some of them he has
alleged that the Indian democracy is
under attack Rahul Gandhi also said that
he was under surveillance that several
Intelligence Officers have often told
him to be careful of what he says on his
phone calls or through his messages
because he is under surveillance these
are Big charges that were made by Rahul
Gandhi on foreign soil and of course the
BJP is now demanding that Rahul Gandhi
must come and apologize to the nation
for insulting India while the congress
party says that there is a Witch Hunt
going on against opposition leaders and
that they are only criticizing
the policies of the government if they
feel the democracy is not working in the
nation as it should be then they have
the right to say so that is what the
opposition is saying of course are made
loud protests and slogeneering
Raj Lakshmi Joshi with us on the
broadcast do you believe that this is a
sound strategy of the BJP to demand uh
that Rahul Gandhi must come to the
Parliament and apologize for the
statement he is made or do you believe
that this will give more attention and
in fact highlight several of the
speeches made by Rahul Gandhi
a very good morning and I think that
this should be taken up as an exemplary
measure that uh Mr Rahul Gandhi he has
to definitely apologize because the kind
of statement that he has made he has not
only just criticized our democracy he
has also said that the power he has
asked for some superpowers like the UK
and the US to and not turn a blind eye
to this whatever is happening in the
Democracy so what exactly does he mean
by all of this this is this is like
calling for attention from them is he
like asking them to uh invade India is
he asking for for them to uh put some
sanctions against us I mean this is this
is absolutely unacceptable and I think
that some you know some strong deterrent
should be put in place to uh stop he is
an elected representative so you know
any electors representative when he he
or she travels abroad they should know
how they should represent our country
this is not how you talk about our
country in the uh in the international
Forum so I think that a strong deterrent
is very much necessary and he definitely
has to apologize and I think that the
bdp is very right in demanding that he
should do so so that you know in the
future also neither he nor anybody
should go and make such a ridiculous
statements uh ever again
the opposition there says that they are
only criticizing the policies of the
government and if they feel that
democracy is under attack in India then
that is bear freedom of speech and
expression
uh that there has to be some limit to
the this term of freedom of expression
you know even in our constitution it
comes with uh you know it comes with a
lot of checks and balances so it is not
uh it is not that you can say any and
everything so uh it it definitely comes
with certain filters you have to be sure
about whether you are putting the
national security at risk what he said
there was uh what was hinting at a
regime change it was hinting at
sanctions being put against India it
hinted at a lot of things that actually
goes against our democracy so I think
that that actually doesn't come under
freedom of speech or expression but in
on the contrary it goes against our
national interest and that is the reason
I feel that we need to apologize and in
fact uh you know there has to be some
strong action taken against him also it
shouldn't just end with an apology for

finally happened yes Royal Challengers
Bangalore have finally won a game in the
Women's Premier League yes it happened
last night capping off an intimate start
to to the tournament with a fine five
Wicket win over up Warriors in the Navi
Mumbai Mumbai last night while smriti
mandanas perform continues and it's a
problem for the team it was the 20 year
old Kanika Ahuja who was shining with a
30 ball 46 runs with the
Divine kicked it off by taking both the
openers early on and Parry later grabbed
three wickets but again it's a big
question whether they're going to make
it to the to the cutoff or not we'll
have to see we are joined by an esteemed
panel today but more importantly we have
uh James King the cricket commentator
from South Africa who watched women's
game very closely in the Cape Town for
the World Cup welcome to the show James
James finally the good news is on RCB
has opened their account and how
yeah some great news there coming out of
Mumbai there with the RCB opening their
accounts and it was up to the youngster
wasn't it uh Anika huji just the
incredible Innings there from from the
youngster and yes another example of how
these uh amazing young women are coming
through and they're soaking up pressure
to deliver in The Cauldron that is now
the wpl so it's fantastic to see and you
know all these big name stars but uh
these youngsters you know soaking up
that pressure and it's just great to
see that coming up from the from the
youngster and the comments off the game
really really I think was fantastic well
let's talk about the positives what do
you think actually went uh rcb's way was
it the Ellis Paris uh four over 16 runs
and three three wickets or Sophie
Devine's all on performance and for
almost for 22 runs 23 runs and two
wickets what do you think is going are
the old foxes coming together in a in a
pack of wolves
yeah I think I think you just hit the
nail on the head you know it's not about
um we had individual performances May
ultimately get you out over the line but
if you do look at the contributions that
you're talking about there it's not just
one person or two people it's not the
big names necessarily that are all
contributing or one or two that are
contributing to the video have
contribute to the victory for ICB right
it's finally a team effort that's got
them over the line so it's the
combination of of experience and youth I
mean you look at the main scorers for
RCB and it's the the youngsters that
have come through the Indian youngsters
that have come through to get them over
the line it's your experience as you
were mentioning that's taken the wickets
and restricted uh UB Warriors to the
school that they got so you know it's
coming together and it hadn't happened
for them before then and even though you
might have had the failure up front yet
against
just you know not able to buy a run at
the moment it looks like but you've got
the depth there and the contributions to
stabilize them after they were in
trouble and you know get them over the
line in the end which I think yeah
really good for the tournament you know
they have actually got over the line
there's now some competition for that
playoff place and it's going to be
interesting to see what landforms Jim's
I'm going to just hold your thought
there you mentioned you briefly
mentioned that smriti Mandana is causing
a lot of trouble despite being the
leader ah smriti mandana's scores are
bismally low according to our standards
35 23 18 4 8
and perhaps a zero what do you what do
you make of an 88 run at an average of
14.
uh is that the smriti Mandana do we know
nothing it's not is it it's not you know
it's not a person that we normally see
leading from the front and consistently
getting getting the runs and you know
you can't really put your finger on it
can you in in these situations it's
almost a a decline if you look at the
you know looking at the scores and just
trying to think okay you know what sort
of happened
um the important thing I think smarty is
that it's just that the team got over
the line yesterday so you know despite
the fact that she hasn't contributed and
maybe you know it's good for her not to
have that pressure that she has to take
everything on her own shoulders as the
captain and as you know the the one of
the lead batters and uh that she's she's
able to announce that right right
I didn't make it but we made it sure
made it finally but we're going to talk
about an interesting performance last
night on RCB because RCB is one of the
uh the most sought after team when it
comes to fans and they're swarmed with
the observations and counter
observations and and some jibes as well
but the good part is yeah we've got
Kanika Ahuja scoring for 36 let's spare
thoughts for the youngster in fact she
is the
highest score by an uncapped player in
the Premier League earlier it was in IPL
by Paul walletti 120 and last night it
was Kanika huja your thoughts 30 ball 46
runs were you impressed with the kid
yeah I think you know that's a it's a
very good slime it means that the
youngsters are coming through in the
precious situation I'd love to comment
afterwards saying yeah she's taking
inspiration from we're at Coley that he
came to see them and and said you know
don't treat this pressure treated as
pleasure and go out there and basically
do your thing and she said that really
run very strongly in her head while she
was making those runs then as she said
she felt earlier on in the tournament
when she got that very good 22 that
she'd maybe giving it away she's focused
on her strengths and and a lot of people
there that are you know rooting for her
and have really talked her up
um maybe even before and now with this
inning I think very good comment from uh
Grace Harris around how well she played
and her grace obviously on the opposing
team but I think that just tells you a
lot about what this IPL means to so many
or wpl sorry it means to so many any
different people which is uh and those
you know established players and the
young players coming through that it's a
breeding ground for future talent and
that can only span not just Indian
women's Cricket but you know women's
crickets around the world in good
spirits so I think it's very exciting
well let's spare a thought for the fans
because uh the fans are an intrinsic
part of any franchise when you have got
uh in the in the auction room when you
had
what did you think of it and when you'll
suddenly look down after five games you
will staring at the barrel of the gun
with no Victory altogether your views
how would a fan feel from that moment to
last night
yeah I think you know you're looking at
it and you're thinking you know when are
they going to actually fire you know
they've got all this Firepower in there
got all this experience you've got uh
some of the youth coming through with
the you know capped players as well as
uncapped players and you're starting to
think well no one of these guys going to
come good when are they going to repay
our investment you know and not just
from a not from an owner's point of view
but from a from a Fan's point of view
and and fans invest so much I think we
mustn't underestimate the amount that
fans invest just in emotional and you
know the emotion of it and supporting
your team and just you know the the
probably getting distraught when they
just don't get over the line and you
know having lost five in a row it's just
it it's sort of almost defied logic that
that could happen with the lineup that
they have you look at and we like Dennis
who you know is not even really been
part of what they've been doing so
you've got you've got a backup as well
in in the hutch you know that it's not
that you've just got
um these players that are out on the
field or the team that's out in the
field so it's um it was puzzling and now
that they're back in it almost I mean
you look at the blog and because you've
got two teams that are Germany I'm gonna
just hold on to your thoughts I'm just
going to hold on to your thought you
said it's puzzling because you've got a
wealth of talent sitting inside the hut
trying to take over but where is the
problem is the problem with the
management uh certainly the coach The
head coach or the operations the cricket
operations guy at the RCB who's
supposedly one of the highest paid uh
IPL and franchise Cricket official he's
getting everything wrong year after year
do you think think he is responsible for
the entire team not settling it
well I think you know it it's you know a
hard one to to call but you have to say
that you know this far into the
tournament
you would have you would have expected
that the the you know all the
component parts of this would have come
together to to give you a performance
and to identify where it's perhaps just
not going right and that you you're
looking at and and looking at it and
saying okay how do I get these
combinations right what's the input from
the you know the team what's the captain
what's the input on the other coaches
how do we take what's happening how are
we comparing or you know you look at
your own performance first obviously
right but it is important to understand
what's happening with the opposition and
how do you you know plan for each game
and and try and look at how do you get
over the line take the conditions into
consideration look at the team that
you've got the players at your disposal
and how they're going do you feel
they're going to perform best and the
best combination for that particular
time and event so it's uh it's it's a
tough one to call I mean I I don't
necessarily think I'm a I tend to be a
bit of a fan stitch on some of these
things unless there's the evidence there
that shows that it's one individual or
not you know that's that's really making
um a difference either way but it's hard
to understand how you have a situation
where so many good players are not able
to get you over the line you know in
five in in in five uh matches and then
yeah you come good but on the back of a
standout performance from metal to stand
out performances with juice
let's flip the situation you've got
shabnam Ismail which is the fastest
bowling uh bowler in the world right now
you've got Lola Laura wolvard who's the
highest scorer at the World Cup just a
fortnight ago or three weeks ago I mean
both the players one was not picked for
the the auctions and the second is still
warming the benches if horses for
courses if shabnam is smile
is sitting in the bench and not being
able to play because she could not find
a way into the team and there are a
couple of other examples as well like
you mentioned uh do you think it's time
that the youngsters will put on the heat
on on the for on the big names as well
is it going to start or has it already
started
I think it has already started certainly
but yeah you've also got to give the you
know some of those players
it gives them a chance I mean I think I
think you can't underestimate the value
of experience right and match situations
tend to you've got two extremes here
you've got people who that have been
around for a while can read a match that
can plan within a match how to play it
you've got the maybe exuberance and
fearlessness of Youth that comes in and
sometimes that'll pay off for you and
sometimes it won't you know it's just
how do you get that combination right
it's the coaches or you know and and
captains the I think it's their
conundrum always is how do you go in
with the team that you've got with the
almost the menu that you have in front
of you that you know what dishes are you
going to choose almost in some way to
say how do we put the right combination
together that's going to actually make
sure we we can get over the line satisfy
our our fans keep everybody happy and
keep our team happy that we're in the
hunt uh for all that and and sometimes
you have to make the tough decisions
around who do you leave out who do I put
in but you know I do think you you've
got to give those uh experienced players
also need a chance to get in with the
condition into the conditions play and
and be able to actually you know run
with that and go with it I mean you you
think that somebody plays six Innings
and and you're yet to really make any
kind of contribution you know do you
actually make a tough decision and and
say to the captains sorry you can't play
in the next game because you're just not
contributing well um and and it's not
yeah which is the captain who's uh LED
from the front and who has impressed you
because our next couple of questions are
based on your answer
yeah so you can't really look much
further than the two top teams can you I
mean if you look at Harbor Freight and
you look at Meg Lanning and you
understand what they bring to their
teams and I'm not saying that you you
know you're not that's not a disc on on
anybody else that you know on the on the
other captains that are there but if you
just look at the experience they bring
from International captaincy and you
look at how the deal with pressure
situations and time after time they they
stand up they read the situation and
they they're able to help get their team
over the line just have to look at the
player of the match performances
do you understand that James you you've
very nicely put the name of Harman preet
Kaur the Mumbai Indian captains she's
got 65 of 30 11 of 8 53 of 33 and 51 of
30. she is leading from the front you
you were there at the Cape Town when
India I lost the semi-final match and
there was a brutal comment made by Nasir
Hussain at that point of time post-match
ceremony he said that it was a lazy
attempt and a schoolgirl Cricket that
happens do you think Harman preeth Kaur
has finally silenced her critics this is
a tough one for you James but let's bite
the bullet do you think it's a
Redemption time and harbanpreet has
resorted to and reverted with her
performance
you know I I'm sure she's not going to
see it that way is she but uh but the
the thing is that
yeah you know that was
it was that it happened you know what
happened in the World Cup semi-final
happened her reaction to what happened
there and shows that just what it meant
to her what and she realized you know
when you have somebody's experiences
that you don't actually have to tell
them that what they did you know was you
know maybe what necessity you don't have
to tell them I mean everybody's entitled
to their opinion and to say you know as
a pundit or a an expert what they think
but the thing is that she's answered you
know from a quality she's showing in
this competition the you know what she's
about she served that in the semi-final
of the World Cup I mean she wouldn't
India wouldn't have been in the position
they were in yes to get over the line in
that semi-final if it wasn't for her and
so one moment of Madness if you want to
call it that and it does happen you know
it happens to so many players and you
know I don't want to even go back into
the to some of the history of of those
key moments in right in pressure moments
things that happen and you know it
that's that's the way it sport Works
absolutely that's the way how it Sports
was and it is very brutal we all know
that James one last quick question
before we wrap up our show which is your
favorite team as of now as of today
well I I'm I'm president as president
biased uh but yeah MRI for me really uh
are just fine in Top Gear at the moment
um being challenged significantly by
daily capitals clearly I think that
you've got
combinations though if they start coming
together for the other teams I mean I I
think RCB if they can put together two
more good performances they've got a
very strong choice of being in the
playoffs and then it you know then if
you turn it around and you've got
momentum on your side the other teams
start to sort of flag a little bit and
they they're not continuing their
winning ways necessarily
all right so about who takes momentum
into the playoffs often that's going to
come out on top not necessarily who
starts well unfortunately in a lot of
these uh tournaments and tell us the
situations so ma'am anything can happen
but yeah I read I rate I mean am I have
just been incredible so far and uh Karma
Greek continue to lead from the front
it's going to be very difficult to see
them being beaten for more such videos

VhaNX_HHV1s,Ariha&#39;s Parents On NewsX | Hear Ariha&#39;s Parents&#39; Version | NewsX,It has been more than a year since 2 Indian parents have been separated from their baby. Ariha Shah was a toddler when ...,2023-03-15T16:18:44Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VhaNX_HHV1s/hqdefault.jpg,"now it has been more than two years
since Indian parents
have been separated from their child
arihasha who is a toddler where the
German authorities took custody of her
after alleging that she was being quote
unquote sexually harassed by her parents
since then the toddler has been living
in foster care in Berlin the parents of
the child who are seeking to reunite
with her are with us on The Telecast
today and let's hear their ordeal in
trying to get back their daughter with
them
joined by dharasha who's the mother of
ariha I'm also being joined by bhavesha
who's the father of ariha
dharasha
is
custody
foreign
foreign foreign
um
I came for the second time and my wife
came for the fourth time or like each
time we came and we are like trying to
get an appointment with me a uh in in
the last hearing uh me a already Indian
Embassy
who will only be fighting for the rights
of the child and
the child should be repotted to India
but the problem was that uh Joe lawyer
Embassy Embassy request at least
exactly what they are planning and how
they are planning uh
opportunity but later on from the
lawyers we got to know the lawyers were
very sympathetic the Lords were very
good but the problem was like it was not
uh like uh their line of field because
they belong to an international car law
or something which I don't know what
does that mean but like he didn't had
any knowledge or any idea about how the
international child rights law works so
that was a big catch so like how many
sandwiches
so that was a major problem and after
that as soon as we got to know that day
onwards we are trying to get connected
with Indian Embassy in Germany but like
Assurance
eyeballs
and there was a case that she fought
against the Norway government she got
the custody of her children after seven
long years
in fact charges against our that the
children were not being treated well and
when the government was not really aware
of the customs and rituals and cultures
of Indians who had immigrated to Norway
you know she had been accused of feeding
her children
she was also accused of allowing her
children to sleep in the same bed as she
and her husband slept in so now these
These are cultural differences uh that
bring about a Discord in how the child
writes authorities say in Norway or in
Germany would look at at with regards to
the contrast that is witnessed in the
cultural ethos of of of of Indian
parents of Indians or or any other part
of the world now you've spoken about how
you were not satisfied with the lawyer
who's fighting your case uh what is the
appeal that you would like to make
through our channel to all the people
concerned to the Indians who are
watching your telecast to the
authorities that are watching your
telecast so first of all I would like to
say like all these European countries
don't even bother about the Indian
culture they don't even know like what
Indian culture is till date they are not
even sure what is the difference between
a Jain vegetarian or a vegetarian diet
and a vegan diet still they are saying
that like I am asking for a vegan diet
for my child but whereas we are asking
for a vegetarian diet they don't even
know what is the difference between
Hindi Urdu and Gujarati they they
consider all three languages same so
this is the major problem and they they
don't even know anything about our
culture so so because of this
so like they didn't even don't even
bother what does the India is
so so that's what uh I would like to
appeal from like I will only like to
appeal from Sri Narendra bodhiji that
like he can only take like he can he can
only help our child because in Germany
or in anywhere anywhere in the world
because um I have even even seen the
news X interview last time where where
Mr late we know tikoji uh was fighting
for the children who were taken from
Florida so he's he's uh and that was
being covered by newsx thanks for that
and uh clearly like he is not concerned
about the parents and same thing I am
telling don't don't even consider about
us please please help our child that's
what and that's the reason we are in in
India and that's what we know tikku late
late Mr vinotiku also said like
I'm concerned about the child because if
the child stays more than 18 months in
Florida so that they will not be
returned back and their identity will be
destroyed same thing is happening with
our child so we are just asking help for
our child SRI Narendra Modi ji we want
we want you know we want um
that's what we want we don't want
anything and we are not here for any to
seek any help for ourselves
uh it's an unfortunate incident that has
taken place with bhavesh andhara Shah
their daughter Arya is in the custody of
the German authorities there are these
child rights authorities that have put
in the blame of sexual harassment
against the parents they are sitting
with me right now there's an appeal that
I make to the public to the authorities
to the prime minister to the ministry of
external Affairs on their behalf to work
on this problem that has arisen it has
continued for two years and more it is a
little child of two years she was seven
months old when she had been taken away
snatched away from her parents under the
acquisition under the allegation of
sexual harassment from her parents by
the German authorities and it's been
over two years now that she continues to
be in the custody of the German
authorities it's high time the minister
of external Affairs did
and took some strong actions to allow
for the parents to be reunited with her
daughter I thank both of you bhavesh and
Tara for joining me on The Telecast to
putting out your appeal I wish you all
the best I can understand and I
empathize with your pain and I'm going
to only wish you all the luck and we
hope that by this telecast and giving
you the sad time we are able to reach
out to the right people to the right
Ministries to the right departments to
work on your case in an exigent manner
to allow for you to be United with your
daughter for more such videos subscribe

3ErHsnpjmjw,Oppn Parties to March to EDs Office in Delhi | Oppn to demand Probe into Adani | NewsX,"To Subscribe our YouTube channel ""NewsX"" click on the link below:- #delhi #adaniscam #newsx ...",2023-03-15T10:11:01Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ErHsnpjmjw/hqdefault.jpg,"well the opposition is mounting it's
offensive against the government once
again MPS of like-minded opposition
parties are going to March to the Ed's
office to register a complaint against
the adani scam today at 12 30 pm
from the Parliament House
mahima kataria my colleague is joining
us at this point in time to give us more
updates mahima an unlikely scenario
raghav chadna and some of the members of
the congress party in the same room for
a joint cause
well absolutely beneath it is the 16
like-minded parties as we all know that
today is the third day of the second leg
of the parliament session or I would say
the budget session but both the houses
have been adjourned and like you
correctly pointed out all the parties
are going to march from here so these
are the bad the visuals that we people
are showing you massive barricading
police force deployment paramilitary
deployment that has been done in the
area of the parliament and the marches
and escalation on the part of opposition
in the middle of the standoff in the
parliament beneath in a bid to escalate
its offense against the Modi government
the opposition planned the march to the
office of the investigative agencies
that is the Ed and the CBI over two days
to highlight AI should also probe into
the adani issue sources said that the
opposition MPS belonging to the 16
parties and that is what we people
believe that also that in the Malika
Arjun office 16 like-minded parties met
and the 16 political parties which are
coordinating in the parliament are
likely to lead a March from this very
road that we people are are showing you
the visuals though the opposition party
is agitating over what it calls is the
misuse of agencies by the governing BJP
to Target anti-bjp political parties and
leaders the marshes are likely to demand
that the agencies launch a probe into
the adani issue so that is what we
people are learning that any moment from
now the political parties that is the 16
like-minded political parties are going
to come and start with their March to
the enforcement directorate but beneath
one point I would like to make here
which is very important that this entire
move was mooted by none other than
Congress MP Casey venugopal he gave an
idea about this particular March that
now the agency should probe in the adani
issue so they along with the JPC they
want now the agency to probe for more

um
I just came from Mexico and we have now
taken a new home in the Yucatan in the
very very bottom of Mexico and we invite
you all to come and join us there
where it seems that people are coming
from all over the world
and you ask them
why did you come and they say we don't
really know we were just drawn here how
long will you stay well I came for three
weeks and that was three years ago
so it reminded me very much in 1977 when
I
put my feet first on the soil of India I
came from USA
to be part of the 400th
birthday anniversary of Guru ramdas in
Amritsar
and
India
became my home
and we would travel here two to three
times every year remaining in Los
Angeles for 40 years
and
[Music]
doing all these last
53 years really that I've been
practicing this science of Kundalini
Yoga and teaching it all over the world
I'm still amazed every day when I get up
before the sun comes up to be reminded
that my feet have touched the Earth one
more day and I have one more day that
perhaps I can share and do something
useful in this lifetime
and so far so good I believe
a story
I'm always reminded of
is a story that Osho used to tell and it
was her name was
it started with an R I can't quite
remember her name if she's Persian or
Indian but she would be found up on the
road
looking for something and she was an old
lady that was leaned over she kept
looking and looking and the neighbors
would come and they would say Rubina
what are you looking for and she says
I'm looking for my needle I lost my
needle
I was like a sewing needle so the
neighbors would all gather and try to
find a needle
by the roadside
needles are really small right so they
finally said to Robina
this is impossible do you have any idea
where the needle is
and she says yes it's in my house
and then they really started talking
she's gone mad well they knew she was
mad anyway but she was a prophet and
they said then why are we looking up on
this road if you're
needle is in your house and she replied
because this is where the light is
there's no light in my house
it was a story and it was a parable
to say that our light we live out here
but we've lost the light
on the inside and we're in darkness
and one of the stories one of many that
I heard along the way another one was it
was when I was 20 years old and it was
in 1960 something and we had heard that
there was a woman in Carmel Valley in
California in Carmel because I lived in
La for 40 years that she
seemed to know something that we didn't
know at that time I was 22 years old and
we didn't know anything we didn't know
yoga we didn't know meditation we did
not have any
inside steps because our parents hadn't
done it most of us and they were just
looking for the light on the outside
which is called materialism
but there was a special old lady she
probably was 50 years old but at that
time when I was 20 that was old and so
we hitchhiked to our house and it was by
the ocean
and we went in we heard it was free
because no one had any money then and
she was a small lady
and she was on this box that played
music we didn't even know what a
harmonium was and there was a keyboard
like a piano and we came in quiet and
there were candles lit and she sat there
and she sang and she welcomed us all and
the song that kept in my mind for years
and years was a Yogananda song who is in
my temple who is in my temple all the
doors do open up wide all the lights do
light up high who is in my temple
and I had no idea what she was singing
Temple was she talking about lights
what's she talking about what's the
outside what's the inside I was so
struck
with her
and with the Osho story
that I spent years
trying to find this light or trying to
find what they were talking about
and that's when I got blessed to enter
when I was 26.
an ashram that did Kundalini Yoga
and after one class and getting up at 2
3 in the morning with sadhana
and becoming a very devout vegetarian
and also starting to cook and serve
hundreds of people every day on the
streets then I started understanding for
the first time
what real happiness is what real Joy is
and whenever I get lost
if I go back to
all of that I'll remember why I am here
and people ask me when are you going to
retire
and I said well probably I'm my exhale
meaning if God grants me the power to
keep helping and keep serving in any way
I can why would I do something else it
doesn't make any sense so I'm so honored
to have been divided been invited by
Sangeeta and I I'm amazed at how many
friends Sangita has
everybody you know she's my cousin she's
my best friend when I was a child I've
known her 20 years everybody's rallied
to come to this place to be part of this
it's small today but I believe something
has been birthed right here today and
you're all witnessing it this will
transfer to many cities because people
want to in the way the world is now how
do you
how do you grow old with Grace how does
your brain still keep working
how can your body keep working there
must be a way because marketing tells us
pretty much the opposite just take a
pill just do this just do that rest rest
always rest and um
so I'm here today hopefully tomorrow
you'll all come to the 10 o'clock class
of Kundalini Yoga everyone can do it
there's not a soul who still has a
heartbeat that can't do Kundalini Yoga
and if you'll join us tomorrow at 10 I
think that'll be great I thought today
I would do just some very short little
things to give you the experience of how
fast you can find your joy how fast you
can heal how fast you can let all your
troubles go so if you'll sit up straight
or straight as you can
and I'm going to tune in because I have
to
talk to
our employer upstairs
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
please inhale deeply and hold your
breath
and exhale if everyone will bring their
Jupiter finger your index finger up just
like right by your ear lobes and then
take them down just a bit so it looks
like this
chip
[Music]
so keep going and even if you find
yourself
stopping because you think you can't get
your fingers to go take a breather and
then go again symmetrical left and right
side of your brain will start working
much better
foreign
[Music]
keep your eyes rolled up
we're going to do it a collective five
minutes
[Music]
right by your earlobes
[Music]
be able to keep them symmetrical
[Music]
it's such a beautiful
joy to be with you all I
actually have to leave in just a few
minutes to go catch a flight back to
rishikesh for which I apologize but I
am so happy to spend just a few minutes
with you
this wonderful conclave that Sangeetha
and all of her team has put together I'm
so so glad to be here I'm so glad to be
here with my beloved sister gurmukti
especially at her 80th birthday just
before we come together next week in
rishikesh at paramarthnicathon for the
International yoga Festival
as we're here talking about aging
blissfully and just just the few minutes
that I have I was thinking you know
yesterday
I was at a beautiful event here in Delhi
at the Constitution club
by Vicky and I had the great honor of
sharing a stage with a 95 year old
athletic champion her name is bagwani
Pago
that one seemed to go out no problem
here we are
looking uploaded
her name was bhagwani
Devi dadiji
95 a small little beautiful woman from
haryana who is now a world champion in
100 yard dashes shot put throws not
that she was a champion when she was
young and now she just happens to be 95.
but right now just having started in the
last couple of decades she's become this
world champion
and as I sat next to her on stage
yesterday
I got
some beautiful tips from her not given
directly in terms of bullet points of
anti-aging but just through talking to
her and they were things very simple
she doesn't use any potions or pills or
powders
no special tonic
but she's asleep by 8 30 every night and
she's awake long before five
she eats very simply Japanese
and she loves just just see me later it
was amazing just to simulate first thing
she did
hello everyone
this has been such a revelation you know
sometimes you come because you're asked
to by
your friends
but I am so happy to be part of this
wonderful conclave and sagita this is
absolutely beautiful what a great
Ambiance and you're going to go very far
with this because I really feel that
more than anything else in the lives
that we lead today
you know looking after Self
um you know your own well-being in the
hecticness of life that we lead is
really possibly the most important
um you know thing that we should take
into our daily considerations and you
know in our lifestyles which sometimes
is quite unhealthy I feel our topic
today
is to create the life we deserve
the bigger picture of course is
aging blissfully well I'm just trying to
age gracefully
not trying not to lie about my age
anymore but uh God forbid anyone asked
me that question but uh yes I think this
is um such an amazing platform to bring
together
um our modern day lives and the reality
of the kind of life that we are leading
but what we really need to inject into
it is I think self-care
I'm going to be reading a lot because
out of my phone which I've scribbled
notes on because I can't remember a
thing and I have to stop blaming covet
three times and praying Fork because of
which because I this is just age I mean
to be honest and uh today I have these
two incredible people with me
who I have known on a very personal
level sunit who I have known ever since
I have come into Delhi but more than two
and a half decades ago I have always
admired him of course for his creativity
I've also been in fashion
um most of my life and I I have loved
fashion since I was a kid and
um sunit I mean he's the original Glam
slam you wanted to look for anything
glamorous uh you went to sunith Varma
and he's been actually through so many
stages of his journey uh professionally
and personally
um and I and
somebody mentioned his humility and I
think that's that for me is my friend
sunid and of course talent in like which
has no bounds
and then there's this lovely Dr Gita
prakash my GP Perils of her profession
who does answer my call at all kinds of
orders with the weirdest of things that
I come up with I have always been the
opposite of a hypochondriac I mean
almost childlike I've never finished an
antibiotic course and really I'm very
very careless and lackadaisical about my
health so if I go to a doctor means I'm
almost dying or I think I'm dying and
there is uh Dr Gita prakash on call 24
hours with me whenever I need her which
is incredible when the kids were born
and I had to be here on my own because
my husband was in the Navy so they sort
of grew up I I used to always tell him
I'm giving you ready-made children
because sort of I looked after them nine
years now but whatever it was I had
great fun in the sense we always found
something fun to do with that but
everyone goes to their tiles and
tribulations I went through my own I
lost my mother my mother-in-law my
husband recently about a couple of years
ago that was a big shock but my children
are so supportive and not only them I
always say my in-law bacha's also who
have now become my bachchas I mean I
think that is what's helped me to go
through everything plus my work like I
said they enjoy what I do and it was the
biggest strength to be able to help
people to realize I'm still privileged
the other thing I always say is keep the
faith there's nothing you cannot do if
you put your mind to it so you just have
to stay positive and say this is what I
want and this is what I'm going to do no
matter what everyone you will find so
many roadblocks but they happily sort of
move away you Slither through them if
you really want to do what you want to
do so just remember you only live once
do whatever you can whenever you can if
opportunity strikes like it did for me I
mean I did three years of being a radio
jockey as well I used to talk on radio
shows also on medical issues basically
Medical but in the sense somebody just
said why don't you do this and I said
why not and today somebody said why
don't you model I said I'd love to so
when somebody calls me this before they
say what it is I say yes because I'm
sure I want to do it so much fun I mean
it's another aspect of you that you
learn about so I think what you do is
you just keep growing till you die I
suppose I think covert taught a lot of
us a lot of things
I'm sure many people who have had some
personal tragedies and stories I lost
two very close young cousins overnight I
mean one died within three days one died
within seven days much younger than I
ten years younger than I am 15 years
younger than I with little children and
I think I was always
um
a little bit more optimistic about life
even as a kid and growing up it may have
to do something with my upbringing or my
family but I think post covet
everybody's had a new sense of living a
new sense of the moment because you're
here today you may not be here in the
next 10 minutes I mean there's there's
20 year old and 30 year olds who are
falling ill and passing away within in a
gym I I'm sure everybody read that
recently so
I think for me I've decided
um I actually decided that long back
that I was going to live my life to the
fullest I'm not a very typical
Punjabi boy who kind of you know was
going to grow up and become a banker
like their parents
um and and thank God I do what I do
because I'd be so bad at everything else
I I almost don't know anything else to
do but to do what I do so because I like
doing this I celebrate that every day
and I enjoy literally every day of it
great and that's where you get your yeah
yeah that's where I decided that you
know this is the one gift that God has
given me
and more than the gift this is the one
opportunity that God has given me
because a lot of people are very gifted
a lot of people are very gifted but they
may not have the opportunity they may
not have the support system I'm very
happy to be here
um I got this opportunity I think we
call it the drama
you know the drama which happens
and I'm happy to be amongst all of you
um
I was given I when I was reading this
aging
gracefully and you hear the word
blissfully
I feel connected in terms that it's very
spiritual notion
it's a very spiritual lifestyle which we
are talking about
I've been practicing meditation for the
last 20 years a little introduction I'd
give about myself
I got introduced with the teachings of
the Brahma Kumaris just casually because
I just wanted to have a little more
concentration
um and that's how I got connected with
meditation I had no inclination to wear
a white saree like this and be in front
of you my whole purpose was very selfish
very focused to get some good marks to
focus on my studies
and it really did help
and
I've been born and brought up in Lucknow
maybe you've been there
it was a very good
introduction which helped me and
As I Grew in my college and then I did
an MBA I went to Bombay did my MBA
because I was ambitious
and yet I found that no matter what
you're doing no matter what you're
achieving
you need to be connected with the self
um you need to experience that Bliss
Within
if you want to actually experience
anything outside otherwise you just go
with the flow and you don't know where
your life is going
so I was connected with and practicing
the Raj yoga meditation which was just
next to my college actually they studied
in NM and is a very beautiful center of
the Brahma Kumaris just next to
um you know just walking distance
I came back to gurgaon because Delhi and
gurgaon where my family was settled and
I started working I worked in an MNC as
an analyst for some time
but even there
we had people who were meditating
and of course I was a meditator I
started working practicing
and then I had the opportunity
to understand and actually go to a
retreat center where I'm now putting up
I'm coming from we were talking about
nature and I was just connected to the
retreat center where I stay it's a 30
acre campus and I take this opportunity
to invite all of you
um you know it's called Om Shanti
retreat.org you can check our address
where we have peacocks and birds and
flowers and trees and it's open for all
um
it was built 23 years ago but which was
a Barren land but now it's of course a
different story
so you're all invited there for the last
10 years and serving there as a Raj yoga
teacher
so while I was working as an analyst
um every weekend I used to spend my time
there and go back to the corporate world
to the world and come back
and I did it for about a year and a half
every weekend
which gave me this understanding you
know the contrast of what's happening
and you know what I want
and it became very clear with my friends
uh you know finding a life finding a
partner going abroad settling somewhere
um I had to figure out what I needed to
do you know you were talking about we
had a woman in white hair you had you
know we're talking about people in your
60s or 70s but you know aging is a
process which happens every moment
because even a teenager is trying to fit
in especially a girl
if you're choosing anything maybe you're
choosing to do a job maybe a I mean I'm
sitting here if when I chose that I
would like to lead a spiritual life what
do you think was it easy or difficult
we are talking about inclusivity but how
about inclusivity of spirituality
how about women being allowed to choose
whether they want to lead a spiritual
life or not
because
and I'll tell you an experience when I
was
10 years I mean I chose about 12 years
that I'm gonna be in this 10 years I'm
at the center
I was younger
a Slimmer
and you know my friends and my
colleagues
family relatives and so-called well
wishers
it was very difficult
they can't accept a fact that I would
like to lead a life which is close to my
heart
and you know what they said to me what
would you say
foreign
and what else what do you think what
else
yes you have not this is not your age
you know this is not your age you are
too young to do that
now aging gracefully meaning there is
nothing too young or too old
let's take that into consideration there
is nothing like you're too young to do
that or you're too old to do that
if you are convinced if you are having
an experience if you are sure what
you're doing it's absolutely fine I
think
so I'm just bringing another perspective
of spirituality
I'm happy now that uh I'm happy because
I'm standing here and sharing it in
front of you I'm happy because I got
connected with my friends who counseled
me
who were getting married settling
everywhere and counseled me you know
they said you know
just
take it easy do what you have to but you
should have a life
I said you know I have a life
I have a life believe me I have a life
they said just do everything but you
should also have a life
now
of course I faced certain of these
Challenge and I remember a particular
phone call from a very good friend of
mine who had gone to Canada she settled
there she's still there Married With
Children
um and she called me and said you know
and and my friends called they had a
little meeting they had a meeting and
they said you know we've had a meeting
and we think
we just don't accept what you're doing
it's just not accepted uh you should not
leave your job you should be financially
independent doing something nice great
with a you know nice package and then
you do whatever you have to
and at that time I felt a little
betrayed I'm opening up here I felt a
little betrayed why because these were
my school friends they were my friends
which I thought were like my family and
I felt they also can't understand what I
really want and so if I have to be on
the path of anything I think you have to
be alone
you have to walk alone your Life Path
it's a joy and an honor to be here today
with you all
when sagita asked me to come here to
join you
and talk about overcoming the fear of
death as we age I said huh let me think
about it I haven't really talked in such
a
Enclave like this
but not only death but we have we also
fear age aging
but we need to face reality
we're getting older
second by second hour by hour
and we cannot run away from old age nor
from death
can we we cannot run away
I have gone through many challenges in
my life facing death too which I try to
overcome through positivity
I had cancer
and thought that was the end
and death was so close to me and my
family
I recovered and managed quite well
during that difficult uh
couple of months
and
as a practicing Buddhist
we do not run away from Death in fact we
are
told to
think about aging and death at all times
it does sound depressive once I was in
America I lived in America and I was
traveling in a bus to work and then one
I was reading a Buddhist book and
somebody said what a depressing book
you're reading but then I I didn't say
anything I just smiled because I was
just studying also but
it's not depressing it's a part of life
we age uh we die and we have to accept
it understand it and die gracefully and
peacefully
first of all I think I should share with
you some a glimpse of my background I
was born in Hasa Tibet
and now it is as you all know it's
occupied forcefully occupied by China
and I came out to India before
1950 to study in Darjeeling
and uh
nine years
when I came to India to study in
Darjeeling to a modern School in fact my
Grand aunt she could have been the first
Tibetan to study out of Tibet
in the 1920s
and
I was very fortunate to have a family
in an isolated and conservative country
with a very open broad mind to send me
and my siblings to school in Darjeeling
it was a missionary school where I
learned so much also
well
my first challenge in life
was of course when I lost my country I
was in school and some students came and
said oh there's a Revolt in Tibet
there's a fight in Tibet we saw it in
the Statesman so I went to the library I
must have been about 12. went to the
library and read the article and I
thought oh
what's happening my country is
a sort of a war there people rewarding
my family were there and it just struck
me especially my family members I was
more worried about and later certainly
dawned on me that oh maybe I'll lose my
country
whatever
uh I was in Darjeeling in school and it
took us 21 days from my home in harsa to
come to the border of India in Sikkim on
Horseback and he's doing a fantastic
work now going all over the world
teaching the Dharma and also working
especially in go organic Go Green in
ladakh where they planted a million
trees in The
Nomad area where it's a very dry and
they had to irrigate and sort of make an
ice stupa you must have heard about the
ice stupa he financed it and he's busy
so anyhow he came from Tibet very late
and did more work than any of us did
having been caught into college and so
on
then in 59 there was a handful of
Tibetans like us who spoke English I had
just finished my senior Cambridge and I
had a scholarship from an old friend of
my family
uh actually he was the grandson of Utah
the great writer so Elia came to India
to see his son his Dalai Lama and the
refugees and came wanted to see my
family
so he said what are you doing I said I
don't know because in Tibet women
after hardly had education get married
that's all or you become a nun
so I said I don't know he said are you
good in maths in art so I said that's
one of my best subjects he said I've got
a scholarship for you in New York in
Pratt's Institute but I got married and
then I got
settled in work
being a translator at the Tibet Bureau
in Delhi and on the rehabilitation of
Tibetans
next challenge was my husband was posted
to Switzerland
so with two toddlers we lived in
Switzerland for five years we had over a
thousand Tibetans resettled there the
Swiss government was so kind to invite
them and many children adopted studying
there
so after that we went to
America to migrate migrated there and so
everything was new country new Customs
new languages but we managed to be
managed
I think we Tibetans being so high up in
the mountains 12 000 feet was where I
was born and life was not easy really
tough life so I think that sort of gave
us some inner strength to go forward no
they're not spoiled like my children now
you know how easy going in the cars and
having everything go to the grocery stop
Supermarket get this get that uh we went
through a hard life I mean many of our
people went through a hard life I was a
little fortunate but anyhow we managed
but then in 1979 we decided I have a
daughter and a son we decided that they
were getting too Americanized
they needed some Eastern
Customs tradition to know something
about our Eastern culture so we brought
them back to India we've had a family uh
you're an entrepreneur you're into
Wellness you're a columnist you're in
media you're in social media everywhere
so how do you uh embark on this journey
with successes after successes and
knowing fully well that there are a lot
of stresses that will pull you down each
step of the way it's a difficult Journey
but a successful one and is it just a
facade and what goes more behind the
curtains whoa all right firstly hello
everybody and welcome to the next few
crazy minutes on this roller coaster
ride so uh let's start with saying yes I
have donned many hats over my entire
career
having said that my mother prathima bedi
there's a book time pass
and she says that there's birth and
there's death
we know these two exist
in between birth and death there is this
little tiny amazing journey called life
and all we have to do is time pass
and all we do is mess it up
and all we do is think about the social
constructs of what we are told we should
be doing how we should be studying how
we should be learning what we should be
becoming how we should marry who we
should marry the right way to dress the
right way to eat we're so busy following
set patterns set by Society we forget
what life is actually about all the
journeys that I've traversed personally
and professionally
for me have just been life leading me I
have enjoyed every challenge that has
been thrown my way I was studying in
school my best friend Samaya sitting
here we've known each other since we
were 12 years old in boarding school
Lauren schools are now I was a class
topper she's Witness
[Laughter]
I was headed to Wall Street to become
part of the moves and shakers of the
financial world and I toppled into
Bollywood in my red dress flew
ever since then it's been a Non-Stop
Journey that I have allowed life to lead
me on and I have always
said to myself at every point of time
that if it feels wrong
it won't be and at every point of time
no matter what the journey has been it
could be professional going into
becoming a housewife going back into
being a professional and then a wellness
entrepreneur and I look back today maker
and I see that every single aspect of
who I was then it could it could be for
example
um
being famous okay that has led so many
eyeballs today to my entrepreneurial
journey into Wellness today uh it could
be the fact that I write a relationship
column with the times of India which has
been it's 18 years now helping people
helping them solve their problems
helping them analyze uh their lives and
and I grew up in a very different family
in the sense that we grew up
with our minds free there was no social
construct ever thrown upon me it was
always a yes you can do this and the
repercussions will be a b and c
and you better get prepared for either
of those repercussions if you should so
choose to go about the path in the way
you're planning to do so so
we learn to look at life very
differently and everything in my life
today has led me to this Wellness
Venture I'm not sure how many people
here know I know um Mr namgal who was
here earlier and also uh some you know
people who are from Tibet in the Tibetan
world and the Buddhist World here today
uh they know my grandmother very well
and she was a Buddhist now the highest
ordained Buddhist nun there are three
books written on an incredible life
journey of my grandmother my mother has
her book out everybody knows her
incredible life my father has this book
out
um I'm the my grandfather was a
spiritual healer I'm the 18th direct
descendant of his Holiness of of of Guru
nanak sahib so I mean there's a lot that
goes into a person being who they are
today and and allowing life thoughts
processes genetics
um certain character traits certain
energies that we carry with us to come
through us and to guide us and to take
us forward and to be open to it so many
of us are so closed to Opportunities we
don't even recognize opportunities when
they come our way and we're so scared to
take that leap of faith we're so we're
so we're so constrained in what we think
that we are powerless
and at the same time don't recognize
that each one of us has an inherent
power so the same thing can happen to
two different people and they both will
react so differently to the same
situation one will just drown and one
will just ride the wave one will get
crushed and one will go from strength to
strength so your attitude determines
your altitude which is what we're
talking about today which is the way you
see things is the way your life is and
if you don't like your life all you have
to do is change the way you see it and
everything changes automatically Okay so
said than done no and you're you
you're taking these meditation sessions
and you are allowing people to look at a
perspective which is then going to
further enhance your capabilities and
then help you reach your capabilities
the goals that you want to reach out to
uh what is how is that messaging going
across whether to your children to the
people uh through your Venture the
wellness Venture how are you propagating
that message so meditation is very
different and changing your mindset is
very different it's worse you have to
recognize that we are nothing but our
programs so for example we are all if I
ask you who are you
uh
well I'm a woman and taking on this
journey independently with uh
various hearts that I've known first of
personally a daughter a sister a
professionally a journalist a television
news anchor executive editor of the
channel but but more individually
somebody who's a free spirit okay uh
somebody else who who you I'm I'm Somaya
somebody say I'm a woman somebody say
I'm a daughter I'm a mother I'm a
professional you are nothing but the sum
total of your Seer programming s-e-e-r s
is your social programming so from the
time you're born you're told
this is the way you should behave this
is the way you should dress this is the
way you should eat this is the way you
should respond to the opposite sex this
is your attitude towards sex this is
your attitude towards education this is
your attitude towards your career all
your social programming e is your
economic programming which is your
programming towards money a lot of us
especially in India brought up to
believe
the rich people are bad people the
excesses are not good for you you know
I'm simple I'm you know my simple life
is good for me the point is what is
wrong with abundance what is wrong with
money when I do my money manifestation
programs people are like yes yes because
everybody wants money you need money to
have a good life you want a good life
for your children you want a good life
for your family and I'm like okay how
much you want it's like 10 crores I'm
like okay what about 10 000 crores no no
no no I I don't need 10 000 crores I'm
like why not why is this block towards
more no no but I don't need 10 000
crores I said but if you have 10 000
crores
and you want only 10 crores you can do
9990 crores worth of charity
you can go out there and change the
world you don't have to keep it for
yourself you can share you can care you
can give you can do so much so why are
we blocking abundance from coming into
our life because the attitude of
blocking abundant the attitude of being
scared of abundance the aptitude of of
not wanting abundance stops the
abundance from flowing your way because
everything is energy so economic
programming is now the rich people are
bad people money doesn't grow on trees
we've all heard that as we were growing
up rich people are surrounded by fake
friends rich people have chomchas
um you know all sorts of negative
implications and attitudes about money
the other is experiences experiences
your experiences teach you either to to
dislike to be jealous uh to be
untrusting or to be loving experiences
teach you so much not to go near dog
with the dog bit you to be fearful
and R is a religious programming because
religion tells us so much about how we
should be what we should be doing Heaven
and Hell good and bad do this ritual
this will happen to you do that ritual
this will happen to you so all of us are
nothing but a program of a Seer
programming and if you learn what is
going wrong with your programming if
you're unhappy it means there's
something wrong in your programming that
is preventing you from changing the way
you look at things to make yourself
happy it's as simple as that so what is
it that is preventing you from changing
your programming you who's getting in
your way you who can create an issue in
your mind you who can change that issue
you so so it's really very simple when
you think about it that you have created
a program you uncreate your own programs

this was just moments before the rajya
Sabha was adjourned the Vice President
in fact he's left the chair and he's
moved away because there is too much
Ruckus In the rajya Sabha we could not
hear what any of the ministers were
saying piyush goyal there was demanding
that Rahul Gandhi must come to the
Parliament and apologize for the
statements that he has made in the
United Kingdom remember just days ago
Rahul Gandhi gave several speeches
across the UK and in some of them he has
alleged that the Indian democracy is
under attack Rahul Gandhi also said that
he was under surveillance that several
Intelligence Officers have often told
him to be careful of what he says on his
phone calls or through his messages
because he is under surveillance these
are Big charges that were made by Rahul
Gandhi on foreign soil and of course the
BJP is now demanding that Rahul Gandhi
must come and apologize to the nation
for insulting India while the congress
party says that there is a Witch Hunt
going on against opposition leaders and
that they are only criticizing
the policies of the government if they
feel the democracy is not working in the
nation as it should be then they have
the right to say so that is what the
opposition is saying of course are made
loud protests and slogeneering
Raj Lakshmi Joshi with us on the
broadcast do you believe that this is a
sound strategy of the BJP to demand uh
that Rahul Gandhi must come to the
Parliament and apologize for the
statement he is made or do you believe
that this will give more attention and
in fact highlight several of the
speeches made by Rahul Gandhi
a very good morning and I think that
this should be taken up as an exemplary
measure that uh Mr Rahul Gandhi he has
to definitely apologize because the kind
of statement that he has made he has not
only just criticized our democracy he
has also said that the power he has
asked for some superpowers like the UK
and the US to and not turn a blind eye
to this whatever is happening in the
Democracy so what exactly does he mean
by all of this this is this is like
calling for attention from them is he
like asking them to uh invade India is
he asking for for them to uh put some
sanctions against us I mean this is this
is absolutely unacceptable and I think
that some you know some strong deterrent
should be put in place to uh stop he is
an elected representative so you know
any electors representative when he he
or she travels abroad they should know
how they should represent our country
this is not how you talk about our
country in the uh in the international
Forum so I think that a strong deterrent
is very much necessary and he definitely
has to apologize and I think that the
bdp is very right in demanding that he
should do so so that you know in the
future also neither he nor anybody
should go and make such a ridiculous
statements uh ever again
the opposition there says that they are
only criticizing the policies of the
government and if they feel that
democracy is under attack in India then
that is bear freedom of speech and
expression
uh that there has to be some limit to
the this term of freedom of expression
you know even in our constitution it
comes with uh you know it comes with a
lot of checks and balances so it is not
uh it is not that you can say any and
everything so uh it it definitely comes
with certain filters you have to be sure
about whether you are putting the
national security at risk what he said
there was uh what was hinting at a
regime change it was hinting at
sanctions being put against India it
hinted at a lot of things that actually
goes against our democracy so I think
that that actually doesn't come under
freedom of speech or expression but in
on the contrary it goes against our
national interest and that is the reason
I feel that we need to apologize and in
fact uh you know there has to be some
strong action taken against him also it
shouldn't just end with an apology for

with his top ministers to discuss
parliamentary strategy for the second
leg of the budget session Arjun with us
on the broadcasters also while the
oppositions uh parties are now
protesting in the parliament the Army
party and the BRS are currently
protesting we've been told that the
prime minister is holding a meeting with
all of his ministers to discuss the
Parliamentary strategy for the second
session the government has said that
their focus will be on passing the
finance bill but given the sort of
protests and sloganering that has been
going on by the opposition parties in
the parliament it seems unlikely that
much progress will be made
foreign
action is being taken against the okay
as you're talking about the opposition
It's Quickly uh addressed the next
breaking what arzoo is talking about how
16 parties have participated in the
opposition Party leaders meeting that
was led by Malik Arjun kharge in the
parliament today several uh faces there
of the opposition sitting together to
come up with the strategy also go ahead
what really has been discussed in this
meeting which was being led by Malika
Arjun kharge and jairam Ramesh
issue of inflation in the parliament
today and also the issue of the agencies
the actions which are being taken by the
agencies on the uh party leader is under
the Ed custody the um
is also being summoned by the Ed so
these these are all the issues which
will be raised by the opposition and
also the issue of inflation the issue of
price rise of the LPG cylinders so these
were the issues which will be raised by
the opposition unitedly and also the
manufacturing is also trying to unite
your position for the upcoming elections
of 2024 so this is all the attempt is
being made to unite the opposition on
the several issues
also quite interestingly the Armani
party has attended this meeting of
opposition leaders led by Malik Arjun
kharge and the Amani party was also seen
for testing with the BRS but the BRS has
decided to skip this opposition leaders
party because they continue
uh their stance
that they do not want to be aligned with
the congress party
foreign
as we're speaking more updates coming in
from the Lok Sabha we've been told that
the Lok Sabha has been adjourned till 2
pm also it literally just started the
session just a few minutes ago and
already there's been an adjournment till
2 pm
till 2 pm and will continue after that
okay also quite interestingly some more
updates coming in from the parliament
where we've been told that uh piyush
goyal Union Municipal as well as our
defense minister rajnath Singh they have
both now spoken about Rahul Gandhi in
the parliament if said pure school has
said that we demand that Rahul Gandhi
comes to the Parliament and offers an
apology to the people of the nation and
of the house and the defense minister
has also said that Rahul Gandhi is a
member of this house is insulted India
in London a demand his statements should
be condemned by all members of this
house and he should be asked to
apologize before the house so the BJP
strategy there also quite clear that
they will now be taking on Rahul Gandhi
for the comments that he has made in
London
has made remarks about the Prime
Minister about the country in the
foreign soil in the London while he was
he was there for to address the student
so now the bhatijanta party is now
attacking Rahul Gandhi on all his
remarks he has made against the prime
minister in the parliament also the
opposition is saying God the garden
sorry these are not going to be JP
leaders and the defense minister rajna
saying the Cruz goal is also asking the
Rahul Gandhi to to say sorry for his
work he is in the statement he has made
in the foreign
is doing such type of activity then why
he is questioning the Democracy in India
so these are the allegations being made
by the uh
Gandhi to apologize what he has said in
the foreign

Sharma with me is a very special guest
who's flown in to India from United
States of America he is at the helm of
Affairs at the American Jewish committee
he is the CEO of AJC and he spent 12
years in service at the United States
House of Representatives he's a
politician he's a lawyer it's good to
have you Ted on telecast with us thank
you very much uh how has been the
experience for you this time around when
you visited India and particularly Delhi
it's been a very productive trip for us
AJC works hard to advance the
relationship between the United States
and Israel between India and Israel
between the United States and India the
opportunity for us to focus on all of
those things here in Delhi has been it's
gone very well the reception has been
outstanding brilliant you also had a
meeting with the external affairs
minister today you also had a meeting
with the defense minister I'm very
intrigued to know when the message that
comes out from the Exxon affairs
minister is that the relationship
between the three nations India is Royal
and United States of America has gone to
see change since 2014. uh what does he
mean and what is the impact that we'll
see in the coming years of this
trilateral that is forming
oh well the the minister was clear that
the relationships the relationships uh
among all three are strong that the uh
that the United States uh is and
continues to be a strong and important
partner that Israel is of growing
importance that there's a clear
understanding by the minister about the
role that that Israel plays not just in
its own region but in the world and why
the benefits of the countries coming
together uh specifically among
themselves and with the UAE through the
i2u2 is so important it's a it is a sea
change and a very positive one of that
affecting all the countries in a good
way it's it's in thing that you
mentioned
mentorship or Forum or grouping if I'm
missing of the I2 U2 and it all started
with Abraham Accords in 2020 that was
negotiated by President Trump
ex-president Trump uh do you see India
and Israel and their role which is then
going to be all-encompassing in the
Middle Eastern region keeping in mind it
wasn't the case a few years ago for both
India and Israel yeah I think I think
the role that that India and Israel
together with us and UAE can play
is to to build upon the tremendous
opportunities that the Abraham Accords
uh offers whether it's the The
Innovation that comes with these through
these relationships it's the opportunity
to develop closer ties it's the focus on
on the kinds of things that will benefit
all of the countries it's why uh why
while I'm here we'll be visiting one of
the centers of excellence uh
agricultural Excellence that Israel has
has created here in India it's why the
the opportunity again to to benefit from
really Innovation and investment and and
ultimately far beyond that the
people-to-people benefits the ultim as
well uh that's it's clearly an important
part of policy here in India and for the
other three countries as well
as NFTA that has been signed between
India and America
in between Israel and America no I know
I know that those those efforts have
have been ongoing for some time and uh
we've had some some conversations since
we've been here with officials from all
of the countries obviously we're
interested in seeing the ties deepen
it's as I said it's in the best interest
of all the countries and uh and what
whatever is necessary to see those
Advance
um that's that's what's being played out
right now let let's also speak about the
defense sector when you talk about
Israel and India and bilateral trials
defense cannot be left as a standard
standout sector and we you've you've met
the defense ministers raksha mantri just
a while ago uh how are we forging our
ties ahead keeping in mind Israel is
perhaps the third or the fourth largest
uh exporter of Defense equipment to
India
right well that's obviously that's an
important part of the the relationship
there is a realization and this was made
clear in the meetings that we've had
that Israel provides can provide a
Cutting Edge
technology in the defense area that
Israel is a reliable partner and that
that relationship is one that benefits
both countries so that's and that's why
we're so encouraging of its continued
growth
okay you
talking about agriculture this
agriculture water conservation as well
on which Israel has been working really
hard you spoke about the excellent
centers uh what's the goal ahead when we
come about building these government of
Israel the Israeli Embassy they've all
been putting the impetus towards that
direction uh what's what's the goal what
what is it that we are looking to
achieve
well it's not just the government's it's
most important that that the benefits
actually grow between between people and
that's going to start as businesses
interact more and and again the The
Innovation that comes out of out of
these countries especially uh and being
able to to capitalize on the skilled
Workforce on the investment
opportunities uh that's in the
technology area in particular where
where it's it's clear that that Israel
and India are in the United States as
well are such leaders in the world it's
only natural that that we would find
ways to work more closely together as
businesses interact more invest more uh
create more jobs that's going to benefit
the people that ultimately will benefit
the governments as well talk about
businesses and also held these
years with the AJC India's Pura
conversation or a round table that you
had could you give us a gist of what
what happened
sure well we're proud to partner with
the Indian diaspora and indiaspora in
particular there's an enormous
opportunity in the United States to
build closer ties between the Jewish
community and the work that AJC does and
the Indian diaspora we work together in
the United States on on a number of
issues already we advocated for the the
as quickly as possible anyway getting a
U.S ambassador here to Delhi we think
it's important sends an important signal
about the the role that India plays in
the world we work together on the issue
of H-1B visas the fact that there are
Indian tech workers who are at risk of
being kicked out of the United States
trying to extend that we that's
something that we did together with the
community and so in the meeting that we
had here we had the opportunity with
members of the Indian diaspora and
members of the business Community here
entrepreneurs from here to talk about
all of the ways that we can continue to
build those relationships in ways that
will benefit the Indian Community in
America the Jewish community in America
but more importantly and more broadly
the ties between India and the United
States what are these key sectors if I
may ask are of particular interest for
you to be the liaison partner between
them Indian Americans diaspora between
America Israel and and also when you
come over here visited visitor the
Indian Community the business the
businesses the entrepreneurs perhaps if
you have had uh site visits as well uh
well we had an interesting meeting this
afternoon with the petroleum Minister I
think the imagery spaces is certainly
one area where there are opportunities
of Technology overall is clearly an area
where there is there's such uh there's
such cutting-edge advances that are
happening in uh in India in Israel in
the United States that looking for ways
to bring those entrepreneurs together uh
to to build their businesses to build
out their businesses in iTune due to the
role that UAE play can play in helping
to scale up those businesses that's what
we're looking at and and it's the things
that affect the future of the world it's
agritech and Water Tech and climate Tech
and uh and things that can can really
reshape how the world operates at a time
when we're looking at these massive
advancements in Ai and Quantum Computing
and the like okay fantastic I'm going to
also shed some more light into the
Border issues that Israel continues to
face whether it is Syria this has been
an attack over the Aleppo airport has
been attacked has been bombed uh talk
about the West Bank the Gaza Strip and
there have been Terror attacks after
Terror attacks which have led to the
loss of lives in Israel uh it's it's
been a long-standing problem uh is it
doesn't seem like there is going to be a
long lasting solution in the in the few
years to pass by how is the AGC I I is
that also your focal point sure sure AJC
also
Works to advance Israel's place in the
world overall and that means that means
standing with Israel at times of crisis
when there are Terror attacks what we
saw what we read about in in Aleppo is
is just a further
case of Israel taking action that's
necessary to to keep its border with
serious safe you have Iran just across
the border now in Syria and so Israel is
going to take the action necessary to
protect itself just as just as other
countries just as India would just as
other countries would and so we want to
be supportive of of Israel's ability to
defend herself and the people of Israel
okay let's also turn to domestic
politics and that has been quite the
volatile one with Netanyahu again
becoming the premier uh what do you see
in terms of a number of these protests
that have been Gathering Pace in Wake of
the judicial reforms that have been
brought forth well it's a really great
question to be asked in India the
biggest democracy in the world
um talking about the importance of
democracy and looking at hundreds of
thousands of people on the streets in
Israel is the surest sign that Israeli
democracy is Alive and Well people feel
very strongly about about the issue of
judicial reform uh as it plays out we've
our position at AJC has been that the
process should be thoughtful and
deliberative and needs to to respect
civil liberties we're very supportive of
President herzog's efforts to create a
plan to to get to a compromise and there
have been some positive signs that we
read about this morning so Israel is a
democracy that's that's working its way
through this issue and uh and I think
it's important for us to be clear about
what we expect But ultimately respect
the fact that Israel is a democracy it's
interesting what is happening in Israel
domestically and particularly when it
comes to judicial reforms because
there's something of a conversation in a
debate starter here in India as well in
terms of transformation of Judiciary and
whether there should be legislature and
executive that should be given the power
that is going to be overarching as
compared to going about electing your
own members uh in in the Judiciary so so
there are these parallels that can be
drawn can India learn something from
Netanyahu from it well I will tell you I
have uh I I don't really want to wade
into Indian politics that is that is
absolutely true but but I think we can
as these conversations take place
they're the kinds of conversations that
can only take place in democracy and uh
and and in countries where where
ultimately people have the final say
voters have the final say and that's
that's what's that's what helps to bring
India and the United States and Israel
together okay
anti-Semitism which is still a talking
point and if I could take you through
the statistics uh Jews are perhaps the
largest
faith in America that are targeted even
now and then there and then they have
you have uh the Sikhs and then you have
blacks and you have Asians so what is it
that agency is doing to tackle that
situation and it has been going on for
long sure well Jews represent about two
percent of the US population but uh also
represent close to 60 percent of
religiously based hate crimes so this is
something that we've been focused on and
uh and we're doing everything we can to
to try to confront Rising anti-Semitism
it means working together with others in
the community finding allies to work
with standing up with them against
anti-Semitism against against hatred uh
there can be no acceptance of of this
kind of hatred and what it does and
what's important to remember is that
when there's anti-Semitism it never just
stops with the Jewish Community the
entire Society is ultimately at risk and
democracy starts to get chipped away at
when you allow it to Fester so we've
tried to provide training and advocacy
around this issue so people can better
understand what it's meant to the Jewish
Community for thousands of years in
facing anti-Semitism important to note
as we're sitting here in Delhi that
there's been a Jewish community in India
for 2000 years that's never faced
persecution of any kind that's a very
important thing for us to remember as as
AJC leadership and especially when we go
back to the United States and talk about
this trip okay going back to America and
the presidential elections are going to
take place in 2024
a lot of Indians there's a lot of noise
that is being created and it's only
going to become more chaotic as months
pass by there are a lot of Indian
Americans that have put in their hat in
the ring and a lot of like Nikki Haley
they have kamla Harris we also have uh
uh I'm forgetting the name ramaswamy
who's also got into his Republican so
how do you view the rise of Indian
Community it it once used to be a
working class community so then taking
control of uh the bigger roles when it
comes to the CEO the management of the
top notch of the big tech companies and
now obviously getting into the Helm of
Affairs when it comes to politics of
America
well you I think you said it it's uh I I
can't speak to what the perception may
have been in the past but clearly now
we're at a moment where where Indian
Americans sit at the highest levels of
of American Business and politics uh you
mentioned the CEOs at major companies in
the United States and around the world
uh but it it needs to be pointed out and
I'm glad you did that the vice president
of the United States and the former U.N
Ambassador who's now a leading candidate
for president of the United States
both hail from the community as well it
says that that the Indian American
Community has succeeded and should be
incredibly proud of that success the
Jewish community and welcomes the
opportunity to work with the Indian
American Community just as we have to
build upon the successes in both of our
communities to help strengthen America
overall it's also interesting that all
the Indian American candidates fighting
for the presidential elections have
raised the issue of China and how there
are supposed to be increased sanctions
and boycotting of Chinese Goods Chinese
ministers Chinese corporates
how does the AGC look at these things
and is that going to be an impactful way
of changing the Dynamics of running
businesses in America
uh well in my in my prior world uh I had
some insight I was a member of Congress
and this is one issue where there is
strong bipartisan support interestingly
the the support that exists uh around
some of the concerns with respect to
China it's the same kind of support that
we see in uh support for the US Israel
relationship and the U.S India
relationship I think I think it's
important that when there are those
moments that bring the Democratic and
Republican parties together
we should build upon that and at AJC as
we go about our work as advocates we
look for those opportunities again to
build upon those uh those shared policy
priorities that our communities face
okay and finally Before I Let You Go to
obviously you have a few more days of
the year they're going to be hectic
what's what's the schedule looking like
it is very hectic I'm happy but we'll be
here for
um uh for a little while longer than
we're going to Jaipur uh before going to
Mumbai so we'll have the opportunity to
see the Jewish community in Mumbai we
will uh we'll do some more with the
business Community when we're in Mumbai
and we happen to be here for the Jewish
holiday of Purim and the holiday of holy
so we're looking forward to uh to some
some kind of Celebration when we're in
Jaipur as well for more such videos such

hello and welcome to the news X Sunday
Guardian Round Table well today we are
taking a look at the row 224 and of
course what lies ahead we have three
four very interesting General sorry
assembly elections coming up that could
be crucial where we will see a Face-Off
between the Congress and the BJP but
before that there is also talk of
opposition Unity can the entire
opposition get together on one Plank and
who will be heading that the Congress of
course has called for everybody to come
together and to leave aside their egos
and differences they say let's all get
together and let's not look for a PM
phase right now that seems to be
sensible strategy because the Rahul
versus the modified well we all know how
that's going to end but within the
opposition also there are camps the TRS
the TMC and advanced reval seem to be
one faction while the others are another
faction and even on the other faction
there are you know the layers within
layers and divisions so can the
opposition get together and put up a
United fight against Narendra Modi and
if not then what's going to happen
joining me on the show today is we have
mudit Agarwal is Congress spokesperson
aarti jairath political columnist
commentator and a senior journalist
sudhanshu with Phil he's of course a
psyphologist political strategist and a
BJP member and subrashtra she's a
communication expert political
strategist and of course a TV
commentator also so the answer you are
the pathologist so you tell us the
numbers game what's going to happen what
do you think is going to happen it's
going to be a clean sweep
yeah 2024
the verdict is already out okay cleaner
than now or will there be a hunger I
mean as I said
winning is important whether you win by
a margin of 100 seats or you will buy 20
seats or you will buy 50 seats that's
statistics okay critical is who the
nation will trust
and the answer is out the nation will
trust Thunder Narendra Modi I don't
think this can be debated
unfortunately lacks credibility if you
look at the composition of the house
today
Congress is the largest single party
right
besides BJP with 54 odd seats largely
coming from where
Kerala Tamil Nadu
where Congress is in opposition with BJP
it is non-existent
now you just talked about opposition
Unity you see you have to understand
most of the time this is a congress the
conflict is with the regional parties
like in Kerala who are they going to
contest against they're going to contest
against the left
wherever Congress has its seats from as
of today it's it's the regional parties
so they wrote uh the DMK last time in
Tamil Nadu who are they going to contest
they're going to contest
so this entire concept of opposition
unity in the absence of a credible face
and
uh as I said lack of clash of common
interest
becomes a non-starter okay that is the
story where do you see it going the
opposition
well I mean as things stand today the
opposition looks more and more disunited
actually uh you saw on the issue of
Manisha sodia everybody banded together
the Congress was
not part of that you know whole protest
um you know uh uh BRS is holding uh
or hunger strike to demand the women's
reservation will be passed every party
is part of that dhadna the Congress is
not there so you know the Congress seems
to be getting more and more isolated in
the opposition Camp uh you know and all
these opposition leaders seem to be
there seems to be some kind of uh you
know coordination between all the
opposition parties but the Congress is
not part of this coordination and so
that leaves the opposition pretty much
in disarray really in in terms of
putting up a United fight against the
BJP and I think the main problem the
main problem is uh it's not a question
of a face I mean I think the BJP would
love a presidential kind of uh poll so
that you can pit Narendra Modi against
somebody but we've seen in past
elections when you know there has been a
face for instance in 1977 there was a
face Indira Gandhi and there was a you
know United opposition there was no face
but they still won uh in 19 uh you know
89 again I mean there was Rajiv Gandhi
there was really no faith there was VP
Singh but he was not really projected as
a face in 2004 you had atal bihari
vajpay the whole campaign was crafted
around atal bihari vajpayee there was no
face on the other side the BJP still
lost so I don't think it's a question of
the face I think what's really holding
it up is who which party is going to be
the pivot of this opposition you know
United opposition you know which party
will be the predominant one which will
be the one that will Cobble it together
and I think the Congress is seeking that
leadership role which none of the other
parties want to give it because of today
can I just had one small comment see in
terms of being National parties
this is just Congress otherwise all the
other parties are Regional parties
that's the that's the undoing no
sudhanshu we saw that in 2004 as well
if you remember if you remember Congress
was a pivot Congress was definitely
bigger but if you remember at the end
when the BJP lost it was LK advani who
said that the result was an aggregate of
State elections okay so let's not
quibble on that let's not quibble on
that okay uh you know the point is that
the Congress wants to be the pivot but
the Congress does not have that kind of
predominant position and the half and
you know even the national spread
anymore to be the pivot of that so
somewhere it has to swallow its ego
except a diminished role and have a kind
of uh if at all there is to be any kind
of opposition Unity against them it has
to be from state to state to state to
state and the Congress will have to take
a back here but I don't see the Congress
doing that really so can the community
much Advantage I can absolutely almost
disagree with everything okay
so Congress started worst is still 52
seats 20 of vote which is almost 12
crore award which is much much ahead of
any other party except for BJP I mean we
may be 52 seats where we won are
Alliance 198 seats and there are over
200 seats where we came number two I
mean can you really write off Congress
so what is the objective of
an alliance is as of now as I see is to
defeat fascist Modi government which has
done a frontal assault on Indian
democracy and the Constitution and to do
that we really have to look at alliances
at a state level are there certain
states where alliances are in place so
Maharashtra is one of them Bihar is
another one jharkhand is another one
that's fine that's an alliance no we are
still in Alliance with nitish Kumar and
we would be in lines with archery in
that so all I'm saying is a certain
state where alliances are in place and
there's not really a difficulty okay but
then there are certain states where
alliances are not required if you look
at Kerala for instance I mean you also
have to be careful where you do an
alliance because what you don't want to
do also is give BJP a space where it can
occupy your opposition space a state
like Caroline is example of that then
there are certain states in the Middle
where you can say whether the airlines
will be fruitful in short term or the
long term because again the other thing
that we need to take care of when we are
doing alliances is there's sometimes a
space that emerges in which BJP can take
advantage of that and long-term build
their organization plus there are other
states like when you talk about madhya
Pradesh or Rajasthan where Congress is
facing BJP directly so I don't know what
the scope of alliances is there so
alliances cannot be a lazy Alliance
making exercise okay you have to really
go at the micro level and understand
where the alliances may work or may not
work so this is the way I want to put
that but to write a congress I mean
Congress at 20 percent of course has to
be the pivot of any Alliance which is
washed okay but can they make their
pivot work they have the pivot they have
the pan in their presence but somehow
their own opposition allies are not very
happy to give the Congress a chance uh
yes I agree with you uh a prayer on that
I I think uh my love for the Gandhi
family is pretty much out in the open I
don't have a problem with the congress
party per se but I have a problem with
the family which just does not
understand the Grassroots realities of
India it's no longer in Indira Gandhi's
party it's no longer a Rajiv Gandhi
party also what aarti said is pretty
right either you you you know come
together on the basis of a face or you
come together on the basis of issues
tell me one issue that Congress has
consistently taken up Allied the entire
opposition around you know that issue
and created a created a front I I don't
I don't think it has ever happened in
the past you know 10 years of this
government
um something as simple as women
reservation Bill if you cannot back that
bill what are you talking about if you
cannot stand together for forget about
the ideological or whatever political
differences that they have with the
ahmadni party but in in Delhi you know
it's an it's an app versus BJP battle so
then why are you choosing what you are
choosing then the Ahmadi party says you
are a B team of the BJP and then BJP
would go on to say that you know it's
it's a B team of the Congress sorry uh
you know BJP would go on go on to say
that a B team of of the Congress Ahmadi
party is a meeting of the Congress or
vice versa so in that case where really
is what is the strategy that Gandhi
family is following and you know going
and giving interviews in London to sort
of say that we are wondering when that
would come up and uh being elected by
the way to the Lok Sabha by a
democratically chosen uh mandate it
these are all very ironical and very
farcical pronouncements which really
doesn't cut ice on ground so groom comes
to a problem called Rahul
one issue what
she says that today we need to look at
Regional parties the promise is there if
at any point in time just see what
happened in the Northeast elections
BJP did not win meghalaya but look at
the communication Optics of the BJP and
look at the way in which Narendra Modi
himself embraced the entire mandate and
went on to show that we are a united
front when it comes to Nida where was
Rahul Gandhi's where was Rahul Gandhi's
part in tripura they had an alliance not
even a single leader of prominence from
the congress party even visited tripura
forget about anything else
Gandhi bashing has become a favorite
pastime of BJP and so-called Eliza I'm
I'm sorry it's not a favorite pastime no
no I'll just I'll just tell you one
thing I hope I hope
I hope that you continue to live in this
la la land that people want to bash the
Gandhi because of the past time if it
makes you win elections by all means be
happy that Gandhi family is the best
thing
aside from the Gandhi family and come to
the fact that the point that aarti
raised that you know Congress is the
pan-india party when he said the same
thing so there's no Alliance possible
without it so to put it together you
need the Sutra you need like a harsh
Christian Singh Suraj do you see anyone
playing that role it doesn't have to be
Sonia it can be anyone Priya I will just
disagree with arti that politics has
moved on he's debating no no no no why
am I saying this you know we are looking
at politics from the prism of what it
was in the early 2000s the the last uh
two decades has seen that the politics
has moved on from Center being an
aggregation of State politics
Center is now driven by the factor of
Hope which is represented by a party or
a or an individual that is the
difference that is the reason why in
Orissa on the same date you have a
Naveen patnaik winning and
you have a sizable vote for BJP or West
Bengal for that matter
Rajasthan and madhya Pradesh while just
three months before or four months
before they sweep the polls the Congress
swept the polls when it comes came to
Lok Sabha we got hundred out of 100
there the reason being that when people
are voting they used to earlier vote for
their state assemblies in Lok Sabha
today they vote for the nation and it is
this factor which basically is now
determining the choice of people okay
now what is see one one more phenomenon
we have to understand how people vote
you see something must be so terribly
wrong with the government of the day
that people must say I will vote for
anybody else but for this so so
there there you don't look at
Alternatives you you clear whoever is
there whoever is there I will vote like
any other the other is
I may not be in love with this but I am
not antagonistic to this so what I will
do I will weigh what are my alternatives
where do I feel my future lies where is
it that the nation will prosper for and
that is when people make choices okay
now you have to look at these scenario
from the context of people voting for
the nation and when people have to vote
for the nation would they vote for a
Narendra Modi so today is critical for
the the the next nobody's arguing the
Modi Factor what I'm trying to say is
opposition I'll take my that question to
you you know who is the one person who
can bring because you need someone to
bring all these Egos and agendas
together on one platform hurricane sujit
was one that's right absolutely and I
think that is that figure is lacking
today yeah you know in 2004 harkeshan
Singh sujit and Sonia Gandhi they work
together behind the scene it was an
amazing relationship actually and then
you saw Sonia Gandhi walking to Ram
Vilas paswan's house you know so you
feel that Alliance the question is who
is going to play that role today and I
do I want to sort of disagree with
sudhanshu uh you know on some issues uh
one thing is that the bjp's total vote
is 30 odd percent you know 39 including
the Allies yes including the allies
sudanshu and those allies have left the
BJP now all right so the BJP is still
not 50 of the vote share unlike Rajiv
Gandhi was in
1984. so you know that means that there
is a huge vote out there which is not
for the BJP and any case the point is
you know it has to be put to test
whether an old Paradigm like a unified
opposition can defeat the defeat the
Modi factor or not maybe it cannot maybe
politics has moved beyond that today but
the fact is that if if at all there is
any chance for the opposition to do in
to provide any kind of a challenge to
Narendra Modi it can only come from a
unified front if they fight separately
there is no way that they can defeat
Narendra Modi and today I don't see any
figure as you said well I mean I think
shanat pawar quote he certainly has a
stature but you know is aging his health
is not with him and I I don't know you
know at the end of the day I mean I
think you put it very well we come back
to a problem called Rahul Gandhi
i i i i i i it's very sad but at the end
of the day unless Rahul Gandhi is on
board on this project and you know makes
the sacrifices let's say his mother made
in 2004. there's no way but to be fair
don't let him quickly he's not had a
chance to speak huh
we may want something else that's our
choice it's a democracy so you can't
not let us have that Democratic right as
to choose who our leader is going to be
unlike BJP where RSS decides who their
leader is let's park that thought for a
second now alliances are concerned see
more or less if you look at Maharashtra
if you look at Bihar jharkhand most of
the places are eins are almost subtle
now the premise of those alliances
somehow we have to beat BJP there are
few states where this has to be sorted
out I don't think that would be such a
big issue if we really take into account
what our objectives are as Congress
leadership has also said everyone should
leave their egos and come together to
defeat this government so this is the
primary goal towards which Congress is
working and Congress will be the fulcrum
of this Alliance will be the pivot of
this Alliance that goes without saying
and the reason I'm saying it is a party
which is 12 crore was 20 percent of vote
and relevant in over 300 seeds how can
that party not be your pivot as far as
other things other things RPG one thing
I wanted to say was sometimes in
Congress bashing people forget that
there are other parties where earlier
allied with BJP ideologically and they
have a vested interest in their states
because India States Congress is whom
they are facing so you have to take that
into account also before we yeah
this is a small small intervention you
know you're talking about a few states
where there is no Alliance as if these
states are really small matters we're
talking we're talking about United
States sorry we're talking about
we are talking about a state like uttar
Pradesh which has 80 seats we are
talking about a state like West Bengal
which has 42 seats we are talking about
Andhra Pradesh and telling Anna which
taken together have 42 seats I mean look
at the number of seats where there is no
Alliance
okay
okay this is a small caveat
2004 and 2024 are vastly different
the Realms of Congress in 2004 was
hugely different than what is the
relevance of Congress in 2024. so it was
natural for the Congress to play the
pivotal role of the opposition Unity
because if at the end of the day they
got won 45 seats actually it was he he
stitched their lives
because
really the relevance of Congress in 2004
was vastly different when the relevance
of Congress in 24 sure and that is the
reason why replicating a 2004 is a very
very different proposition that is
very different I said a lot of places
lions are in players there are certain
places where alliances are not in place
and of course they are important States
I never said they are not important but
let's see what happens there we are
working towards
an alliance but I think that Alliance
will more or less be Statewide the other
thing that I want to say for anyone to
just you know the right of Congress
right now or any kind of Alliance right
now and the Modi is going to win I think
it's very premature and will be
foolhardy and the reasons
you have States like madhya Pradesh or
sorry States like Maharashtra stays like
Bihar where BJP is going to have a very
very uphill tasks on their hands tastes
like Karnataka even Hindi Heartland
madhya Pradesh Rajasthan look at the
response yatra arose among people lacks
of people came and the unemployment
issue the inflation issues
if your party raises those issues that
we don't get media resonance on that
that's a fact also that we need to look
at please tell me if rahu Gandhi spoke
about unemployment and inflation always
in London
made it as huge an issue as lack of
democratic structures in India yes let
us understand you might see you are a
congressman I'm not a congressman I'm a
voter I might vote for you to convince
me but unfortunately your leaders and
you guys youngsters like us that's the
problem very close to ideological
Congress has no ideologies life was
actually coming to that you know he
talks about the fact that uh not not he
I mean not I don't want to hold it on
the ideology of course we do have but
you know when it comes to alliances you
have to understand that all alliances
are opportunistic alliances yes you may
have ideological Fidelity to certain
issues but in a democracy if you are a
multi-party system you're not here to
just build your entire uh you know
politics based only on ideology there
are tactical alliances that you are
going to make look at what BJP did in in
in the northeastern states or any of the
border states in Jammu and Kashmir for
instance but my problem is what is
congress's ideology you have to be clear
on the one hand you want to take down
adani on on the other hand you want the
corporates also to sort of uh you know
come and invest in states where you rule
so your communication is not clear to
the public and then you go on to say
that you know all if if at all an
alliance partner is not with you you
want to say that oh well it's an
opportunistic alliance with the BJP you
can't diss it like that but you can be
pro-corporates and anti-addani if you
think there is a coronary capitalism or
something happening against one
industrialist why should not the
opposition bring it up yes they should
bring it up but then let her finish of
course they should bring it up but then
when a question is asked you should also
answer then why do you accept you know
these investments in Rajasthan and
children why do you roll why do you rule
the red carpet and it can't just be
about oh you know they come they have
compliances there and they don't have
compliances here you can't have that
kind of a double standard because here
also there are proper documentation in
place it's not like if you want to play
documents documents
nobody believes that but why do you have
them
come to any state you come to our state
there will be a Level Playing Field and
anyone can compete and if you win short
ahead you can come and invest we are not
against capitalism we are not against
corporates we are against crony
capitalism there is a difference and we
need to understand that yes while
what is said everybody will say it
if it lacks credibility it will never
have acceptance of people and that is
what is happening but I want to take you
to a different level now see
India has a window of 20 years
to be a developed Nation
Because by the time
we are into 2047 you'll have 33 crore
old people
normally for a nation 10 years 15 years
don't matter but
India is at a very very crucial point
where the next 10 years will determine
whether we are going to be a develop
Nation or we are not going to be a
development there
people will make choices
who would they believe
having the capacity to turn India into a
developed Nation
you look at the entire polity of this
country
and evaluate individuals
who have this
thought process
this this magnitude of Christ
choices when you know ultimately it will
boil down to choices
you you think you can there are two kind
of alliances one is pre-poll and one is
postpone right today when she listed in
in bigger States
the alliances have a problem the single
vote is a problem what happened in up
last time there was a single vote
attempted and what was the performance
so you had a Mula you had a this thing
saying look I got only three seats in my
state and bsp got 10 I'm not going to
have an alliance now these are AP seats
where Congress is irrelevant yeah you
know this he just talked about uh
Maharashtra and he talked about uh Bihar
he doesn't realize that BJP in
Maharashtra
which has 48 seats only is 22 seats
now we the entire field because we were
under the compassion of fighting it with
shiv Cena today we are going to fight
our numbers will not diminish because of
that and they're fighting Bihar okay our
that again there was with jdu we are
doing it our numbers
factor that there will be opposition
Unity index of opposition unity and so
they will take one BJP we are not saying
whether it will happen but that is the
only way you think absolutely see the
question I think sudhanshu you're
missing the point of the debate the
point of the debate we are not here to
debate whether Modi is going to win
again or the opposition is going to win
we don't know right we're still one year
away we don't know what is going to
happen in the next one year yes of
course the BJP is very much in pole
position I think Modi is very much a
predominant figure in India and you know
and dominates the political State I
think what we're trying to discuss here
is a much smaller Point whether the
opposition can unite yes yes and if at
all the opposition has any chance of
challenging I'm not even saying of
defeating Modi of just challenging Modi
it can only be through a united front
and that is where it has to put together
alliances yes I agree with mudit that it
has to be state by state by state by
state but there are many big important
states where the Congress is not
you know an option an option it's not
it's not an alliance is it ready to see
space to Regional parties in say West
Bengal or in up is it ready to play a
small role and take say in up just two
seats for itself and leave the rest to
arcadesh I don't know I think those are
the questions that need to be answered
and I don't see uh that happening
because you know as he's going on
stressing congrat has Congress has to be
the pivot Congress has to be the
president
that Congress will land up only fighting
75 seats if if
I'm going through that I'm just trying
to say I mean like Congress so to be
honest reduce itself
I can actually say that but here I
totally always disagree definitely
disagree with everything
and very respectfully I think I think
until an unless Congress Congress gets
its numbers right you know on on an
Excel sheet without looking at its
bullet inflated political ego if only
that homework is done Congress can do
something otherwise there is no hope
well Grim works for the opposition over
here there is still time to get your act
together figure out what is the best way
to take on Modi or is 2024 foregone
conclusion that's all for today thank

it's not just military that is or you
know the military might that is
expanding on one hand
um it's important to remember that the
covet pandemic emerged from China and
while we still don't know what exactly
led to the pandemic the origins of the
pandemic are still unknown there is yet
another piece of information that is now
coming in from the country
um that is that is that is ringing alarm
Bells across the world there is an
influencer outbreak viewers in China
that has picked up intensity over the
past week as the Northwestern city of
Jean imposed a pandemic style lockdown
to curb the surge in infections now
according to the Chinese Center for
Disease Control and prevention the
positivity rate for the flu has jumped
to 41.6 percent this week from 25.1
percent last week
the question that then arises is Will
China be establishing protocols similar
to the ones that we witnessed during the
covid-19 pandemic in order to control
the rise in in the cases of influenza as
well and if yes is that the way forward
is that something that will work is that
something that can work joining us on
the broadcast now Dr ishwar gilara to
help us answer those questions Dr gilada
I'll come straight to you sir
um is this lockdown style approach of
China going to help with the influenza
virus sir because we've seen them do it
with the pandemic and then we also saw
the Fallout when China removed the zero
covet policy they seem to be doing the
exact same thing Dr gilada do you think
that this is going to work
uh you see China has pointed along uh
for the last three years they may have
fighted for last 100 years also but
looking at Health aspect they appointed
for three years and a lot of countries
followed initially Chinese policy at
that time when we had nothing to offer
people we have wanted to augment our
system medical system facilities
lockdown was okay lockdown is no
solution basically you locked on your
mouth and nose that's it you don't need
to lock down the whole country so I
don't know how China will deal with this
uh I said earlier also India should
offer help to China China should take
help of India despite whatever political
relationship we have and India can help
them augment all kind of facilities and
help them uh secondly this 41 positivity
rate of this flu is very very high we
have never seen anywhere in the world
this kind of blue but that means almost
everybody is infected or everybody is
vulnerable so 41 are infected now that
means 59 may we have had yesterday or
they will get tomorrow that kind of
scenario we need to look at a whole
genome sequencing uh surveillance
whether China has manufactured another
virus which is more severe than covet we
do not know and nobody believed China
and uh particularly I don't want to only
blame China I want to also blame who
because who had played a partisan role
for last three years and even till today
they have not come out clearly that the
virus had originated from one whether it
is accidental whether it is uh some
design of Chinese we do not know but
they are not they are trying to say that
they had one committee second committee
third committee fourth committee now
there are some news coming from us or
some officer from the Center for Disease
Control from here saying now a lot of
things are coming out but all of us know
not only in India but globally that this
virus originated from one it is a
Chinese uh miscreation and they have
made a whole world suffer now China may
have created something else or the
viruses may have mutated among
themselves we do not know they they call
blue iris all infections look like flu
when there are respiratory infections so
we need to look at whether Israeli H3N2
or H1N1 or influence the type B for
combination of a and b or combination of
covet virus and H1N1 we do not know yes
we need to look at that for more such

I just came from Mexico and we have now
taken a new home in the Yucatan in the
very very bottom of Mexico and we invite
you all to come and join us there
where it seems that people are coming
from all over the world
and you ask them
why did you come and they say we don't
really know we were just drawn here how
long will you stay well I came for three
weeks and that was three years ago
so it reminded me very much in 1977 when
I
put my feet first on the soil of India I
came from USA
to be part of the 400th
birthday anniversary of Guru ramdas in
Amritsar
and
India
became my home
and we would travel here two to three
times every year remaining in Los
Angeles for 40 years
and
[Music]
doing all these last
53 years really that I've been
practicing the science of Kundalini Yoga
and teaching it all over the world
I'm still amazed every day when I get up
before the sun comes up to be reminded
that my feet have touched the Earth one
more day and I have one more day that
perhaps I can share and do something
useful in this lifetime
and so far so good I believe
a story
I'm always reminded of
is a story that Osho used to tell and it
was her name was
it started with an R I can't quite
remember her name if she's Persian or
Indian but she would be found up on the
road
looking for something and she was an old
lady that was leaned over she kept
looking and looking and the neighbors
would come and they would say Rubina
what are you looking for and she says
I'm looking for my needle I lost my
needle
I was like a sewing needle so the
neighbors would all gather and try to
find a needle
by the roadside
needles are really small right so they
finally said to Robina
this is impossible do you have any idea
where the needle is
and she says yes it's in my house
and then they really started talking
she's gone mad well they knew she was
mad anyway but she was a prophet and
they said then why are we looking up on
this road if you're
needle is in your house and she replied
because this is where the light is
there's no light in my house
it was a story and it was a parable
to say that our light we live out here
but we've lost the light
on the inside and we're in darkness
and one of the stories one of many that
I heard along the way another one was it
was when I was 20 years old and it was
in 1960 something and we had heard that
there was a woman in Carmel Valley in
California in Carmel because I lived in
La for 40 years that she seemed to know
something that we didn't know at that
time I was 22 years old and we didn't
know anything we didn't know yoga we
didn't know meditation we did not have
any inside steps because our parents
hadn't done it most of us and they were
just looking for the light on the
outside which they call materialism
but there was a special old lady she
probably was 50 years old but at that
time when I was 20 that was old and so
we hitchhiked to our house and it was by
the ocean
and we went in we heard it was free
because no one had any money then and
she was a small lady
and she was on this box that played
music we didn't even know what a
harmonium was and there was a keyboard
like a piano and we came in quiet and
there were candles lit and she sat there
and she sang and she welcomed us all and
the song that kept in my mind for years
and years was a Yogananda song who is in
my temple who is in my temple all the
doors do open up wide all the lights do
light up high who is in my temple
and I had no idea what she was singing
Temple was she talking about lights
what's she talking about what's the
outside what's the inside I was so
struck
with her
and with the Osho story
that I spent years
trying to find this light or trying to
find what they were talking about
and that's when I got blessed to enter
when I was 26.
an ashram that did Kundalini Yoga
and after one class and getting up at 2
3 in the morning with sadhana
and becoming a very devout vegetarian
and also starting to cook and serve
hundreds of people every day on the
streets then I started understanding for
the first time
what real happiness is what real Joy is
and whenever I get lost
if I go back to
all of that I'll remember why I am here
and people ask me when are you going to
retire
and I said well probably I'm my exhale
meaning if God grants me the power to
keep helping and keep serving in any way
I can why would I do something else it
doesn't make any sense so I'm so honored
to have been divided been invited by
Sangeeta and I I'm amazed at how many
friends Ankita has
everybody you know she's my cousin she's
my best friend when I was a child I've
known her 20 years everybody's rallied
to come to this place to be part of this
it's small today but I believe something
has been birthed right here today and
you're all witnessing it this will
transfer to many cities because people
want to in the way the world is now how
do you
how do you grow old with Grace how does
your brain still keep working
how can your body keep working there
must be a way because marketing tells us
pretty much the opposite just take a
pill just do this just do that rest rest
always rest and um
so I'm here today hopefully tomorrow
you'll all come to the 10 o'clock class
of Kundalini Yoga everyone can do it
there's not a soul who still has a
heartbeat that can't do Kundalini Yoga
and if you'll join us tomorrow at 10 I
think that'll be great I thought today
I would do just some very short little
things to give you the experience of how
fast you can find your joy how fast you
can heal how fast you can let all your
troubles go so if you'll sit up straight
or straight as you can
and I'm going to tune in because I have
to
talk to

your fingers to go take a breather and
then go again symmetrical left and right
side of your brain will start working
much better

[Music]

minutes
[Music]
right by your earlobes
[Music]
and please be able to keep them
symmetrical
[Music]
it's such a beautiful
joy to be with you all I
actually have to leave in just a few
minutes to go catch a flight back to
rishikesh for which I apologize but I
am so happy to spend just a few minutes
with you
this wonderful conclave that Sangeeta
and all of her team has put together I'm
so so glad to be here I'm so glad to be
here with my beloved sister gurmukti
especially at her 80th birthday just
before we come together next week in
rishikesh at parmarthnicathon for the
International yoga Festival
as we're here talking about aging
blissfully and just just the few minutes
that I have I was thinking you know
yesterday
I was at a beautiful event here in Delhi
at the Constitution club
by Vicky and I had the great honor of
sharing a stage with a 95 year old
athletic champion her name is bagwani
Pago
that one seemed to go out no problem
here we are
looking upload foreign
95 a small little beautiful woman from
haryana who is now a world champion in
100 yard dashes shot put throws not
that she was a champion when she was
young and now she just happens to be 95.
but right now just having started in the
last couple of decades she's become this
world champion
and as I sat next to her on stage
yesterday
I got
some beautiful tips from her not given
directly in terms of bullet points of
anti-aging but just through talking to
her and they were things very simple
she doesn't use any potions or pills or
powders
no special tonic
but she's asleep by 8 30 every night and
she's awake long before five
she eats very simply Japanese
and she loves just just see me later it
was amazing just to simulate first thing
she did
hello everyone
this has been such a revelation you know
sometimes you come because you're asked
to by
your friends
but I am so happy to be part of this
wonderful conclave and sagita this is
absolutely beautiful what a great
Ambiance and you're going to go very far
with this because I really feel that
more than anything else in the lives
that we lead today
you know looking after Self
um you know your own well-being in the
hecticness of life that we lead is
really possibly the most important
um you know thing that we should take
into our daily considerations and you
know in our lifestyles which sometimes
is quite unhealthy I feel our topic
today
is to create the life we deserve
the bigger picture of course is
aging blissfully well I'm just trying to
age gracefully
not trying not to lie about my age
anymore but uh God forbid anyone asked
me that question but uh yes I think this
is
um such an amazing platform to bring
together
um our modern day lives and the reality
of the kind of life that we are leading
but what we really need to inject into
it is I think self-care
I'm going to be reading a lot because
out of my phone which I've scribbled
notes on because I can't remember a
thing and I have to stop blaming covet
three times and praying Fork because of
which because I this is just age I mean
to be honest and uh today I have these
two incredible people with me
who I have known on a very personal
level sunit who I have known ever since
I have come into Delhi were more than
two and a half decades ago I have always
admired him of course for his creativity
I've also been in fashion
um most of my life and I I have loved
fashion since I was a kid and
um sunit I mean he's the original Glam
slam you wanted to look for anything
glamorous uh you went to sunith Varma
and he's been actually through so many
stages of his journey uh professionally
and personally
and I and
somebody mentioned his humility and I
think that's that for me is my friend
sunith and of course talent in like
which has no bounds and then there's
this lovely Dr Gita prakash my GP Perils
of her profession who does answer my
call at all kinds of orders with the
weirdest of things that I come up with I
have always been the opposite of a
hypochondriac I mean almost childlike
I've never finished an antibiotic course
and really I'm very very careless and
lackadaisical about my health so if I go
to a doctor means I'm almost dying or I
think I'm dying and there is uh Dr Gita
prakash on call 24 hours with me
whenever I need her which is incredible
when the kids were born and I had to be
here on my own because my husband was in
the Navy so they sort of grew up I I
used to always tell him I'm giving you
ready-made children because I looked
after them nine years now but whatever
it was I had great fun in the sense we
always found something fun to do with
that but everyone goes to their tiles
and tribulations I went through my own I
lost my mother my mother-in-law my
husband recently about a couple of years
ago that was a big shock but my children
are so supportive and not only them I
always say my in-law bacha's also who
have now become my bachchas I mean I
think that is what's helped me to go
through everything plus my work like I
said they enjoy what I do and it was the
biggest strength to be able to help
people to realize I'm still privileged
the other thing I always say is keep the
faith there's nothing you cannot do if
you put your mind to it so you just have
to stay positive and say this is what I
want and this is what I'm going to do no
matter what everyone you will find so
many roadblocks but they happily sort of
move away you Slither through them if
you really want to do what you want to
do so just remember you only live once
do whatever you can whenever you can if
opportunity strikes like it did for me I
mean I did three years of being a radio
jockey as well I used to talk on radio
shows also on medical issues basically
Medical but in the sense somebody just
said why don't you do this and I said
why not and today somebody said why
don't you model I said I'd love to so
when somebody calls me this before they
say what it is I say yes because I'm
sure I want to do it so much fun I mean
it's another aspect of you that you
learn about so I think what you do is
you just keep growing till you die I
suppose I think covert taught a lot of
us a lot of things
I'm sure many people who have had some
personal tragedies and stories I lost
two very close young cousins overnight I
mean one died within three days one died
within seven days much younger than I
ten years younger than I am 15 years
younger than I with little children and
I think I was always
um
a little bit more optimistic about life
even as a kid and growing up it may have
to do something with my upbringing or my
family but I think post covet
everybody's had a new sense of living a
new sense of the moment because you're
here today you may not be here in the
next 10 minutes I mean there's there's
20 year olds and 30 year olds who are
falling ill and passing away within in a
gym I I'm sure everybody read that
recently so
I think for me I've decided
um I actually decided that long back
that I was going to live my life to the
fullest I'm not a very typical
Punjabi boy who kind of you know was
going to grow up and become a banker
like their parents
um and and thank God I do what I do
because I'd be so bad at everything else
I almost don't know anything else to do
but to do what I do so because I like
doing this I celebrate that every day
and I enjoy literally every day of it
okay and that's where you get your yeah
yeah that's where I decided that you
know this is the one gift that God has
given me
and more than the gift this is the one
opportunity that God has given me
because a lot of people are very gifted
a lot of people are very gifted but they
may not have the opportunity they may
not have the support system I'm very
happy to be here
um I got this opportunity I think we
call it the drama
you know the drama which happens
and I'm happy to be amongst all of you
um
I was given I mean I was reading this
aging
gracefully and you hear the word
blissfully
I feel connected in terms that it's very
spiritual notion
it's a very spiritual lifestyle which we
are talking about
I've been practicing meditation for the
last 20 years a little introduction I'd
give about myself
I got introduced with the teachings of
the Brahma Kumaris just casually because
I just wanted to have a little more
concentration
um and that's how I got connected with
meditation I had no inclination to wear
a white saree like this and be in front
of you my whole purpose was very selfish
very focused to get some good marks to
focus on my studies
and it really did help
and
I've been born and brought up in Lucknow
maybe you've been there
it was a very good
introduction which helped me and As I
Grew in my college and then I did an MBA
I went to Bombay did my MBA because I
was ambitious
and yet I found that no matter what
you're doing no matter what you're
achieving
you need to be connected with the self
um you need to experience that Bliss
Within
if you want to actually experience
anything outside otherwise you just go
with the flow and you don't know where
your life is going
so I was connected with and practicing
the Raj yoga meditation which was just
next to my college actually they studied
in NM and is a very beautiful center of
the Brahma Kumaris just next to uh you
know just walking distance
I came back to gurgaon because Delhi and
gurgaon where my family was settled and
I started working I worked in an MNC as
an analyst for some time
but even there
we had people who were meditating
and of course I was a meditator I
started working practicing
and then I had the opportunity
to understand and actually go to a
retreat center where I'm now putting up
I'm coming from we were talking about
nature and I was just connected to the
retreat center where I stay it's a 30
acre campus and I take this opportunity
to invite all of you
um you know it's called Om Shanti
retreat.org you can check our address
where we have peacocks and birds and
flowers and trees and it's open for all
um
it was built 23 years ago but which was
a Barren land but now it's of course a
different story
so you're all invited there for the last
10 years and serving there as a Raj yoga
teacher
so while I was working as an analyst
um every weekend I used to spend my time
there and go back to the corporate world
to the world and come back
and I did it for about a year and a half
every weekend
which gave me this understanding you
know the contrast of what's happening
and you know what I want
and it became very clear with my friends
uh you know finding a life finding a
partner going abroad settling somewhere
um I had to figure out what I needed to
do you know you were talking about we
had a woman in white hair you had you
know we're talking about people in your
60s or 70s but you know aging is a
process which happens every moment
because even a teenager is trying to fit
in especially a girl
if you're choosing anything maybe you're
choosing to do a job maybe a I mean I'm
sitting here if when I chose that I
would like to lead a spiritual life what
do you think was it easy or difficult
we are talking about inclusivity but how
about inclusivity of spirituality
how about women being allowed to choose
whether they want to lead a spiritual
life or not
because
and I'll tell you an experience when I
was
10 years I mean I chose about 12 years
that I'm gonna be in this 10 years I'm
at the center
I was younger
a Slimmer
and you know my friends and my
colleagues
family relatives and so-called
well-wishers
it was very difficult
they can't accept a fact that I would
like to lead a life which is close to my
heart
and you know what they said to me what
would you say
foreign
and what else what do you think what
else
yes you have not this is not your age
you know this is not your age you are
too young to do that
now aging gracefully meaning there is
nothing too young or too old
let's take that into consideration there
is nothing like you're too young to do
that or you're too old to do that
if you are convinced if you are having
an experience if you are sure what
you're doing it's absolutely fine I
think
so I mean I'm just bringing another
perspective of spirituality
I'm happy now that uh I'm happy because
I'm standing here and sharing it in
front of you I'm happy because I got
connected with my friends who counseled
me
who were getting married settling
everywhere and counseled me you know
they said you know
just
take it easy do what you have to but you
should have a life
I said you know I have a life
I have a life believe me I have a life
they said just do everything but you
should also have a life
now
of course I faced certain of these
Challenge and I remember a particular
phone call from a very good friend of
mine who had gone to Canada she settled
there she's still there Married With
Children
um and she called me and said you know
and and my friends called they had a
little meeting they had a meeting and
they said you know we've had a meeting
and we think
we just don't accept what you're doing
it's just not accepted uh you should not
leave your job you should be financially
independent doing something nice great
with a you know nice package and then
you do whatever you have to
and at that time I felt a little
betrayed I'm opening up here I felt a
little betrayed why because these were
my school friends they were my friends
which I thought were like my family and
I felt they also can't understand what I
really want and so if I have to be on
the path of anything I think you have to
be alone
you have to walk alone your Life Path
it's a joy and an honor to be here today
with you all
when sagita asked me to come here to
join you
and talk about overcoming the fear of
death as we age I said huh let me think
about it I haven't really talked in such
a
Enclave like this
but not only death but we have we also
fear age aging
but we need to face reality
we're getting older
second by second hour by hour
and we cannot run away from old age nor
from death
can we we cannot run away
I have gone through many challenges in
my life facing death too which I try to
overcome through positivity
I had cancer
and thought that was the end
and death was so close to me and my
family
I recovered and managed quite well
during that difficult uh
couple of months
and
as a practicing Buddhist
we do not run away from Death in fact we
are
told to
think about aging and death at all times
it does sound depressive once I was in
America I lived in America and I was
traveling in a bus to work and then one
I was reading a Buddhist book and
somebody said what a depressing book
you're reading but then I I didn't say
anything I just smiled because I was
just studying also but
it's not depressing it's a part of life
we age
we die and we have to accept it
understand it and die gracefully and
peacefully
first of all I think I should share with
you some a glimpse of my background I
was born in Hasa Tibet
and now it is as you all know it's
occupied forcefully occupied by China
and I came out to India before
1950 to study in Darjeeling
and uh
nine years
when I came to India to study in
Darjeeling to a modern School in fact my
Grand aunt she could have been the first
Tibetan to study out of Tibet
in the 1920s
and
I was very fortunate to have a family
in an isolated and conservative country
with a very open broad mind to send me
and my siblings to school in Darjeeling
it was a missionary school where I
learned so much also
well
my first challenge in life
was of course when I lost my country I
was in school and some students came and
said oh there's a Revolt in Tibet
there's a fight in Tibet we saw it in
the Statesman so I went to the library I
must have been about 12. went to the
library and read the article and I
thought oh
what's happening my country is
a sort of a war there people revolting
my family were there and it just struck
me especially my family members I was
more worried about and later certainly
dawned on me that oh maybe I'll lose my
country
whatever
uh I wasn't Darjeeling in school and it
took us 21 days from my home in harsa to
come to the border of India in Sikkim on
Horseback and he's doing a fantastic
work now going all over the world to
teaching the Dharma and also working
specially in go organic Go Green in
ladakh where they planted a million
trees in the latak The Nomad area where
it's very dry and they had to irrigate
and sort of make an ice stupa you must
have heard about the ice Trooper he
financed it and he's busy so anyhow he
came from Tibet very late and did more
work than any of us did having been
caught into college and so on
then in 59 there was a handful of
Tibetans like us who spoke English I
just finished my senior Cambridge and I
had a scholarship from an old friend of
my family
uh actually he was the grandson of Utah
the great writer so Elia came to India
to see his son his Dalai Lama and the
refugees and came wanted to see my
family
so he said what are you doing I said I
don't know because in Tibet women
after hardly had education get married
that's all or you become a nun
so I said I don't know he said are you
good in maths in art so I said that's
one of my best subjects he said I've got
a scholarship for you in New York in
Pratt's Institute but I got married and
then I got
settled in work
being a translator at the Tibet Bureau
in Delhi
and on the rehabilitation of Tibetans
next challenge was my husband was posted
to Switzerland
so with two toddlers we lived in
Switzerland for five years we had over a
thousand Tibetans resettled there the
Swiss government was so kind to invite
them and many children adopted studying
there
so after that we went to
America to migrate migrated there and so
everything was new country new Customs
new languages but we managed to be
managed
I think we Tibetans being so high up in
the mountains 12 000 feet was where I
was born and life was not easy really
tough life so I think that sort of gave
us some inner strength to go forward no
they're not spoiled like my children now
you know how easy going in the cars and
having everything go to the grocery stop
Supermarket get this get that uh we went
through a hard life I mean many of our
people went through a hard life I was a
little fortunate but anyhow we managed
but then in 1979 we decided I have a
daughter and a son we decided that they
were getting too Americanized
they needed some Eastern
Customs tradition to know something
about our Eastern culture so we brought
them back to India we've had a family uh
you're an entrepreneur you're into
Wellness you're a columnist you're in
media you're in social media everywhere
so how do you uh embark on this journey
with successes after successes and
knowing fully well that there are a lot
of stresses that will pull you down each
step of the way it's a difficult Journey
but a successful one and is it just a
facade and what goes more behind the
curtains whoa all right firstly hello
everybody and welcome to the next few
crazy minutes on this roller coaster
ride so uh let's start with saying yes I
have donned many hats over my entire
career
having said that my mother prathima bedi
there's a book time pass
and she says that there's birth and
there's death
we know these two exist
in between birth and death there is this
little tiny amazing journey called life
and all we have to do is time pass
and all we do is mess it up
and all we do is think about the social
constructs of what we are told we should
be doing how we should be studying how
we should be learning what we should be
becoming how we should marry who we
should marry the right way to dress the
right way to eat we're so busy following
set patterns set by Society we forget
what life is actually about all the
journeys that I've traversed personally
and professionally
for me have just been life leading me I
have enjoyed every challenge that has
been thrown my way I was studying in
school my best friend Samaya sitting
here we've known each other since we
were 12 years old in boarding school
Lawrence schools are now I was a class
top up she's Witness
[Laughter]
I was headed to Wall Street to become
part of the moves and shakers of the
financial world and I toppled into
Bollywood in my red dress flew
ever since then it's been a Non-Stop
Journey that I have allowed life to lead
me on and I have always
said to myself at every point of time
that if it feels wrong
it won't be and at every point of time
no matter what the journey has been it
could be professional going into
becoming a housewife going back into
being a professional and then a wellness
entrepreneur and I look back today maker
and I see that every single aspect of
who I was then it could it could be for
example
um
being famous okay that has led so many
eyeballs today to my entrepreneurial
journey into Wellness today uh it could
be the fact that I write a relationship
column with the times of India which has
been it's 18 years now helping people
helping them solve their problems
helping them analyze uh their lives and
and I grew up in a very different family
in the sense that we grew up
with our minds free there was no social
construct ever thrown upon me it was
always a yes you can do this and the
repercussions will be a b and c
and you better get prepared for either
of those repercussions if you should so
choose to go about the path in the way
you're planning to do so so
we learn to look at life very
differently and everything in my life
today has led me to this Wellness
Venture I'm not sure how many people
here know I know um Mr namgal who was
here earlier and also uh some you know
people who are from Tibet in the Tibetan
world and the Buddhist World here today
uh they know my grandmother very well
and she was a Buddhist now the highest
ordained Buddhist nun there are three
books written on an incredible life
journey of my grandmother my mother has
her book out everybody knows her
incredible life my father has this book
out
um I'm the my grandfather was a
spiritual healer I'm the 18th direct
descendant of his Holiness of of of Guru
nanak sahib so I mean there's a lot that
goes into a person being who they are
today and and allowing life thoughts
processes genetics
um certain character traits certain
energies that we carry with us to come
through us and to guide us and to take
us forward and to be open to it so many
of us are so closed to Opportunities we
don't even recognize opportunities when
they come our way and we're so scared to
take that leap of faith we're so we're
so we're so constrained in what we think
that we are powerless
and at the same time don't recognize
that each one of us has an inherent
power so the same thing can happen to
two different people and they both will
react so differently to the same
situation one will just drown and one
will just ride the wave one will get
crushed and one will go from strength to
strength so your attitude determines
your altitude which is what we're
talking about today which is the way you
see things is the way your life is and
if you don't like your life all you have
to do is change the way you see it and
everything changes automatically Okay so
said than done nope and you're you
you're taking these meditation sessions
and you are allowing people to look at a
perspective which is then going to
further enhance your capabilities and
then help you reach your capabilities
the goals that you want to reach out to
uh what is how is that messaging going
across whether to your children to the
people uh through your Venture the
wellness Venture how are you propagating
that message so meditation is very
different and changing your mindset is
very different it's worse you have to
recognize that we are nothing but our
programs so for example we are all if I
ask you who are you
uh
well I'm a woman and taking on this
journey independently with uh
various hats that I've owned first of
personally a daughter a sister a
professionally a journalist a television
news anchor executive editor of the
channel but but more individually
somebody who's a free spirit okay uh
somebody else who who you I'm I'm Somaya
somebody say I'm a woman somebody say
I'm a daughter I'm a mother I'm a
professional you are nothing but the sum
total of your Seer programming s-e-e-r s
is your social programming so from the
time you're born you're told
this is the way you should behave this
is the way you should dress this is the
way you should eat this is the way you
should respond to the opposite sex this
is your attitude towards sex this is
your attitude towards education this is
your attitude towards your career all
your social programming e is your
economic programming which is your
programming towards money a lot of us
especially in India brought up to
believe
the rich people are bad people the
excesses are not good for you you know
I'm simple I'm you know my simple life
is good for me the point is what is
wrong with abundance what is wrong with
money when I do my money manifestation
programs people are like yes yes because
everybody wants money you need money to
have a good life you want a good life
for your children you want a good life
for your family and I'm like okay how
much you want it's like 10 crores I'm
like okay what about 10 000 crores no no
no no I I don't need 10 000 crores I'm
like why not why is this block towards
more no no but I don't need 10 000
crores I said but if you have 10 000
crores and you want only 10 crores you
can do
9990 crores worth of charity
you can go out there and change the
world you don't have to keep it for
yourself you can share you can care you
can give you can do so much so why are
we blocking abundance from coming into
our life because the attitude of
blocking up under the attitude of being
scared of abundance the aptitude of of
not wanting abundance stops the
abundance from flowing your way because
everything is energy so economic
programming is now the rich people are
bad people money doesn't grow on trees
we've all heard that as we were growing
up rich people are surrounded by fake
friends rich people have chomchas
um you know all sorts of negative
implications and attitudes about money
the other is experiences experiences
your experiences teach you either to to
dislike to be jealous uh to be
untrusting or to be loving experiences
teach you so much not to go in your dog
will the dog bit you to be fearful
and R is a religious programming because
religion tells us so much about how we
should be what we should be doing Heaven
and Hell good and bad do this ritual
this will happen to you do that ritual
this will happen to you so all of us are
nothing but a program of a Seer
programming and if you learn what is
going wrong with your programming if
you're unhappy it means there's
something wrong in your programming that
is preventing you from changing the way
you look at things to make yourself
happy it's as simple as that so what is
it that is preventing you from changing
your programming you who's getting in
your way you who can create an issue in
your mind you who can change that issue
you so so it's really very simple when
you think about it that you have created
a program you uncreate your own programs

V2PDfX-5fPI,"H3N2 Claims 2 Lives, Centre Monitors Situation | Dr Randeep Guleria Speaks Exclusively | NewsX","H3N2 Claims 2 Lives, Centre Monitors Situation | Dr Randeep Guleria Speaks Exclusively | NewsX To Subscribe our YouTube ...",2023-03-11T09:31:56Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/V2PDfX-5fPI/hqdefault.jpg,"it is the central government that has
warned people of the h3n to influenza
virus that is doing the rounds the
central government has told states to
keep a close watch on the N3 N2 subtype
of the seasonal influenza virus after a
an 87 year old man from Karnataka became
India's first victim of the virus the
union health Ministry in a statement
said that it is monitoring the situation
in various States and union territories
through the integrated disease
surveillance program
and this is the network that provides
information to the central government
and the health Ministry on a real-time
basis the cases arising from seasonal
influenza are expected to decline from
March end is what the center has stated
it's also said that young children old
age persons with co-morbidities are the
most vulnerable groups in the context of
seasonal influenza so far Karnataka and
haryana have confirmed one death each
from H3N2 influenza
foreign
this n3n2 influenza has now caused the
death of two individuals one from
Karnataka and one from haryana how must
people
get their treatments in a bit to fight
the virus on an immediate basis
so I think what people need to do is be
careful and especially the elderly and
those who have comorbidities those those
do individuals who are unfortunately
died because of H3N2 or those who are
elderly and had comorbidities therefore
those groups should be extra careful
when they're going out they should wear
a mask they should wash their hands
regularly and avoid going to crowded
places you also have a flu vaccine which
gives some protection therefore they
should also get themselves vaccinated if
they haven't done so already and if
there is any suspicion that you have a
flu-like symptoms you must get self
yourself tested so that you can be
started on some treatment which is
available as far as antivirals are
concerned against influenza okay Dr
guleria we've seen these flu flues to be
quite common but also benign why is it
that this time around the n3n2 influenza
is so much more potent that people are
getting bouts of cough they are getting
fever and these complications are only
becoming more complex and the fever and
cough and cold lasts for a longer period
of time
correct here there I think there are two
or three reasons for this one of course
is that for the last two three years
we've been following a lot of covet
appropriate behavior marrying Mass
maintaining physical distance and
washing our hands because of that we are
seeing less respiratory infection
because all of these measures prevent us
from getting uh Airborne or respiratory
infections and that is why this was
there secondly for the last two years
covet has been the dominant virus as far
as respiratory viral infection is
concerned and therefore there have been
less cases of influenza and therefore
the the natural immunity that we as a
population get against influenza has
become less and therefore there is a
likelihood that we are as a population
more prone to getting the influenza this
time ah once the virus re-emerges and
the virus itself has had a little bit of
a mutation which has made it a little
more infectious and that is the other
cause so I think if you combine all of
this we are seeing an increase in number
of cases but every year during the
change of the weather there is a surge
in influenza cases this more this year
because of the factors that I've just
mentioned but the good thing is that by
and large most cases that we're seeing
are presenting with fever body aches
cough uh sore throat and like you
rightly said fever persists for
sometimes almost five to seven days and
cough can be there for a few weeks but
in terms of severe pneumonia admissions
in the hospital or requirement of
ventilatory support that is not very
high like we saw during the waves of
covet okay we are seeing some patients
getting admitted especially those who
are elderly and who have comorbid
conditions difficult area they are also
unfortunately two deaths that have been
reported because of the N3 and 2 virus
that is virulent one is in haryana and
one is in Karnataka is this virus
fertile
so in patients whose immunity is low or
in those who are elderly the virus can
cause severe pneumonia and can lead to
Ico Admissions and at times it can be
fatal this we see or not only in India
but globally also that when you have
influenza outbreaks given in the U.S
it's been estimated almost 30 to 40 000
people probably die every year because
of influenza it's predominantly the
elderly and the patients with
co-morbidities therefore we need to be
very Vigilant we need to increase
awareness among this group that they
take precautions they prevent themselves
from getting the infection and like I
said they should get themselves
vaccinated so that they are have some
degree of immunity to fight the
infection if they get the infection
precautions that need to be taken by
people so as to not get to the N3 and to
to not to not attract the N3 and to
virus what can people do to ensure that
they are not
fighting the virus they are able to
surpass this bout of n3n to influenza
that is in the air
so first of all I would say that people
when they go out especially if they're
going into a crowded place and it's
indoor you shouldn't wear your mask and
so if a mask should be back again you
should regularly wash your hands because
the infection can be transmitted from
your hand to your face and into it to
your Airways you must also try and
maintain physical distancing if you're
in a in a crowded area if we can do that
especially the high risk group we can
protect ourselves from getting the
infection like we did during the covert
times also those who have
are at high risk I would say that they
should also get themselves vaccinated
the flu shot is available getting the
influenza vaccine will also protect them
against the uh a severe infection
and those who have contracted the
was perhaps even weeks for the patient
to then get back to his normal self what
are the precautions they need to take
what is it that what are the corrective
actions that they need to take to get
your themselves cured of the disease
so if those who have a flu-like syndrome
should get themselves tested and people
get themselves tested for covert I would
say not only get your nasal strap for
covert but get it also for H3N2 for
influenza if you are influenza positive
and you are in the high risk group you
should also start an antiviral drug or
symptom of air which is commonly known
as stami flu that should be taken you
must take a good diet fresh fruits green
leafy vegetables keep yourself well
hydrated and if your fever is persisting
it's high grade you are having cough
with the sputum production there is
chest pain dizziness and children if
there are drowsiness the child is not
taking good amount of feed then you must
definitely consult your doctor as soon
as possible
yes in there is some increase in the
number of patients it's not that money
as we saw during the covet
waves but yes patients who have elderly
who have comorbid conditions are getting
admitted in the hospital with worsening
of the comorbid conditions or because of
a viral pneumonia which is leading them
to have breathing difficulty
the union health Minister has come up
with an advisory he's held a meeting of
a review meeting with various uh
members various State Health ministers
and officials and he's come out with an
advisory advisory to the states that
they have to be on a lot and closely
monitor the situation uh what are the
state authorities that they should be
doing to ensure that the patients are
cured and those who are still not
contracted the virus are secured from
not Contracting the virus
so I think we need to go back to covert
appropriate behavior wearing our Mass
physical distancing and washing our
hands for some time the mass this the
the
chances of the influenza being there are
only for the next few weeks it will come
down after that and I think we need to
be very Vigilant in terms of
surveillance monitor the number of cases
that are coming in a particular area
just to see that there is no outbreak
there look for Hospital admissions do a
surveillance to see that there's no
increase in Hospital admissions and make
sure appropriate treatment and drugs are
available so that all those who are
having the infection or are diagnosed to
have influenza infection because of H3N2
are treated in time and appropriately so
that we can save lives and before I
and the common symptoms that they have
they they face they experience once they
catch the n3n2 influenza virus
symptoms are like that we see for flu
you have high grade fever pain in your
throat running nose cough and body aches
you can have severe body aches joint
pains some people may also have diarrhea
and vomiting and this may persist for a
few days normally the fever lasts for
about four to five days it can go up to
seven days the cough can last for a few
weeks and your body aches also tend to
last for about four to five days and at
some people will have like I said chest
pain breathing difficulty and then they
need to consult the hospital and some of
them may need to be admitted
thank you Dr Galleria for sharing those
details with us and talking to us on
news x uh to make people more aware of
the N3 and 2 virus that is in the air
and precautionary measures need to be
taken and if you have contracted the
virus then when you need to take
corrective actions there are a number of
medicines that are available there you
have to reach out to your doctor your
ENT specialist who is then going to give
you the right course to be taken to get
rid of the virus in fact the central
government has also said that it is
keeping a closed tab on the entry into
subtype of the seasonal influenza after
this 87 year old man hailing from
Karnataka became India's first victim of
the virus the union health Ministry in a
statement has said that it is monitoring
the situation in various States and
union territories through the integrated
disease surveillance program Network

0gcEiE82oZA,PM Modi Raises Khalistani Vandalism During Joint Press Meet | As Khalistani Rampage On Peak In Aus,PM Modi Raises Khalistani Vandalism During Joint Press Meet | As Khalistani Rampage On Peak In Aus | NewsX #pmmodi ...,2023-03-10T09:16:36Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0gcEiE82oZA/hqdefault.jpg,"all right important highlights of the
Prime Minister and the Australian leader
Mr Albanese talking about uh both the
countries forging ahead in this
direction on a multitude of issues he
also spoke about how a commission is
going to be set up for the Indian
Australian Association well the Prime
Minister also did not pull a few punches
he spoke about
temples in Australia being vandalized
and he also spoke about kalistani
elements that are fermenting trouble for
India in the country of Australia so the
Prime Minister has raised the kalistani
issue as that is becoming a problem and
that is becoming a concern for the
government at hand as well
we are
of course focusing on what the Prime
Minister said at this point in time
he said that as countries we also need
to figure and focus on cooperation but
at the same time problems pertaining to
uh Indians as well as the cultural
Legacy of India in Australia cannot be
sidelined they need to be highlighted
and that that's exactly what the Prime
Minister did
a concern which has worried the Indian
diaspora as well as the government in
command about what the kalistani
movement is doing in Australia
this is of course more to do with the a
friendly as well as
an amicable way of telling the
Australians what the concerns for India
are they become my colleague joins us on
the broadcast to give us more details
and perspective about this devika the
trade and the bond homing aside the
Prime Minister did not mince his words
saying that these concerns
ought to be addressed including the
kalistani elements yes uh this is quite
a quite an important development that
has taken place because one was not
expecting the prime minister in his
bilateral to actually raise this issue
but he's not as you said minced his
words he said that I have seen reports
of attacks on temples in Australia I
have conveyed this to prime minister
Albanese and he has assured me that the
safety and well-being of the Indian
Community in Australia is a priority for
them so this is a big statement that is
coming from our prime minister and we
were in fact hoping that this issue will
be raised because many we've been having
several conversations on our Channel as
well wherein we've been talking about
how you know London or the United
Kingdom has been allowed to become a
breeding ground for khalistan and now
they've been looking to spread the
tentacles into Australia as well we've
seen four such attacks take place not
only on Hindu temples but also on the
Indian Community recently that was
holding a protest march with Indian
flags and they were attacked so these
were very serious issues that were is
and there was not a lot of hope it was
felt that perhaps diplomatically this
issue will be taken forward in closed
rooms but the fact that our prime
minister has today standing on the same
platform as prime minister Albanese made
a statement saying that we are concerned
about these reports and we want an
assurance from you that the Indian
Community in Australia which is a very
large community in Australia will be
protected and will kept safe is a big
message that we will not now allow these
uh kalistani elements to also spread
into Australia as they have into the
United Kingdom or even in Canada
right and as you rightly said that this
is a very Salient highlight of the
bilateral between the two leaders in
recent memory or in fact you know if you
look at the track record of the Prime
Minister interacting with various world
leaders from from around the globe he's
barely mentioned uh you know a thing
like this so uh you know this is
absolutely of great importance to the
government because it's being held by
the prime minister
at the same time we need you know this
is also reflective of our changing
relation in our changing comfort with
Australia the fact that we are a part of
the quad with Australia with Japan and
the us we want to get this level of
comfort where we are not beating around
the bush but we are coming to key issues
that affect us bilaterally that affect
our nation bilaterally or that affect
our community uh in a direct manner in
Australia so I think this is actually
quite reflective of our growing comfort
with Australia the fact that we can come
on a world stage and make a statement
like this uh to the world that listen we
have had talks about these recent
attacks we're not just brushing this
matter under the carpet we're talking
about these recent attacks and uh we
want to come up you know with Solutions
uh uh that are conducive for Australia
that are conducive towards the growth
between our two really uh you know
Nations so I think this is actually
quite a positive step before anybody
says that okay you know India has raised
this matter and will this now create
problems between India and Australia no
I do not I don't think so I don't think
that's the key takeaway from this the
fact of the matter is that India wants
to ensure that it has great relations
with Australia and a part of that is to
have very open honest conversations
about matters that clearly do affect the
Indian Community in Australia that
continues to of course uh contribute
towards Australia's growth as well so
this is I think this is a big step and
of course a very positive development
that has taken place all right devika
thank you for joining us Dr sharath
Kohli Economist is also with us of the
program uh Dr Coley apart from uh you
know the the economic understanding
between these two countries you know I
would also want you to weigh in on the
Prime Minister perhaps being very vocal
about the safety of Indians in Australia
and the safety of indianness in
Australia
yes vineeth I think uh you know he
doesn't spare an opportunity whenever he
finds one and uh vandalism on the Indian
places of worship in Australia as a
matter of concern especially coming out
of a movement which had died down long
long ago kalistan this whole rubbish
which is happening I think I think uh
the role of the government the local
government and that country is pertinent
it's significant because it's after all
a Law and Order question so for a
country for not being able to handle Law
and Order in a place like Australia
which is supposed to be a developed
country I think it is is very
questionable so it was it was very
appropriate for the prime minister to
raise this concern that our places of
worship and safety of uh you know we
have a total diaspora across the world
of 3.2 crore people so which is which is
a very very significant numbers and
prime minister we must not forget is
very passionate about diaspora I mean
every time he travels he never misses
out an opportunity to to interact with
the dice for us so I think uh not just
the safety of uh you know people out
there we need it is also about he said
indian-ness because of a movement which
is being allowed to uh to develop over
there a movement which is which is being
allowed to move forward unhindered cans
also send a wrong message to the
perpetrators out here in India because
we see this in Punjab we hear names of
uh you know or different kinds of people
who try and raise slogans on the road so
take out uh you know you know those
those many processions who who uh you
know flaunt their uh their talwars and
so and so I think this is this is not
done we cannot allow the head of this
kind of uh movement again to be coming
up which is divisive it is believe it is
based on separatism and I think it is
very important and a very right time for
the Prime Minister if this is being
funded from abroad if this has been
perpetrated from abroad I think it is
the duty of the head of the state to to
make shock or that it is submute and it
is it is it is to be put in his mind
that this is anti-national it's against
India it's divisive politics and it
should not be allowed so I think the
Prime Minister very rightly in fact uh
when uh some time ago when I did a show
on news explaining uh amongst when uh
prime minister Alvin easy had not
arrived but was about to arrive I
remember talking about this as as the
first point apart from the economic
issues that this issue of kalistan and
places of worship vandalism should be
taken up by the Prime Minister and as
anticipated he has taken it up I am sure
going forward uh the one homie which is
being shown between the two Prime
Ministers this would lead to a you know
very very conclusive action on these
forces and people who are trying to
create this nonsense uh in foreign lands
meaning right and
right let's listen and in fact let's
reiterate and show you what the Prime
Minister had said
Australia
foreign
Minister said that this is a worry that
he already shared with the Prime
Minister of Australia and he was
reiterating that stance again but the
fact of the matter is what the
Australian response is going to be you
know we have in fact highlighted such
threats and such problems with Indians
and towards our national Securities when
it comes to a country like Canada but
their response has been very lukewarm
we'll have to wait and watch what the
Australians do now
absolutely Vanessa you're right about
that of course we have to wait and watch
what Australia has to say on the matter
but the important thing is that we have
at least presented where we stand today
uh it's not an isolated event that has
happened in Australia we saw that it was
a series of attacks and all claimed by
supporters of khalistan and kalistani
elements in Australia so we were seeing
that this there was an emergence of a
kalistani movement in Australia that was
targeting the Indian Community that was
targeting Hindu temples and we have
decided to at least nip it in the bud as
far as Australia is concerned and this
is precisely what we've been seeing on
our Channel as well when we've held all
these conversations the four times the
attacks have happened we've had a
conversation each time and our simple
demand has been that will Australia now
act because in the past we've also
spoken to journalists and others from
Australia who sat with us on these
debates and they said no we don't know
of any sort of kalistani movement per se
in Australia this is a new phenomenon
that's taking place and therefore we
said okay if it's a new phenomena then
let's nip it in the bud let's talk about
it openly and honestly let's say that we
are uncomfortable with the emergence of
this kalistani movement and let's now do
something about it before we end up
becoming like I said like the UK or
Canada

WptgDh92pag,Modi Albanese Bilateral | What are India’s priorities? | NewsX,Modi Albanese Bilateral | What are India's priorities? | NewsX #pmmodi #anthonyalbanese #newsx To Subscribe our YouTube ...,2023-03-10T07:48:39Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WptgDh92pag/hqdefault.jpg,"prime minister Narendra Modi and
Australia and the Prime Minister Anthony
albanize are holding bilateral talks in
New Delhi the two leaders are expected
to discuss various issues to further and
boost the comprehensive strategic
partnership between their respective
Nations besides both leaders are also
expected to hold talks on trade
investment Defense Education and
renewable energy India and Australia
share a warm and friendly relationship
the Strategic partnership between the
two countries was elevated to a
comprehensive strategic partnership in
2020. last year both countries signed a
Free Trade Agreement called the economic
cooperation and trade agreement and the
bilateral trade between the two
countries amounts to around 27 billion
dollars till 22 but it is expected to go
or perhaps even cross 50 billion dollars
in the next few years let's listen into
these reactions
well can I just thank Prime Minister
Modi for the extraordinarily generosity
of his very warm welcome here
Australia and India are great friends we
are partners and we're building that
partnership even stronger each and every
day both through our personal
relationship as the prime ministers of
India and Australia but importantly as
well the relationship between our
peoples our leader delegation here of
significant Business Leaders as well we
want to cooperate with India and build a
relationship in culture in economic
relations as well as in our security and
I want to warmly thank Prime Minister
Modi for this extraordinary welcome here
today we are competing on the cricket
field to be the world's best
back together we are building a better
world
all right to joining us on the show at
this point in time is Mr Charles
Thompson Australian journalist ambassadi
pakora former Diplomat also with us on
the program Professor editorial director
of the Sunday Guardian joins us on the
show as you well thank you everyone for
being a part of this conversation uh
Professor nalapath if I can begin with
you sir
yes right so before we come to you let's
also you know highlight some of the
issues that exactly will be uh you know
the core areas where these two leaders
are going to be discussing matters that
are pertinent to both the nation
respectively first up of course
upgrading the ecta to a comprehensive
platform safety of Indians in Australia
amidst the kalistani motivated movement
Smart Energy partnership for
collaboration in Sola uh is something
that the Australians definitely can pick
a cue from defense partnership to tackle
China in the indo-pacific uh the
Australian interest in India's defense
technology are also something which is a
growing need at this point in time uh
and of course upgrading a number of
Trade Agreement parameters is going to
be the areas that both these leaders are
going to be focused on Professor
nalapath if I can begin with you sir
while India and Australia they are very
friendly they are very very ambitious
about depending on each other and taking
this partnership and this trade
agreement to the next level but the fact
of the matter is that there are some key
issues that still exist for Australia as
well as India in your opinion from the
top of your head which is that first
thing that both these leaders need to
iron out so everything works out
smoothly one of course is the elephant
in the room China
uh you're quite right vineet and there
was a perception across the world that
prime minister albanisi will be uh if I
may say so a little more uh uh a little
more uh attentive to to to to China uh
than his predecessor Scott Morrison has
been but I think that particular
situation has been completely diffused
the reality is that prime minister
albanizi may speak in a softer gentle
atone but in his actions he's very
clearly showing that he has a clear
understanding of the threat that is
posed by the Chinese attempt to expand
its territory uh its influence all
across the indo-pacific uh from that
point of view India would obviously
welcome that stand and I'd also like to
say that both the prime ministers appear
to have established a very warm and
Cooperative relationship with each other
the Prime Minister Modi and prime
minister Morrison and a very warm and
Cooperative relationship and now that
same closeness has been established with
prime minister albanizi this reminds me
of the United States where Prime
Minister Modi had a very good
relationship with Obama than with Trump
and now with Biden so I think
fundamental interests are actually
driving this relationship and whether
it's United States whether it's
Australia whether it's Japan the four
Court Partners the fundamental
relationship is driven by a common
desire to ensure a free and open
indo-pacific to ensure that democracies
succeed against uh attempts by
autocracies to weaken them and from All
Points of View so far it's been a hugely
successful visit on the part of the
Australian prime minister a lot of the
earlier apprehensions and about him
about the policy of his government I
think they've been laid to rest by his
very strong diplomacy in India and is
very strong advocacy of a very close
relationship between Australia and India
absolutely right Ambassador your
thoughts and your basic aspirations from
you know the Strategic partnership
between these two great Nations
thank you very much always a pleasure to
be with you to listen to professor
nalapath and of course we'll be
listening to our friend from Australia
I'll try and understand what he says
because we wash our face in the basement
we don't wash our fights in the Bison
anyway that's on a on a humorous note
there have been some irritants in
Australia Australia such as the
Toleration of the Kazakhstan movement
destruction of Indian places of worship
yet I do believe Mr military always a
pleasure to be with you is and and to
talk to the millions of people on your
show is that the two countries have come
to terms with each other we are Partners
in Quad as the whole world knows but
we're also linked in a mini natural
called India Australia Indonesia that
focuses on strengthening cooperation
within the framework of the Indian Ocean
Dream Association the indo-pacific G20
and the blue economy interestingly I
read somewhere that prime minister
Albanese had come to India in the early
1990s there's a Backpacker Professor
then he got hustled in Connaught place
please ask him to claim his money for
we'll give it back to him we can afford
it now now you've given all the figure
right these are live shots coming in
Ambassador just just interjecting you
for a second sir these are light these
are live shots coming in between uh the
Prime Minister and the Australian prime
minister uh you can see the chemistry is
absolutely wonderful there seems to be
ground being laid at this point in time
for some Stella cooperation ambassadora
continue sir
you're a Foreign Service kid so you'll
understand this that having been in some
ways whether Mr Thompson agrees with me
or not rejected by China Australia needs
a new market the only one that is large
enough is India let me also tell you sir
something very interesting and I'm so
professional knows this that when uh
Scott Morrison the previous prime
minister who had a great relationship
with India's prime minister asked for an
independent International inquiry into
the origins of the Chinese virus this
ping pong ding dong tingling character
went berserk and described Australia as
chewing gum stuck to the boot of China
the white trash of Asia Zone and so
forth now they also banned imports from
trying out from Australia so it's very
interesting that there were eight ships
loaded with high quality Australian coal
that were not allowed to dock in China
and they had to be diverted to Indonesia
and India so I believe that was the
beginning of the trilateral between
India Australia and Indonesia that is
the Chinese misbehave as they always do
we have Alternatives so the basic uh
element the basic factor in the
relationship is it's the economy is
stupid as Bill Clinton said in the early
90s and the second element is China to
contain China's movements actions its
threats in the Indian Ocean region in
the indo-pacific there is no one better
place than India Australia is that I
believe they realize that their
partnership would be excellent would be
imperative for the preservation of the
openness of this common good which is
the indo-pacific
right Mr Thompson
Mr Thompson what are your thoughts what
are your thoughts we spoke yesterday as
well sir these are of course exciting
times India and Australia a lot to pick
from each other
I think look credit has to go where it's
due and it's due with one or two people
and the first of the rank is Narendra
Modi there has there is no other
politician on the planet who does
branding like Narendra Modi I mean those
pictures of the Prime Minister of
Australia he did he had no idea when he
saw than me went into shop Australia has
also gone into shop it's been on all the
news channels that is this picture of
Alvin Avenue and he's at a cricket match
in Gujarat so I would say to you that
okay China's a bully and China has over
a period of time got even stronger in
its tactics of being bullying and but
the thing is India has changed I think
the this is where in the whole of the
South Pacific and with all of the
countries that the thing that's changing
everything is India and it's India now
that's willing to lift its head and
prepare to do agreements to do trade
agreements to to start sharing military
technology and even having an Australian
prime minister on on a Navy ship so
there's been I think there's been a big
change in India and it's India that's
taken the lead in this of course if
you're bullied and by your biggest
trading partner and Australia's biggest
trading partner has been China you have
to look for other places and India has
just opened the welcoming man I mean
it's amazing what's going to be very
interesting though over the next six
months or one year is to see how China
deals with Narendra Modi I think that's
going to be the fascinating thing
because wherever they bully whichever
country they're bullying in Southeast
Asia the mat is now open to connect with
India
hmm Professor the important Point
interesting point china is going to be
on its toes and perhaps even hard on its
heels observing India in the next six
months
well uh I'd like to point out that uh
you know chip manufacturer is a very
very important component uh for the
future and for the present and both
Australia and India have extraordinary
complementarity of talents a
complementarity of resources natural
resources and human resources and I
think a close working relationship
between the two would would actually
Turbo Charge the the progress of both
countries in in fields of high value
manufacture so I'm very optimistic about
the future of the india-australia
relationship I think that it was set on
a very firm footing by by the previous
administration Scott Morrison let me say
and prime minister albanizi has now
continued that momentum and in fact
added to it so I am very optimistic
about that and I think both the
Australian as well as the Indian prime
ministers recognize the importance of
these two democracies working together
there are voices in Australia in India
as well that are dismissive frankly any
kind of roof between India and Australia
will bring music to the years of the
people's Liberation Army and General
headquarters in Rawalpindi and that's
precisely why where we need to ensure
that the relationship is on a firm track
and very importantly we need to ensure
that
misrepresentations about each other uh
you know peripheral issues are not
allowed to overshadow and overthink the
big picture which is the imperative of
India Australia cooperation I'd like to
say that I think prime minister Albanese
would be would have been having
discussions in India or certainly some
of his delegation would have about the
problem that is being faced in Australia
by uh Lobby which is funded by China and
and organized through Pakistan which is
basically targeting a particular
peaceful religious denomination and the
houses of worship of that religious
denomination this is a completely
peaceful religious denomination known
across the world for that and they have
been deliberately targeted in Australia
essentially to turn public opinion in
India against Australia against the
Albanese government I'm sure that the
Prime Minister of Australia is cognizant
of that and I'm looking forward to
strong action by him to prevent this
particular Lobby from continuing its
activities designed to terrorize a
particular Community a particular
religious community that has always been
known for being peace loving and for
contributing immensely to wherever it
has settled right uh Ambassador it's a
valid point you know we've been trying
to sound off the danger uh you know to
the National integrity and the fabric of
our nation which continues to be
threatened from countries abroad
specifically Canada uh you know but they
haven't paid much of a heed to all these
calls to uh you know do something
against these kalistani elements do you
think that we will perhaps have a better
leverage now because of our proximity
and friendship with Australia
Mr
Jose you might recall that before 9 11
happened we kept telling the Americans
that look these guys are terrible
fellows and terrorism is going to hit
you also no no that's a third world Law
and Order problem we were described as
the third world the world was very
neatly partitioned into first second and
third now a fourth world is emerging
which India is leading which is the most
powerful
um what really did happen sir in the
early years of our independence the
first uh five decades Mr Thompson India
and Australia talked at each other they
did not talk to each other in the late
in the late 1980s we had leased a Soviet
submarine to train our own people and
the Aussies went bazakans out there who
do this etc etc all that is forgotten
because now they've got orcas and they
are themselves getting all these nuclear
powered submarines and so on so things
change relationships change perceptions
change but sir today if there is an
issue that Australia ought to be a
little more cognizant of and I'm sure it
is then what we perceive publicly it is
Terrorism but terrorism Knows No
Boundaries it recognizes no religions
and there's one country as we know it's
the epicenter of terrorism as India is
the epicenter of culture and peace its
neighbor unfortunately has adopted
terrorism as its child so I believe that
Australia will understand this I believe
we'll talk about this I'm told by my
friends in the intelligence community
that cooperation in that area too in
intelligent sharing is increasing I
think Canberra has figured out what it
hopes to achieve with India we figured
out what we want to get from Australia I
think both countries have chosen each
other as development partners and if I
may respond with the punch line yeah he
had right choice baby and that's truly
Cricket this is cricket
right miss Mr Thompson uh your your
thoughts on uh you know these concerns
that India has about its cultural
identity and integrity being honored and
appreciated in Australia
why is it looking at that the first way
of looking at it is that there's a
larger and larger proportion of Indians
now in Australia who are calling
Australia home and they're also having
an impact in all of our Lives whether it
be politics whatever it be in Australia
so that's one aspect to it the second
aspect is I of course I hear repeatedly
that Canada Australia must do more with
these people who are doing these things
but there is the rule of law and to me
the thing that must change in India and
I say this quite clearly is
it should be a fact that you cannot
enter or in India if you're now an
Indian with a foreign passport and you
have committed a crime or you have
committed some offense uh that should
just not happen and the moment these
because it's a very small minority of
people start to realize that their
travel restrictions put on them it may
also help calm them down but
most Australians they're not aware of a
lot of these problems are these problems
are created within the Indian Community
against the larger Indian Community and
only time will tell
um I that that's I think all I I've
repeated this a few times before and I
think this is something that we both
sides have to think seriously about
hmm all right Professor alapat what are
the other issues that you think that
India is uh you know likely to bring up
uh when this bilateral concludes you
know apart from the threats to the
Indians you know there is China of
course and and you know the economic
slowdown uh you know the volume of trade
is also something uh which has increased
or gone up you know at a snail space is
that also uh going to be a concern for
uh for especially India look we need two
points one I fully agree with uh Mr
Thompson he's absolutely right and
whether it's from Canada the UK the
United States Australia any part of the
world where you have a foreign citizens
of Indian origin who are conspiring with
hostile Powers two hostile Powers uh
China and Pakistan against the Indian
people they should definitely not be
allowed to come to India and spread
toxicity in our country uh that I think
that the the lenient attitude towards
them needs to be replaced by a very very
strict application of the zero tolerance
policy towards such elements the second
point is you know the Australia and
India democracies the democracies are a
lot more than governments and
democracies are civil society
democracies are private companies
democracies are our ngos democracies are
universities the democracy is a societal
groups of people and a lot of
interaction needs to take place between
these various groups and I think that is
something that both governments need to
empower and incentivize a barriers
frankly to that kind of free movement of
culture of you know of talent is very
important for example in Tech you know
it's so important in high-tech fields to
ensure that there's a seamless back and
forth flow of the highest level of
talent if you have Manpower Curves in
place then you can't really have a tech
partnership you have to have a seamless
flow of very high value individuals
India has got those individuals
Australia's got those individuals and
for us to cooperate there needs to be a
seamless coming and going of these
individuals I'm sure these points are
being raised and are being discussed and
I'm very certain as has currently been
said by Mr Johnson Indians feel
extremely welcome in Australia and they
find Australians very wonderful people
and I would agree a few Australians I've
met definitely meet that description so
I'd like to say that I do hope that the
way will be cleared to create the
governmental framework in place for a
great expansion of cooperation across
all the different elements of Indian
society and economy for more such videos

Australian prime minister Anthony
Albanese will hold bilateral talks in
New Delhi today the two leaders are
expected to discuss various gamuts of
issues to further boost their
comprehensive strategic partnership uh
besides both leaders they are also
expected to hold talks on trade
investment Defense Education and
renewable energy India and Australia
share a warm and friendly relationship
the Strategic partnership between the
two countries was elevated to a
comprehensive strategic partnership in
2020. last year both countries signed a
Free Trade Agreement called the economic
cooperation and Trade Agreement
the bilateral trade between the two
countries amounts to nearly 27 billion
dollars so far
in 2122 and the bilateral trade is
expected to cross 45 billion in the
years to come
right India and Australia making sure
that their partnership doesn't end
on
the already promising note but continues
to soar and continues to benefit both
the Nations
the Prime Minister and his Australian
counterpart also watched the India
Australia
test match yesterday on its first day
both the prime ministers met the
respective captains Rohit Sharma and
Steven Smith thus showing that the
camaraderie and the uh born homing
between both the countries is just
beyond trade and necessities
Australia for the very long time has
been looking to House china as a
strategic partner because of ideological
differences with the Chinese government
they have found a partner in India that
not only complements their Democratic
point of view but also their ideological
point of view
the Prime Minister has always been very
vocal
about extending a helping hand whenever
it comes to Australia and that gesture
and emotion has been reciprocated by the
Australians from time to time
foreign
so here we are at the Hyderabad house
with the Prime Minister and the
Australian prime minister
will be
addressing the media
former Ambassador former Diplomat
Ambassador sajan joins us on the show at
this point in time Ambassador according
to you what are the areas that India and
Australia are likely to focus on uh you
know especially when India is heading
the G20
yeah a large number of areas you know
both bilateral as well as Regional and
global so as far as bilateral is
concerned as we were speaking earlier
trade economy Commerce that would
definitely be a very important element
of the negotiations and second thing
would also be the defense cooperation we
know that uh
uh prime minister albanizi he visited
the vikrant yesterday the
aircraft carrier and in recent years the
discussions between the two sides on
cooperation and defense have increased
very significantly uh this is also in
terms of Maritime domain awareness both
of them have interest in the
indo-pacific in the Pacific Ocean Indian
Ocean because the security is linked to
that so uh trade and defense are
definitely in terms of
bilateral issues and also in terms of
building up resilient Supply chains we
had entered into a trilateral mini
lateral between Japan Australia and
India on having resilient Supply chains
and a stable Supply chains so that is
another particular aspect then in terms
of investments in both the countries the
treated agreement actor that has been
signed that has been brought into
operation and I think that is expected
to give a Philip to this bilateral
engagement then in terms of security
it's very important because both of them
are members of the quad and the quad
meetings have been taking place
regularly at the summit level also this
year it is uh in the next few months Mr
Albanese will be hosting the quad Summit
at which he's invited all the other
three leaders so I'm sure that is going
to be an important area also uh
Australia will be hosting the Malabar
defense military exercises so that will
also be in the regional Global context
that will also be an important part of
the discussions and of course
people-to-people contact what we saw
yesterday in terms of cooperation
expansion of cooperation between the two
sides on the soft power issues on
Cricket people to people I think all
these are there's a very
there's a very big template that both
the leaders will be discussing uh
terrorism I think will be another area
which will be uh which will be a focused
and then finally in terms of uh
specific attention would be on a free
and open inclusive indo-pacific and
ensuring the rule of law in the region
in
how big uh you know a bone of contention
is China likely to be when uh India and
Australia talk about their future plans
you know China will always be there
hanging around at the back of their
minds I don't think any of the joint
declarations that you will see or any of
the statements by the two prime
ministers I don't think the name of
China is going to be mentioned but all
these areas that I have mentioned
whether it is a supply chains whether it
is defense on whether it is indo-pacific
whether it is Malabar it is all to some
extent I'll not say all of it but
definitely to uh some extent to a large
extent also uh being uh
you know the the reason the rationale
for that is the expansionist policies of
China the assertive policies of China in
its neighborhood in the South China Sea
in East China Sea so uh and the sort of
action that China had taken against
Australia in the wake of the covid-19
crisis when Australia had demanded an
investigation into the origins of the
crisis and how it had china had come
down very sharply on Imports of wheat of
barley of uh of uh Vines from from
Australia so Australia is definitely
interested in looking at some other
good
reliable
growing markets and definitely India is
a very attractive proposition as far as
that is concerned so China is definitely
a very important fact
lurking in the background but I don't
think it will be brought out in so many
words out it could be open for more such

albanize is visiting Rajkot he's paying
his tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and this
comes after he visited the rashtrapati
Bhavan and hailed India as a close
partner with Prime Minister Modi
major Muhammad Alisha defense expert
joins us on the show to give his take on
this important visit Ali a very good
morning to you
morning Ali what do you make of you know
this growing proximity between India and
Australia obviously when it comes to
strategy Australia Echoes our views on
China but at the same time trade is
something that Australia definitely
needs a hand with they've been trying to
cut the umbilical cord with China and
the next obvious destination for that
Gap is India
absolutely we need to read firstly we
have the Australian prime minister when
he came to India he and uh prime
minister went to Gujarat and they saw
the match over there and another Modi
Stadium we have a very very good Indian
ambassador to Australia
a very bright yeah ifs officer in fact
uh he had been the ambassador of Peru so
now when India and Australia that ties
we have a lot of Indians studying and
working in Australia we have a lot of
Australians in India in fact as well so
yes the ties are growing and the bond is
only strengthening with unlike uh many
nations where like for example I will I
don't mean to compare ourselves with a
downtroduction like Pakistan but
Pakistan is actually falling apart with
all his friends like China Saudi Arabia
all the Muslim uh Middle East countries
also they are falling apart but on the
other hand on the contrary India's
relationships India's diplomatic ties
with several countries are growing
without Australia in fact our trade is
go is growing our education our exchange
programs with them are growing and
certainly I mean uh China also acted
funny with Australia in a way by making
friends with uh Solomon Islands and
which had a packed with Australia
earlier so that affected the Australians
as well in a large way but India always
helped there to help everyone out and
Australia and India it's give and take
it's uh unconditional our leadership
with Australia is uh I see it as
strengthening even further in the days
to company
hmm
Ali what do you think is uh going to be
you know the the way forward going ahead
with Australia when it when it comes to
our you know cultural connection
Australia understands it but when it
comes to the you know the welfare of our
citizens there have been some issues and
misunderstandings in Australia do you
think that is also something that should
feature in our list of priorities
well yes we reach uh see recently what
happened to foreign minister
was in Australia just a few days back
and uh that's the time there was attack
on Indian students in Australia and
should he have addressed it yes he
should have and he did in fact subtly in
a way but the motive the purpose of his
visit at that time was totally different
and he uh stuck to his email I'll give
her a small analogy with this everything
and I will it's not everyone to
understand see in the I because I will
give a very defense analogy indeed in
the on the borders we petrol the areas
right when we meet an enemy Patrol if
we're going for a Reiki petrol we are
wrecking that area we are motive is
different so we if you see the enemy do
we fire upon the enemy upon seeing them
no we will gather all the inputs and
give it to a higher up to a headquarters
to execute what the actual motive was
similarly when I extend up as Minister
had gone to Australia he stuck to his
aim and yes we should uh take up the
matter where
in Punjab that's a different thing we
threw them out we would not allow it to
happen on our soil so they tried that in
Canada then they tried expanding their
wings to Australia but again I I just
meant I just complimented
the Indian Ambassador there so I think
he is the right man to actually create
that bridge and uh they I think I
comment the Indian government for
putting the right plan in the right
please arrive the right job in fact so I
have known this monthly we've done
theater together in our days and so
knowing him personally and closely I can
tell you I can vouch for with conviction
that's such a golden opportunity with
the right manners there is definitely is
going to be a very very beneficial for
both the Nations for more such videos

are partners and we're building that
partnership even stronger each and every
day both through our personal
relationship as the prime ministers of
India and Australia but importantly as
well the relationship between our
peoples our leader delegation here of
significant Business Leaders as well we
want to cooperate with India and build a
relationship in culture in economic
relations as well as in our security and
I want to warmly thank Prime Minister
Modi for this extraordinary welcome here
today we are competing on the cricket
field to be the world's best
back together we are building a better
world
pretty good
all right that was the Australian prime
minister speaking on the outline of the
bilateral meeting between him and the
Prime Minister a number of areas
including education technology
and trade are going to be featured in
this conversation between the two
remember yesterday was a landmark
occasion the Australian prime minister
as well as the Indian Prime Minister Mr
Narendra Modi were in Ahmedabad to watch
the fourth test match between India and
Australia
their Partners in court as well and Mr
Sanjeev srivastava a foreign affairs
expert joins us on the broadcast to give
us his insights into this high and very
important meeting Mr srivastava
Australia has always been you know a
friend that India has relied on but the
fact of the matter that the tide is
changing when it comes to dependencies
on China how important a role is India
going to play when it comes to you know
uh you know the trade dependencies of
Australia
yes we did I think India Australia a
strategic partnership is a very
comprehensive
strategic partnership having shared
values shared interest shared
opportunities shared challenges
obviously these relationship is is
between the two democracies of the
indo-pacific region and this region is
facing a severe Challenge from a country
like China and the rules based order has
to be protected and for that to do also
democracies are coming together with
regard to China Australia's trade
relationship with China we need if you
look at during the covet pandemic time
when Australia raised the issue of the
investigation of the origins of Corona
virus China got infuriated and they
started taking uh all sorts of you know
negative steps to cut down the trade
with Australia and Australian Australia
China relationship got very much a taste
during the corona time and now Australia
is having security concerns with regard
to Chinese various Maneuvers negative
Maneuvers so I think Australia is
looking for various other avenues
opportunities in other countries and
India is one of the Prime destination uh
from uh for Australia and during this
visit uh as you said uh very lightly we
need that trade investment education
renewable energy defense Etc all you
know critical issues uh will be
discussed and obviously a trade and
investment will be one of the key issues
and uh I think uh Australia is going to
invest more and more in India and
Australia is looking for a better
Avenues Australia's China relationship
has got deteriorated during Corona
pandemic as I said so I think uh India
is going to be in a fulfilling uh its
responsibility towards it's a it's
aesthetic partner Australia and I think
India is very much geared up India will
also be benefited because the very a
supply chains with China
which were there in China they are now
thinking of moving out of it and uh
India is the one of the Prime
destination from all those Supply chains
from democratic countries I think
Australia will have a closer ties which
is closer trade ties with India in times
ahead I it is quite clear and during
this visit I expect a lot of you know
understanding uh will will be you know
happening with regard to how to enhance
our traded investment relationship uh
with Australia and that is certainly is
going to happen during this visit I very
much look forward to such developments
former Diplomat Ambassador Ashok sajanar
also joins us on the broadcast
Ambassador very good morning to you I
hope you can hear me
I can hear
it yes right so good morning what do you
what do you think sir are the the
Salient the important uh points that
India and Australia are supposed to lie
Zone as well as trade upon there are
definitely synergies which are emanating
out of Australia which used to emanate
for China
yes I think trade is definitely trade
investment economic cooperation is
definitely a very important area where
both countries can cooperate uh
collaborate much more and we have signed
just signed a trade deal of free trade
agreement with Australia that has been
approved by the Australian parliaments
so I think that is very much on track
we have also just a year ago signed a
trilateral deal between India Japan and
Australia for resilient Supply chains
because this was a very important issue
during the time of covet because China
had tried to weaponize the supply chains
of essential items and essential
Commodities which are required for
dealing with the covid-19 pandemic so
there are a number of a areas where both
sides can look at each other in the area
of
economy and trade we have also seen in
the area of defense the what partnership
has grown very significantly I think
it's a particularly a matter of
satisfaction that the new government of
prime minister Albany that came to power
last year in May that they have not
missed a step in terms of both taking
the ballot to partnership with India
forward and also in terms of its focus
on the quad you would recall we need
that when earlier in 2007 we had
discussions on the quad and the initial
discussions that the four countries need
to come together Japan U.S Australia and
India and at that time we had seen an
election in Australia which threw up
Kevin Rudd as the Prime Minister who's
from the same party as prime minister
Albanese and he immediately withdrew
from that grouping so there some
concerns and apprehensions that were
being expressed when
Scott Morrison was voted out in albanesa
came in but it is a reassuring that he
is right so of course started the
conversation but taking relations with
India forward for more such videos

to give his perspective on this
Ambassador good morning to you
good morning what do you make of uh you
know these discriminatory practices
which continue to Spur out of various
parts around the world and including the
United States
or practically four years uh I I will
have to look at the whole issue from a
kind of a perspective that exists not
just one country but globally uh people
believe that USA is all a completely
balanced Society Affair without any
discrimination there is no Society in
the world there is no country in the
world where a discrimination does not
exist where there is no law there is no
violation of laws existing laws etc etc
and in the USA also there are practices
which are not sanctioned by the law but
they do exist uh and therefore each
Professor balance is going to say that
uh what happened to her is a result of
gender discrimination and racial
discrimination uh it is not at all
unlikely that such ideas of such youth
but at the about the same institution
but the most points really here is that
a person is able to access the U.S
judicial system and in accordance with
the existing laws of data distinction
which will retract that we want so in
this case all I would say really here is
that if there is
I'm very very confident that the if the
court will take a decision in accordance
with existing laws and regression in
accordance with the law and through her
satisfaction uh and that is basically
that she should not carry on the feeling
that she has been discriminated that's
the most important part and the law

commentary today that's going to be very
interesting to uh hear and watch right
Mr baby shubman Gill coming in in place
of KL Rahul something perhaps that
should have been done a long time ago
he prayed in God see the problem is what
happens is that when media has a media
focuses too much on particular prayer
and he will be under pressure now that's
the problem is that we do not give
player a genuinely the priest if Rahul
was not playing well he should have been
replaced without any uh hearing cry so
probably there are so much of pressure
built on that he shouldn't dropped and
we should be brought in so both were
under pressure Raul went out uh shubham
just came in and he came in with a lot
of expectation and on a track where
nobody succeeded to expect to exceed uh
to succeed in the on that track for the
survey big misrepidation where he
dropped there so this time again now he
has already been given uh one test or
another he played two innings which he
did not perform well he again will be on
Under Pressure that is a strange way of
inducting a fresh blood a decide he
should have been automatic Choice when
Rahul was clicking around should have
been eased out for some time and brought
this fellow brought in without any uh
Fanfare no he had come in he has to
perform that's the problem
hmm
all right
well there was a change in captaincy
also in Australia do you think that's
worked for them
oh yeah definitely but remember one
thing
you give credit this TV sent you I don't
want to be captain now anymore because
my uh period is over it is uh the new
capital had come in this is this will
never happen in India no by either if
anybody had taken succeeded then
everybody said oh make him a captain
forever now but here is Steve Smith
himself saying that his time is over
he's not going to be Captain a captain
I may stop Gabriel so that was a great
thing and great Sports principle uh that
is what makes other teams different than
Indian we stuck on to our post and every
body starts committing on this nobody
commented on him he was just ask a
question he replied that he doesn't want
to make Captain know anymore because of
the circumstances because Community is
not here at the moment because his
family is taking over as a captain
shepher he has been asked to take over
as a comprehensive so that is itself
shows what sort of team that is what is
their mental makeup our we people fight
who will be Captain who will be Vice
Captain who will did not who will be
coming one down who will be coming too
down who will be opening that is our
system when we win everything is okay
but the moment we lose everything falls
apart and we start to decide to see the
difference and I think Steve Smith made
a lot of uh difference he said
dearest his understanding of the IRS
went to appeal when not to create and
where so many changes which he brought
in falling in bedding and also a
confidence he gave to them the team so I
think that just but remember one thing
it is whether one match cannot we
connected but we cannot say that one
match has changed the whole complexion
of the city foreign

type of saying until we get out in the
middle but um yeah it does look like a
good Wicket and you're still happy
playing three Spinners it's a different
approach for the Australian side yeah it

we've brought back shami now there's
been a long time between the end of the
last test match and and the start of
this one is is that good does it allow
you to forget what happened does it how
does that work for you yeah no I think
it's all it's always nice to have some
time off uh understand what we did right
what we did wrong uh just to regroup you
know as a team always nice to have that
time off uh you can reflect on so many
things as well uh but yeah we prepared
really well for this one hopefully we
can get what we want here and your take
on the surface you're playing on today
yeah I mean not not the surface uh what
we saw in the first three test matches
it looks like a very good pitch I don't
know when it's going to start turning uh
but yeah looks a good pitch obviously I
hope it stays like that uh for all five
days because you're going to match
second of course so well done well
Android Take Care thank you right there

Steve Smith has won the tells on this
momentous occasion Australia will bat

thank you
thank you
now these are perfect pictures these are
fantastic moments that you would want to
relive lifelong because it is the
presence the mighty presence of the
Prime Minister of India honorable Prime
Minister of Australia as well free
Narendra Modi is there and the two prime
ministers walking side by side and a
short while back a moment that touched
our hearts was the fact that both the
prime ministers were holding the hands
of the two captains and it was a
wonderful gesture because at the end of
the day what matters is Brotherhood what
matters is camaraderie yes sport is all
about struggle about Deadlocks where
nothing seems to happen in spite of much
effort but the moment you start to enjoy
results start to follow that's exactly
what those Smiles that's exactly what
those gestures are telling us sport is
the biggest metaphor sport unites people
sport gives you hope where once there
was only Despair and that is what
honorable prime minister of India
Narendra Modi has always highlighted is
always highlighted that sporting culture
is something that has to be imbibed in
the Indian fraternity that is the reason
we see Halo India that is the reason we
see Keller India University games that
is the reason we talk about the
importance of Mighty when you talk about
this Stadium Narendra Modi Stadium this
can accommodate one lakh 10 000 people
and more it can accommodate one lakh 10
000 people and more look at the energy
look at the ferva look at the Enterprise
it is absolutely mind-blowing the two
prime ministers are there the two
captains were there champion of
champions Ravi shastri is the one who's
taking them and giving them a good tour
of the memorabilia as we can call it
they have been talking about the
pictures there they've been talking
about history and we have Revisited
history and when you speak about the
greatest test rivalry why are we here
why are those two giant figures there
it's only because we are talking about
the Border gavascript trophy ladies and
gentlemen welcome to Fourth Empire again
and how many story
for you and that is the magic of sport
in absolutely
ground is quite historic because
Australia and India we are celebrating
the 75th year of friendship but let me
tell you Australia was a dominant force
between 99 and 2007 and 2011 it was this
ground where we beat Australia in that
semi-final game in that quarter-final
game to uh and and with the the Prime
Minister walked past that picture you
know India uh the entire team holding
that World Cup trophy in 2011. so that
was the moment here we ended the
Australian reign in World tricky
because Cricket today is a religion
prime minister along with this
Australian counterpart
taking a round of the stadium the crowd
is ecstatic seeing both the Prime
Minister uh at this particular venue the
toss has happened Stephen Smith decided
to bat first
a good decision considering that there
will be spin in a couple of days well
done to the two captains and well done
to the two tall figures they're the
respective prime minister the two
countries
taking a round of the stadium a stadium
which is named after the prime minister
here earlier on also went on to
encourage both the captains holding
their hands and showing that Sports is
nothing but good spirit
this is uh a great moment for Indian
cricket as well as the Indian
relationship and equation with Australia
off the field like Harsha bhogly said
their chemistry and their Association is
an example of friendship and on the
field there is healthy rivalry and
that's exactly how it is supposed to be
once again these are stunning visuals

Prime Minister on that
cart or buggy whatever you want to call
it it's a golf cart which has been

Minister and the Australian leader

is on his three-day visit to India today
now he'll be here till the 11th of March
prime minister Albanese will be
accompanied by Australian Minister for
trade and tourism Senator Don Ferrell
and Minister for resources in Northern
Australia Madeleine King as well as
other senior officials and a high-level
business delegation as well now this is
albanese's first visit to India as the
Australian prime minister and he's of
course said that India and Australia
have historic opportunities to
strengthen our relationship I'm being
joined by Economist sharath Kuli thank
you for joining us this afternoon sir
we're talking about Australian prime
minister visiting India several trade
deals are also on the cause we're
expecting cooperation on the lines of
trade to take place
firstly sir two aspects of this at a
time when a lot of digital transactions
are taking place several countries are
resorting to a rupee as well and using a
local currency for a trade uh do you
think that would be something that could
be discussed in this particular meeting
well after
the CPA the economic cooperation Trade
Agreement has come into Port from end
December so uh you know you know
obviously the Australian prime minister
and India for that matter they want to
capitalize on this and then take it to
the next level
and uh you know we should not forget
that the indo-australian uh trade uh
total trade volume is about 27 to 28
billion dollars uh and India has a
negative uh trade balance towards
Australia
and we import about 17 million dollars
and we export about a little more than
10 billion dollars most of the Imports
constitute of mining strength of
Australia which is poking coal and a
little bit of wine here and there some
food product very productive so and so
forth so I think uh the Australian
government and the Indian government and
the the two heads of the government
would try and take it to the next level
because it's a free trade agreement
where most of the Australian Imports
about 85 of them in the first stage and
then three to four percent in the next
stage they will be having zero import
Duty so I think they would like to
capitalize on that and this is this is
very pertinent Arty because Ever After
covet the Australian Chinese relations
went power
and the moment Australian Chinese
relations went Tower I think Australia
was looking at the next Asian giant was
in India for making it straight like
step forward so I think the the visit is
very very important very significant and
I think this is this is a stage for
where both the Nations can enhance they
trade relations to the next level as far
as India exports Pakistan most of
exports constitute uh finished product
some of these are pharmaceutical
textiles and other mixed uh stuff but I
think as you rightly pointed out India's
might in the digital world India's might
in the fintech and we saw Singapore uh
you know you know uh facilitating a part
of Indian fintech for the diaspora I
think India would like to push forward
its Financial technology to Australia
the UPI system the famous UK system
which has now become popular across the
world I'm sure Australian prime minister
would have a lot to carry from here
apart from the tour that is baking trade
and tourism tourism as well will be will
be on the focus
India to Australia Australia to India
then of course we should not forget
about the students you know about four
five million citizens being sent by uh
spent by Indian students to study in
Australia so some kind of an arrangement
like UK where you can walk for two years
as a student uh after after qualifying I
think we can we can also look at some
kind of agreement being is uh being
being reached with Australia uh during
the visit party for more such videos

a clean energy a clean energy green
hydrogen you know these sectors are very
vital sector at a point of time when the
entire world is attempting hard to do

these steps India and Australia are
taking both the countries are a very
responsible member of the International
Community both are democracies both have
shared values shared interest shared
opportunities shared challenges and
obviously trade links between India and
Australia Auto grow even further and it
is it is also likely there are some
reports suggesting that uh India
Australia might update their
relationship and a comprehensive
economic partnership in agreement level
relationship this could be you know uh
uh uh both the countries may have after

inmates are made it is good for the both

going down and down right China you know

of the student Federation of India SFI
that barged into the Asia Net News
office in Kochi they shouted slogans and
they also allegedly disrupted the news
operations at Asianet the SFI claimed
that Asianet had quote and could faked
the interview of a minor girl last year
in connection with a news report on the
drug Mafia story they also put a banner
saying this establishment is an insult
to the Civilized Kerala State the police
arrived at the office soon after and
filed a complaint at the
at the police station the SFI members
have been booked under sections 143 147
and 149 of the penal code
that's the big story that you're
tracking for you there are allegations
and counter allegations in fact The
Newsroom the news office of Asia net
which is a media organization from down
south from Kerala was vandalized was
attacked and the attack has been
initiated by the SFI
give me details about this attack when
did this happen uh what was the reason
that the SFI came out in large numbers
attacking and vandalizing the news place
or at the latest that we're getting
megha is the fact that there were some
members of the students Federation of
India that allegedly invaded the Asianet
news office in ernakulam in Kerala uh
this incident took place approximately
at 7 30 pm on Friday evening which is
the 3rd of March what we've been given
to understand is that there were at
least a group of 30 SFI members that
entered the Asia Net News Regional
headquarters they in fact forced their
way past security guards as what reports
and sources are telling us and also
interfered in press operations of age of
of Asia Ned by yelling slogans and also
threatening the staff members as well as
journalists it's important to understand
megha that the SFI of course is a
student branch of the cpim and the
Asianet news office has accused it is
Accused by the cpim of manufacturing
news regarding the alleged sexual
assault if over 10 girls students at a
school in Northern Kerala so this of
course is the background to what exactly
has transpired now visuals on our
television screens right now in fact are
from the Asianet office in all the
latest that has taken place SFI members
in fact also tied the derogatory banners
in front of the Asia News headquarters
right right before the Kerala producers
there were any police action that has
been taken thus far
or let me know what we've been given to
understand up until now is that there is
a complaint that was made by uh the Asia
Net News resident editor and um uh the
palari vatam police have initiated an
investigation which has been given to
understand megha is that there at least
30 members that have been charged under
IPC sections 143 which is unlawful
assembly 147 which is rioting as well as
149 which is forming an illegal assembly
for the prosecution of a common object
of murder now the allegations of course
have been bad by cstv footage also that

to wait and watch but all of the Nations
quickly if I talk about Delhi State they
have seen this thing and it has been
proven at this political party with the

analogy in fact uh you know the ahmadni
party is also now uh campaigning in
Karnataka and they are also planning to
campaign and of course fight elections
assembly elections in a number of states
this year uh do you think that you know
this lack of focus perhaps towards the
areas that they are already governing
has also resulted in the mismanagement
that we see
foreign foreign
goes with the Delhi State and they want
to contest in different uh States in

speech itself so it is a competition in

[Applause]
when I started my legal career India
just started to assimilate with the
world economy post-liberalization and
globalization was all the rage
I am a direct product of a globalized
economy I got to study in the US and UK
and I've worked in New York Tokyo Hong
Kong and then in India with an ease not
even contemplatable a decade before that
but it also meant I did same kind of
work in all those jurisdictions there
was a rush for standardization of
products and services that got marketed
not only in its country of origin but
also the rest of the world
but we have seen shifting Sands in last
few years
the political slogans for localization
especially during covid when we saw
several countries face tough economic
situations grew quite sharp but the
interdependencies between economies have
grown so rapidly in the last few decades
that a complete de-linking is neither
desirable nor possible as a result we
are living in what we call a globalized
world localization which is a word a lot
of even the audiences ask me what does
it mean it's a combination of
globalization the words globalization
and localization
it is used to describe a product or
service that is developed globally but
is adjusted for use or consumer in the
local markets
19 vaccine that was made in India is a
very good example of how globalization
and localization interact with each
other how the r d that gets created in
one country can be used effectively to
reduce costs and make it accessible for
a large number of people
localization has grown even more in
significance due to climate impact to
fight the negative effects of global
warming we need a global movement which
is attuned to responses by local
societies to these challenges as a
result the Indian legal profession is
also once more adopting to this new
phenomena
the next three days we will hear from
our panelists as to how the Indian legal
and fraternity and the global fraternity
is realigning itself to This Global
change in their practice areas
in closing I want to remind everyone of
a silent auction that's going to be
conducted starting tomorrow in the
conference for the benefit of ipro Bono
a not-for-profit organization that
provides legal help to victims of sexual
assault
please do participate by remembering
that it's for a good cause we've won
this conference to be also be considered
unparalleled for the amount of money
lawyers raise for a good cause
we undertook this cause drawing
inspiration from honorable Chief Justice
of India
who has through his judgment speech and
action furthered the cause of
inclusivity in this country
in a recent speech Justice Chandra Chu
said the rule of law have understood and
implemented properly is a defense
against oppressive structure such as
patriarchy castism and ableism
he's made the two-finger test and sexual
assault survivors in offense he also in
his judgment upholding a single woman's
right to abort an unwanted pregnancy
between 20 and 24 weeks recognizes
matter to rape
thank you justice chandrachu for your
forward-looking judgments
[Applause]
finally I would like to extend a world
welcome to all of you to join us next
three days of the conference which is a
work of a great amount of hard work in
love and you know we promise it's going
to be an intellectually engaging Beast
thank you very much
foreign
for setting the tone not just for
today's evening but for the entire
conference now I would like to ask Mr
Tushar Mehta the solicitor general of
India to deliver a special address Mr
metha began his career as an advocate in
1987. he was designated as a senior
advocate in 2007 by the Gujarat High
Court he was appointed Advocate General
of India in 2008 and additional
solicitor general of India in 2014.
thank you so much for joining us Mr
Mehta please join us on the dice
[Applause]
at the outset I tender an apology for
being late my apologies to my Lord the
Chief Justice of India and all of you
my lord The Honorable Chief Justice of
India our iconic
chief justice justice Chandra tool
Mr Wilson
to gracious ladies
Miss Lubna shuja and purvi jothani
my dear friend
Miss Jane
Justice Sanjay Karol
ladies and gentlemen
the event of glocalization
could not have been organized in a
better venue than in India because India
stands
the idol glocalization point for the
entire world
friends since last few years
the world has witnessed a remarkable
progress
in variety of areas
so far as India is concerned
it's Progressive
its succeeding lips and Bounds
it has spread its wings in all spheres
of life
and is now a chosen destination as an
economic Powerhouse of the world
we have our own local manufacturers
local products local services and we
contribute
globally as well
so far as economic
Powerhouse is concerned
since last about
five to seven years
there has been a remarkable jump in the
Indian industrial sector
and
in different sectors of small and medium
Industries
the resultantly
in the index of ease of doing business
India has got
a sudden jump in
is now crossing the 79th mark
as compared to where it started few
years back
we have 100 percent
FDI foreign direct investment
through automatic route
that's not something which is glaring or
relevant the most important and
remarkable part is
during covet pandemic when finances were
draining from rest of the countries of
the world India recorded maximum
foreign direct investment even during
those trying things
when we talk of glocalization we
necessarily talk
of contribution of local products and
contribution of those products in the
global economy
friends we have started
digitization in a very big way
as a nation there are two very
remarkable schemes called digital India
and startup India
we have today in India 115 unicorns with
a cumulative valuation of over 350
billion dollars
and India is the third largest startup
economic ecosystem of the world today
digitization has played a very Dynamic
role
and has placed Indian citizen into the
world map
we have
750 million mobile internet users as on
date and India is adding one internet
user every second
that's the impact of globalization
a local man selling local products or
discharging some local Services is now
connected with the globe with the global
business look Global Services
Etc
very importantly
when we talk about
India as a destination we necessarily
talk about the
the human birth
the the people of the country because
more and more people in the world are
investing in India investing their time
their energy their ability their
technology Etc
to ensure that the country is safe and
healthy
India has the largest
Insurance scheme in the world called
ayushman Bharat
which
encompasses and covers
500 million people
which is more than the population of
European Union
it's completely cashless it's complete
completely seamless and it's completely
paperless
that's the impact of globalization and
the goal is to ensure that an Indian
citizen not only contributes to the
global manufacturing or Global Services
but also can compete at the
international level and international
players come here and utilize
human capacities in India
friends the best part of globalization
the best example of globalization
along with local manufacturing was
witnessed when we faced one of the most
serious crisis a human kind has ever
faced namely covet
except one or two countries no country
had their own indigenous vaccine
India could produce two local vaccine
India
gave 2.2 million doses
to its citizens
and administered
total vaccines and please listen to this
figure carefully India
vaccinated people and administered
vaccine doses globally locally
manufactured to the population which is
2.5 times the total population of United
States and European Union put together
but that was our globalization Drive
we believed in vasudeva kutumbakam
namely the world is our family and we
not only vaccinated each and every
Indian citizen
but we also helped several Nations by
supplying vaccines locally manufactured
here in India
that is one of the marvelous examples of
glocalization
now coming to the role of
law
we have made several statutory changes
we have made several legislative changes
we have several legislations like
insolvency and bankruptcy code we have
reduced the corporate tax we have
several other Provisions we have
discarded several laws which came into
conflict and used to clog our legal
system
and now the ease of doing business and
ease of getting Justice delivered has
become very faster and effective
the judicial system under the very very
able leadership and stewardship of
as I said the iconic Chief Justice of
India justice chandrachood has also
adopted digital digitization in the
process of dispensing Justice
one of the great great example is
digitization of the entire court record
we have complete e-filing there is no
physical filing most of the courts are
paperless
and the Judiciary as an institution of
judicial governance has utilized and
adopted artificial intelligence and
machine learning in their respective
processes
the Supreme Court has very actively used
artificial intelligence and machine
learning in its dispensation and we have
a scheme called suas which is Supreme
Court
software again
under the remarkable leadership of The
Honorable Chief Justice of India which
has the capacity of translating the
judgments as well as legal documents in
nine different languages
this is what we are doing to ensure that
the common man knows what the highest
court of the country is ruling
to protect his fundamental rights
online dispute resolution is
growing online dispute resolution
records our commitment as a nation that
the resolution of dispute before the
dispute occurs is more important than
its resolution after the dispute has
occurred
friends
we have yet to hear the wise words from
my Lord the Chief Justice of India and
other dignitaries to graceful ladies
I'll not take much of your time I once
again tender my apology for being little
late I attended an apology my lords uh
it was some unforeseen circumstances
which resulted into a little delay on my
part kindly pardon me for that and I
wish you a very happy evening today and
always thank you so much
[Applause]
thank you so much Mr Mehta I would now
like to invite Mr Marcus Rios the chair
of the international law section of the
ABA to come up to the podium to deliver
a special address Mr Rios is a partner

dear distinguished guests and
authorities dear friends and colleagues
I should have spoken with the organizers
to let them know that I usually need a
step up to these things because people
in the back probably won't see me but at
least you can hear me
um
first I want to say
namaskar
good afternoon

Hindi so far but I'll be staying here a
few days so I promise to learn a little
more
my name is Marcos Rios as I was
introduced I'm a Chilean lawyer I
practice corporate and M a lawyer in
Santiago Chile and I chair the ABA
international law section before I go
any further
for those of you scratching your heads
and asking yourselves why is a random
Latin America chairing a U.S Bar
Association
let me clarify to you that you don't
have to be a U.S citizen to be admitted
or be admitted to practice in the U.S to
be a member or a leader of the ABA or
its international law section
also let me tell you that the annual
dues for non-us lawyers are very
affordable so I'll be taking your
registrations right after the conference
now joking aside for those of you who
may not be familiar with the ABA and its
international law section let me tell
you that the ABA has over 4 000 members
worldwide it's the world's largest
voluntary professional association as
well as one of the world's most if not
the most influential Bar Association it
has all sorts of influence in the U.S
political system in the U.S legal system
for example it is the sole qualifier of
law law schools uh for to be admitted to
you to the to the bar in the in the
different states in the U.S it is also
the it has also set the rules of
professional conduct that are applicable
throughout the United States it provides
in-depth in research of every single
candidate to the U.S Supreme Court and
into hell and and members of the ABA are
called for hearings in the U.S Senate so
it is one of the most important legal
institutions in the world
the international law section our
section the international section as I
like to call it is the international
branch of the ABA we have approximately
12 000 members from over a hundred
countries
um and we have 55 specialized committees
divided in substantive practice areas
and also geographic regions

work on legal Publications International

that our members business is our

accomplishment of an important goal of
the international law section
our members from India had been growing
substantially in the past few years so
when I was chair-elect I made it one of
my goals as chair to bring the ABA to
India
I must say however that there is no way
that this conference would have ever
occurred without the great Fortune of
having
number one the two co-chairs of the
international sections India committee

nature
who will not take no for an answer
and who are true examples of strong
Visionary kind and effective leadership
you truly are among the best leaders
I've encountered in the section thank
you for your outstanding Vision
motivation and hard work and for making
this happen

possible at all without the huge
institutional organizational and
logistical support of Jindal University

amazing Jindal team for your

honorable chief justice Chandra child
honorable Justice Michael Wilson
distinguished guests ladies and
gentlemen distinguished panel good
evening I am absolutely delighted to be
here today with you all for this um
fabulous event
and very pleased to be here in New Delhi
to kick off the ABA India conference
2023 with an evening to celebrate our
different cultures as we look at Law in
the age of globalization it's my first
time in India I'm really enjoying myself
you have a beautiful beautiful country
the food is fantastic the weather is
amazing and I don't want to go home
but as you've heard my name is I'm the
president of the law site of England and
Wales and we represent the solicitor
profession which has over 200 000
members
at the Law Society in England and Wales
we regularly engage with the UK and the
Indian governments as well as the Bar
Council of India and other trade and
professional bodies and we do that to
promote collaboration and knowledge
sharing between the two jurisdictions
this is an important relationship to
both legal professions here in India and
also back home in England and Wales
the UK and India already have strong
ties in numerous areas such as trade
laws and policies that go back centuries
we have seen growth and development on
both sides and these ties have only
strengthened through mutual support
Indian trade including its legal
industry has ventured into various
International jurisdictions over the
last few decades
the UK has remained a welcoming
destination for Indian business
and this is not only reflected in the
amount of collaboration and professional
migration that continues and strengthens
between our two countries but also by
everybody who is here tonight taking
time out of their busy Diaries to travel
here to acknowledge the importance of
forging Global legal relationships
as you will all know this conference and
the timing of this conference is
opportune for us given the ongoing UK
India Free Trade Agreement negotiations
the seventh round of negotiations took
place in February this year only a few
just recently and we hope that the
agreement will deliver meaningful
outcomes for Legal Services
we have extensive experience in legal
services reform in the UK as well as in
regulating an open jurisdiction
we are ready to share our expertise to
support the discussions between our
respective governments
our current prime minister Rishi sunak
has reiterated the UK's commitment to an
agreement with India
and your government shares that same
commitment
I am so pleased that we can build on the
current momentum
to Foster further ties with the
indo-pacific region these are exciting
times for the UK India trade and
investment relationship
back home in England and Wales we have a
very open and international legal
environment
we are proud to be home to Legal
professionals from nearly 100
jurisdictions and we have a are a base
for over 200 foreign law firms
this openness to International Talent
has helped to turn our jurisdiction into
a global leader with legal services
adding a total value to the UK economy
of 60 billion pounds
it has also brought skills and expertise
into England and Wales which were not
otherwise found domestically
and it supports greater consumer choice
business outcomes and economic growth
finally it has supported inward
investment we know that companies have
greater Comfort making Investments when
they can access legal services that they
are accustomed to working with
many Indian lawyers work in the UK and
there is no reason to believe that India
may not enjoy similar successes as a
legal jurisdiction in the future indeed
at the current Indian government has
consistently told the world that it is
open for business and the jurisdiction
is becoming increasingly welcome to
foreign organizations and investment
now is the time for both of our
countries to engage around win-win
opportunities to benefit our businesses
and our citizens
as I have said at the beginning of my
speech the Law Society of England and
Wales is the representative body for
over 200 000 solicitors we are their
voice
we drive excellence in the profession
and we protect and Safeguard the rule of
law and indeed protecting the rule of
law is one of my presidential priorities
during my year in office
the Law Society Works globally to
protect lawyers who face intimidation
and persecution simply for doing their
job and we strive to maintain rights for
all
the law site is always paid an active
role in defending the rule of laws
supporting lawyers at risk worldwide as
president I am continuing this proud
Legacy in addition to fiercely
protecting our rights at home
this is much like the work that is
currently being done in India on
upholding the values of Liberty and
freedom and combating gender
discrimination
we would welcome collaboration on these
issues I'm sure everybody in this room
will agree that anyone who has the
talent the ambition and the capability
to join our profession should be
welcomed and able to progress as far as
their skills and drive will take them
diversity is a strength and an asset it
leads to better decision making and
stronger businesses
before I finish I would like to turn to
the theme of law in the age of
globalization
convergence of India and the West
India is one of the world's oldest
civilizations but it's only been
independent for 75 years
in the last three quarters of a century
India has progressed immensely and it is
now the fifth largest economy in the
world
India is a country of enormous
opportunity
and there are the chances for
collaboration not only with the UK but
with Nations all around the world
we look forward to working with our
partners in India to increase investment
harness the power of new technology
and seize the benefits of its innovative
Workforce environment
I look forward to building further on
the collaborative and supportive
relationship shared between our two
countries May that relationship continue
to prosper and grow
thank you
[Applause]
thank you so much I would now like to
invite The Honorable Miss Justice
Michael D Williams to deliver a special
address just as Sir Williams was
appointed as a judge of the Hawaii
Supreme Court in 2014 prior to being
appointed to the Supreme Court Justice
William served as a circuit court judge
for the Hawaii first circuit and
previously served also as the Director
of the Hawaii Department of land and
natural resources
Aloha which is what we say coming from
Hawaii and Namaste they mean essentially
the same thing recognizing the beauty in
each human spirit and in particular I
want to say how honored I am to be here
with the solicitor general of India and
I'll apologize for a request that I
would be making later in my remarks and
it's of course an honor to be with Chief
Justice of India
what a a wonderful opportunity and as
well thank you for your address Ms shuja
it was a great to hear about the the
power that's coming from
the England and Wales and Marcus Rios
I've heard a lot about you now I get to
see you in person and I'm also excited
about making this request with the
representative of the international
section of the American Bar Association
and
Ms jatani I think we're going to be
together on some panels and I look
forward to being with you as well but
let me say that um
I think maybe it was destined that I'd
be able to speak to this audience with
this eminent panel because of a requests
that I'm going to be making having come
from Hawaii but having come from Hawaii
via two institutions that have shaped
our culture and this is a story of
glocalization in those two institutions
are the Supreme Court of India and
Jindal Global Law School
I should say as well that the one of the
most remarkable legal Minds a powerful
India person who I've had a chance to
have some shall we say life coaching
from is pratibha Jain who we've all seen
in action and it's so exciting to come
from Hawaii to see that but to get to
the point
keep in mind that Hawaii you've all
heard of it the most remote land mass on
Earth and if I were to look inside your
mind as sort of the collective human
consciousness and ask you what's the
ideal environment on earth like most
people on Earth you'd be thinking about
Hawaii
but we have had a problem that can only
be solved
through the international
legal system through the rule of law and
that's a problem having to do with our
future because
our natural resources are very much in
an emergency State we are having trouble
with our drinking water supply and as
you probably know because the sea level
rise it's likely that we'll lose our
beaches in the future so we have to
reach out internationally and we had
that challenge and through some
rather fortuitous circumstances uh
uh Vice Chancellor Kamar came to Hawaii
with
Justice SWAT to enter Camaro and that
led to having two
Chief justices of the Supreme Court of
India Justice takar and Justice Chandra
Jude come to Hawaii now how many times
you think we've been visited by a member
of the Supreme Court of Hawaii or the
chief justice so you're starting to get
the point so Hawaii
started an environmental Court
and you had the greatest environmental
Court in the world the green tribunal
and your justices came to Hawaii to help
us and that empowered us
in Hawaii
not only that we have had the direction
of the law the actual
decision making of the Supreme Court of
India that I had the pleasure of helping
to put together the global judicial
Institute on the environment which is a
group of justices from around the world
organized under the United Nations as
you can tell with the focus of
environment and so in looking at the
case law looking at the judicial
decision making there is no more
powerful
no more Visionary and no more proven
leadership than the Supreme Court of
India and of course we all know
we all all know that now it's being led
by somebody that by all accounts is a
leader for the the world judicial
Community but especially Hawaii
so now we've gotten to the point and
I'll conclude by saying
there's an interesting kind of
discrepancy a certain amount of tension
between some courts in the United States
and I've had the privilege of speaking
to Justice
Arjun secrete about this who also
blessed us with his presence have spoken
to other members of the Supreme Court of
India some of which are here about this
kind of tension because at the federal
level I'm at the state level state
supreme court where I've been for a
decade or so and before that a decade or
so at a trial level
at the federal level there's a movement
away from the direction that India is
leading the world judicial Community
because our courts are becoming more
restrictive
allowing less access to the court
particularly if it comes to issues
dealing with the environment on the
other hand
although I know there's a rather large
caseload for the courts of India it is a
reflection on the confidence that the
people have and there aren't the same
barriers that are erected by your court
your court is much more welcoming your
court also has providing been providing
leadership on rights that deal with the
environment that have helped Hawaii so
we now have case off from Hawaii that is
now the most Progressive I would say
excuse me I'm on the court so I'm giving
myself a little bit of credit but most
Progressive and in line with the courts
of India the courts of Europe so this
glocalization the idea of becoming
International
brings me to my request and
Mr solicitor general thank you for your
powerful address looking at what Indy
has accomplished looking at what's
taking place with technology looking at
what's taking place for the development
of the rule of law and with the great
minds behind the international section
of Mr Rios and I wouldn't put this
burden on the Chief Justice of course
for reasons it'll be obvious when I make
this request but so we have had a great
alliance with India our court our state
and maybe we're at the point of
glocalization the point of the
development of the international law
where
you might consider
is it do you think it might be possible
for to Hawaii to become a state of India
if you don't
and I know it's very presumptuous but if
you don't mind speaking to Prime
Minister Modi if you'd like to come to
Hawaii first
so you can sort of see what we have to
offer you know if you could keep an open
mind that'd be great but it's a real
honor to be here and I look forward to
the presentations I I have one you know
on Sunday at 2 30 if you can help us
work out this international law issue
Aloha and namaste
[Applause]
thank you so much Justice William and
now I would like to invite The Faculty
coordinator for the ABA India conference
2023 Professor Shirin worthy to join us
she is going to be reading out a message
on behalf of the Attorney General of
India Mr R venkatramani who is supposed
to be here but can physically join us
today but he's taken the time out to
send us a wonderful message Shireen
please
foreign
law in a globalized world greetings and
warm regards to the friends across the
Atlantic the lack of my physical
presence be compensated by all the
warmth and wishes that I can gather to
welcome you all for both an intellectual
Delight an abundant Hospitality that
would remain forever with each one of
you
I assume that we are Christopher
Columbus of law in 21st century and with
mutual understanding and contemplation
we will be able to go beyond lines drawn
by Cold Wars of yesteryears and
divisions of race and Crete The
Reluctant ages of comparative law are
dead the colonial hegemony on legal
systems is giving way to Shared
exchanges we are in the midst of
transitions which are unprecedented in
human history the global impacts on
lives of All Peoples calls for new
engagements on Justice delivery and
Justice Administration law as an
instrument of limited trade and
commercial interest has expanded Beyond
yesteryears visions and perceptions the
Cold War era has disappeared but assumes
new forms of conflicts conflicts among
nations surrounding economic and
resources control are apparently Beyond
entrenched ideological positions
migration of peoples and capital are in
heady mix of technology and science the
development School of Economics with an
eye on unlimited planetary Supply is
undergoing birth Banks the right to
equality claims varying from Nation to
Nation Assuming New Dimensions domestic
governance institutions and political
party Hues are exposed to challenges not
easily resolved the human rights
dialogues and demands have added facets
that transcend National Frontiers while
law concerning trade Commerce and
contracts continue to evolve both by
common law questions and constitutional
impacts as well as World Trade
Organization framework the most
important question will be how do we
envision A Brave New World where equal
regard of all and equal access to all of
primary resources are in short from laws
domestically applicable to meet specific
needs of each country to laws partly
common to all humankind we are drawn to
evaluate the least common denominators
of all laws several human demands on law
for special attention many of them like
dignity privacy cultural amalgamations
are not answered by past understanding
there's a conservative backlash across
the continents against religious
encroachments thus law making active
people's participation in governance and
intervention by courts will in order to
cope up with challenges need to ask her
to unasked questions
I understand the Constitutional courts
are entrants into governance matters in
a big way tectonic shifts in court
driven changes are new to our
perceptions on Montesquieu can we have
constitutional theories Beyond Thomas
Jefferson can we have social mediations
institutionalized many such questions
crop up with the dividing lines between
political Theory philosophy and law
becoming blood let me invite you for a
rich treat in Bharat with its ancient
heritages and cultures the planet Earth
is our mother it has withstood mindless
onslaughts and Explorations all to meet
humankind's ecological imperialisms law
is has worked on command and control
mode the adversarial adjudication model
cannot and should not be the only
framework of Law whatever one may do to
trim its unproductive edges or fine-tune
its processes it will still fail in
delivering justice to all in state of
ease and comfort Continental exchanges
are thus important I'm sure you will be
back with rich rich memories are

distinguished colleagues from the
Supreme Court who are part of the
audience here
and
distinguished in righteous and
participants in this conference
I'm delighted to be inaugurating the
American Bar association's India
Conference of 2023
particularly because I also learn from
what Mike said a short while ago that we
could be actually wielding our
jurisdiction and article 142 of the
Constitution to have a more productive
Association of Hawaii with India perhaps
I've had the occasion earlier of
speaking at ABS conference in 2021
but I congratulate the organizers for
bringing together leaders from across
the legal community over the course of
the coming weekend
so pratiban
mrtani my heart is congratulations for
putting together such a brilliant
conference with your colleagues
as I began to think about think about
this year's conference and its subject
which is low in the age of globalization
convergence of India and the West
sort of dawned on me that in many ways
our constitution the Indian constitution
is a prime example of glocalization even
before we ventured into the age of
globalization
while the Constitution was framed in a
world which was starkly different from
the globalized world in which we
presently live
it is no secret that the drafters
carefully reviewed the Constitutions of
several countries and learned from their
experiences whether it was in the
context of the due process of law
or a variety of constitutional Concepts
which have now become a part of our own
tradition
the
Chief Architect of the Indian
constitution Dr ambedkar's explained the
importance of global engagement
in the process of constitution drafting
when he said
one likes to ask whether there can be
anything new in a constitution shame
that this hour in the history of the
world
he said that just before the
Constitution was adopted
more than 100 years have rolled over
when the first written Constitution was
drafted
it has been followed by many countries
reducing their constitutions to writing
what the scope of a constitution should
be has long been settled
similarly what are the fundamentals of a
constitution are recognized all over the
world
given these facts all constitutions in
their main Provisions must look similar
Dr ambedkar further added that the
Indian constitution was not merely an
inspiration from the global discourse
but was based on the local aspirations
of the country
when he stated
that the only new things if there can be
any in a constitution framed so late in
the day
are the variations made to remove the
fault lines and to accommodate it to the
needs of the country
in that sense our constitution our
founding document
had a combination of both the global and
local and produced a uniquely Indian
local product
while the Constitution took inspiration
from the global the course of
jurisprudence and law that it chartered
was innately rooted to India
as we discuss
this seven decades later
there is no doubt that the constitution
was a transformative force in our
society
the Constitution was grounded in our
social and political context
while also trying to incorporate Global
practices
however what has changed over these
seven decades
is the fact that we are in in an
increasingly globalized world
now not only do the meta lessons flow
across borders as they did 70 years ago
but our day-to-day lifestyles are
influenced by the happenings across
oceans
our age has consequently led to our
practice in terms of laws being more
interconnected than ever before
beat in terms of data protection as we
draft our law
or in terms of our jurisprudence on
insolvency
or arbitration
the impact of comparative jurisprudence
is continuously rising and evolving
of course there is nothing surprising or
spectacular about this journey
rather
one of the most innate human Tendencies
is to learn from others
this is what has enabled our species to
evolve and thrive
the extent of her being interconnected
is obvious from the breadth of the
topics which will be covered in the
conference itself
hence I begin by congratulating the
organizers in the manner in which they
are covering over 25 sub-topics under
this theme
the law has
in a sense served
as a global currency of trust
in our globalized world
and I borrowed that phase from what a
distinguished judge of the Singapore
Supreme Court Justice sundaresh Menon
has said in a recently published book
called transnational commercial disputes
in an age of anti-globalism and pandemic
the book is
so they described the law
as a global currency of trust
globalization has in that sense created
a new transnational Marketplace
and in the introduction to the book
chief justice Menon says
that if legal rights can be considered
the new currency of trust
then it follows that our own legal
Frameworks have become the National Bank
in which we can Safeguard and realize
those rights
so far so good
but we are equally cognizant of the fact
that globalization has led to its own
discontent
there are a number of reasons for this
for the Meltdown which has been
experienced world over
in democracies which were liberal
and which we today
May wonder whether they are liberal
especially in the context of the
jurisprudence which their courts are
evolving overseas
there are numerous reasons for the
Meltdown which took place
an anti-globalization sentiment as it
were
overseas
one
I think the first of the origins of this
lay in the terror attacks which took
place in 2001.
India was
shaken up sporadically by these Terror
attacks as we were
several years ago in the previous decade
but 2001 was a watershed moment
which brought to the global Society the
Stark realities which India had already
confronted for years and years before
that
the second I believe was climate change
and the impact of climate change
across the world
whether it is in terms of the changes in
the monsoons
the changes in cropping patterns
the spread of disease
and the impact of climate change on
farming communities on fishing
communities
across the world which threaten the
existence of the most of the most
marginalized groups in our societies
climate change is not something which is
therefore
an elitist notion but it recognizes the
impact of something which starkly faces
our societies especially communities
such as those and
Coastal Nations
and Coastal States
which would be seriously affected by the
impact of the pandemic
the third I believe
is the impact of the covid-19 pandemic
which forced Nations to shut their
borders
and to pull down their shutters
the pandemic
gave rise to an urgent need to look
Within
close ourselves to the rest of the world
as travel was restricted
as communities as communities
struggle to survive
the fourth
reason for this Global meltdown
I believe is in the rise of inequality
across the world
because just as globalization produced a
larger pie for Nations
and a reduction in poverty across the
world
equally the share of that increased by
which devolved
on the lower half of the population
was far less than the share of the pie
which is consumed by a fraction of our
populations globally
and this rise in global inequality
was perhaps one of the
reasons for the reaction that you face
world over
to the rise
of not globalization but localization
movements
whether it be in terms of politics
or economics
or the historical evolution of our
societies
as a politician in the UK said
a rising tide
seems to lift all the boats
it now seems he said
that the rising time seems to only lift
the yachts
now how do we ensure as professionals
and how do you ensure as thought leaders
that this assessment of globalization
is rising the yachts and not the boats
is replaced by a model by which
it's the boats which rise and I think
that is really the challenge which we
face
but I do believe that
the covid-19 pandemic gave us
opportunities
in darkness
and discontent
because the history of the human race
lies in our ability to rise above
discontent
and to see beyond Darkness even if we
cannot see within Darkness
and covid-19 really was in that sense a
game changer for Humanity
as I will shortly tell you it has
created a new paradigm
for Humanity of which we are all apart
and then how do we as lawyers how do we
as judges respond to the challenges
which have been posed to us in a post
covet Society
I call it the post-covet society in the
optimism and human and Humanity survives
on optimism that there would be no new
variant of the virus which will come to
us one day
but even if it did I do believe that we
are more prepared now than we were ever
before
but I therefore think that
there is something that kovid has done
to us
it has produced first and foremost
a digital Marketplace
where we've realized the importance
of working Within
we all live together we work together we
survived in a Marketplace of ideas
together
kovit taught us that we could live
isolated from each other
but is that a sustainable model
or do we need to go beyond that
by creating an agenda for sustainable
development
an agenda for sustainable development in
terms of the environment
an agenda for sustainable development in
terms of our interpersonal relationships
is
an agenda of a state for sustainable
development
in terms
of the Frameworks and the regulatory
Frameworks which we create as we move to
a more sustainable future in our
societies
when the Constitution was drafted
with which I began a short while ago
our constitution maker said
possibly no ideas of the lines along
which Humanity would evolve
we didn't possess Notions of privacy
there was no internet
we didn't live in a world which was
controlled by algorithms
and we certainly didn't have the social
media
for every little thing that we do
and believe you me as judges we are no
exceptions to this
because for everything that you do you
face the threat of being trolled by
someone who doesn't share your point of
view
we live today in an age where people are
short on their patients
and they are short on their tolerance
they are short on their patience which
is a reminder to me to be brief
but people are also short on the
tolerance because
we're not willing to accept
perspectives which are different from
our own
so just as Humanity has expanded
with the global Advent of travel and
Technology
Humanity also has retreated Within
by not willing to accept anything that
we ourselves as individuals believe in
and I believe that's the challenge of
our age
some of this is perhaps the product of
Technology itself
truth has become the victim in an age of
false news
with the spread of social media
something which is said as a seed
germinates
into virtually
a whole Theory
which can never be tested on the Anvil
of rational science
but the grave danger which our societies
do then face
is the danger of not being able to
combat
what we have now set forth
a change which
Humanity has brought in terms of the
Advent of Technology
but which is perhaps flowing out of our
control
but having put you on guard of the
pitfalls of the world which we live in
let's also dwell on the positives as
well
one of the great benefits of the age in
which we live
the age of globalization and now
with the problems which we have faced
the inward looking localization the need
to promote local welfare
is a creation of an international rule
of law particularly in the commercial
context
and our profession the profession of
lawyers the profession of judges
has been of central focal point in
generating the creation of an
international rule of law
we have created an international rule of
law
by developing International instruments
as we did after the second world war
whether it was in the context of the
convention on
civil and political rights
the convention of economic social and
cultural rights
and then of course a whole host of
specialized conventions
whether it was the convention on the
elimination of all forms of
discrimination against women
of the convention Against torture
or the convention against racial
discrimination
and these conventions have therefore
created
an Avenue for domestic jurisdictions
worldwide to adopt
an international rule of law
and embody it within
as a framework for an evolving domestic
rule of law
so in that sense it has given rise
to the internationalization
or the international germination of
domestic law
at a certain level we have looked at it
from a comparative context
so for instance in Fields as diverse as
whether
we should have the right to privacy as a
constitutional protected right
or in more commercial context
such as the Notions of fairness and
equality
and fair procedure in commercial
arbitrations
we have embodied within our own legal
framework International principles
which were grounded in a broad framework
of Rights
certainty
and the legal aspirations of a just
International order
but equally there's a reverse
Trend which has been taking place
which is a constitutionalization of
international law
just as we have had International
borrowings into the local context we
have had the export of domestic ideas
into the international context
so what we have written within our
systems has become a part of a wider
International dialogue across continents
and borders
we live in an age where there is a
seamless flow of capital
across boundaries
there has always been a movement of
human beings across boundaries
thousands of years ago there were no
political boundaries
human beings could flow seamlessly
across
continents
as political boundaries grew
there were restrictions on human
movement but globalization produced the
seamless movement of people
but above all I think our age is marked
by an internationalization of ideas
and this internationalization of ideas
is truly
something which holds hope for us as we
emerge from the darkness which was cast
upon us
between 2020 and 2021 in particular
as I speak to all of you from our legal
community
let me tell you about how technology has
been Transforming Our Lives
in the profession which is so close to
my life
as a judge of the Supreme Court
namely the profession of judging
the covid-19 pandemic give us little
option
the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
of India then spoke to me and said
we have to pull down our shutters
tomorrow
how are we going to ensure that we will
run Bales to people who are in distress
who have been arrested
how to ensure human Liberty
we had in place a robust technological
infrastructure in nearly 18 000 courts
in India
we had desktop computers and every
courtroom
and I said to the Chief Justice that we
had these desktop computers in every
courtroom and we could just use them to
start video conferencing
so we started some video conferencing
in a very gentle way and then expanded
it across
all the courts in India
what video conferencing has done as a
consequence of the pandemic
is that it has led to a decentralization
of Justice
and I think this decentralization of
justice is an important Paradigm in
promoting greater access to Justice
of course at a certain level it has
promoted judicial efficiency
but it was also promoted a sense of
Equalization of social opportunities for
advancement
the Supreme Court of India is not just
the Supreme Court of
New Delhi
the Supreme Court of India represents
the aspirations of citizens in the
smallest villages
and what better way to reach out to our
citizens
than to use technology as a part of our
mission to take justice to the doorstep
of citizens
so far from technology really being
something very complex
the back end of Technology as complex as
it can be
but the front end of technology is
something which we have to utilize to
reach out to citizens
so that we reach out in terms of
providing all our services
the colonial model of Justice was
premised
on common citizens reaching out to
Justice if you look at the architecture
of a great colonial buildings of Justice
these colonial buildings which provided
justice during the colonial regime
were intended to be architectural
Marvels
but they were also intended to wreak a
sense of awe and fear
in the minds of citizens
you would have a big silver mace which
would be placed at the front of the desk
of the judge
if only to remind the citizen that the
power of this mace could be used on your
life if you didn't fall in line
now that model of justice has to change
of course those buildings are our
heritage
but the model of Justice which those
buildings embodied in the colonial era
has changed
we still operate a penal code of 1860.
but while we operate the penal code of
1860
our interpretation of the penal code has
changed
it was a very beautiful book written on
the descents
of Justice side Mahmoud
it was one of the distinguished judges
of the allahabad high court
the law in the British era was that
if the accused was not present before
the charge
it was yet open to the judge to decide
the criminal appeared on the absence of
the accused
by reading the papers themselves
we then reinterpreted our criminal
procedure code before the right of a
hearing became a part of our law in the
criminal procedure code of 1973
by interpreting it to mean
that there can be no justice to the
accused unless the accused is personally
heard by the judge and you cannot
condemn a person to The Gallows or for
any term of imprisonment unless that
person is heard
so we have
changed through a process of creative
interpretation
the colonial model as it were
and now it is for us as succeeding
generations to use the benefit of
technology and creative interpretation
to reach out to our citizens
as part of our mission in the e-courts
project
we are on the Anvil now in the Supreme
Court of making e-filing Universal every
case would be filed in the e-filing mode
our e-filing module is undergoing a
security audit
but we will have to train our own
lawyers our law clerks the clerks of the
lawyers
because there is an internet divide and
we don't want anyone to be left behind
in the Advent of Technology
we have launched into a very ambitious
scheme for digitizing records across
India in all our courts
we've already started live streaming
Court proceedings
our constitution bench hearings in the
Supreme Court are live streamed
the benefit of live streaming is to
reach out to citizens
on the flip side citizens will realize
how boring the processes of hearings in
the court can be
but in telling them of how boring our
work sometimes can be
we are sending out a message to our
citizens
that in the smallest cases which we
decide of somebody's pension of
somebody's job
of somebody's disability compensation
we take every little case
seriously
and that sense which emerges therefore
from the use of Greater technology in
terms of live streaming
is to remind our citizens that we exist
for you
and to promote access to Justice and to
realize access to Justice
by involving the citizens in the
participatory
role
as people for whom Justice is truly
intended
there are 30 000 judgments of the
Supreme Court 34 000 judgments of the
Supreme Court since 1950.
each of these judgments was available in
English
in the official report which is the
Supreme Court report
which was woefully behind time
the result was that all the judgments of
the Supreme Court were put across to the
legal profession by private publishers
who would use our judgments
to create beautiful headnotes and then
offer them for sale to our citizens I
have no difficulty with it because they
did a great job
I've used those reports both as a lawyer
as well as the judge
but what we have done recently is to
digitize the entire 34 000 judgments of
the Supreme Court
we've provided a free text facility a
search facility
and each of these 34 000 judgments is
now available free of charge for
Citizens across India
you have law colleges in India which
have no resources to purchase law
reports that's the harsh reality of
India we have at one end the Brilliance
of the national law schools
which sustain all the top law firms in
the country but we also have the base of
the pyramid
but there are no books or no law reports
they have no resources
now there is I believe a duty on all of
us as members of the profession to reach
out to them
Because unless we reach out to citizens
who are at the base of the pyramid
our mission
as leaders of the profession would not
really be fulfilled and it is in that
spirit that I mention these facets to
all of you to give you a sense of being
sensitive to the issues which the large
base of the profession faces
apart from the East Supreme Court
reports
we've launched a new project to
translate every one of our 34 000
judgments in every Indian language which
is recognized by the Constitution
already close to 3 000 judgments have
been translated into Hindi
and these have been
made available to our citizens
now mission to translate judgments is
Guided by one object that you must allow
citizens who don't know English
and certainly not legally is English
that we write and speak off in the
courts talking of ejusdum generous and
actors and nemanam grab a bit and so on
and so forth
we have to allow our citizens to
understand the work which we do in a
language which is known to them
and we are using artificial intelligence
and machine learning
through a product which is being
developed by the IIT the Indian
Institute of Technology at Madras
for the purpose of disseminating our
judgments
just last week in the course of a
constitution bench hearing we had
real-time transcription of the arguments
which were made
by lawyers on all sides including the
Leonard solicitor general
so the arguments which were made before
The Constitution bench were reflected on
a screen in the court real time by the
end of the day the arguments were
cleaned up cleaned up not cleaned out
but cleaned up
and then once the lawyers had said that
the arguments were fairly accurate or
completely accurate we decided to open
them up to the community
so this is a limitless source for people
to understand legal strategy to teach
legal strategy to law students
to show them how constitutional cases
are evolved in a court
what is the process of legal reasoning
which our courts follow
because the output of a judge I do
believe is only a tip of the iceberg in
what emerges as the ultimate product of
the Courts
we are moving to papal escorts
courts where there would be no paper at
all in fact as a matter of fact
all of us five judges in the
Constitution bench didn't use a scrap of
paper
we were completely in a digitized format
and we had the entire case load on our
laptops
we have adopted virtual courts for
dealing with traffic offenses
it's the smallest summary offenses so
that the work which was done by say two
dozen judges can be done by a single
judge monitoring a server
now all these initiatives are crucial
for instance what do virtual courts do a
shopkeeper who keeps their shop open
beyond the regular hours and has to pay
a paltry fine to an inspector doesn't
have to waste a day to attend a court to
pay the fine
or somebody who wants to contest a
traffic ticket doesn't have to go to
court to pay the fine
all that you have to do is that you log
on to the server if you want to pay the
fine you pay the fine and the case is
struck off
the cause list of pending cases
so technology in that sense enables us
to reach out and to change the profile
of the law as standing somewhat apart
from the rest of society
but apart from technology there are
vital issues which confront the
profession today
Chief among them is the reform of the
legal profession itself
in so many ways
our profession is still patriarchal
our profession is feudal
are professionals built upon kinships
and relationships of community
not to speak of closely monitored clubs
clubs of friendship of Association
the law firms in India
were at the Forefront of become becoming
equal opportunity employers
the reason for that was that when we
generated the new national law schools
there was this inflow of Highly talented
young lawyers who had to be absorbed
on a meritorious basis for employment
the law firms had a very valuable part
in India
in creating opportunities for women and
men and others
and by giving them a Level Playing Field
to work on an equal footing irrespective
of parentage of ancestry of religion of
caste of community
but that spread of equal opportunity is
still to devolve on the mainstream as it
were of the legal profession of those
who practice in courts
seniors in our profession still do
believe they don't believe that it's
necessary to pay young lawyers
proper wages
the attitude is that you've come to my
Chambers to learn what do I pay you for
that model is really an obsolete model
in the in the age in which we live
and unless we democratize the process of
recruiting young people into law
Chambers in India
our profession will continue to remain
futile in its mindset
and we would not be open to allowing
the truly Brilliant Minds to come into
the legal profession
I'm often asked about why we can't have
more women judges in the Supreme Court
than we have
why can't we have more High Court judges
from amongst the women that we have
and my answer is not simple
the answer is a little complex
but I hope it has a germ of Truth
the state of our institutions today in
terms of inclusion of diversity
reflects the state of the profession
say two decades ago
because the judges who come into the
high courts today
in 2023
or the judges who come into the Supreme
Court in 2023
reflect the state of the bar
at the beginning of the millennium
now unless there was a Level Playing
Field for women to enter the legal
profession and to thrive in the legal
profession
between 2000 and 2023 there's no magic
won by which you will have more Supreme
Court judges drawn from amongst the
women in 2023
so we have to create a framework a
groundwork
for a more diverse and inclusion a more
diverse and inclusive profession today
if we truly have to create
a future aware
our profession will be more inclusive
and diverse
but there is cause for hope
recruitment to the Judiciary in India
is drawn from the bar as
to the high courts and of course to the
Supreme Court but recruitment to the
Judiciary in India is also drawn
directly through the district Judiciary
into the higher courts
the statistics today on recent
recruitments to the district Judiciary
in India at the lowest level indicate
that in many states
over 50 percent going up to 60 percent
or more are women
now the cause of that is a spread of
Education in India
as education has spread in India
women's education is
caught up
and there is today a perception
on the part of the middle class
the growing middle class in India that
the key to prosperity of the Indian
family the average Indian family is to
educate your daughters
now how do we convert that potential
into promise
it's not enough that we have this young
Talent emerging out of our law schools
into the legal profession
but how do we ensure that these young
women don't fall by the wayside
either because of the fact that they
their roles changed as life went on
if it is for us to create conditions of
dignity
in terms of the people we recruit
into the legal profession
so I conclude by then saying that
the importance of the conference which
you've organized
and I thank the IBA for bringing this
conference to India
is at various levels
it's about sharing best practices
it is about the spread of ideas
it's for creating interpersonal
relationships
and I do believe that
bringing this conference to India
reflects
the fact that India truly
is a focal point today
in the global Marketplace
not just of business
not just of Industry
not just about knowledge not just about
technology
but in the spread
of new ideas
and when I hear statistics about
startups
about unicorns
I think what's most important about that
is the power of the young
our country is reaping the demographic
dividend
we are a young Society
and in the young society that we have
lies
the prospect for
hope
that there will be change
so just as I began my lecture by telling
you about
some of the darkness which pervaded US
just two years ago
I do believe as an
eternal optimist
that our society the Indian Society
would lead from the front
as we
aspire to be a more inclusive and
diverse Society
I didn't have my watch and I am not sure
whether I exceeded my time thank you

Bi0T2cAhgT4,NIA Attaches Hizbul Terrorists Property in Kashmir | Terrorist Basit Reshi Under Scanner | NewsX,NIA Attaches Hizbul Terrorists Property in Kashmir | Terrorist Basit Reshi Under Scanner | NewsX #nia #hizbul #newsx #kashmir ...,2023-03-03T07:39:21Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Bi0T2cAhgT4/hqdefault.jpg,"the Nia is continuing its Crackdown on
his bull terrier wrist his bull
terrorist Basit rishi's property has now
been attached by the Nini has attached
to the property of this his bull
terrorist in baramulla we will take you
through several details of this big
Crackdown on terror that continues Ajay
the Nia has attached the property of
another his bull terrorist Basit Rishi
is this uh taking place in sopor Ajay
can you confirm
well yes a pattern is the exactly area
where this busy it's a property have
been seized by the Nia with the motive
to ensure that every link of the
terrorist has to be honored from the
German Kashmir as uh you know
Administration and the government wants
peace a full jump in Kashmir hey this is
the sixth such property seized action by
the Nia and the state investigation
units here in the German Kashmir special
investigation units uh they have seized
three houses and the properties of three
terrorists of Jammu and kashmiral group
which was banned recently by the
minister of Home Affairs and now the
properties have been seized in the
rampant and today this terrorist house
has been deceased by the Nia and
yesterday another action was taken by
the team of Nia when House of uh House
of uh uh
you know
yesterday in Sri nagar's area
so it shows that how action is taking
place here in the German Kashmir to
ensure that every Terror link has to be
you know decimated here in the German
Kashmir because earlier what was
happening that those who have joined the
terror ranks their properties their uh
uh their other things they basically
that remains intact uh uh with the
family and the with other people and
which basically uh you know helping the
terrorism in the survive I believe that
that's why authorities are ensuring that
whosoever is having the terror links
they have they have to face the
consequences and that's why uh this
action was started by the uh by the
investigation agencies that they are
attaching and seizing the properties of
the terrorist and uh Terror those who
are operating from Pakistan or those who
are sitting or behind the you know bars
in the German Kashmir right absolutely
and at the same time Ajay the Nia says
that this particular man Basit Rishi
this terrorist he planned and executed
an attack on a police guard post uh
on 18th August 2015 in which one police
Personnel and a civilian were killed and
he is as per reports presently in
Pakistan he is also a designated
terrorist under the UA uapa so many
charges against this
well uh see there are very clear-cut
instruction and their clear-cut uh you
know instruction to the ground forces
those who are dealing the terrorism the
German Kashmir that those who are having
guns in their hand they have to be
neutral neutralized by the security
forces and those who are having the
terror link they also have the face the
consequences this basically was the
active terrorist and carried out to
attachment a police person and his son
was killed in the past and uh that's why
you know uh this section was has been
taken by the Nia that every Terror link
has to be Unearthed by the agencies as
to to completely bring back peace in the
German Kashmir and that is what
basically happening in Germany Kashmir
that back to back six property of six
terrorists have been seized in last two
weeks in the German Kashmir ramban Doda
and Srinagar shopping these are the four
locations where six properties have been
seized and our sources are saying that
more than 100 properties of such
terrorists will be seized in the German

KWUr8KrZ14A,QUAD Foreign Ministers Meet in Delhi | Time To Define Indo-Pacific Principles? | NewsX,QUAD Foreign Ministers Meet in Delhi | Time To Define Indo-Pacific Principles? | NewsX To Subscribe our YouTube channel ...,2023-03-03T04:49:37Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KWUr8KrZ14A/hqdefault.jpg,"India is hosting a quote for ministers
meeting in the national capital today
the meeting is underway as we speak
external affairs minister Shankar is
chairing the meeting while foreign
Ministers of Australia Japan and
Secretary of State for the United States
of America are all in attendance earlier
this morning the Japanese foreign
minister also arrived in the national
capital to attend the corn meeting in
person so of course it remains to be
seen what will be the key highlights
that emerge out of this squad meeting I
have with me Professor Madam nalapada on
the broadcast professor and I also have
with me a Minto Ambassador Suresh Kumar
goyal let me begin this conversation
with professor professor we have been
discussing an indo-pacific Charter on
news X once again given that the squad
foreign Minister's meeting is taking
place what is it as per you that India
now really needs to push forward in
terms of an agenda for a new world after
a pandemic and hopefully soon in a
post-war situation as well
well devika I'd like to point out that
uh in in India in New Delhi uh
fortunately not at the level of the
Prime Minister Modi or external affairs
minister jayashankar but other levels
there is still a certain amount of
Romanticism going on
and you know talk of no let's have an
accommodation with China let's do well
let's let's get into an understanding
with them uh we can go back sometime
somewhere to Hindi Chini bye bye the
reality is this is absolutely Living in
a Dream World the quad has value only if
it is a security construct whether it is
a all the other matters can be discussed
only under the framework of a security
construct because that construct alone
will give the court the cohesion the
coherent and frankly the entire setup
that is needed to combat every one of
these other problems so I think it's
important the India United States Japan
and Australia and here I'd like to say
the Au Claire is not India anymore it's
Australia which frankly is very cozy
cozy where the China under the new
dispensation it's important for these
four democracies to come together to
understand that security is at the core
of stability in the global order and the
court which needs to be the guarantor of
of security and stability in the
indo-pacific unfortunately the the South
China Sea has been almost entirely taken
over by China uh the terror the
territories of several of the countries
in the indo-pacific have been liberal
that by China the air and sea space of
several countries the fishing rights the
other Maritime rights of several
countries have all been called opened up
by China and frankly if the the court
has so far played the role of an
onlooker it's time for the court to be
active as Prime Minister Modi correctly
said let's not only look East let's act
East well let's not only look like a
court let's act like a chord I am
hopeful that Minister Jay Shankar and
his three other colleagues will be doing
this and I'm very very happy that the
Japanese foreign
minister did not come most likely
because he and the South Korean did not
want to join the the other G the the G7
members
in basically creating a scene if I may
say so at the G20 meeting the Japanese
are very polite people the South Koreans
are very polite people that's the Asian
Heritage and therefore they kept but at
the same time the Japanese respect India
and that has been shown by the foreign
minister coming for the board meeting
all right Professor stay on with US
ambassador same question to you sir what
do you think in and out really needs to
be pushing for as far as developing
certain new principles guiding
principles foreign for a new world order
is concerned
babies are that's a very complicated
question really because it's not a
question of what India wants it's a
question of what is possible under the
current circumstancy then India
Australia Japan and USA came together in
Quad uh as professor malpa says Squad
was a security of security oriented
security driven uh Concepts as a
grouping uh the issue is that what do we
mean by security
also made very very clear that the
security as far as what is concerned
does not necessarily mean military
Security in fact for the military
Security USA later came on with another
grouping called awkward the security and
the quad goes to many different areas
Health security energy security
connectivity secure Maritime security
Etc and these are all very very
important issues that is point number
one uh at the India has been
contributing in all the areas in terms
of even humanitarian relief generally
Etc and there's been excellent work as
member of court in this area number two
points really here is
became necessary after those aggressive
and assertive action by China yes in the
area and one has to deal with all those
things uh for India the problem is not
limited to Chinese aggressive and
assertive actions in indo-pacific but
they also expand towards our Continental
borders yes China is now delivered and
Beyond these two front so we need to see
how this security
can be developed to essentially control
and restrain China's aggressive actions
in indo-pacific and in the region okay
Master goal stay on with us Professor I
will and we also have made a show with
us on the broadcast Mission I'll come
come back to you in just a moment and we
are trying to reflect some developments
on our screens as well the motivated
photograph of the four foreign Ministers
of the coordinations is now out and U.S
Secretary of State Anthony blinking has
now tweeted out saying good to break
bread with my quad colleagues in Delhi
today together we recognize the
indo-pacific region will shape the
trajectory of the world in the 21st
century and we are committed to
safeguarding its peace stability and
growing Prosperity professor nalapath
what does this then mean in terms of
like I said putting out certain guiding
principles because sir in 1941 we had
two men who met aboard a ship and they
signed eight principles in in the form
of the Atlantic Charter that then became
the guiding principles of the United
Nations that has continued to dominate
uh you know as guiding principles for
the world for many decades now given the
new reality is when we say that we are
committed towards safeguarding peace
stability and growing Prosperity how do
we now put it down into very clear
guiding principles
uh devika I'd like to point out that uh
your the news accident Sunday Guardian
were the first Global media Outlets to
talk of an in indo-pacific Charter in
explicit and comprehensive terms and I
I'd like to point out that yes I mean
you know where we talk about different
definitions of security now I remember a
time when the London Bobby the London
policeman there were no policemen with
any guns or revolvers and several of
them have been killed now times change
Concepts change and we have to break out
of the old Concepts in which there is
this kind of an aversion to talking in
terms of Alliance either we may not call
it an alliance we can call it a
partnership for democracy or for
security but the reality is security and
defense has got to underfin this
relationship the Prime Minister very
correctly recognized this yesterday well
when Primo Minister Meloni and he were
beating that defense is also going to be
a very important aspect of India Italy
relationships and uh prime minister
Meloni is fully committed to that as
much as Prime Minister Modi I'd like to
say we need a complete if I may say so a
you know a complete refreshing of of our
of our conceptualizations and our views
on the world we have seen now you
remember devika I've been skeptical from
the beginning about any state coming out
of this particular court of this
particular meeting uh not the court of
course statement will come out but of
the G20 both in the Finance Minister
ministers meeting and this and the
reality is the spoiler is China just as
Pakistan wants to basically you know
ensure that that Sark is is melted down
China wants to ensure that this year the
G20 has a deadlock because uh it does
not want India to get any credit and
that is a fact of life you must realize
we have to understand who the adversary
is and we have to understand who the
countries are that can help us deal with
it now you know what is the worrisome
development over the last several years
is that the Australia the U.S Japan they
have been coordinating among each other
and I don't know whether it's because we
don't want to or because they're not
asked to uh but we are not in the
picture
I think it's important for us to be in
the full picture the full frame where
this is concerned and in my view you
know two things are very important the
G20 meeting is important because Prime
Minister Modi and Minister Jay Shankar
very clearly enunciated the stand of
India which is the stand of what I may
call the g200 the global South they
clearly enunciated that they knew that
that would face resistance they went
ahead and India has now once again
emerged as the champion of her of a huge
collection of countries that as prime
minister said were not represented in
the G20 meeting the g200 and the second
point is uh all the four foreign
ministers meeting for the court I think
frankly devika in my view more in the
G20 meeting the more important meeting
for us in the long term and now is this
coordinating all right Professor narpa
thank you for joining us let me bring in
major Shah as well into the conversation
major Shah same question to you sir
because it's been a while now and of
course you know these uh the photographs
uh and the statements The Joint
statements all of that is very important
this is how new relations begin this is
how new blocks begin but now how do we
move Beyond stating the same thing over
and over again when we say we want to
strengthen peace and Security in the
indo-pacific like I said many decades
ago two men came together and they said
okay these are the eight principles that
we will now follow because this is what
we feel needs to happen in this post uh
you know World War II scenario given
that we have moved Beyond now it's
almost been eight decades since the
Atlantic Charter was signed how do we
now bring about new guiding principles
how do we enshrine these principles in a
way that they can actually be then
worked upon by bringing in new
institutions that reflect the realities
of today's world
reference to the Atlantic Charter after
the world war in fact it needed to be
signed at that time and this outline
Charter did come about that time so I
think it's also a time right now where a
new Charter civil Charter can perhaps
come up and not just just come up not
just by your words not just by saying
but by accident India always believes in
actions India leads the way through
actions like for example I'll give us
for example when the turkey earthquake
took place recently toky and Syria
earthquake India was the first the first
one to react and they said straight away
they immobilized the ndra of the army
the medical reps they were there the
rescue teams were there straight away
whenever there is a global crisis
anywhere India is always there to help
whether concerned India or not India is
always there to help yes that's a
different thing like any other Nation we
will give first brought it to our own
people and then of course thereafter the
humanity comes first for India beat the
F1 crisis on 15th August 2021 when
Taliban came there in the government and
that time we our aircraft went and
bailed out a lot of people from there
Prof guys are you grain crisis operation
ganga very successful in fact never you
can see two countries which are at War
stopping the war for time being a
humanitarian Corridor a ceasefire
happening because of the intervention of
a third third country similarly because
like I'll give you an example I'll give
an analogy of uh if you tell a child
that beta read books the child may not
read them but the child will not listen
to you but child will follow what you do
your actions so because actions speak
louder than words and a picture speaks a
thousand words also at the same time so
when uh when you actually do it a child
will see you before reading a book the
child will read a book a habit
unfortunately many people uh it's
missing from nowadays but again
similarly when India does a diplomatic
meeting a high level meeting like a G20
like the chord we have the right center
dialogue at the same time simultaneously
so many things were happening we had the
most ever Diplomat with its last year
and on March April we India saw a flux
of diplomats global leaders coming and
looking up to India and coming up to
India so when we actually come up we
actually take the lead by Leading by a
personal example it makes a very very
big difference and again I'll give you a
good sign for the first time after the
the war we had a we had a U.S and Russia
actually meeting face to face so that's
a different thing the Russians spoke
with and said that was no negotiation
happened and it was they were meeting
while standing but the very fact that
they actually met in one roof in one
room it was a very very good sign a
positive sign we cannot expect a change
overnight but certainly be on the right
track and by India leading the G20 I can
assure you I can watch with conviction
on first December ever since we got the
presidency of D20 I what I can see we
can see India going in a very fine way
I'll quickly conclude by quoting these
numbers and these are not the numbers
issued by the government or anyone the
other Uno numbers by the World Bank by
global organization in 1750 India was
contributing to one-fourth of the GDP of
the world thereafter from 1947 till now
we've had 950 billion dollars of FDI
162 countries have invested into India
now when countries and in the last 90
months that is a precise seven and a
half years in the last seven and a half
years our GDP once our FDI has gone up
contact it is now over 550 billion
dollars which means how fast India is
growing how far India has taken the lead
and when people the foreign countries
like the 162 countries where FDR
invested into a country it does not mean
they are only investing dollars or the
money it means they're imposing their
faith in the leadership their future
their prospects their their the
potential of the country they can
foresee the potential of a country to
grow so when India takes a lead with the
faith of all the world or all the uh of
all the all the world powers it really
I'm sure something certain is going to
come out of it many times we see in
meetings there's only angrezi there's
only talks they only are good foreign
games but nothing really happened but
here they are things moving on ground so
I feel very very proud when I see India
leading the way from the front devika
absolutely thank you for joining us
Ambassador goyer also with us on the
broadcast message thank you for waiting
patiently uh you know same question to
you so I post the same question to you
what are you saying as per you uh needs
to be pushed as far as some sort of
some sort of you know like I said a new
set of guiding principles or perhaps
even a focus on China focus on
countering this debt trap diplomacy that
China engages in what is it that we
really need to be pushed that needs to
be pushed as far as a key agenda is
concerned
that's a very good question and uh I was
listening to Professor nalpath uh where
he strongly recommended us to
and I think in that sense to choose to
go with the USA to turn one into a
military Alliance is it thought to be
really explored fully because the issue
really will then be it's not a China it
is China Russia together the relations
between the two particularly in the
issue of Ukraine and in the Pacific
incidentally Russia still does not
recognize in the Pacific they still call
it Asia Pacific
and that becomes a very complex kind of
an alignment we need to choose uh who
are going to we are going to go with but
we will need to be very clear about this
thing I think uh the question that you
ask about what to do about China
China is a very strong neighbor and it
is undoubted completely that there is a
great deal of essay between your power
between India and China and therefore we
need to deal with the issue of China's
regression and China's receptive in our
neighborhood both on the continental
border uh in the opacity as well as our
other neighbors like Pakistan and
Central Asia where China is totally
spreading is still takers if I could see
so so we need to visit China and in a
manner
to secure our own national interests and
National Security China cannot be
ignored that is certain and I would in
that case say
that the international pressure should
be on China
to become part of the international
order once again as it exists in the
sense that the debt diplomacy pressure
on the neighboring expanding Bri to
become a military kind of a connectivity
all this need to be very clearly and
thoughtfully reordered so that China
becomes part of International Peace and
Order rather than an international
expensive tendency for more such videos

as we are now enlarging our footprint
the Digital Universe and with the
excitement the drama the atmosphere and
passing the games being immediately
connected to users while they absorb the
final details and the world-class
analysis in our print edition
as you know the Hindus had a very deep
and proud tradition of Engagement with
thoughts and poor journalism we are
privileged that because of the higher
theme for the Hindu group publication
and the love and affection with both to
the decades in photon 1978 the awards
awarded by a magazine have high petition
gravitational value with both persons
being justifiably proud retributions of
this the it is the ones celebrated
figurative excellence in sport and we
hope to empower athletes and Sport
persons to continue to break new records
and greet the new particles of clothing
and we are also aware that as India is
in the midst of generational
transformation a younger generative
sports fans

foreign
after beating the unbeatable team of the
West Indies in June 1983. tonight we are
delighted because they're right here
that we have the Delight we are
delighted we have the entire 83 team of
Heroes right here with us to celebrate
the iconic moment in India's history
all the legends of 83 are here without
the televators forever International
victory that settled heart all Indian
thoughts are played with hope and
optimism they are very grateful that
they've come to another
indeed had been the greater cheerleader
all the way right back from 1978 it's
been both started a government uniquely
places a singular both magazine every
move every minute every month with
chronicled meticulously every detail
every inning every talk every thing of
the jacket has been detailed by Potter
so when it actually
but we've been fortunate because we were
a ringside witness we have all the
images and all the ringside reports
we also quietly supported all the teams
and we always invest in them players but
it's now then cricket by now Cricket
football just I think a lot of people
will testify that we have been following
people's Journeys each um
important been investing in and we have
followed the journey closely to the
decade and thanks to this whole time
not an obsession and that's because of
83.
they pulled off the impossible beating
against all the odds they found with
West Indies which had indeed won the
previous two World Cup I think that win
as everyone knows changed India at
sporting Destiny an hour and after life
forever
till then we had been very defeated as a
country very diffident about our
sporting capability timid and timoth in
our project on the global Arena when
Kapil Dave and team won the entire
Cricket World was stunned and in
disbelief to offer a flavor without
picture back then to give us this
audience a contemporary audience
attentive what a big gun what a big
moment it was involved it through
cricket history I would read from the
sport type report shortly after that
magical win at that time both are
reported that repeated press had written
up India and it started the World Cup
and that pretty pressed with a different
India actually hailed couple neighbors
colleagues as Indian mistakes Indian
mistakes who had walked through fire
the Sunday Times of Britain likewise it
coupled men turned the world upside down
and they know that very interestingly
India which was Cannon father became
Canon and that brung the biggest
surprise and then as a I did an ICT
website is also noted that India's
lifting of the world cup with Cricket
created in 1983 Cricket created Underdog
Story then during a middle couple days
fighting a World Cup in Lord balcony had
allowed countless cricketers critical to
dream and to see their own dreams
manifest into shattering New World
Records a new general Cricket in
Greater many others who have been
inspired by this epic Victory India won
against Another World Cup in 2011 but
why is 83 till the game that's always
forever acts on everyone's minds and
heart why so
because it is the first time that Indian
an Indian team actually related the
three days of being the world's number
one and that also powered up
collect itself a team gave us real
self-confidence that India could be a
major player in a big game and we could
be on the road to becoming a major
sporting power quick Cricket remains of
course a natural Obsession everything 83
now our cricket borders one of the most
richest and the powerful in the world
India become Cricket biggest Market the
Indian Premier League the IPL Cricket
new new internet exciting form enabling
Global players to compete had become the
hottest International game with auctions
attracting the very bad names in the
game and we have the 83 World Cup to
team to Dan for this rapid Ascent of our
Fortune as a protein country therefore
we are very deeply in honor that they
are going to celebrate this win with us

RT4Z3aHbHmw,&#39;The L-G is not being questioned because he is a BJP man&#39; | AAP MLA Somnath Bharti on NewsX | NewsX,"To Subscribe our YouTube channel ""NewsX"" click on the link below:- https://www.youtube.com/user/newsxlive/ Watch More ...",2023-02-27T16:51:45Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RT4Z3aHbHmw/hqdefault.jpg,"while this entire
matter continues to play on
with amarni party taking pot shots at
the BJP and vice versa
why would there be a requirement for the
government to then bring about
encumbrance to the ahmadni to the common
janta your party itself is named after
ahmadni so why why cause so much grief
and inconvenience to the people to the
ahmadni
magnaji what is happening in Delhi
it's it's unprecedented
a policy which was finally approved by
honorable LG
in May 2021
and after that
nobody had a right or a duty to look
into that policy
so I don't understand that something
which has been give which has been
approved by none less than honorable LG
how companies will be responsible for
that
so BJP is not questioning
it's on LG
on that policy
but it's questioning the process the
process
was culminated
by LG SRI Anil bazel
so Anil baijalji has to explain to Delhi
in case
policy is termed bad BJP must question
Syrian ill basil why was he not
investigated number one number two
today I was in the court myself I was a
witness to the entire proceeding in the
court
when CBI asked for five days of a remand
the the court asked that what for why do
you want Iman for what
CVI was unable to respond to that
question which was pinpointed to that
you know
that if that is the case then the
Judgment no no answers to that question
why did the special CPI code give a
five-day reminder
[Applause]
I'm going to speak about it later but
the charges that have been posed by the
CBI against against Manisha sodia is
about the contentious Provisions that
were added to draft first draft number
one of the liquor policy there were no
records of how the provisions were
included in the final draft of the
liquor policy then there are questions
being raised that the draft exercise
there have been questions about why
remained evasive despite being
confronted
and and about the six to six with a five
percent profit margin has been increased
to 12 so wherever the six percent
Kickbacks and who were they giving being
given to and what is this South Lobby
this Vijay Nair whose name has again
been sprung up during this proceedings
that were taking place the arguments and
the counter arguments in the special CBI
code so where is this South Lobby what
is the purpose of the South Lobby and at
whose behest
were the Delhi government and money to
Saudi are working when when drafting the
final uh liquor policy
see whatever you said so far yeah is
what BJP has been saying so let me let
me be
helpful to your audience
if you allow me to speak yeah okay if
you allow me to speak please allow me to
speak you're asking me to answer
so the so the master see Master question
of all questions is the one question
of which nobody is giving me response
when the final Authority
approval authority of the entire uh
policy was honorable LG SRI Anil vessel
why is he not being questioned because
he is a BJP man so BJP today need to
answer to the nation that Anil Anil
vigil shahab when he was approving the
policy after which the policy became
final then why is he not being
questioned as the mole question which
which BJP needs to answer and the
country wants to know number two
till date there is not a penny recovery
BJP did everything under the sun
possible they dig out the walls of
Manisha sotia's house they take out the
beds everything
they went to the locker of urbanization
they got they got a jhunjuna from there
they went to the parental houses of
Mississauga they got every place not a
single penny was recovered not a trail
of money was recovered where is the
money ten thousand crores so the
question is fair enough
animals
are innocent they are working for the
welfare of the people and there no there
is no wrong doing whatsoever in the
excise policy that was launched for the
2021 2022 yeah then why are you afraid
of the CBI inquiry
we are not afraid at all we have given
every access to CBI they came to the
house we opened the house they came they
went to the bank Locker we opened the
bank Locker they went to our parental
house we we opened the parental houses
they we they went to the villages we
extended all possible support we did not
obstruct CBI in any manner they asked
for the phone we gave the phone they
asked for the laptop they gave the
laptop we gave everything to the CBI CBI
today
was unable and rather ashamed of its
activities because of political pressure
they are they have to do all this but
they had no answer to any of the
questions asked by the judge in the
court in fact the memo of arrest and the
remand application of CBI both were
divide of any Merit so had it been a
normal case the judge would have slapped
them with possibly punishment with
possibly cost okay but today because the
political case so everybody is under
pressure today so I think we need to be
mindful of this that I'm saying with all
responsibility that there is not an iota
of evidence there is not an iota of
proof with CVI of any kind other than
what cook up what what stories they're
cooking up okay just to falsify
everything okay fair enough this is your
this is your point this is your opinion
this is what you're putting across to
the public through your press
conferences is and press briefings as
well all right so but you know I have
one big question uh being being a
resident of Delhi being a citizen of
Delhi being a delhiwala why is it that
every single time there is a protest
there is a dharna that is taking place
in Delhi whether it is about shine bag
and TCA protests Farmers protests and
now with all the tamasha that is taking
place between the ahmadni party and the
BJP and the dharnas and the protests and
not to mention the chaos and the
pandemonium that was witnessed in the
McD house and there is no work to show
off by the mayor because she's just been
appointed a few days ago every work has
been stoiled if you want to go by liquor
you have to end up going to Noida or
gurgaon there is no alcohol available in
Delhi if you want to get your MCT work
done your certificates that you want to
retrieve from the MCT you can't do that
why does the delhiwala have to bear the
Brunt
because today let's say MCD for example
in MCD delhiwala gave every Delhi
citizen gave the Bandit to Ahmad the
Party by giving 134 seats
104 was given to BJP which is bigger is
is BJP people are they too too poor in
mathematics 135 is bigger than one zero
four everybody knows so why are why why
they were creating cross in the house a
supreme court can you imagine Chief
Justice of India had to intervene to
make BJP understand a small line written
in the Constitution that nominated
member shall not vote in the in in any
of the meetings of MCD was it so
difficult to understand by apjp so
unfortunately today The Brute Force
which which BJP enjoys at the center
that is becoming an obstacle in the
Constitutional values of India
gave a beautiful Constitution but the
Constitution today is in danger because
if BJP is brutal force the way that you
are misusing every institution every
Authority Under the Sun in the nation
against the political opponents that is
the main reason every Delite is
suffering today the suffering of daily
diet is
doing a lot of good works okay for more

I think we're just waiting for gopal Roy
to eventually actually speak other Ahmad
political leaders are making a stunning
Revelation this morning they are saying
that several of them have not been able
to able to even leave their residence
also my colleague is joining us this
morning
what is the allegation that the Ahmad
party is making this morning they are
claiming some sort of defactor house
arrest on the basis of what
is about to visit the CBI headquarter
and around 11 A.M he will visit the
headquarter and before that he will go
to the rajkart uh earlier also we have
seen when he was uh he was asked to
summon in the CBI he went to the rajghat
along with the Sanjay Singh so the same
he is doing today also but the ahmadni
party is alleging that the uh the
leaders who want to support their leader
um are being put on the house arrest so
these are the allegations which are
being made by the ahmadmi party on the
police and they are saying that the uh
also the Sanjay Singh has tweeted and
said that the Modi police might not uh
stop the crime but they will put the
full power to arrest the Manisha sodia
he is also illiced that the leaders are
being put on the house arrest uh the
Empire such type of tricks are being

the allegation which I are being made by
the ahmadni party on the central
government and also before going to the
CBI questioning the Mani susodia has
also tweeted uh going to this API again
today will cooperate fully in the entire
investigation the love of the lacks of
children and blessing of the country men
are with us I don't care if I have to
stay in jail for a few months he is the
follower of bhagat Singh bhagat Singh
was also hanged for the country this is
just a small thing if I went to the jail
so this is something which is being said
for this several times they've expressed
apprehension
uh of Manish sodia's arrest this is not
the first time the last time also he was
questioned by the CBI the same
allegation was made by him and by his
leader arvind kejriwal that this will be
used
to basically concoct an arrest now
that's the argument on the other side
remember there is both a CBI inquiry
going on into this matter and an
enforcement director inquiry going on
the CBI inquiry is of course
investigating
criminality is
regarding this they have yet so far not
named Manisha sodia in their preliminary
chart sheet which was of course filed a
couple of months ago the Ed inquiry of

Indian origin Ajay banga to head the
World Bank as its Chief Ajay banga is a
former CEO of MasterCard and he will
succeed David malpas who was to retire
in April next year but has announced
that he will be stepping down early the
reason for jabanga's nomination for the
post is believed to be his experience in
handling Global challenges including
climate change so this is a big
development that is taking place
internationally is of Indian region and
he has now been he's the first Indian
origin American to hold the post of the
world bank chief
we will try to bring in an expert on
this particular development but this is
the latest that we're tracking for our
viewers uh U.S President Joe Biden has
now nominated Indian original jabanga to
head the World Bank as its chief
as I mentioned earlier viewers ajabanga
is was the former
MasterCard CEO and his position for the
World Bank president
comes after David malpas decided to step
down early from the post sharath Kohli
with us on the broadcast uh Sharad Ajay
Banger's nomination to lead the World
Bank is of course making headlines and
rightly so this is a huge step he's an
Indian original person who will for the
first time be leading the World Bank
undoubtedly devika I mean it's a it's a
it's a giant leap for uh you know I mean
not that Indians have not excelled
internationally before I mean if we can
have a vice president of the United
States has offended origin we could have
the prime minister of United Kingdom
who's an Indian uh I'm not very
surprised but then it just uh you know
reiterates the confidence which the
world has in India's intellectual
capabilities and the power of Indians to
lead big organizations like World bank
now we all know World Bank is is you
know exactly what is its role how
important is World Bank with regard to
the world economy we all know that so I
think foreign
you know facing Global challenges on
world economy and so and so forth I
think I think a perfect plan and I can
tell you that World Bank from here on is
going to have a better life ahead
because you're going to see more black
practice more students nothing being
given by World Bank uh because we often
see World Bank name IMF you know
sometimes their decisions come up the
questions and you start wondering what
was the basis or what was not the basis
for that matter but I think within India
and command you're not going to see any
of that it's going to be a very prudent
and a very pragmatic a very sensible
very rationalistic decision making uh
from the World Bank a matter of Pride
and the fact that the U.S president
himself nominated him I think that shows
the pride of confidence Mr Biden has and
you know I have been saying that it
comes the beginning that today if
Indians disappear or in the people of
Indian origin that disappear from
America American tech industry American
businesses will come to a standstill
because they are being run by an Indian
brain I think this only vindicates my
stand which I've been taking for very
long time that if Indians who run the
biggest economy in the world and now
it's 10 India who's going to run the
biggest bank in the world for that
matter baby

the Russian president has hit out a Joe
Biden over his Kiev visit he says that
this visit will only escalate the war
Putin in his address on the first year
anniversary of the Russia Ukraine war
said that it was the West who started
this war and is continuing it by funding
Ukraine he also said that Ukraine
started the war to protect donbass and
accuses Ukraine of becoming a puppet of
the West he also blamed the west and
NATO for trying to convert Ukraine into
a nuclear state
listen it
problems
back in the 1930s they led the way for
Natchez to take power in Germany and in
our time they started building
anti-russia from Ukraine it's not
nothing new people who know a little bit
of History they are perfectly aware of
what's going on it can be traced back to
the 19th century it was happening in
austro-hungary in Poland and in other
countries with the only goal
to take away these historic territories
that are now called Ukraine from our
country that was their goal there is
nothing new about it absolutely nothing
they are just repeating old ways the
West expedited the implementation of
this project they supported the coup in
2014. it was a bloody cool anti-state
coup anti-constitutional coup and it's
like nothing happened like it's a normal
way of things they even informed
everyone how much money they spend on
their
aggressive nationalism as a ideology
recently one of the battalions of
Ukraine it's shameful for us to hear
they started calling one of the
battalions adelvice like a Hitler right
division that was involved in
executing prisoners of war and killing
Jews all across the Earth
and National Guard of Ukraine and
normally Ukraine
are using
and other SS divisions
who have covered their hands in blood up
to their elbows
and nature Germany on their equipment
new Nazis they are not even hiding who
they consider themselves who they
descended from
and it's astonishing that no one in the
is noticing this taking notice of this
why because they do not care they don't
care about who
all right my colleague vishali is
joining me on the broadcast to give us a
perspective on this vishali as expected
Vladimir Putin has hit out at Joe Biden
for coming into Ukraine and saying that
this will only escalate the war further
well absolutely because the statements
made by the U.S president yesterday that
they will provide all the arms and
ammunitions uh to the Ukraine and this
is something that's suggesting that
somewhere even U.S wanted this war to be
continued and uh also uh he has made it
U.S president made it very clear that
the condition of economic conditions of
uh Russia is a good at this point of
time and uh this is uh What uh we are
also learning from the poutine statement
today that you know Russia's existence
that takes uh and somewhere you print
conflict uh us is making as a global
concentration with Russia and this is
something is not acceptable and uh
somewhere the poutine has also uh made
it quite clear that now the Russia will
also react accordingly so this is
something that's suggesting that this
war will continue for uh for some more
time as the first anniversary is just
closed uh since this war started and
this is something that's very serious
because he has also blamed this entire
West Zone uh of the globe and said that
you know somewhere this West is you know
encouraging uh the the local uh
a local fight into the global so they
are more interested to uh for uh you
know uh uh and uh make it uh as a global
issue and somewhere he has completely
and strongly uh he uh take the uh how
the U.S president made commitment and uh
he is quite upset that you know the U.S
is uh basically responding uh for
Ukraine and the way uh uh U.S has made
it quite here that they are shining uh
uh with the Ukraine and actually it was
a big message that U.S has sent uh
globally that you know whatever happens
at Ukraine uh you they will pay with you
pay and will help them completely as we
all know the current situation of Russia
is almost so good the economic condition
is not so good at this point the
powerful uh USF gives a full arms and
ammunition uh the uh uh what we are
logic uh you know the
promised yesterday so if this kind of uh
this category is of U.S so certainly in
the upcoming days it's a tough time for
Russia and that's the reason why today

European mindset remark has echoed
during the Munich security Conference
during the 17th edition of the globe SEC
Forum last year in June Jai Shankar
remember had schooled a journalist with
a Savage reply and had said that Europe
has to grow out of the mindset that
Europe's problems are the world's
problem but the world's problems are not
Europe's problem the context was now
used by German Chancellor Olaf's calls
on Friday as he suggested a change in
this so-called mindset it's called said
and I quote Europe must get out of the
mindset that Europe's problem are the
world's problem of the world's problems
are not Europe's problems school's
acknowledgment of India's point of view
as mentioned by the Indian foreign
minister is of course of huge
significance it comes as the German
chances all set to visit India from the
25th of February till the 26th of
February let's quickly listen into what
the German Chancellor actually said
you know at the same time and under no
Illusions about what we can achieve for
dialogue alone also among our Democratic
Partners in Asia Africa and Latin
America
foreign
this quote from the Indian foreign
minister is included in this year's
Munich security report and he has a
point
it wouldn't be Europe's problem alone if
the law of the strong were to assert
itself in international relations
however
to be credible as a European or North
American in Jakarta New Delhi Pretoria
Santiago de Chile Brasilia Singapore
and to achieve something
it's not enough to emphasize our shared
values
we have to generally address the
interests and concerns of these
countries as a basic prerequisite for
joint action
and that's why it was so important to me
to not merely have representatives of
Asia Africa and Latin America at the
negotiating table during the G7 Summit
last June
I really wanted to work with these
regions to find solutions to the main
challenges they face growing poverty and
hunger partly as a consequence of
Russia's War as well as the impact of
climate change or the covet 19.
all right I have with me Ambassador go
ahead and also meet a shot with us still
on the broadcast Master boy let me get
in a quick response from you sir you've
heard what the German chances had to say
this is something that India has been
saying for a very long time that the
West in totality needs to come out of
this mindset that their problems have to
be addressed by the world but the rest
of the world's problems are not to be
addressed by the West at least Germany
is now taking some cognizance of this
reality and the German Chancellor there
realizing that it's important in today's
day and age for Germany to have a
one-on-one with several nations of the
world Beyond you know it just being
between the EU and the rest of the
countries but also Germany needs to take
cognizance of what's happening in the
world and what is it that Germany can do
to help and similarly rest of the
European Union Nations uh need to follow
suit
absolutely uh see what is happening
there is there are two points here there
is a clear recognition of the changing
world order from the days of the World
War II when Atlantic Charter established
a certain kind of a precedent of Europe
as was reflected also in the security
Council uh presidents of Europe over the
world really where every problem
everything that happens gave a prominent
role to Europe and therefore everything
was about problem and they had to deal
with it second thing it clearly
recognizes the refusing of the growing
role of India as an International Fair
and the recognition of the wisdom of the
work world even by eam Jai Shankar where
there is a clear message that Europe
cannot really remain to think it uh
behave in terms of its own trickiness
and provenance in the world affairs and
that there has to be a clear
recommendation of role played by Asian
countries particularly India so on the
whole I would say is a clear recognition
of the brain importance of India and a
growing role to be played by India in

Blackman has spoken out on the income
tax service that have taken place he
said that this has got nothing to do
with nothing new and this has been going
on for quite some time and he said that
it's a BBC India's job to make sure that
they follow the rules that are set up in
India and he's also said that let BBC
act and provide access to all the
records and all the information and let
the tax authorities come to their
conclusion and speaking on the
documentary by the BBC on P prime
minister Narendra Modi Blackman has once
again reiterated that the docu-series
was a propaganda piece
uh it was a hatchet job and a BBC in
fact practices shoddy journalism
the issue around the uh the review of
the BBC's tax Affairs I understand it's
nothing new this has been going on for
quite some time and obviously there have
been discussions between the Inland
Revenue here the the income tax
authorities here and the BBC obviously
this is a survey uh where the income tax
authorities have looked to gather the
evidence to establish if the BBC is
doing anything wrong I would say quite
openly it's the BBC's job in operating
within India to make sure they're caught
with the rules and regulations and I'm
sure it'll be cleared up very quickly
but you know that's that's up to the
authorities tax authorities it's also up
to the BBC to make sure they're called
with the rules that operate here
conflate the two issues at all I mean
obviously the so-called documentary
which is more of a propaganda video if
you like in a two-part series with an
absolutely disgraceful piece of shoddy
journalism with an attack on narendamori
both in his time as chief minister of
gujarats and then in his time as prime

innuendo and slurs it was should never
have been broadcast by the BBC and of
course because the BBC has a worldwide
reputation people think oh my goodness
this must be true but it was produced by
an external organization overseen by the
BBC and then broadcasters the truth well
it's far from the truth I mean it
dismissed I mean facade it actually
didn't look in detail at the causes for
the Gujarat riots 20 years ago and it
certainly didn't look at the all
important fact that the Supreme Court
had thoroughly investigated all the
claims against Narendra Modi and found
their not a threat of evidence to
support them so you know the reality was
that Narendra Modi as chief minister had
done his best to try and appeal for calm
he looked to additional police resources
not only within Gujarat but beyond and
eventually he had to call in the Army to
help sir well
Muhammad joins me back on The Telecast

7nQAxT4lmME,#The2024Plot | 3 Secret meetings full details | NewsX-TSG Exclusive,"Since the last few months of 2021, several small gatherings in London and Delhi, including in one of the embassies in New Delhi, ...",2023-02-12T12:05:06Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7nQAxT4lmME/hqdefault.jpg,"ladies and gentlemen the countdown for a
general election in the world's largest
democracy is now well and truly underway
a general election amounts to the people
of the country exercising their adult
franchise to decide the future fate
of their governance by electing leaders
and representatives to form a government
on the face of it it should be an
exercise where we see our candidates
pick one
we think he or she can best serve their
country which party can best serve
and who can best serve as the leader of
that party and then the leader of this
country but democracy doesn't work in
straightforward ways there are
machinations at play because the great
power makes people do great things
influencing popular opinion
perception
the good the bad the ugly is an exercise
that is both open in the public rallies
that we will now see over the course of
the next 365 days but also in the rooms
and back rooms where all the
machinations of Cloak and Dagger
exercises will also continue this is
part of the Rough and Tumble of
democracy which we have to choose to
accept
everything
is not at face value it is the duty the
job of the opposition parties in this
country to try every legal trick in the
book
to try and bring down the current
government
but at what point of time
do the lines get blurred
does the desperation and the want for
political power
cause us to collude
with certain entities running certain
agendas
and what could be worse
if a part of those willing to run
agendas in this country seeking regime
change intend to do so not simply
for the pursuit of political power
but from the point of view of invoking
regime change in this country and
thereby hoping
that future governments have ious can be
influenced or perhaps
to the very disturbing extent
that they can be destabilized and
therefore as a country we can be
weakened
a stunning report has come out in the
Sunday Guardian newspaper this morning
and I'm going to read it out to you it's
been authored by abhinandan Mishra and
deviantu mondal Debian is joining us now
on the broadcast and the report says
in the last few months of 2021 since
then
several small Gatherings have taken
place in London and Delhi including one
of them in in one of the embassies in
New Delhi in which persons of Indian
origin and a few diplomats have met to
discuss the broader theme of how to
impact a government change in India in
the May 2024 general elections
the Sunday Guardian has been able to
speak to someone who attended one of
these meetings according to them when
they were invited to be a part of this
group through existing acquaintances who
were already apart they were not aware
that the Gathering was being convened to
debate on the action needed to ensure
that the government is made or seized to
be made to have existed
joining us on the broadcast with more
details on this Debian do
three meetings have been alluded to by
you in this report what are the details
that you can share which you have
regarding these meetings
so rishabh you know these meetings have
started as we had mentioned in our
report sometime in 2021 uh and it is a
long effort that
put in to ensure that the uh
the government doesn't repeat itself the
present dispensation doesn't repeat
itself in 20 2024 general elections the
problem is you know there are persons of
Indian Origins as well as foreign money
being involved in the uh in in
strategizing this but as far as our
details we have been able to gather
there have been three uh specific
meetings that we are aware of that has
taken place in Delhi one was at a
private residence in moti bagh we do not
know the identity of the individual uh
but what we are told that it could be a
rented accommodation in motibag where
this meeting had taken place in
somewhere between 20 to 25 people did
attend that meeting most of whom were
not Indian citizens but citizens of uh
but citizens of different countries but
with Indian origin uh we are also told
that certain diplomats were also a part
of the meeting that happened in motiban
as we have also mentioned in our report
there is an embassy and diplomats from
that particular Embassy who were
involved in strategizing or a policy
perhaps uh for this login 24.
also uh there was another meeting which
lesser participants that happened in Ito
is what we are told at a lawyer's office
in Ito and that meeting has seen about
10 to 12 attendees uh if per se who were
mostly lawyers uh in that particular in
the third meeting of the lawyer's office
in Ito okay so Debian due to the best of
your information and I'm and and your
source is an individual who wittingly or
unwittingly was actually invited to one
of these meetings so it's a first-hand
attendee or one of these meetings now to
the best of your information from your
souls is this an ad hoc Gathering is it
incidental that a group of people were
attending a meeting and they happen to
be discussing uh you know ah
a new government in India or was it
called specifically for the agenda
of formulating regime change in this
country in the next election
so Richard the ones the meetings that
took place in India were specifically
done to uh to to go for a regime change
or to formulate policies and strategies
for regime change in India but there
have been uh meetings that are taking
place in London and in in the U.S which
at least our sources aware of uh where
these meetings are ad hoc meetings where
the Indian diasporas are invited they
are uh they then they meet their
acquaintances and people there then they
are also individuals who come to India
quite often from these gatherings that
can participate in these meetings so uh
the meetings as far as our sources are
telling us that the meetings that take
place in India are specifically for the
purpose of uh formulating strategies and
policies to dislodge the government but
the ones that do take place in London
and uh in the U.S are ad hoc meetings uh
with the Indian diaspora where a lot of
people who maybe so you're alluding that
some people are are as in the case of
your souls being unwittingly invited by
their acquaintances on a pretext
and then they are being
either lobbied or an attempt is being
made to convince them now is this then a
well-structured
Kabal a well-structured entity or are
they working on a loose a premise with
you know loose goals
well uh of course this is not a I mean a
group of people who are working on lose
goals they have they clearly have well
structured structured agendas in their
mind and they have well structured so so
uh I mean what we have been told by our
sources also in indicates that you know
there are uh individuals who are not
trusted initially to be part of the
group uh unless you know and all the
informations are not spelled out unless
you become a part of the a core group
and the internal group of the of these
individuals so what is the plan to which
we have an allusion to is this simply
about them seeking
uh
on on a democratic basis uh change which
they are free to are they doing
fundraising are they planning propaganda
initiatives in this country and abroad
what is the illusion I mean are they are
they buying up I don't know uh
advertorial space in foreign
Publications what are they actually
discussing that we have an indication of
so they are discussing you know to bring
out the policies which they think are
the ills of the government they think
that the government is uh promoting
hatred so so the main uh they also feel
you know some of the agendas what we are
told have been discussed is about you
know how the society in India has become
uh polarized so the government is
responsible they think that the present
government is responsible for that
polarization in India uh you know they
also think that the minorities are being
targeted and they are not safe in India
so so perhaps uh these are some of the
broader agendas that they are working on
and they are trying to bring in more and
more people who could act as their foot
soldiers perhaps uh during the election
campaign so of course okay this is okay
now now from what you have said in your
report which has been provided to you by
your Source now and I'm drawing now
illusions on the basis of the report
debendo
which ladies and gentlemen is very much
in the Diplomatic District of
chanakyapuri
perhaps one meeting
organized or hosted by a a foreign
Mission these are all well-heeled
individuals
these are well to do well-heeled
individuals one would assume
right absolutely uh these are not
individuals who have randomly decided oh
come on oh we wake up and decide that
okay we need to change the government no
that's that's not that's not the case
they are as you said well healed they
are well I mean they're all
intellectuals if I may say so they are
well educated they are uh people who are
working in different uh different
organizations across the world so of
course they are not uh just okay to the
best of our knowledge
on the two fronts one you mentioned
specifically in the report that there is
a specific person of Indian origin from
Texas
who flew in to India for one of these
these meetings ah now what I mean what
information can you share about who
these individuals are or who they
suspected to be
right so uh rishabh I mean as for our
knowledge that individual is a working
professional in Texas and he had joined
uh the meeting in Delhi that happened uh
and I think it was the moti bhag meeting
that the individual joined uh but uh
nothing more we know as so far but of
course these are all professionals as I
said okay okay now uh before I before a
broken roping our other colleagues now
uh
you write in your report that there is
the participation or hosting of one of
these meetings by you say a non-european
union non-nato
European country currently in the news
now anybody with some sense of logic and
allude to who that is and I will do the
illusion even if you can't
but what do we know did this was this
just a Embassy party in which these
people were attended and the and the
embassy can say listen we had no no
knowledge of what was going on and what
people are discussing over drinks is is
not our business or are we suggesting
that diplomats from this Mission were
actively involved in putting together
this meeting knowing full well what the
subject and agenda would be
well uh we can uh from what the hint
that we have is that uh the diplomats uh
maybe the top Diplomat was not aware but
certainly some of the diplomats in the
in the uh party perhaps that was
organized in that Embassy were fully
aware uh the the invitations had gone to
those people who had earlier been part
of such meetings so of course it cannot
be a random people coming into that
Embassy in a party and uh discussing
such issues over drinks so of course uh
this is not a random discussion that has
happened in that it was a well thought
out well-planned well-strategized uh
meeting or party or whatever one we call
it that was organized in that particular
Embassy okay they Mindanao just stay
with me uh Professor Madam nalapath is
also with us editorial director of the
Sunday Guardian my colleagues from
across the country raghavendra is in
Lucknow Shakti is in Patna Praveen Kumar
is in Chandigarh Naveen Nishant is
joining us from Delhi are becoming cross
to all of them to understand whether
these are happening only in specific
locations or now a greater National
effort is being put in to the best of
our knowledge knowledge so far it is
rooted around the national capital but
let me get professor nalapath in now
professional now
uh any individual or group of
individuals are free to host any dinner
or lunch that they seek to host and
discuss anything that they feel is wrong
with the country
and they would like to see improved at
what point of time or at what point
does that cross over
into illicit activity which should
disturb us
uh look uh I I would only like to stick
to the facts as I know them and Sunday
Guardian has also I know and the
research that we have done and divyendu
has brought it out it's an it's an
initial p
may I first point out that this
particular European country which has
been in the news uh for the last one
year I would say it's not only in the
Indian Embassy they have been active in
their embassies Across the Western World
embassies uh in the United States in in
the UK in Germany in France in Poland
everywhere and India has been a very
special Target of saying that look these
people I mean you know the argument is
that India is responsible for the fact
that this war on on Ukraine is
continuing and lo and behold they
completely do not mention the country
that more than 10 you know that single
country I would say 10 times more than
every other country put together is
helping Russia in Ukraine and that is
China so essentially this particular
European country is shielding China and
it's not surprising because China is now
very active in whether it's uh you know
getting older some some of the equipment
that has been dunked on them or other
things they have been very active in
that country for a very long time so
they've been spreading this Canard about
India and it's had an effect in the
United States for example you'll recall
the Sunday Guardian Canada story about a
particular you U.S Diplomat you know
weaponizing the question of visas to
Indian citizens yeah and making it
impossible to get a a U.S visa it took
as did 900 days at that point in time is
still about 500 Days yes which is
unforgivable when you count the fact
that five or six days if you're a
Chinese citizen you get a Visa no you
know in fact if I'm Indian I can fly
down to Bangkok to get a visa to the U.S
within five or six days but within India
current appointments are available for
September 2024. I want to make another
point and that is the reason why this
whole effort is taking place and the
reason why there's a strong link to a
this a particular country not a European
country a country which is our neighbor
is that in the decoupling that is taking
place the worry that they have got is
that India will rise to the level the
oecd is predicting which is by the 1930s
become you know by by the 2030s become
the biggest economy in the world okay so
this is to choke that okay well well
there are there are many motivations and
let's not assume that that embassies
here are operating only for benevolent
interest is their job to propagate their
national self-interest uh even though
that might be deluded and part of
reality I can think of only one country
which is a non-nato non-eu country
currently in the news and that happened
with the embassy in Southwest Delhi and
that's Sweden uh there might be others
but I can only think of one I might be
mistaken that there might be might be
others there are certainly a couple of
others who are looking uh currently for
European and the NATO membership are in
the current news I think Professor album
wants to make a point then I want to get
now reporters to find out what's
actually happening on the ground
if you say that
that's not Sweden if I may say so okay
people has not been very much in the
news this particular country has been
very much in the news right over the
last one year okay and not only that
it's foreign minister it's
um an other senior uh policy figures
have many times uh been quite negative
and nasty about India because of India's
okay very simple style well well you can
you can guess that leaves whom who is
non-u non-nato but might be seeking to
join both at this point of time I'll
leave that uh to the best guest of the
of our viewers you heard emphatically
who it's not now let me get my colleague
Naveen into this conversation Naveen
you've been investigating this on the
ground uh what is uh how seriously is
this being taken now that this news
report has been has been published
foreign
[Music]
the reason is the tricky matter is
because
if political entities within this
country are doing meetings and coming up
with whatever strategyms that they
choose that are within the Realms of the
law
to propagate their interests in their
agenda they are free to do so in fact
it's their job to do so
but if they are seeking a betting
Orca voting
with foreign people having a foreign
agenda then we should be rather
Disturbed so let me go across to
Abhishek my colleague in Mumbai Abhishek
we have to then draw the assumption
ah that it might not be limited
to just a couple of meetings in delhi
now uh from the conversation that you've
been having from your sources now how
seriously is this matter not being taken
where you are in Mumbai
um
[Music]
if it's if it's political parties in
this country holding whatever meetings
perfect legitimate exercise if it's
foreign Nationals and foreign agenda is
being run then we should be deeply
Disturbed so I'll request you now to
follow up on this story out of Mumbai
okay okay and and find out whether this
is Delhi has been the only epicenter or
attempts have been made to infiltrate
and create this this cabal in Mumbai as
well let's hop across to a couple of
other state capitals before I go to Mr
Money
uh who's sitting on the broadcast with
us as well uh sakshi is joining us in
Chandigarh sakshi now uh so to the best
of our knowledge in the report the
information which has been provided by
The Whistleblower as has been written by
deviandu is restricted to three meetings
in Delhi ah but of course simply the
meetings in Delhi do not a national
campaign agenda made where you are in
the capital of two states uh what is the
investigation uh being done what are you
hearing from your sources now
um
you know I'm going to request you that
you know now you follow up in Chandigarh
whether there is any knowledge where the
consulates in Mumbai why the council is
operating out out of Chennai for various
foreign missions not for the specific
foreign mission that seems to be under
the radar right now and this would
happen to be a foreign Mission which has
received Aid and assistance from India
and of course there are certain people
looking to Prime Minister Modi to help
them out at a larger International level
so please uh sakhi please follow up on
this let me head across to another
Capital Praveen kumara joining us from
do we have any information further to
what has been published in the Sunday
guardian of any other meetings outside
Delhi that have been taken place or are
potentially under investigation
now you follow up on this okay because
now we need to understand whether this
is just just a wine and cheese cabal
could well be we don't know
that that's all they do or indeed is
something more Insidious effort because
I again repeat political parties
coming up with whatever
confabulation that they can but if
they're working in cahoots with an
international cabal which is seeking to
enforce regime change because it feels
that that would therefore create a
different situation for India's
strategic interests is fundamentally
mistaken India strategic interest will
remain India strategic interests so ok
now let me get RVs money into this
conversation
Mr money I'm sure you've had a chance to
read the report okay
it is troubling but how troubled should
we be should we consider this that this
is a mission
that is propagating an interest here and
they're having their wine in cheese
cabal and that's that will be the end of
it or should we be more concerned about
them than lobbying support in other
foreign countries putting in efforts to
create International crises for India
by running this cabal
uh it cannot be dismissed as a wine and
cheese cabal or a meeting or whatever it
is see you have to see the Bharat jodo
yatra had been there and this is
happening around the same time
concluded and you also have overseas
Congress and having a very close
relationship with the Auntie India
basically
the entire country is behind one man and
a particular set of political groups
whether it is from the left-link
liberals or whether it is X or Y they
are singularly hating one person you
cannot hate a person and ask for a safe
change of leadership in the public
mandate is something different
and that particular parties or those
people have set up people have have a
record of indulging is inviting foreign
Ministers of the UPA times ex-minister
of UPA type and he had been hosted in
the former vice president was also to be
attending that meeting is it not
disturbing and it is not simply overseas
this is not oversimplifier okay I just
want to focus the conversation a little
bit okay so so
which is in disagreement with India's
strategic position so it is a matter of
very great what could they possibly do
because the common layperson question to
you sir is I'm hoping you can hear me
the layperson is a question to you is
that what can a country do to influence
a major general election in this country
what could they possibly do
was BBC documentary not an attempt to
influence the voting pattern of the
alienating the one particular alienating
one particular chain of the population
was it not an attempt by whatever wrong
doing whatever illusion was being
propagated there it is something like
that these type of information Warfare
this type of because
the the whatever may be the reasons I'm
not eluding into the reasons that uh
development geography is happening India
okay but let us let us say
hypothetically there is a country which
is walked on at this moment
hypothetically okay and their leader
would want to visit London to secure
support which they are
and they are upset with India for you
know not doing enough to support them
for whatever reasons on the basis of our
own strategic interests but that
strategic interest is being appreciated
by many others what could this small
country potentially do without the help
of many others and do we have reason to
suspect that they will actually get the
help of the great data Powers we do have
the reasons to suspect not only that it
is not a particular way of sovereign
state doing it we do not know as you
said it's a chicken and egg story
whether the pios and the other motivated
panty India haters from the Pio and
other lobbies they initiated this
process lobbying with the countries of
their own precedence or lobbying with
wherever their influence spreads okay
and that created this situation to
happen or it is the initiative from the
country itself which are disturbed by
the development geography the government
has achieved in the last seven years all
right okay okay
I'll leave the last word professor and
we'll come back and have a more detailed
conversation on this a bit later in the
evening professor nalapath
the question then remains is what should
then trouble us
because of a country out of its own
motivation is seeking to Lobby
individuals
because they're unhappy with the
Strategic position of the government the
Strategic and interests of the country
of India will not change after a general
election takes place sir one would say
that what is important today would
remain important
and if the country is only able to do X
why should we be worried
uh rishabh if I may reply to that
question
and that is very clear the fact of the
matter is that throughout Indian history
a lot of the damage to India has been
done from within India or by by Indians
themselves and regrettably the same
seems to be happening now as is
correctly being said India is now in a
situation where it could emerge as
definitely number three in the global
rankings and soon number one and then
now you have people of Indian origin who
for whatever reasons whether they
reached the reasons they have an
estimate whether they really believe in
that or not I mean one can't say but the
fact that there have always been people
of Indian ethnicity who have been
willing to betray this country for
whatever it is a mess of cottage or
whatever it is and that has been going
on and I'm not surprised it's going on
now in 20 23 I'm not surprised at all
okay so for people watching this
broadcast
uh
now the cat is out of the bag
okay the story has been published the
Sunday guardianlive.com is where you can
read the story and links are have been
tweeted out
Etc as well
we will come back and have a
conversation in Greater extent but I'm
just going to leave it with the last
couple of quoted paragraphs which of
course have been well thought through
and well put together
which says the exercise to create a
negative perception about the government
by exploiting its weaknesses as per the
deliberations will begin in full force
from September 2023 about six months 180
days ahead of the expected elections
sources aware of these developments said
that the strategies on how to launch a
concerted and carefully drawn out
campaign to reach out to the masses both
through offline and online modes
including through social media and
WhatsApp and Enlighten them about the
ills of the Narendra Modi government
were a crucial part of these
deliberations the substantial expenses
incurred for organizing these meetings
and the subsequent campaigns are being
funded by people of Indian origin and
other Nationals so not from India
all right let's come back and have a
more detailed conversation in just a bit
I'm going to thank all my reporters who
are going to be following up on this
from across the country on what is
actually taking place whether this is
restricted to Delhi or elsewhere so far
the information is these are three
meetings but one has to assume if
they've been three they've been others

first time established 5.9 million tons
inferred resources of lithium in salal
hamana area of riyasi District of jamun
Kashmir Vivek bhardwaj IA secretary
Ministry of mines and at over 60
geological reports and 35 geological
memorandums to the state government
during the 62nd Central geological
programming board meeting which was held
is joining us for more on this story
Ajay take us through these uh breaking
developments coming in
well yes it's a big achievement and
especially for the German Kashmir and
the fourth long District of Germany
Kashmir which is riyasi and uh about 5.9
million tons of lithium uh you know
input resources uh that basically found
in the rayasi district which is a uh
far-flung District of the German Kashmir
and the area where this uh has found is
the salal hamaina area in riyasi
District and this Reserve is going to
definitely change the picture of uh not
only reality but also the German Kashmir
as we know that the coming future is of
lithium and the electric and we know
that how the country is heading towards
the uh towards electric vehicles and
other things and that is going to help
riyasi district to develop and
definitely to generate jobs as well as a
economy is going to be boosted here in
the German Kashmir and the country as
this you know much of lithium which is
found here which is from here in the
riyasi district that is not only going
to help German Kashmir but also going to
help the country's economy as a that can
be exported uh you know outside the
country as well
all right uh let me in fact also ask you
about how significant this uh this
finding is in terms of you know natural
resources as well for jnk and for India
Ajay it is very significant and as we
know that how German Kashmir is full of
potential and for many years you know
the things were we can say that just
hiding inside the uh inside the health
of jobin Kashmir and this time uh if you
talk about this riyasi District because
we know that how the electric power
plants and hydroelectric power plants
were started in the German Kashmir in
the recent pasta earlier you know uh
several employers you know power plants
and hydroelectric projects were going on
there but now uh recently the the
government of India have a Kickstart new
project as well and during this uh you
know researchers of you know Geological
Survey of India what they have found in
reality District that there is the
potential of a lithium as well so that's
why the uh the sampling was done uh you
know a few months back and uh yesterday
when this uh report has came which
declared that yes this lithium which was
a sample from this area that found a
very uh you know uh very uh good and
that's why they have also disclosed that
about a 5.9 million tons of lithium
infrared uh is uh you know here in this
area in the riyasi Hills uh in hamana uh
so that is going to definitely uh help
the government of uh government Kashmir
authorities here whether it is our jobs
whether it is a economy that is going to
definitely boost economy as well and uh
this short plan area which was uh we can
say that not developed much this is
going to get a
um you know new share as well as also
this is going to develop uh on the world
map as well for more such videos
