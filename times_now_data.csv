viewers as we begin let's go let's go
straight across this is a theis car
viewers very important state this is
where in the previous election
the BJP got all 11 out of 11 10 out of
10 yes okay let's have a quick look at
this here's the numbers has one state
again like MP the populist measures of
the Chief Minister and of course the
cost combination worked out with the
Congress Oh issuing impact in showing
him impact by the Congress y-yeah for
the Congress the colorful actually picks
up about eight eight so a reverse so
it's a reversal so very day before the
India it's now going to be just three I
think most of it in the last few months
you know when the measures will started
taking impact on the ground
the BJP loses the Congress so who is
this who do the credit go to mr miguel
the achievement the leadership the state
leadership changing things around it's
very interesting viewers we were
expecting today we were expecting today
numbers to be consolidating in the
india's favour it's not quite happening
at least as of now you can look at the
bottom of your screens one eighty one
ninety nine the upn are inching towards
the century mark viewers and you can see
we have already counted about three
hundred forty nine so it's almost 350
seats coming up there sixty nine others
taken together the others in the ups
still not still not ahead of the NDA put
that growth change let's have a quick
look at the other state let's look at
delhi delhi big state the app and the
congress ah shadowboxing they want to
come together it's little bit of high
now going on but here this is the
voltage entropy is actually inching back
to its 2014 vote share you know it's
gain here they got seven out of seven
seats so it's 43 they've actually gained
one point five percent game while the
urban voter seems to be leaning once
again
the BJP has even taken a share of the AP
voters actually oh really
that's a motorcade also another in india
and of course the looks of my election
is concerned the poor have shown a
preference for Modi's that has happened
okay that's what's happening okay very
hard in the slum areas during amongst
the poor van Chile's has been able to
galvanize a lot of the wood bank that
was with the arc traditionally and if
the up and Congress don't go together
actually we'll be curtains for the well
so we are projecting we are projecting
in Delhi there you see it's seven out of
seven for the BJP if the Congress and
the OP are watching they better get
their act together because that's their
only hope many people would say they're
only opening the app in the Congress
could they reverse this do you think I
think if the app and the Congress were
to get together in Delhi there would be
a more food for a more formidable
challenge to the BJP but but when
they're fighting separately dissipates
the the anti-bjp board and its advantage
BJP there is still some conversation
happening of women in Congress was
divided but why do you think the people
of Delhi will not see through this
opportunism look at what the politics of
mr. Kejriwal have been over the last
five years six years he's always thought
that the draft agenda shed upon Ivana is
the only one that counts around the
coffin let me just tell you one thing
you know the Ferrari just couple of
sorry
couple of days ago monastery made a very
important statement talking to the media
right right if these two even there lie
still we will win seven and he made an
open offer saying that the 14 who are
going to be upset please don't forget it
we are there for you so he has basically
made an open offer to the lot of the see
when then call sattaiah yes these four
candidates of the Congress are going to
be knocked off views attention to the
bottom of the grid there that numbers
should go up now from 181 to about 188
because we've counted Delhi so I would
request the grid people who are looking
at the grid very closely to quickly
quickly update those numbers there you
can see them viewers they're going to go
up
we are already crossing the 350 month
now we have three 55 56 seats out of 543
the India numbers are going to search
they're going to get closer to the 200
mark 187 let's go to Punjab Haryana very
quickly Haryana coming up on your
screens let's quickly push the Haryana
number this is Delhi still let's quickly
push to Haryana there you see it
let's go okay we need to move on yes
this Punjab okay we brought up and job
right now Punjab very important here
it's looking like a very mixed bag isn't
it yeah very mixed back the India is
finally cannot cross
that rubican hating 32% and converting
to seeds okay which was not let's have a
look at the numbers let's have a look at
the numbers here in Punjab there you can
see them viewers they come up on your
screens as of now the India is that to
this this again it is finally this is
again he started making a present and
they've actually dented both the app and
the Congress on and one but that could
change viewers because you've been
polling in this state and you're
thinking that this is going to become
more even up yeah and up is going to
lose more votes over there that's very
clear okay that's very clear okay let's
quickly go to a Haryana very quickly
Haryana and let's call out Jammu and
Kashmir as well as Chandigarh dead there
you can see it any matchup for this
there you can see it there are a number
coming okay Tariana viewers yeah here
the India that you consolidating over
2014 growing strong AB it's growing
strong has emerged as the center of
gravity for every now that are because
the opposition is in total disarray here
divided even the Congress got a taste of
its own medicine in the recent by polls
in the assembly by force in Jane where
one of them more voluble spokespeople
let's look at the seats quickly in is
our mind where one of their voluble
spokesperson reduced to number three
there you can see India Gate the UPA do
and that number is coming up there you
can see it ate into that remains out of
ten and very quickly viewers if you keep
looking at the bottom of your screens
after we project both Punjab Camacho and
Jammu and Kashmir that number is almost
going to hit two hundred let's just pull
out those and put them out on our
screens Nizam by I just go quickly back
to our guests and bring them in this is
looking very very interesting now
because what we have and we are still
viewers we're still about 130 seats to
core it's at eight forty four where the
BJP the NDA is now inching closer to the
200 mark we will see that change on the
bottom of your screens in just a few
moments because we are going to add
Punjab you're gonna add the mature
Pradesh we're going to add in fact Jammu
and Kashmir as well as the seat of
Chandigarh so those numbers will quickly
go up they'll bump up and you will see a
change there two hundred almost on the
cards for the NDA can they make it to
two hundred and seventy two on their own
Jay from the east
70 odd seats need to come from North
India
yes as an alliance Oh as an alliance so
we're looking at Bihar we are looking at
we are looking at ERISA we're looking at
Bengal they've got to make some big
inroads if they got to get that number
that's very interesting we oppose it a
very interesting point two hundred and
seven four zero one called 5:43 is the
full number of looks of our seats you
can see it there the NDA crossing the
two hundred seven mark there the 200
mark there by about seven the up8 121
the other that 73 it's an open game but
it looks from where we are right now
that the NDA is going to cause ahead how
close does it get to the majority mark
we know in just a few moments we're
going to call more states very quickly I
want to open this out need a 50% stake
right now to cross the halfway mark is
reflected Narendra Modi is coming back
Rahul Gandhi has been to say that okay
that I agree the Congress has not made a
mark but this is not a mandate let me
bring in dr. fowl eels this good evening
sir yes nothing two sentences round if
these numbers hold up of course marina
Moody's winning the election based on
these numbers but Congress has not been
decimated in fact the Congress is more
than doubled with Sally Rahul Gandhi
will be able to say with reasonable rate
one party that is decimated and we will
see confirmation of that and that's the
left the left is pretty much left over
and I want to ask you sir
dr. father leave something very wrong
something very wrong is happening
well let me first congratulate you that
you have actually put out the figures at
the barrage and the party and the NDA is
going to be nowhere compared to what
they were in 2014 and I think so that's
very brave of you given the environment
in which we are functioning at this
point of time and so using the BJP with
the TMC I think that would be a
statement that will give you a bump of
energy when it comes to crushing media
freedom we know where she stands with
that so hang on AP that call a spade a
spade Cindy congratulate Jerry a Latino
oqu you are you are a hard to give at
this point of time and I think so that's
that's clearly indicative of the mood of
the nation is getting reflected in your
channel it is more concrete on the
ground than it is Atena as it appears in
in the vertical in the opinion polls and
these polls that you have conducted now
and because is it the narrative with
your if you look at the beach
okay let me bring you see the Kazan
issue has become central okay let me
bring the left organized the caissons
the left led the movement for the
caissons so that has become a national
narrative so through you you can okay
once in fact the left is actually
guiding that than acts there is no doubt
you know pain that there is rural
agrarian distress there is
down fair enough that's the fan up but
you're not the partner that is providing
the alternative and I want to brilliant
scientist Avast Ravel quickly one second
sir allow me well the conversation has
been forced by the left okay okay one
say I want to learn here it's
contributed a humungous need to ensure
oh the clad becomes part and parcel of
the entire discourse of the nation okay
let me bring in dr. Sanjeev as to why
dr. Serizawa
I mean Sanjeev sorry doctor suddenly on
this panel one minute Sanjeev sir I just
want to ask you this there are two
confirmations that are coming through
fine the Modi wave and after five years
very trying years through a period where
we've seen many changes etc etc and some
policy decisions that went back we are
seeing Modi doing fantastically well in
the situation that the country perhaps
finds itself in number one number two
round Gandhi Priyanka Gandhi both well
are not cutting ice with the electorate
the third front remains confused entity
as far as voters are concerned there is
obviously a growing need for an
alternative but it's certainly not being
provided by the UPN the third front
you'd have to concede okay see what Alan
said first of all I agree with them that
the Congress is not being decimated it
shows it is reaching 80 90 so yes but
they are not reviled enough to take any
heart number two while you have been
consistently saying Rahul that there is
no Modi there I'm not sure whether there
is a Modi wave or no Modi wave but what
there is no more thean bridge appears
very convincingly done for themselves if
they have made this election as
completely mr. Modi centric it has
willy-nilly become a mr. Modi centric
election other than South India
number two what the BJP must be
complimented for is something which I've
never notation mostly not notice in my
last 30 35 years of reporting is that
this is for the first time when I talk
to voters they ask so if not more
my impression of Indian elections always
was that people are not bothered what
the alternative is they just would
usually vote out the incumbent okay but
this time the BJP has managed to sell
this narrative to the people well for
that if not Moody who okay there are
nobody is coming to you know this is not
your first time on the BJP this is not
the first time that we have been at a
loss for an alternative Tina factor is a
word that has been bandied about many
many times but we have a hundred and
forty two seats still to call viewers on
the news up you're going to get the full
numbers but certain trends are beginning
to consolidate emerge right here on
times now we leave it at this we are not
saying that there is no more the wave
there could be changes in the next one
hour we're also not saying that these
numbers could not actually consolidate
further remember the Prime Minister's
yet really to begin his blitzkrieg a
hundred and thirty rallies he has
planned
he has only conducted thirty of them a
hundred still to go wait and watch this
game is wide open viewers 72 hours
before the first phase

rolling coverage in over the next one
hour we are going to tell you
projections across 166 looks of our
seats most crucial uther Pradesh Madhya
Pradesh Delhi the heartland and some
states in the North this is big viewers
because this could change the complexion
of the numbers that you're seeing on the
bottom of your screens as of now viewers
we have been projecting 235 seats out of
543 so a little over the halfway mark
the Indians cross the century it's 1:06
UPA 87 we've called the south we've
called the West the east and the north
are left viewers and this is becoming a
tantalizing battle suspenseful battle
because the India is still short by more
than a hundred and sixty-eight seats of
the majority mark will it all change in
the next one hour will the UPA and the
others who have formed crucial alliances
and are resurgent in the Hindi heartland
close that gap can there be a big
surprise the numbers in the South
viewers on your screens 129 129 we have
projected you can see that the change
has been monumental in favor of the UPA
but not enough 64 seats the UPA will get
in the South 26 the NDA shall pick up
and if our poll is Right The Times Now
VMR poll trackers right then 42 will go
to the others some of those others could
switch over to the NDA nothing can be
ruled out this is wide open in the South
in the West 103 out of 103 projected and
you can see it's here where the NDA has
really picked up I am sure it would want
to see many more seats converting in
Maharashtra it's had a bit of a setback
in Maharashtra over the last three or
four weeks but even then the India
import position there in the West 80 out
of 23 these are states of Rajasthan
Gujarat Maharashtra Goa Daman do Dada
and Nagar Haveli so these are big states
and this is
in 2014 the BJP had done fantastic meets
down 17 seats it wants to obviously get
those 17 seats but now we move to that
Pradesh and Jem rook is going to put his
neck on the line this is the one state
viewers which many people say could be
the difference between the NDA making it
across the halfway mark the BJP perhaps
getting close to the halfway mark or
even crossing it let's go to the big
election wall right behind me viewers
here it is looked at Pradesh coming up
for you on your screens this is going to
be the moment that will bring a lot of
chatter not only amongst you viewers but
also across the Twittersphere
here we can see if this is the vote
share this is how it's talking on for
the BJP now tell us what's going on
things have changed just between April
and March March knock-on effect 2% 2% no
not yet there is not a court is change
the fortunes by 2 percent that's a huge
amount in a state like utter Pradesh Jay
not you Allah could I think a lot more
is at work this if our data is right and
and I would be honest I've really worked
hard on this data to interpret this data
that was the number yeah for the BJP
it's at any point I don't percent now
crucially that got them viewers 71 seats
just the BJP and the gut bun then the
BJP NDA got 73 now look at this that
number is in the same ballpark now
almost in the same ball binary man
shoots that actually should restore it
pika so are we going to see and we're
not going to call out the numbers right
now in Assam by but are we going to see
perhaps the same levels at which the BJP
is or are we going to see the number
that the 50 there you can see it the
50/50 there it comes in a plus 8 in just
you look at the difference in about 15
days yeah plus it here it is it's come
up yeah so that's the difference that 2%
makes
8 precious seats these are like Golda's
for the Bharatiya janta party isn't it J
hooray now just break it down for us
yeah what's going on in this state
Rahul with actually over the past two
trackers we've spread ourselves across
the state I mean a researcher in my
office latrine or a goon - Avasthi by
night I mean literally we've spread
ourselves across the state now
irrespective of the geography of the
state there was one pattern that ran
through common like a fast flowing river
okay and that was known Yadav overseas
no another will be seized and launched
out of Isis are now developing a sort of
fidelity for the BJP which for which
ones only the upper caste one that is in
excess of 50 or 60 percent of their
response in other words yeah it's
section of non jot of SE and essays are
still sticking to this lot no they are
going in bigger numbers bigger numbers
yes that is absolute polarization that
is taking place yeah see in that section
in 2014 the BJP swore share was 45% non
jart of Isis now that is touching 55 or
60 percent
similarly in non Yadav OB sees it is
scaling up from about 45 percent to 60
percent 60 percent yeah and the double
whammy for the mahogany but then there
is that even the Congress is picking up
some 10 or 12 percent of that
restricting them hands Rahul Gandhi just
handed the election to the Modi NDA
that's the question that comes out of it
by reducing this entire contest to a
triangular one route Gandhi and his
great generals who have been perhaps
strategizing Priyanka Gandhi who else it
is mother of Sylvia's son Joe three
detest India any of these intellectuals
they are probably just given the game
away viewers given the game away in
utter Pradesh the Maha Cotman then
gaining Sanjeev Slovakia has a view
everyone's going to have a view on this
everyone's going to have a view this is
one of those talking points look at the
numbers at the bottom of your screen
viewers look at it 80 seats come from
Uttar Pradesh you add the numbers three
one five out of five forty three 156 and
now the India only requires about 120 to
be across there
we mark roughly yes Sanjeev service
Terra my big problem my limited view is
just two sentences what could have
rolled on the or Congress done they
would write their to rest for an
alliance or ago now whatever being born
who are suggesting what you are saying
they should have sat out of the contest
in you P that may be causally maybe that
they got a more secretive contested two
seats and said okay they were right
seven seats my Hatice snubbed them don't
leave seven seats so now suffer
so the non-bjp combination is suffering
because of that do this clearly in areas
like many seats like siren poor for one
yeah most glaring it's our and put
because Imran Masood is going to take
two three lakh votes BJP will win so the
Congress presence is actually a harming
the that's what I'm the only way the
only let's let's see only one others in
candidate accumulation and Miami these
individuals have come out and said that
route Gandhi wasn't his own trip own
trip he brought in his sister and after
he brought in his sister there was no
question of the Gandhi subsuming
themselves under the overarching rubric
nilin of the maja got van then let's be
honest this was a strategic error role I
think I think what Rahul Gandhi is
trying to do is to really fight the next
election rather than this one it's about
reviving the Congress as much as more
than it is at then about stopping Modi
in that sense at least in U P now the
question I have for J is that the number
of fifty four and we've been discussing
this J before we came back on air as
well this is by far the single highest
number for the BJP and you pee in any
opinion poll are conducted in this
calendar year
yeah so my question to you Jay is that
now our reporters have also been
traveling across u P and they're finding
in these parts of Eastern European are
other and and I and those regions the
mahogany one than holding up so what I
would be interested in knowing is it
which specific areas is the poll
conducted in UPA B where do you find the
consolidation that you spoke off of non
Jadhav SCS and no any other moba case in
which you're coming or happening yeah J
break it out
we actually we've covered the entire
state in the past to track oppose one is
the post Bala code this one so say
starting right from the West
up north in bitching or okay going right
down to the geography Ken much leisure
the other end of the state which is
eastern u P then picking up seats in
bundelcund that is Banda we picked up a
lot of seats and others as well as you
know other than actually the SP ba
speaking can put up a very good fight
and in the Terai region to our great
surprise I mean I can even name the
seats but he right in the Terai region
where the sabe three by fully the
sitting MP has rebelled she's contesting
on a Congress ticket we found that the
Yadav's were not comfortable voting for
Shabbir Ahmed Bal Mickey who is the
meter AC reserved seat and it is easy SP
candid we found a section of them also
saying with vote for the BJP all across
the other states in Malaysia the eastern
part of you P we found this polarization
of nor any other OBC saying oh we're
worrying for BJP well down in western UK
also we found that let me tell you one
thing the Jazz being conservative the
real surprises and we had this long
debate of air before we came into this
show viewers in the afternoon when we
were putting this entire numbers
together and trying to make sense of
these numbers he actually believes that
that number and interpolation could go
higher actually ok Rahul is very smart I
don't want you to hold me for this but
I'll give them I'll give the background
a proper scientific examination to what
they're whistling break it down into a
point if you just forget that there is a
candidate selection mess and everybody
votes as for their cast okay this is the
hypothesis guys everybody votes as per
their cast and in the proportions that
have come out in the survey and you take
the rough cause now there's no cast
senses but you take the rough cast
proportions that are available in the
seats
the tally can even go to 60 60 but again
this is the hypothesis Rahul based on a
certain assumption and a data obviously
all of this even the number that you're
projecting was based on a hypothesis yes
as opposed to consolidated in a few C
okay yes because achalasia also getting
flop show Priyanka Gandhi is getting a
prop show these two things are going to
affect Muhammad Ovid
I'm going to show that let me enjoy say
increased to 60 awesome okay let me ask
Juhi sing chewy sing I want to come out
to you you're the spokesperson the
Samajwadi Party many people have said
Juhi sing that you're actually raising
the wrong issues that post Bala caught
you lost the plot that post Bala caught
you began to question our forces that's
what the BJP has said and that is what
is coming up
you've also played into the hands of the
minority community and those that are
trying to polarize reverse polarize this
election so many people are saying that
you've actually played the wrong
gambling I think you've yes dalek can I
answer please around I think you are
confusing parties and my question is to
Jay he was talking about beright he was
talking about co-champion go to our very
first scope spoke and he said there was
a macro level of feeling where the
others were watching you switch to
sections yeah no let me speak so you are
talking about my government then you
mentioned my candidate you took the name
of mr. Shapiro's Valmiki and then you
can immediately send to the section of
the others would not vote for it
so the BJP would win so if this is the
sort of hypotheses then you can give any
number of seats I think the market one
then is going to do over 60 seats and we
are going to win you peat and apps the
kiosk Adele avoided myopathy and
Achilles chide Rahul Gandhi no why did
they both child Rahul Gandhi just the
other day just yesterday from the first
joint rally they held and held him
responsible for dividing votes what is
the apprehension if you're winning then
forget around Gandhi Theorem totally why
bother why the next you will say forget
the Prime Minister forget the BJP you
already forgotten him you already said
that the primary
in distress I spite of the unemployment
so it might not be shoes on time sir but
there are real issues and ups okay you
might let me pass the question of not
two three visits ER doctor Sudan truth
okay there's a bum one moment let me
bring the BJP cross 65c yes well that's
the problem six my body says one thing
Akhilesh Yadav says quite another but
there are two or three disturbing
aspects of the campaign that the BJP is
running sir dr. Trivedi in Uttar Pradesh
it's far too communal even today yogi
Adityanath responding to my avati made
an outlandish statement you have Sakshi
Minaj who says something you have
several others from your party that are
going out there and pretty much baiting
the minorities now I want to ask you sir
is that the discourse you want to
propagate on a day when your own
manifesto promises to take all sections
along tell me sir Rahul we are committed
and marching ahead to take everybody
together
you taught us a karate karate yoga we
want sub Cassatt sabka Vikas but you
remember today in siharan Parelli Maha T
has openly said you Muslims semaj up in
a vodka Robin a grey got wounded kuma
vishesh car Muslims some ads they appeal
cannot chat you give Ahom Cody what does
this mean you are categorically making a
communal appeal and the same Marathi
during the you peep in hands of my
election has said you Muslims imagine
about number of odd carry the moon
lancing you said key acolytes had not
improved on things from later right and
a kadai says give my everything my Amity
is not it is not confine yourself in my
manner becoming a leader secular mirages
and the yogi Adityanath are seated in
the election rally sir
with individuals that are charged with
lynching I'm asking you this question
now to what extent are we going to go
Jeremiah had beheld you how to glow
behind polarizer in the mentioning page
39 of your manifesto and it does not
even find a mention in the twenty five
seventy five objects of missions that
you want to accomplish before India
turns 75 in 2020 to explain sir dr.
Trivedi now yes first I would like to
respond
who is vitiating that mass fear you

yes one two three and 41 yes
the Congress JDS Alliance let's remember
on the ground wherever they are strong
they're strong together they do not
complement each other they don't come
here friends are in the same territory
soon all their shops razor divide they
like joking like absolutely chalk and
cheese northern Karnataka is BJP versus
Congress southern karnataka was actually
Congress versus genius which means when
they get into an alliance they don't
completely transfer works well I can
tell you something here and this is off
record yeah I can't name those
individuals but when I was in Bangalore
when I was in Bangalore certain people
told me yes certain people told me that
there was a huge problem of chemistry
between the JDS and the Congress party
absolu not unsurprising you're saying no
not and you know to the world they use
this how can sworn enemies be expected
by Patti Fiat yeah by their bosses to
suddenly become friends when their
entire political existence was dependent
upon taking each other
yeah that's very interesting knowing
that you know to tell our viewers we
we took care to pool constituency's
where such non chemistry existed like
Chitradurga Tumkur and even Shama Raj
Nagar down south
you could even expect a surprise win for
the BJP in places like Chama Raj Nagar
because congressman Julia nobody go up
so that we could go up this could go up
the number could go up viewers this is
what Jay says he's being very
conservative because he always believes
it's better to err on the side of OK on
the side of caution let's let's move on
one second before I come out - yes we
make you want to throw throw enough
comments yes even even invoke illegal
strongholds like Giardia yeah we're HD
Kumaraswamy his grandson is fighting ok
they are heading for a crisis you have
so Malaka popular actor who's an
independent candidate whom BJP
supporting you have a situation where JD
s does not trust the Congress you have
the Congress president and de rigueur da
are calling for a joint meeting day
after tomorrow in Bangalore in in in
Manya just to make sure even there won't
strong all their popular rotors have any
other see through what I believe I said
corporate genetic alliance and Vivek is
telling you the inside story this is
something that was also communicated to
me mind iam I saw you see surprises
there look at the numbers at the bottom
of your screens viewers we've counted 87
out of 543 23 to the NDA ups 62 others
said - so as of now the UPA picking up
the bulk let's quickly go to Andhra
Pradesh I think that's what is coming up
there that's the vorcha in Andhra
Pradesh projected by Jay and his team
there you can see it the UPA the you
pnath going solo gosh both the two main
parties national parties decimated yes
decimated who's picking up look at that
everybody is in a - there's big eight
and a half plus in the others who are
these out of this 13.4 about 10 percent
as mr. Pawan Kalyan you start absolutely
you kingmaker Oh a new Chiranjeevi in
the south oh okay and has a following
across Sangram in Telangana as well Wow
so he's going to be a factor even in
challenge yes will we see that in the
poll when it comes up he will figure out
the others but you will see it in the
others okay and these two political
parties what is
he is evened out the contest between
Weiss RCP and the TDP a contest that was
not even has now sort of even now so who
is he hitting so who is he he's actually
hurting the Weiss RCP was making anti
TDP woods view is very very important
because when you look at the conversion
when you look at the conversion we're
pulling out the seats you will suddenly
see that while he might be hitting the
Weiss RCP the wires are CP jug gun ready
yeah looks like the man of the match in
Andhra Pradesh which way is he going to
go we don't know as of now he's keeping
his cards very close to the chest will
he be with the NDA it looks as if he
might be but he also did significantly
says forgiving the Congress he's
forgiving Rahul Gandhi for betraying him
yeah so this man could be a kingmaker
kingmaker we are talking about Jagan
Reddy who could be the kingmaker viewers
he's only lost two seats in the last few
weeks the momentum still very much with
him Chandrababu Naidu trying to push
through as gain - but that's the contest
the other parties know we're in the game
and this is a consistent trend that we
have seen mr. Raja Gopal on whenever we
have had a contest where the Congress
and the BJP are up against third forces
they wilt no confidence that when a
large number of individuals in either
the Congress or the BJP mr. Raja cofilin
this is not the sign this the length and
breadth of India not espousing
confidence in mr. Modi toggle this
clearly expresses view from Andhra
waters that split toe bifurcation of
antara was wrong because Congress has
been totally routed and second thing but
the BJP is not gaining suribabu Naidu
who left who left the India and said
I've been betrayed seems to have struck
a chord somewhere Babu Naidu son let me
bring it on
people have taught his betrayal later
let me bring in mr. Varma once again mr.
Chari mr. Varma this is very significant
we are seeing the Congress being snubbed
and if the Congress really wants to make
it past that 100 mark Andhra Pradesh
would have been an important place for
it to be in the picture the others now
in that column at 27 the NDA 23 uph 62
it's getting close 102
counted out of 543 mr. Varma Nishant
Verma the Congress party Rowell Gandhi
not a factor apart from Kerala okay
thank you
I need a minute yeah first of all I am
NOT very excited with the numbers here
because when I then in the beginning you
said 14301 is a sample that doesn't even
come to zero point zero zero two zero
four percent of that total electorate
that India has but still let's discuss
what we have good job done by Jay at
least what I see is the 23 showing on
the screen for NDA from these southern
states is absolutely going to be 0
primarily because I have these 40
promises for 0 from 2014 of BJP I am NOT
going to discuss the caste part and the
religion part and so on even if I pick
one and especially in the southern
region of the of the country one is
setting up a team of India initiative
which will include the Prime Minister
and the chief ministers as equal
partners I am sure our voters are not
fools
if BJP has not been able to pick up that
and complete in five years not based on
Sabri mala or a AIADMK know the entire
ballgame when it comes out to the public
this particular promise may and the PM
and the CMS was supposed to be on the
equal partnership has not been fulfilled
and southern states are sensible even
via other north and eastern are but
southern states they vote sensibly and
when they would send simply because of
the higher education trade whatever BJP
has sir I asked you a simple question
you're giving me a whole thesis which is
completely which is completely relevant
to the question I asked you I am only
asking yes apart from bringing yourself
through he's gone on jazz effort can you
tell me sir this was supposed to be the
election which was to suggest that round
Gandhi was having a connect with the
people of this country and let me bring
in mr. Shrivastav ah mr. subasta we are
not seeing evidence of that that must
worry the Congress party if it really
has to recover it has to do
Stickley well today and I in the sample
on that that what he is doing too badly
Kari likes what they are doing well but
the Karnataka result of gorgeous project
and he's been conservative holds true
then no unrealistic the government will
love to be will be on its way out
because if JDS and congress can't work
together in this looks uh by Election
Day but let's look at the reasons behind
let's look at the reasons behind let's
look at the reason if you are the most
crucial seats but let's look at the
reasons behind an arch number of moves
made by route Gandhi in the north are
not going to help as you know the
Congress party contesting as a fourth
force in interpretation only damaging
the gut bundle and I short the Jay will
agree with me on that score yeah so
round Gandhi has to ask himself a few
questions here he can't just walk away
from the ruins and I want to quickly
bring in telangana
look at Telangana viewers where is the
Congress in the South zero it's
completely marginalized except for in
Kerala here you can see here it is this
is Telangana there it is the TRS doing
fantastically well there the Congress
still has a bit of a vote you can see
butts conversion is extremely poor
conversion is poor finger so obviously
there are some still some varies no it
seems it is the opposition party but it
is but but look at this forty three
point six zero and look at the seats the
seats not adding up just to do for for
the Communist Party and there you can
see that TRS causing ahead there you can
see ya
14 now its gain 1k momentum with it
they're down by one you can see her down
by one yeah and of course GDP is
actually the big loser it a big loser
now I think even some viewer information
to abuse the BJP girl is wonderfully
spread across five six Lok Sabha seats
with greater than 22 percent but is also
not converting beyond that that's the
problem with the BJ it's not converting
let's have a look at the big talking
points coming out of the south
all I can say to you is that if mr. Modi
was this great man national figure the
South is not suggesting that number one
if Rahul Gandhi taught that his raffle
claims and most importantly his claims
that the government is a Joomla circuit
would deliver him the votes it's not
happening look at the numbers 112 out of
543 the NDA the NDA stuck right now at
23 the ups 62 UPA only doing well
because of its alliances don't get
confused viewers the Congress by itself
if you look at that number down perhaps
just about in the double digits there
the others at 27 112 out of 543 one
second these are the big talking points
and they're coming up behind me viewers
let's look at them
BJP footprints expands but needs a leg
up from the allies viewers it needs a
leg up so the BJP and we were told were
looking at these 120-odd see one of the
saw is 31 29 and we're going to see the
counter go up to 129 and you can see the
NDA only 23 the UPA 64 the others wide
open right now
yes let's have a look the South crucial
for okay the big takeaways and the big
takeaways
okay gentleman gentlemen don't get
bogged down don't get bogged down let's
have a look at the big crucial takeaways
and you can see the overall picture BJP
footprints expands but it needs a crutch
from its a helping hand so it's a South
crucial for Congress fortunes as of now
the South keeping the Congress party
suspenseful II guessing third front
floats on the southern lifeline so
remember the third
it's very active and strong in uttar
pradesh orissa and of course bengal can
it grow into posing a challenge to the
two main formations we don't know as of
now there is hope there is hope
let's have a look at the over number
picture the overall numbers picture
coming from the south there you can see
you can see it viewers on your screens
that's the overall number and you can
see here the change from 2014 to april
1964 is the number for the UPA enough 26
for the NDA and of course the others and
the others there are at least two
parties that could switch to the NDA
here so this could be an inflated number
it looks good on paper but it may not
actually work in the favor of the UPN I
want to bring in the TRS and I want to
bring in the TDP the TRS first sir if
tomorrow the NDA were to make you an
offer
would you join would you sign up or
would you go to the UPA TRS spokesperson
Rahul to early I mean the states are
still relevant the states are still
relevant the regional parties are still
relevant so we believe that the reason I
am a numbers will grow up hedging your
bets significantly we will see that how
a federal front could be made the we've
been speaking will tell you he's got to
the ground actually is sympathetic John
don't play this game you're the B team
you're the B team of the BJP CP and your
party very seriously have sympathies
towards the NDA they will wait in the
last possibility Prime Minister we have
if that doesn't happen it will go ahead
and support India let me not be
nocturnal Tina can I just want to do we
want to decimate the Congress too so Jay
Jay Jay Jay could actually give us out
well Jay tell me something of these two
parties a TDP and the TRS our own
one position that of kingmakers right
wrong that's always been their rule
especially that of mr. Naidu mr. Naidu
let me go across to the TDP sir if
tomorrow the nd able to knock your doors
would you forget the bad blood first
first let you hear okay okay tell me
tell me sir
tell me which way will you swing well I
don't want to hear all of this side you
have something to say because I am not
listening to all sorts of unverified
audio here so tell me mr. Tanaka lanka's
what's your position if tomorrow mr.
modi would to invite mr. Naidu and say
well well discharge has been around in
fact yes even the first one to show on
how BJP were going soft on wires RCP a
place where the BJP state president is
fighting no is our CP had decided to
fight a field of V candidates well we
haven't been able to things and we
haven't been able to win Abdul Razak
from the JD s because we've simply run
out of time we had to start about 10-12
minutes late on this particular show but
132 out of 543 the numbers are there
it's tight ish but it's open right here
wait for the numbers from the West

after weeks of hype and drama Congress

who train daily when Rahul got the name
they were but a kite in Delhi in every
angle and in a model now Sonia Gandhi in
my service you want India Geum know who
lied would ruin see to you look in a
Congress regarding where in Assad's
adrianel available here
Rahul is emerging as a leader for the
past two years in a short span of time
he emerged like anything and people are
seeing him as a savior of India and it's
not only an election it is the election
for the democracy of India it's the
election for the Constitution of India
and all the core values of India so in
this particular context the people of
Kerala well-educated people of Kerala as
a role model for the entire India they
collectively believe that Rahul Gandhi
has got a metal to administer India
it was a spectacle that involved weeks
of planning and coordination massive
welcome on the streets of Calcutta
growls aah
and look at the kind of responses after
cards this is certainly an event that
has galvanized the Kerala Congress party
workers or we here in the state of
Kerala and the Congress believes will
hate them in the southern states as well
how far will this really translate all
of this enthusiasm other southern states
as well that's a big question that in
fact leads to the answer file his
nomination yard in why not Rahul Gandhi
of course certainly hoping that all of
this enthusiasm over the border southern
states as well how far and how easy this
will be remains to be seen certainly a
big challenge for the Congress president
of this point of time but making a huge
deal of this entire Roadshow and
certainly hoping at this point of time
response that really they are they got a
bill that they have at this point of
time as far as this nomination filing is
concerned this is the kind of response
that we see the crowds completely going
crazy with Rahul Gandhi coming here in
the streets of why not will remain to be
seen really whether this enthusiasm will
translate towards and whether the
Congress can ensure that this continues
in communities as well
Rahul Gandhi's presence if nothing else
has certainly energized the Congress
rank-and-file in the state of Kerala as
it is being seen as a matter of prestige
for the stage unit the party insists
that this energy will carry across the
states borders to neighboring Tamil Nadu
and could not
a massive sea of humanity right outside
the collector's office in Calcutta why
not district these are people who've
gathered over here party workers of the
Congress of the Muslim League of the
gamma student student all of them
present over here for bowel Gandhi's
nomination the Kerala Congress says that
this is the sort of enthusiasm that they
believe will be replicated to
neighboring constituencies and
throughout Kerala but will this
translate into votes across the border
in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and Andhra
Pradesh in Telangana that's a
million-dollar question at this point in
time today it's overwhelming and I think
because there are so many demographic
characteristics of why not which make
this a kind of mini India that if this
is the level of enthusiasm for ral
Gandhi's candidature in Vienna surely it
must in some way reflect what is
happening in the country as a whole
which is the rise of Rahul Gandhi at the
restoration of the Congress as a major
national political I think in Tamil Nadu
which is where I am from the enthusiasm
has already been demonstrated at Stella
Maris College in nagercoil in Karnataka
over the entire period of those assembly
elections you saw how popular he was so
it's in itself what you call an osmotic
process that the enthusiasm from there
gets reflected here and the enthusiasm
here gets reflected this time Congress
is saying this will have a huge impact
for the southern states because all the
southern states have asked for mr.
Gandhi Congress party has asked what do
you personally feel will it have an
imperative Lee when is contesting you
general impact what he says is I'm not
going to dispute you see the enthusiasm
of the people enthusiasm of especially
the young stage
like a nor the turn D as a parliament
consequences and also the whole of South
India
while the Congress workers in Kerala may
be enthused there are questions being
raised about Rahul Gandhi's decision to
contest from two seats why is he doing
it does he feel vulnerable in his pocket

his principal opponent there smithy

in fact Prime Minister Narendra Modi has
not spared him either
Muslims and Christians make up for
almost 50% of the population in the
bernard lok sabha constituency and it
didn't take long for Prime Minister when
he was this would be the first time
Rahul Gandhi will be contesting from two
different constituencies his mother
Sonia Gandhi had earlier fought from
Botha methi as well as Volare in
Karnataka in 99
taking on sushma swaraj back in Kerala
Rahul Gandhi's detractors have not just
downplayed his presence and Bernard but
her even denied that it will have any
impact on other southern states they've
even said that Rahul Gandhi was
weakening the index of opposition unity
last time they got only 20,000 notes
they didn't done anything for why not
especially because they that time India
was robbed a Congress and availed when
I'm in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu Kerala
also they didn't earn anything even now
because you know
Mogi taken this place for development
that also note the state government is
not allowed for that PM Modi said Rahul
Gandhi is running away from windows
because careless mentalities entirely
different and because he's losing
committee that's why he came here
any there's no way it wasn't under
original Stan article in the UDF
Einstein and figure London other Dorada
Rahul Gandhi why not Roman silicon Oh
Haneen 40 remaining on the grim carnival
isn't only
coming up right after this break
enormous enthusiasm among the people
here you look at the crowd the mostly of
the people are youngsters that shows
that young people of this country is
with Rahul Gandhi
amid reports that top CPM leaders would
campaign in Vinod it was not entirely
surprising then that Rahul Gandhi had to
declare a truce saying he won't attack
CPM and would instead absorbed their
attacks the question then is where does
that leave the local Congress unit I
know that the CPM and the Congress have
been gone in a fight in Kirin and this
fight will go on but I want to make it
very clear to my brothers and sisters in
Kerala to my brothers and sisters in the
Congress party I understand that the CPM
has to attack I understand that they
have to fight me but I am NOT going to
say a word against the CPM I may have to
send a message of unity I'm here to send
a message that South India is important
and I fully understand that the CPM has
to attack so I will absorb all their
attack with happiness but from me you
will not hear a word in my campaign
against the CPM he has also said he
would not attack the CPM now this is a
very straight position because mr.
pinburrough vision is attacking him on a
daily basis you are of course taking on
the CPM on ground but the fact that he
is not going to take on the left this is
a very interesting position that he's
taken he is only going to attack me TP
and Prime Minister see that one thing is
way that shows that Rahul Gandhi is the
national leader with a sagacity we take
large hotness CPM for the last two four
or five days
attacking skeptic skeptic utter has been
done on dagger Gandhi but we are enough
to take your printer.i vision and CPM
not Rahul Gandhi Rahul Gandhi is a
national leader Rahul juice one person
has taken a strong stand on the unity of
left democratic and secular parties you
know that you are coming from Delhi and
you know the political development
officer what does it stand estándares
very clear it was crystal clear and who
was responsible for a defeat in such a
move it is none other than the chief
first of Kerala mr. provision and party
secretary mr. Cody RIBA Luristan and two
other Politburo Dumbo's who has some
role to play in the Central Committee
and
Bureau of the CPM those people have
destroyed that bridge we also asked
these state Congress leaders which seat
Rahul Gandhi would drop if he wins both
Almighty and Binod we didn't really get
a clear answer but take a look at these
responses and why not
which of these two seats philippic that
the seal at first point is that we will
win the election
afterwards we think about that if Rahul
she wins animator and in why not with
sit will he pixel we leave it to Raji
really leave it to his wisdom what if he
picks Amity
wherever he is he loves India Indonesia
in the people decide
one thing issue are in both conscience
he he will win even when with a
comfortable majority but beyond the hype
and hoopla what impact will this really
have on final presentation we drove into
the interiors of this Hill District to
find out

pointing out earlier as well it has been
decided that the aam aadmi party and the
congress are going to be contesting in
the national capital together but
nothing i will not consider anything
efficient in the time both the leader
come out and you know announcer because
in the past we have been given 21
information by the both the party that
they were in the top four lands but
later on they went on record to say
perhaps something was going on but today
we can confirm I am in a position to
confirm that there have been leading to
the impact with the Congress leader and
our leaders and they have a lead upon a
formula at the Congress party will
confess the number of the Congress want
in Delhi Ahmedabad is also asking for
industry develop a clear formula
directly and it has been choked out is
that the Congress party consisting on
three feet and and the three team will
be given to a multi-party source of

big development because our manicotti
national ambitions has just taken off

wanted some share to be given by the
Congress party in the state of Punjab
they also wanted assurance coming in
from the Congress party on the demand
for a full statehood for Delhi let it's
a very interesting special energy

alliance because the form is pleased and
it can didn't just need it with its own

batted for mr. P Chidambaram and said
that the party should understand that
saddam rom is an asset for the Congress

challenged transfer of officers and
approached the High Court we will be
shortly joined by our correspondent from
Hyderabad in fact Paul woman is joining
me now on the phone line from Hyderabad
Paul this is a scene as a setback for
the Chief Minister himself we had
questioned this transfer of police
officers in Andhra Pradesh but the High
Court really seeing nothing wrong in it
let's write PP in fact the Beyonder
Pradesh High Court has refused to give
interim relief to the transfer of the
three IPS officers the intelligence
chief and espies of two districts had
been transferred by the Election
Commission and prior to this the whilst
ICP had complained to the EC regarding
several problems within the state and
how they were responsible for them but
however the et had not claimed that they
had taken action based on the wiser City
complaint they said we are not giving
any reason for the transfer we are just
answering them and that is when
Chandrababu Naidu and his government
moves the High Court saying that other
polish especially the intelligence chief
does not come under the ambit of the
Election Commission and that they're not
allowed to transfer but however the High
Court has given has refused to interfere
in the matter he said the transfers will
continue the transfers will hold good
and the High Court will not interfere
will not given interim stay in this
particular subject then what was the
primary objection of Chandrababu Naidu
to these transfers Paul was it a mere
matter of making this transfer political
because the EC seems to have got some
valid reason for the transfer of these
officers
completely what political analysts are
telling us is that elections are
underway in on 11th the elections would
be taking place in Andhra Pradesh is not
only the assembly could also
parliamentary elections there any kind
of transfer of officers at this
particular point would only mean that it
would expect that the ruling party
because all the officers most of them
who have been who have been placed in
several districts are all very close
than the woman I do our trusted soldiers
is what we have been told so if
move it can effect of the ruling party
because then that is why is our CP a
gave a complaint saying that the
officers are working at the behest of
the ruling government that is why you
see took action but like I said they've
refused to say we have tons 43 Isis
officers because of the ycp complaint it
is that we are transferring them and we
are not going to give you a reason why
we have transfer them that is when some

India has done and they've given out an
advisory as of now so far saying that
they are least interested in whatever
achievement is there on the other side

on your chana scheme in factor this
remember right ahead of berry two weeks
before the state's going to before India
goes in for votes now there's a route
which is being kicked off over the
kisaan scheme let's go across to the pug
gopanna who's joining us from Bengaluru
with more details on that people if you
can just get us details of what exactly
it is that hdk is alleged that Prime
Minister has lied about well time and
again you know whenever both these
leaders we even if you see the you know
campaign trails off by Minister Modi on
history Kumar Swami the issue of palm
loan waiver does come into the picture
you know as during this juncture usually
we've seen several BJP leaders without
at Connecticut government or one on
implementation of the promise on loan
waiver and also we want to highlight how
on the one three there was all the state
government should also provide a list
and yes now it out at the state
government of Karnataka has not even you
know a complete list which you know
things allow a peace center to actually
system birth the amount that could have
been allocated to canonical this is what
he is the buting and he's going on to
say that the Kannada government has done
its P whereas you know it is life at the
BJP spreading well of the genesis of
this problem the bug is the fact that
the kiss on Man three the pradhan mantri
kiss on Vimeo China lies of the fact
that half of the money has to be given
by the state disbursed by the state only
then will the central government
disperse the rest of the amount and
which
has been an ongoing war isn't it that
the kisses are saying that they have not
been compensated and the center turns
around says that it is a sate who has
not paid the states come constantly I've
been blaming especially the non-bjp
states have been blaming the center for
it so is this likely to be one of the
big poll agendas the welfare of kiss ons
the spool season definitely we've
already seen we show farmers taking
center stage of both the parties have in
interest in ensuring that they would the
farmers as you mentioned your schemes in
particular which comments on the center
especially when it reaches the people
with the planting of the BJP government
the state government which is not you
know ruled by the BJP thinks twice to
actually put in their amount of the
education or their amount of part of the
financial part as well because of the
end of it other creditors going to the
BJP you have you know there is there is
some sort of if there's no balance and
that's where the issue really lies and
the ones who are failing to get the
benefit is the power well very

breaking news coming in from the
political circles in the national
capital suspense over Delhi BJP seats
continues after party rejected the first
list of candidates sources are telling
your channel that unhappy with its Delhi
unit for objecting to fielding
celebrities in the national capital for
the looks of our polls the BJP top brass
has asked it to send a fresh list of
probables the list which was finalised
at a meeting of the state units election
committee did not include former
cricketer Gotham Gamble's name whose in
fact candidature is making rounds as a
possible candidate from the New Delhi
seat after he recently joined the party
mowett is joining me live now for more
on this Mohit what exactly is the issue
here this state BJP a unit does not want
these celebrities to be a part of their
candidates list that is to be submitted
to the leadership at centre
well certainly you know it does seem so
pretty what we are getting to know from
party insiders is the fact that you know
there have been a lot of apprehensions
made by the co committee a lot of names
that were you know given to the central
leadership order for seats upon the
parties their tickets to be given from
from Delhi essentially were not of those
who included celebrities and you know
they were also apprehensions raised on
the fact that you know Manoj Tiwary a
former celebrity got a got a ticket in
2014 despite the fact that he did not do
so well from from Gorakhpur in 2009 so
all these things were kept into
concentration and it seems that you know
even Gotham zombies name was dropped
from this list now this list which was
actually given on 22nd of March it had
to anyone names all of you know all of
which have been dropped at the moment by
the Senate leadership and the century
leadership has in fact at any unit to
once again prepare a fresh list and this
should include just not the names from
the core committee we've been given to
understand that you know mainly those 2
ne1 names aware of those members which
were already in the committee and that
is something that this the central
leadership has taken note of and hence
asked them to remove all these names and
rather you know give out a fresh list
which may or no a may or may not include
those names but at the same time you
know they have they have actually
demanded for a fresh list so that is a
moment stay with me let me also bring in
pearl Vina who is also with us on this
broadcast parina here it seems that the
BJP wants to have a counter strategy for
the aam aadmi party because if they want
to include celebrities the clear message
is that because we were out of power in
the national capital we can't show the
work that we have done but we can have
these celebrities to counter the work
that harm our be party represented as
I've done
oh absolutely because you know what is
not final it also the Congress and OP
Alliance and BGP not being in power and
like her rightly you mentioned that they
don't have any work to show and they
would you know they would need some
names and faces which are public figures
and hence celebrities what they think
the card which would play for them so of
course you know we know that as Nirmala
Sitharaman who is closely monitoring and
seeing the list of names and the daily
unit is preparing of course rejected the
first list and they want them to gear up
and come with some names which would
work for the party because also what's
coming up that we could see that by end
of the day today that up and a congress
could contest this together as an
alliance and this could be become a
tough competition or a tough fight for
vodka janta party and hence a bacterium
the parties daily units have to work
twice harder and have to work much
harder to put up a face about Felina
this love-hate relationship between our
motley party and the congress is not do
giving them any benefits you know in
terms of stitching and alliance together
how long before we actually get an
official confirmation on whether or not
they will be contesting elections
together
well what we know from our sources that
today there will be a last round of
meeting between Alma at my party and
Congress because the proposal which is
you know roughly made yesterday
internally inside Congress will be
proposed by Congress party to the Amida
party today and finally after the final
meeting they will officially go both
from Congress and our magma party
whether they'll go ahead or not because
we have seen a lot of drama after an
internal conflict between two factions
of Congress oh one which was headed by
Sheila Dikshit and all her working
presidents and the other was of course
BC Chaco and RJ Martin who was looking
into the groundwork and also getting a
feedback from ground workers as to what
is that people demand and if they do
want an alliance and PC chacruna Joe
Martin is the one who has been
continuously opposing this and took this
matter to Congress president Rahul
Gandhi they had two round of meetings
yesterday and two and then finally
Congress internally made this two three
break your break up and now finally they
will propose this officially to aam
aadmi party we by end of their the day
progresses we expect a final official
statement whether they are playing this
and going ahead together Congress and
our right and will of course keep a
close track on all those developments
with you but we know for the moment
thanks very much and Mohit if I can
request you to stay with me because I
believe you can get us inputs on the
other story that we are moving to",True,en,4986,0,22

and from one of the story with joint
life by I guess ashes at Pune wala
lawyer joins us if bomb la political
analyst also joins the panel Shazia ill
me the Srinagar and Sanjeev Shabazz have
continued to be with us then we come to
foreshadow Hawara the question that is
being asked as this is Congress today in
a very very difficult situation that top
leaders former Chief Minister such as
Ashok Chauhan are actually thinking of
quitting now that's a very significant
statement to make I somebody who served
in the Maharashtra Congress and I was
part of the strategic committee of the
Maharashtra Congress which hired Ashok
Chauhan gee I must tell you that even
though he was the president mr. Rahul
Gandhi was never comfortable with the
idea of him being the president and
taking the decisions and therefore at
every stage whatever decisions could be
taken away from him they were done that
was being done he was a nominee of Sonia
Gandhi north of Rahul Gandhi and
therefore all Gandhi encouraged factions
within the Maharashtra Congress whether
it was petty Raj Chauhan whether it was
money crowd decree whether it was the
other leaders who would have direct
access to Rahul and Rahul
encouraged them and I think it is all of
that that has stayed today I can tell
you in chann the pool seat which they're
talking about they are giving a
candidate Congress workers are saying
that some people may have taken money to
allow the candidate of the BJP to have
such a easy candidate from the Congress
this is the state of the Congress party
and no wonder good people like Ashok
Chavan gee are feeling helpless and they
are on the verge of okay okay now one is
popular to respond things have become so
dire
octopus / - a dagger a symbolic as
Maharajah 'this worked awesome Amla the
question that is being asked is that the
kind of dealings within the Congress
party are creating this kind of dissent
and nobody is manufacturing this that
tape is there for all to see
Ashok Chauhan has not completely
distanced from this tape he is not
denied its existence or said that it was
a completely fake conversation the
question is that the issues that are
shocked JaJuan has referred to a very
very real Asif Bhamra you see
you see mother there's very selective
cherry-picking to sensitize the
headlines unfortunately I mean it could
be a general and a regular conversation
between a Choctaw and because of we know
and I have a problem when you say this
is cherry-picking there is an audio tape
which we have which we have broadcast
over here is there a similar audio tape
that exists for other political parties
please bring it was it Lee himself is
not denying these charges no no I said
bomber he himself is not Italian your
signature be bleeped let me complete
because you you were taking half of my
affair and I'm completely biased prop
just to save your position the problem
is that we need the mother of the
problem is that we need you know why do
we need all this I mean even a headline
in the Kaipara dushashana gossip amla a
tsubame you are not you know I find it
strange that your only form of Defense
today's offense to attack the reporting
to attack this saying this is cherry
picking and in fact I want to take this
question of course I don't want to take
this question I want to take this
question once again I want to take those
questions which are say we shall meet
before I come to a solution Akasha today
today today today it appears it appears
when one reports on factual
circumstances on tapes that are not even
being denied then the only option that
people have to try to defend themselves
as to attack the media
hereis I would like to just tell us if
homology at this point of time that in
any time the elections and they are
defections of senior leaders if at all
even rumored to be so it does become
news and here is an audiotape which is
not being the veracity of which is not
being himself by the Congress mr. Baba
is mr. Bhalla you are not able to make a
coherent argument when I gave you a
chance to let someone else at least make
that argument please you can respond to
it later later at you speak let her make
up points so bond the point that you
make is that it should not be news at
all one the point that you know I was
just merely responding to the fact that
he said that it should not be news at
all I think this is election time any
defection such as senior leaders and
we're looking at talking about less than
a joke Jumanji talking about and not
denying the tail on which is being heard
al Sabbagh let me finish re let me
finish you've said it you've said
cherry-picking four times use repeating
yourself let me finishing what I'm
saying for the first night and then
you're gonna continue repeating yourself
ad nauseam because that's where it is
news second and most importantly because
there's a senior leader and they have
been many such stories and it's happened
before
if we heard what Himanta Biswa Sarma ji
who joined the BJP said as to how around
and they treated him so there are many
many such presidents okay okay okay okay
shorty I think you've made a very
significant point over there I want to

poon abolish as upon avala even if this
is as mr. Duchesne Nagar insists a
conversation between a party worker and
his leader and if it comes out in the
public domain should we really treat it
as a trivial matter
should we completely be ignoring it at a
time such as this which is so crucial
which is the locus of Elections
mother of Maharashtra make Congress has
been in power for majority of the time
and it is a good chance always for
Congress NCP to come back to power so we
are not talking about a private
conversation between two individuals we
are talking about the party which can
give power to the state of Maharashtra
and represented public representatives
and if the deciding of the tickets is
such that the ejection of that tradition
'it is himself feeling so disgusted and
frustrated then it raises questions that
whether there is internal democracy in
the congress to the extent that they
even listening to the president of the
state unit point number two whether they
are listening to the Congress workers
gen mana and point number three the
Prasad Jatin Prasad did not deny it when
the media went and asked him simple
question that sort of BJP joined curry
he could have said no okay you asked
that question if the answer is a simple
no okay did not say no that's why the
media changed your story yes yes yes I
think this I think the media is the
softest punching bag is very easy all
editions have eternally done this and
they will continue to do this I don't I
don't expect much I don't expect much
more from our political leaders but
Sanjeev ask them let me come to the key
issue let me come to the key issue
sanjeev she was there which is that
there is a serious problem not just in
the Maharashtra Congress but also when
other top leaders are thinking or
talking about changing their not just
their constituencies but openly coming
out and speaking out against decisions
that are taken within the party
Sanjeev see Congress is a party which
clearly looks like it is fighting
battles on different fronts and they're
also fighting a battle within because
it's clearly on the backfoot the BJP
looks like the front-runner the Congress
is confiding a rearguard battle still
all opinion polls are saying that
they're going to double their seats so
and on the other hand while I may not be
a politician but I am still entitled to
my view I haven't heard any discussion
on the internal democracy in parties on
the part in five years okay
I haven't heard any debate on mr.
conderley son crossing over a former
chief minister's son crossing over so
yes there there is an element of
subjectivity and and channel
let me complete just one minute late
Sanjeev completed spoiler then I'll
cover you completely appoint Sergey no
no it's all right
company can go ahead I think I think
those who understand all have already
understood where I am trying to see the
thing is that we as a country as a
vibrant democracy everybody's also
understanding what is happening so yes
Congress is having its own set of
problems all right at the same time
Congress problems are always being
exemplified across most of the media
both is a true ok strange about it ok if
you finished your point I'm gonna allow
Georgia to debate you on that Shazia
what Sanjeev Shrivastav is saying is
that whether similar things happen with
the BJP and there is no discussion or no
debate around what happens within the
BJP and internal democracy of the BJP
you're responsible then I'm sorry it's
Angie Sanjeev is my senior some gg's
your senior to me and you knows much
more about politics and many of us here
and is reported more and but I have done
a fair amount of reporting and every
time there are there is there are there
is dissent about a vertical distribution
over BJP in the BJP camp there are
stories and they are protests and all
that is covered just says this is just
as mr. canler son crossing over became a
news point so will this because there is
no where there is a BJP no let me finish
saying what have things in Jeep no
Sanjeev gee and let me finish saying
what I'm saying so it is always a point
of discussion with mr. candidates and
crossing over all the news had mr.
tandoori crossed over it would have been
no facility not very very big news all
right all right all right all right
unfortunately we were discussing
internal
sent within the Congress somehow this
has transformed into a discussion of

tracking at this our there's massive
speculation about Rahul Gandhi
contesting in Kerala particularly the
why not seat where in fact he's going to
contest the 2019 looks of our polls from
Kerala Congress leaders are delighted
over the reports and the Congress local
chief has compared Kerala Pradesh
Congress chief has compared confirmed
that Rahul was positively considering
the offer listening PCC unit has sent in
their their desire and request that
Congress president should contest there
we thank them for for their effort as
also expression of their love and
affection and Congress president will
positively consider it well I'm
delighted by the news if true if it's
officially announced that Rahul Gandhi
will contest from a constituency in
Kerala this shows first of all that we
have a candidate who is confident that
he's going to be the next prime minister
and he wants to show that he's electable
on both the north and the south of the
country I think that's a real question
to ask Narendra Modi does he have the
confidence in Rahul Gandhi as we like to
contest in the South if so we welcome
him to Thiruvananthapuram let him come
and challenge me here we give him a good
fight for his money
I prefer vision the Kerala Chief
Minister says that by round contesting
against the Left Front in Kerala what is
the message he is trying to convey says
Rahul is fighting against the left in
Kerala and not the BJP do you think
that's the right message that's the
question coming in from Kerala Chief
Minister pin arrived vision listening or
let me take the question across to
Shilpa who's joining us at this moment
for more on the story Shilpa very
pertinent question being raised by Vinny
revision because ultimately it's the
index of opposition unity that the
opposition believes will only deliver a
result against this current NDA
government well that fed model in fact
that Chief Minister entire chain
statements seem to suggest that the
speculation over Rahul Gandhi's
candidature combined archons 20 or
rather if you decide to contest on the
Binod constituency then it is going to
go against the spirit of my husband and
he of course says that at the time and
there are so many things that are
happening nationally do you think this
is the right decision to make what
message is this trying to convey in
Kerala the Congress will be stating will
let's head on and you know it's not a
DGP that we're trying to defeat it's the
less government that they're trying to
defeat so that is that message that the
Congress wants to convey at this point
in time and when as reported
specifically asked him as to whether
he's suggesting as to the secular
parties coming together nationally he
says that it's understood from what I
just said this is this is this a message
that Rahul Gandhi and the Congress party
wants to give out to the entire country
that they are trying to defeat the left
rather than the BJP all right Shilpa
thanks so much for joining us with on
that particular story in fact I also
want to try and connect with a Vivek
errand alum who's also with us live at
this moment Vivek
very significant statements coming in
from the left they are not at all
pleased that Rahul Gandhi is going to
contest from Kerala are they also
perhaps a little nervous about the
fortunes of the left in the slopes uh by
election if Rahul Gandhi contests there
because the Kerala Congress leaders
certainly believe that Rahul Gandhi
contesting will boost the prospects of
the Congress itself in the state of
exactly mother that's what the Congress
leaders and even the Congress skaters
feel that the presence of Rahul Gandhi
in Vinod which is the biggest constancy
in Kerala and is also the safest bastion
of K of Congress party in Kerala and
that could actually boost the morale of
the Congress workers and they believe
that you know Congress could win all the
twenties Lok Sabha seats in care life
Rahul Gandhi you know contest over
because they feel that you know this is
the one one constancy which shares his
ball which which has or you know which
has constancies from all the three or
district that's Malappuram Calicut and
why not this constancy was formed in
2009 at that point of time the Congress
candidate won with a brutal majority of
1 lakh 50,000 and then it came down to
20,000 when mi shahnawaz was contesting
over there but still we can tell you
that this particular constituency why
not is a safe constancy for Congress and
that is the reason and they believe that
the presence of Rahul Gandhi contesting
from here from why not which will make a
huge impact for the party and well
absolutely certainly of course whether
Rahul Gandhi contests or not is now it
seems at least a little immaterial given
the fact that it has already sparked off
such a huge controversy in such sharp
reactions coming in from the left and
the Congress leaders thanks so much for
joining us for those updates - hope as
well as Vivek was slipping into a quick
break now",True,en,28291,283,200

it is the most sensational news break of

Pitroda has insulted our brains by
claiming that attacks like Pulwama keep
happening and it was wrong to target
Pakistan every single time imagine that
in the same breath he gave terrorists on
a clean chit on the 26/11 Mumbai attacks
that left over 160 Indian people dead in
fact he even asked the India government
for proof of the Bala Court air strikes
listening to the deplorable remark that
was made by Sam Pitroda that has created
political ripples across the country
attacks happen all the time
attack attack happened during what was
this Mumbai Taj Hotel and over.i hotel
okay I mean we could have then reacted
and just send our planes but that's not
the right approach according to me
because eight people come and do
something you don't jump on the entire
nation I would like to know a little
more because I have read in New York
Times and other newspapers what did we
really attack did we really kill 300
people
I don't know that on a day when a senior
Congress leader has dared to give a
clean chit to Pakistan joining me live
or news or direct is the woman who will
take on Congress president Rahul Gandhi
in his home turf in Amity smithy Ronnie
Union Minister joins us today on news
our direct smithy Ronnie Sam Pitroda has
he insulted matters by questioning the
Bala caught airstrikes asking for
further proof on whether 300 people had
really been killed in Pakistan through
those airstrikes
I think naviga what is outrageous is
that Rahul Gandhi's advisor today not
only questions the capacity of the
Indian Armed Forces but he also holds
human life with contempt the nonchalant
way in which he dismissed innocent lives
that were lost during the 26/11
attack is not only a political shocker
but honestly as a human being it is one
of the most distasteful statements I
have ever heard the fact that mr.
Pitroda talks about the New York Times
if he'd just taken the pains to read the
in-depth analysis and reportage by
Indian media houses across the spectrum
possibly he would not have questions but
then mr. Pitroda today reflected the
true character the true nature of the
Congress party it speaks in folk tongues
imagine we are possibly close to 10
hours since the statement was made by
mr. Pitroda we have not seen a single
tweet or statement which reprimand stand
Pitroda for taking this not only
politically a most disdainful approach
but also as an Indian one of the most
reprehensible statements ever made but
well miss Ruth irani mr. Sam Pitroda is
the Overseas chief of the Congress party
he probably lives abroad more than he
lives in India and he says he's been
reading the New York Times and other
publications world over rather than
reading the Indian media so he probably
believes those publications more so Miss
Smith hi Ronnie
I'm a loner is anybody who seeks for
evidence or seeks for confirmation on
how many people died in the Baloch or
air strikes are they all anti Indians
anti-national
I think naviga I think naviga there are
two three parts of the questions that
you posed to me that I seek to answer
one in that mr. Pitroda seems to be
clever by half by claiming that he has
limited knowledge and if that is what
his claim is no wonder is chella turns
out to be half-baked as mr. Gandhi is on
many a political issues insofar as
questioning the capacity of the Indian
Armed Forces on many on occasion and
representative of the armed forces have
spoken to the nation at large with
regards to what happened at Bala code
if mr. Pitroda deems it not fit to
believe the Indian establishment to
believe even the Indian Armed Forces let
him know at least the
world stands United with India in this
pursuit of justice against Pakistan that
you claim is terrorist on so if not New
York Times if you're taken even the
pains to look at times now possibly it'd
be much more informed but this is not a
case of misinformation this is not a
question of doubt
I think the inhumane way in which mr.
Sam Pitroda literally like I said in my
earlier comment was nonchalant enough to
dismiss the lives of innocents lost
during 26/11 the way he wore lightly all
the evidence that has been produced time
and again by India with regards to
Pakistan's intervention Pakistan support
to terrorist groups in India I think
that it in some way also is reflective
of the inner mindset of the Congress
party because as you and the rest of the
country knows this gentleman is the
advisor to Rowell Gandhi the Congress
president and the fact like I reiterate
it's been 10 hours since his statement
and mr. Gandhi is not deemed at fit to
distance himself or reprimand mr.
Pitroda mr. Pitroda today has the silent
support of Rahul Gandhi for the
atrocious statement that he made against
the Indian Armed Forces and against the
civilians who lost their lives during
the 26/11 attack well the Congress has
distanced itself by saying this is of
mr. Pitroda personal opinion but Miss
Smith irani the question everybody will
ask you is that you must boil into
digital is very Rhoda and why not now we
can ask any citizen of course the Guru
speaks and is accepted by the cella
so much so that the China has maintained
a stoic silence for the past 10 hours
knowing that the nation is outraged
knowing that martyrs families are hurt
knowing that those who lost their near
India once during 26/11 today seek an
explanation from the Congress president
knowing this mr.
Gandhi has maintained a studied silence
and when you say that this is his
personal opinion the question that
begets the statement of yours is that is
this what congressman in private and
personally feel about India

Nicole singh sidhu nakai teen so
terrorists dead yes or no what was the
purpose
where were you operating are you
operating terrorists or trees was it an
election gimmick same statements being
made by provision saying even mamta
Banerjee so do you think all these
opposition leaders who are questioning
the number of people who were killed in
the air air strikes are actually only
question
because they don't believe in the army
or they have the right to ask questions
to any government
I think naviga you digress from the
statement when mr. Pitroda made he was
very like I said nonchalant very casual
about the fact he has it with a red eye
he was very casual about the fact that
ha America's top Santa but we did not
attack an entire country or bring to
justice terrorists after the 26/11
attack that means mr. Pitroda today
reflects the mindset that Armed Forces
personnel was speaking about especially
when very respected Armed Forces
personnel came out and said that the
then government had an option to bring
to justice these terrorists and the
organization supporting such terrorist
groups but the den government led by the
Congress Party chose not to do so

trouble in store for portal our midwives
over Farouk times now has access denies
line of questioning the ni said to ask
the midwives the source of funding for
expensive equipment like the tar of
treachery antenna which was exposed by
times now promoting this I want to go
across to our coral a senior editor
Internal Security nikunj cargoes joining
us live at this moment we also have with
us Pradeep data live Nichols let me come
to you first what exactly really is the
development as far as the ni is
concerned because we understand this is
the proof which was found the
communication equipment and now that
really is what mayor wise will be
quizzed on well mother the point is that
Midway's had issued a Glenda
clarification on the back of that
clarification about the equipment being
found at his residence I asked the
national investigation agency officials
that Miller says that this is a 2 MB
Lee's line and he has taken it in the
routine course of Internet connectivity
that is required by him for preferring
his religious activity chinks the
national investigation agency says that
it is certainly not a regular Internet
connectivity as far as they are
concerned and they say that if it is a 2
MB leased line of whatever Internet
connectivity it is why can't me wires
come to Delhi or why can't Midway face
and IA and explain to them what are the
contours of this entire equipment a
national investigation agency is claim
is that this is a vendor to vendor sale
equipment it is extremely high-end and
sophisticated also is a costly piece of
equipment they want to know the source
of funding they say that clearly this is
in violation of most of the norms that
are there in place across the country
regarding Internet telephony equipment
and Internet telephony connectivity
therefore this is certainly not
run-of-the-mill equipment regularly used
by individual users like you and me and
our viewers at their residences is what
the national investigation agency
claimed and they completely rubbish what
mere wires had put out to a press
release the other day in in the sense
that this is a part of a regular
Internet connectivity and that every
agency was aware of its existence and
why also go to the extent of saying that
if it is so why can't me where's come
and explain his position to the national
investigation agency absolutely that's
certainly a pertinent question let me
take that across to Pradeep as well
firstly this is a very pertinent
question and really why mid wise is
continuing to evade the law because they
he has clearly denied coming to Delhi
for the questioning of the NI when he is
faced with such clear evidence of that
communication equipment if he has
nothing to hide why is he running away
from the agency mother you're absolutely
right in fact saw me resume before work
is not about law and he has to infect
answer to the questions of my ni what in
fact Snickers was rightly saying that
there was 40 feature antenna that was
recovered by NIU ting at 8:00 on 26th of
February and besides with the sake he is
related to sheriff earning we asked his
question in front of whether a various
other security agencies also because
never eyes we have seen that he had been
trying to break up religion saying that
because he's a religious preacher that
is why he's been targeted even some of
the political party leaders including
the one of the line
Mehbooba Mufti also came to his rescue
saying that he's a religious leader but
question arises can a religious leaders
take hawala money that is one question
because nobody's about law that way in
fact many other religious leader would
not have been cooling their heels behind
lockup for jail and dirty deals but here
he is a religious leader he's trying to
take that alibi and trying to project
that he's so he will not be going to
Delhi and the second question is that he
cannot be the beggar cannot be the
chosen in the same way that criminal
cannot be choosing where actually he has
to be investigated whether he's to be
investigated is she another or rather is
to be investigated in Delhi when already
he has been issued someone he has to go
to Delhi and get proper investigation
done the girl's problem being that in
the past also they had been enjoying all
that premium on separatism and they had
been using that the premium so we have
seen in the past Yasin Malik had also
been moving scot-free and but now I
think sentiment has made up its mind
that they have tightened their dues and
I and I is definitely going to question
me right so to front van
wherefrom he got the money because
hawala money came to him for tariff
funding because this man had been
working as a kind of an ATM machine who
was in fact verse one sponsoring sports
stone pelting in many other areas right
there are already proof that is a winner
and I the second thing gives wide 14
feet antenna was here because this was a
hotline where he was getting dictation
from across the border so that
can sponsor talented actors and also
destabilize a situation in Valley so
Rohini religious preacher his job is
only to promote religion so he believed
as a religious leader he should
certainly should have been there
promoting a peace in the valley instead
it seems that he was taking dictation
from Pakistan but I want to before I go
further I want to quickly ask a question
of Nicole's Nicole
what are the options before the NI if
midwives continues to evade at the law
if he continues to the weight coming
down to New Delhi for questioning how
does the ni plan to proceed in this case
the matter of the fact is the options
are similar as available in case of any
individual accused if the if Midwest
despite being served repeated someone's
by an investigating agency under the
mandate to serve under the mandate to
investigate the case refuses to join the
probe he would have to be arrested at
some point of time because that
questioning has to be completed unless
the questioning is completed the case
cannot move forward a charge sheet
cannot be filed in the case and this is
recovery of personal property in mid vs.
residence who if not Midway who else
will answer for these questions so this
is an ia has already offered him
foolproof security he can come and
record his statement and will be given
the kind of security he wants but he
will have to answer questions about this
Internet telephony connectivity source
of fun purchase a source of purchase and
installation who the individuals
responsible and people who carried out
the installation of this equipment at
his residence all that he will have to
yield necessarily to the national
investigation agency there is no choice
in available in that all right Nico and

national was attacked rather he faced
backlash by locals after he tried to
attack the traffic cop who was stopping
him from breaking traffic rules
according to Delhi traffic police this
African national was riding on the wrong
side of the road and instead of paying
the fine he started attacking the
traffic cop there were some passers-by
who came to the rescue of the cop who
then assaulted this African national as
well Priyanka party is joining me live
now for more on this Priyanka if you can
first tell us the exact sequence of
events what happened there that started
really this you know sort of a situation
between this African national and the
locals
[Music]
yes and a pretty I was talking to one of
the senior officers they are they're
verifying the exact location where this
incident happened that I'm sorry
hi - but you know what is called but
fact of the matter is that this instant
is is very shocking to see that how
people and the African Nationals are
getting into a scuffle just on the issue
of a challenge we know that in this area
of us Galka area they have been many
scuffle which has happened within the
locals and those African national and
this time the cops are also trying to
shave their self the the fact which we
have got to know is that they were being
issued challenge by the traffic cops but
in the meanwhile they started attacking
the man the African national who work on
the scooty started attacking the local
police and to save the local police the
people came in between there's no
company so far which has been fired by
the African actually I was just a short
while back I was talking to
representatives of the Delhi chapter of
African Nationals so they are saying
that this has bring him become a common
phenomena by the traffic police to
charge more money from us this is only
the allegation which has been put in by
them but this kind of fizzle being
caught on camera is suddenly shocking to
see dr. Pillai it is shocking to say
because at no cost people should be
allowed to take law in their own hands
but at the same time try ANCA is there
any official complain that this African
national has lost because if he was on
the right side of the law then he should
have also followed the rules right
oh yes and the PDR the officers are
saying that they are verifying the
location where this particular incident
happened this could be wrong Binda pod
or this could be the other so the
ferocity of this particular video is
being verified by the local police but
just a short while back I spoke to the
representatives of the African Union
right here who are the representing the
telly chapter they are saying that
according to their information this
incident happened on Monday but
certainly this kind of incident
happening on the street fight between
the foreign nationals and the local
police and the local people also
assisting the local police in the fight
it's very disturbing all right okay
Priyanka in fact let's just once again
play out for our viewers the exact
sequence that has been caught on camera
there was an African national who was
riding on the wrong side of the road
when the traffic cops tried stopping him
he started assaulting the cop and to
rescue the cop there were some locals
there's some by standards who then
started assaulting this African national

your own verification are you certain

very clear about one thing I am not
supposed to be in every spot to do the
investigation the Constitution does not
give me the right to do that
I'm not but I am supposed to respond to
any smoke that is going to be managed
only when there is a fire so if there is

it if I got an anonymous call I got

I get people telling me about specific
details about a thigh Airlines safe
flight that landed from Bangkok about
the true kg of gold that was confiscated
almost being confiscated before the

something needs to be done and I hear as
the media says see there are so many
things that the media brings to the
notice of the authorities there are so
many trials that are happening in the
country because the media have done
their homework of bringing those truths
to the public domain so as a as up as
the central minister who is right now in
Bengal I'm supposed to respond to that
but if you see my tweet I very clearly
said that I'm not going to make a
political comment I have put it brought
it to the people taking it to the people
who are supposed to do the
investigations and are going to verify
the facts so I have lifted two that I
needed to act and I acted the truth is
going to be in front of you very soon
investigation absolutely people are
talking about it as I said if there is
smoke there must be a fire whether the
fire was real or it is just gossip
all going to be in the public domain
very soon but at the mall joins us for
more on the Samanas you would put that
question across to babul Supriyo Wylie
says that this is information he has
received from secondary sources he's
also at this point of time not willing
to stick his neck out on this
information where he is making certain
political charges against the TMC top
leaders it's election time and babul
Supriyo no matter what he says whether
he's saying this in individual capacity
or any other capacity cannot pick a very
sign then he is a BJP Union Minister and
he's also a sitting looks of an MP from
a sample which is investment goal so
babul Supriyo Sweeting about an incident
and attributing it to media reports will
certainly have more relevance more
significant and essentially he is trying
to make an allegation against a senior
leader of a political party and against
the family of that of the leader trying
to stress on the fact that that family
member of the leader while coming to
Kolkata from Thailand had apparently
smuggled in from some gold which was
caught of the hands of customs and
apparently customs had the then- offer
of without any proper verification maybe
under duress or maybe under any sort of
a pressure but the point is mother
having checked myself the customs
department has not really made any entry
of any incident of this nature that
happened on Saturday or early on
Saturday morning one second of all there
is no picture or visual proof of an
incident which has found a mention in to
media reports attributed by babul
Supriyo in his tweet number three the
customs people have not really admitted
the allegations against them or dismiss
these allegations they are maintaining
absolute silence and number four we are
also hearing their words and
interventions or foolish people and what
time or what junction investor
intervention came we are unsure because
there is no sincerity proof of that
so this juncture babul Supriyo making
certain comments about about the
political parties leader and the family
even though politically sounds very
significant but then on the ground how
much of it is true only depends on
investigation yes but we should feel
wants investigation but who would
investigate the matter and based on what
there is a big question mark
negate it customs have to believe and
total twinning customs that we believe
already and tomorrow stay with us let's
listen and once again to what Bob will

allegations amazing well I want to be

by the manner in which Priyanka Gandhi
has been moving from place to place you
know visiting various temples and also
stopping by at various you know massage
and other such to just places it does
seem that way party now is asking people
electorate her followers as well as
supporters of the BJP not to fall for
the ploy that and the kind of narrative
that Bianca Gandhi seems to be reading
before 2019 elections she is clearly
saying that the Congress party members
over the last you know six decades have
been ruling India but so far they
haven't done anything credible if you
talk about poverty you talk about
corruption you talk about unemployment
mentioned over there are main
characteristic that uma bharti suddenly

want to bring in the BJP spokesperson
very quickly because we are also know
called Delhi and Haryana Haryana is ten
seats and Delhi seven if we don't just
to put out those numbers
Nizam pie how would it look very quickly
if you just look at the overall number
for Delhi Delhi there you can see it at
this moment what are we saying let's go
straight to the seat tally you can see
the word share the app has about twenty
point two percent of the vote but if you
look at the seat share the India is
picking up all seven of those seats and
if you are adding to that tally you can
see and there's not only too short of a
majority viewers too short so we are
already at that point where the NDA is
coming back there's no debate 122 for
the UPA 120 for the others even if they
were to combine their not as many as the
NDA yeah okay let's now call out Haryana
ten seats in Haryana let's have a look
at that that number goes up to five one
nine out of 543 to 77 game over
Modi's back as Prime Minister albeit he
needs his alliances he needs these
answers which is yes very is this with
the Congress Palin so Allah well they
combine together what is a situation
where we don't know we don't realize
that a J Martin will be able to tell you
better because if you go by Sheila
Dikshit she's going to tell you that
doesn't help but Pavan Verma the
question therefore is if the Congress
come together it will pose a very major
challenge to the BJP
the legal challenge against Martin
Moxon's hypothesis being extended by
Pawan Varma well it hasn't happened as
of now and that's the question I want to
ask you Sanjeev stavast where's Rahul
Gandhi misread the electoral game simple
has he not been mature enough many
people have said he's not been able to
tie up those important alliances that
could have seen this becoming a more
even fight
I mean they're very crucial in Delhi and
you pee you pee I think the house is
still not out of the boot no no behind
be honest understanding it's not even
eyes done Maharashtra's Morris has done
Karnataka is done whether it works
certain ground or not your poll shows it
won't and I kind of agree with main goal
hasn't on Kannada happen Bengal is more
or less yeah Big Oil is another one very
important study should have tied up on
each opposition candidate so yes but you
know they were caught between devil and
the deep sea whatever that you have to
think a little bit about your
organization your cadre etcetera my I
have one big question my goalie don't be
so light on Rahul Gandhi you know what
modey modey has successfully used this
period of the last two months to do what
many people thought he couldn't everyone
said he was scaring away his alliance
partners he's brought them back in Assam
Chile's I've actually seen mr. Modi more
than Raqqa in the last so many years in
so it's not a question of being close to
somebody my question is a larger
question now if you asking with Jimmy
throw light on is that yes the
conventional wisdom was that people
wanna it was a close contest boastful
wama NDA mr. Modi has an advantage now
the bigger question is like you said Rao
that it it's two weeks since air strikes
and this momentum will consolidate the
question is whether this momentum of
nationalism patriotism which suits BJP
will consolidate or will people return
to bread-and-butter issues that's the
that's the bigger unknown of this
election rate okay know the answer -
solidity let me ask you sir
the hypothesis is air strikes new pope
acharya the real surgical strikes have
happened on the opposition because of
bala court and other bread-and-butter
issues ki baat ot if it was about jobs
if it was about agrarian distress if it
was about em SMEs are pho now Hodja tu
would have lost this election
before pull out I want to say hell three
weeks support if this would have been
the fact the last three state assembly
elections would happen in the first week
of December
yeah Eco Roger a Scottie karate yoga
that the month of September October and
November were the worst for BJP yes on
two three accounts number one at the
time there was an is strong opposition
on certain issues like GST and other
thing there wasn't a CST Act issue there
was a on one hand there is a cast
conflict which is Congress was able to
dexterously use is still what they were
able to achieve in Madhya Pradesh let's
vote Dennis in Rajasthan one lakh forty
thousand odd votes more than us so in
the best possible scenario what they
have achieved and if you look at your
survey the things are going in the
reverse direction it is not just because
of
Mallicoat in my opinion the decisive
manner in which cinerender Modi is
taking this country ahead definitely it
is the key factor which is motivating
eternal covenants vindication of it's
not responding one more thing if it is
said that the nationalism issue suits
the BJP and the fundamental issues like
bread and butter are occurring together
more go large imposing is also because
phone itself to be a mighty next in the
last two that's the point that's the
point I was making that is the last
three weeks in the
yeah there recognizes line and they
aren't in the same time period the
question is what has changed in the last
three weeks that is actually not made
not mating I would like opposition
parties who are not even an alliance
just accommodation to make that leap
what is it about round Gandhi I want to
ask that question
Nishant Varma what is it about Rao
Gandhi what is it Joey Singh let me ask
you Joey sing joy sing today your leader
echoed my avati and said stay out stay
out don't confuse your messing up you're
messing up my prospects why do you
believe Rao Gandhi is a blunderbuss
around we've already announced an
alliance seem divided cease nominations
are taking place but I would really like
to ask Jay two questions right no no
ma'am you answer my question don't
divert why I'm asking you why don't you
trust Gandhi you have no faith in him
I will not divert no confidence no
confidence in round 10 I've answered
your question each other you can
interpolate what you want but I still
want to RJ that's when the survey was
started you stated two things this was
about the Union budget which is
non-existent and this was about
interpolation of personalities
regionally so yes Bala coat was there
and I think we supported the BJP fully I
hope that fighting terror is an issue
but there's no dichotomy between the
real issues and nationalism at least not
for the Samajwadi Party and the BSP so
yes we have crops to harvest we still
have the minimum support price is not
given we still have the sugarcane
farmers issue we're on the point then
that null in made one second null in
made a very interesting point and one
must go back to his point that someone
has shown greater alacrity Pavan Varma
on the ground this was always going to
be a game of maths in chemistry
let's not forget this you've been in
power five years we can see that there
have been Laguna's in your governance
record but somehow you've been able to
very quickly
Piru it Bala code came in as
big disrupter but you use that time to
stitch up these alliances is that the
difference today
someone's acceptability in someone's
liability Rahul
sometimes I think round the Congress
party must decide whether these
elections are an intermediate stop to
the larger goal of reviving the Congress
party in the long run or is it about
opposition unity in an effective manner
that defeats the BJP in the next
election if they haven't yet decided on
this they are going to go wrong on
alliances and that is going to
hemorrhage their words even a
non-existent anions for instance with
the BSP or the Congress fighting as a
third force in U P or the Congress not
seeing the obvious logic from their
point of view of aligning with the harp
in Delhi and within a percussion in
Haryana and Punjab all of this seems to
indicate to me that perhaps the Congress
is more interested in a long-term
revival of the Congress party then of
opposition unity for this election very
interesting very very interesting point
Nishant Verma is this the reason why is
this the reason why we're seeing what we
are seeing one second Nishant Varma
comes in first he's raised dissenter
come on - yes the chances are going to
agree me
first of all let's not reduce this
debate to a hindi movie where you know
picture katha municipal a actor hero to
have of Gabbar Singh Kohli Marg a hero
Vijaya you know this is Indian politics
India is a vast country 543 seats nobody
is going to forget the manifesto of the
winning party of 2014 nobody is going to
forget the unemployment very quickly
under your nose have a look at the
numbers gone through a lot to come
please allow me to complete and allow me
to complete allow me to complete
please elaborate the country you know
country is not going to forget because
this is exactly what happens with BJP
and this is a repeat it is happening
they become arrogant 2004 they lost
because of arrogance 2019 they will lose
whatever the numbers are there I am NOT
going to confirm them at all oppai
because they're going to lose on the
arrogance we just heard the BJP
spokesperson not complying with the Bala
code statement that in the narrative
that you are giving he's talking about
development and stuff like that and
there is where they're going to lose
please understand there is exactly where
the Nishant varma you're not answering
the question for some reason in the last
three weeks
mr. Modi has been seen as an acceptable
leader and route Gandhi has been seen as
a liability now let me try with someone
a VJ what is easier doesn't work
completely for India what I would like
to add to what Pavan Varma was saying
Nishant if you disallow me I would like
to add wherever I see your contacts
happening it's coming because of
regional parties where the Congress is
not held up its end of the opposition
game at all where is the BJP has shown
remarkable intelligence at the time and
is not strong as it has gone and seeded
seeds - opposition's
it is it is gone and had generous deals
with the opposition the BJP which ran
India's first successful coalition
government and artillery was fight has
not forgotten those lessons okay in the
last lap it managed to do that this is
as much about arithmetic this election
will be the election but
yeah run away with Mirage
so there's a problem here there's a
problem suddenly no one second one
second one second I think you made a
good point sub on the tree you
reiterated what puffin one more question
yet more accommodating there is no doubt
about wanting you look at that number
122 upa 122 you piay a large number of
those seats will be Congress perhaps
they even closing and 100 will have to
do that at 9 o'clock we'll do the maths
nah Vika we'll be back with the exact
numbers of the BJP and the Congress
party but I want to ask you sir what
about this big talk about happening for
example there is finally a code five
days after this tutti five days after
Bala caught when this poll closed mr.
Shah da Cunha whadda you need to respond
to me
the BJP by itself is nowhere close to
what it was 283 in 2014 is this because
despite Bala code people as Nishant
Verma and others are saying I have not
forgotten that their lives actually
suffered simple question sir if I may
sir if I may be let me be very balanced
of course the BJP as you are showing
into January was facing a lot of trouble
but you have to as much as this is about
Bala code is also about once dates are
now it's Moody's leadership kicks in
that time people were not thinking it's
now becoming Modi versus who it is going
to become a presidential contest more
this personality is going to add weight
and that is also an element that you
have to see okay two questions we are
going to take a short break to question
we're going to have a
more seats out precisely about 30 more
seats will put out and we'll see if
those numbers dramatically change in
favor of the NDA do they become more
comfortable but before that two points
keep in mind viewers the NDA has made it
past the halfway mark on its own there
are still 44 seats left to be declared
here but times now VMR is the gut Panda
not being seen as a credible durable
alternative and as rau Gandhi's
existential crisis begun we're coming
right back to those questions and more
numbers stay with us

are the West Bengal four chairs coming
up for you on the big screen and look at
look at these numbers the UPA gets eight
percent so Rahul Gandhi gets eight
percent war chair in West Bengal but
look at this number ladies and gentlemen
30-plus breaches the thirty percent
margin which really opens up the game
for the BJP here in West Bengal 32
percent for the BJP and this is the
Trinamool Congress at 39 still the
dominant force but BJP breaches the 30%
mark and look at the left getting
decimated in West Bengal 15 percent and
Jay Jay that's the story we need to tell
but let's first look at the numbers
before we can analyze the numbers and
that's the seat a big zero for the UPA
for the Congress party with its eight
percent warts 11 percent J in January we
showed about eight or nine yeah in
January we were at 1099 it's gone up by
two seats gone up by two seats in the
poster 30 percent scenario and 31 seats
to the Trinamool Congress so J that's
how that's how the numbers stack up with
your be january d harvest numbers yeah
yeah 9 to 11 increase for the BJP 32 to
31 for congress which is 2 down from his
third 2014 9 now 3 down from 2014 that's
right yeah so J with a 30% plus watch it
yeah that's the BJP get 11 because when
I've spoken to BJP leaders they've been
talking about a number which is higher
than this is that possible yeah now
what's happening is the BJP if you just
look at the map of Fez being all the BJP
is gaining in the upper tribal areas
Aleppo do our cooch behar down to Malda
north it's gaining it has a barricade to
success in the Muslim dominant constants
around bare ample risers worried about
down again there's a barricade to
success around Tom look
but in the northern tribal in urban
calcutta and around and importantly in
the tribal beds of Peru Lea Banco de
beer boom bold food the BJP is putting
up a stiff fight that takes that number
to another so ladies and gentlemen I am
also introducing my panel tonight while
our resident panelists experts continue
to be with us
also joining us tonight is Nietzsche
Chaudhary dr. Dinesh washday will be
with us Amit Mallya faizon Kidwai of the
Samajwadi Party Abhishek Bachchan
ominous and Raoul Naru acres
spokesperson of the NCP Abhishek
Bachchan to you first is mamta Banerjee
facing a tough battle after the left has
been now displaced with a very very key
and strengthened BJP taking the position
as the Challenger to mamta Banerjee in
West Bengal no I can ask you a question
here can you even name the seats where
there is a chance even three to five
seats where there is a chance of BJP
winning this constituency's the reason
why I am asking is through what share
everything is not getting reflected in
Karnataka Congress vote share was higher
than BJP but BJP ultimately got much
more sales
similarly happened in Chhattisgarh in
chat the MP MP Congress BJP vote share
was higher but government was found by
Congress so vote share doesn't reflect
point 1 and I'm not sure of the accuracy
of the survey secondly we see there what
your resident analyst what he analyzed
that about the Muslim majority districts
there are three Muslim majority
districts from all the musha's of R&D -
food
none of them since 2011 where they are
with Trinamool Congress none of them so
that is that was always with Indian
National Congress and that is not the
idea where any change or any resistance
to be happy is being failed if you want
to actually erode the for share of TMC
you have to see in the other districts
like vault pool like hubli like Perugia
like Midnapore like Arvind Calcutta so
where are the gains actually
yes sir now we will try and get as
detailed as you want and with the
respect to the limitation of the time on
the show take a leap udoit cooch behar
even the 2014 performance of the BJP is
commendable before the 2017 avalanche of
the BJP in the state in the areas that
we polled in areas of joram Bankura we
did find substantial support for the BJP
we even formed support for the BJP in
terms of polarization in areas like Balu
heart miss found support in Kolkata not
so that is roughly the spread from a BJP
speaking of seats mr. Bakshi you're not
seeing the what's written on the wall
and which is that the BJP has been
making huge strides in West Bengal and
it's the 30 percent voting gup-a brief
is breached that level is breached then
seats share really good various real
numbers that are being given here and to
satisfy his argument once the 30 percent
has to be a feature if you hold share of
a ITC all in the Trinamool Congress has
been more or less same in 2014 and 2019
now what has happened is the Hindu votes
of a challenger to Mamata Banerjee in
West Bengal there has been some amount
of what shifting from left front to
betray a BJP now even if the same amount
of votes what left got in in 2014 if
they get busy abrogates now it hardly
matters because they at that time also
we were getting 34 states now you are
showing 32 6 but what matters is we left
could get only 2 since last time
investment on and this time you are
showing India to be 11 seats that's
where the catch is well now let Mehta is
is this argument Bible what Mr barkis
say no now I think that there is
whichever way you slice and I said there
has been if you see the trend lines in
2014 to now in West Bengal there has
been uptick for the for the BJP which is
emerging as one of the poles of the
campaign with the decline of the left
now even
2014 BJP had two seats but it had 16% 16
plus percent of the vote 16.8 day now in
that sense it's vote was much higher
than the seats it got yeah so 11 is a
pretty high number but somewhere around
8 plus 2 11 is around 8 or so would be
reasonable for every repeat to expect in
in West Bengal it's one of those states
where it looking to offset its its
losses in the in the hotline yeah 2014
massage to Tosh mr. where does that
leave the Congress party the Congress is
with a big zero that's the level of the
Congress party and the Left Front is
also at a zero so where are the Left
parties and the Congress and isn't that
the reason why the Congress is a party
that many in the mahajan Bandhan don't
want to align with I beg to differ
because these projections the happiest
person today will be mr. Dilip Ghosh who
is the president of BJP and who has been
going around telling people that we
don't have winning candidates and here
you are showing they're winning eleven
seats so that is a surprise to even BJP
I think right now as mr. Bakshi was
pointing out that BJP is great nobody
can deny that and we have seen how they
have been trying to turn it into a fight
between mamta and hindus and that but
Miss Molly also mr. Amit Malviya the
challenge that is being put forth
through the BJP is that you may not have
candidates for the projection of the 11
seats that this poll tracker gives the
BJP
you know that bica I'm not going to get
into disputing the numbers that you put
out because our own assessment seems to
suggest that we will get lot many more
seats than what you have put out but let
me just tell you what's really happening
in Bengal and I think that will put it
in context the panchayat polls actually
saw a great deal of search for the BJP
despite the huge violence that the TMC
card has unleashed on anybody and
everybody who either wanted to contest
from the BJP ticket or was likely to
vote for the BJP
now if the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
happen in a free and fair manner with a
great deal of deployment of this central
paramilitary forces and the Election
Commission giving it the sensitive state
tag you are likely to see a much higher
voter turnout in Bengal and that will
result in TMC smugness completely
disappearing you know the state is like
a tinderbox right now
Mamta Banerjee's oppressive regime is
basically assaulting anybody who seems
to disagree with TMC and that particular
thing will see a kind of retribution on
the polling day in Bengal and therefore
I think that you have got the trend
rights you are have rightly projected
that we have crossed the thirty percent
threshold barrier but my senses and the
feedback that we have from the ground is
that we will do much better than what
you've projected saying that the
opposition does not win then it means
that the elections are not free and fair
is that what he is saying
are you talking I have a question for
you I have a question for you the 2006
assembly polls meant that TMC was
completely routed washed out there was
100% turnout in many assembly seats then
ruled by the left what is your comment
on that 100% turnout so what you are
trying to say that even with EVM free
and fair elections cannot be held are
you saying that are you just coming the
first talking about a certain political
culture in Bengal and why we're talking
less elections in children
asaji the whole world knows that EVM
competitions you have booked that bun
then the petition a Congress competition
has Supreme Court may it is it is not
the other side but let's look at the let

this is teryn Ghana
you can see thirty point three zero for

seventeen point six zero and here is the
other big number forty one point two
zero four k CR is that sound of vote
share is looking at these are the
comparisons from January to now to March
you can see the UPA suffering there an
erosion of almost three percent the big
gains are for India in fact in fact for
the others which of course including
it's the local communist and the I am I

party and there you can see the NDA also
picking up a little bit what does it all

for a chance here it is here it is look
at the comparisons and you can look at

where's this why is this happening in
turn girl non it's very interesting the
Congress is actually higher than the BJP
or the India in terms of would share how
the BJP is picking up some of its old
urban area stronger than Mother
Telangana strongholds like Karim Nagar
so Karim Nagar multi-degree 2nd dhaba
some parts of urban Cholula they tend to
give a boost to the BJP so BJP goes up
to 2 it also picks up a decent would
share about 17% of the words the NDA UPA
be working horizontally spread across
the state even the 30 percent of the

very interesting because viewers I can
tell you one thing now and there's a
narrative that is developing many people
believe that the BJP is going to implode
in utter Pradesh on the back of the fact
that it is being cornered by the cuts
bundles to gut bundles one is the
Congress that got bundle which would be
very active in eastern Uttar Pradesh in
western Uttar Pradesh and then of course
you have the all-pervasive Mohammed II
samajwadi party rld got bundle now many
people are saying that that means
curtains for the BJP
but the BJP seems to be making huge
dents when it comes to vote check of the
other players in the south is the real
election being fought this time in the
south Sanjeev Srivastava are we not
looking close enough at the South in

enough
Rahul but where are the gains for the
BJP so write their vote share is going
up but from the four states that we have
seen I think the total number of seats
is still around five
out when I tell you why 120 why I say
the direct gains they could also be
generic games but but but but when you
look at how a seconder ultimately in
parliamentary arithmetic yes the number
of Lok Sabha seats will constitute Li
but look it's also get it from no the
the the Alliance game if you are looking
at the NDA ending up short as the
existing India they always maintain that
both KCR in Jagan reality in all
probability will go and support mr.
moody there you bruh the elections and
look at the country take significance
true in this from somewhere else we have
to be one seconded that's Jagan with
2262 that's a hue but now for you mr.
Modi would be a function of what is the
final tally of NDA and mr. Modi you know
because both these people juggle is
young kcra's an old warhorse they are
they will see which side of the bread is
buttered for them yes yes these distros
get tight slap political slap on okay
okay okay so therefore my understanding
is Rahul Gandhi's plane there be Sanjeev
she would serve will not accept okay
Nishant when ma holding the shotgun
right into this one second one second
one second I see when there's up one
second I just want to make three points
I asked I asked a very simple question
one second
[Music]
saying to us very clearly okay one sec
you must achieve a started a dream okay
one second one second one second good
reaction from me I'm not dreaming yeah
okay very good very very good don't
daydream let's all live in the reality
and the reality is staring us in our
faces I'm going to bring in some of our
guests but I just want to come back to
the point I began with which has led to
this kerfuffle in our studios and we
make I want to draw you in on this you
see when the India is looking after five
years of anti-incumbency staring it in
its face at the larger picture
what is it seeing it is seeing Rahul
Gandhi not having traction in the South
it's as simple as that the Congress
party is not having traction in the
south so who is getting the traction the
beta's let me let me finish let me
finish it's not like roasting a Congress
it may not be accruing to the BJP no
then it's a crowing to the others and
who are these others it's others are the
people's business wins the others are
not people that are interested in doing
business with the UPA or Al Gandhi and
we make that is significant because at
the end of the day we talk about who can
form the government precisely that's
where you look at these third parties
who are doing exceptionally well whether
it be juggins party he had undertaken
motor in the air of a yatra this body
atre has stood him in such good stead
he's been extremely popular in what he
has done in other states also in
Karnataka as we come we'll see how the
numbers are in Kerala for example the
UDF should have maintained and got
extremely high numbers they've not been
able to do exceptionally well the BJP
has cut a remember both are also
notoriously and I have to and I have to
bring you in on this and you could
perhaps you know absolutely contradict
me I have no problems with that J
but let's also never forget that voters
are usually reticent about voting for
change and they will not articulate that
very expressively specifically when it
comes to parties that don't really have
a presence like the BJP and it could be
in the state of Kerala even in the state
of Kerala and Tamil Nadu we might be
under reading the current step is it a
possibility J look there are a lot of
things that will change between now and
the day of pulling most importantly the
- wings and also most importantly the
candidates know kind of switching even
after the poll was done and you know we
finished the poll in Maharashtra and
West Bengal there have been more than
countable number of defections to the
NDA there be defections from the other
side but to the NDA have been born yes
how the impact will actually reflect oh
really of origin point
Nishant varma it's all up in the air at
this moment optically it looks as if the
scales have tilted away from the
Congress party they are not making
inroads and remember we're only twenty
odd days from the first phase mr Nishant
varma not looking good let's understand
let's understand how an opinion poll is
presented to India it is an opinion
which is being presented and not
mandated look at Kerala look at Tamil
Nadu look at Andhra Telangana I am NOT
talking of the Union Territories the the
narrative that rajagopal and Sam and
others are talking probably is that
Rahul Gandhi is not making an attraction
who's in power mr. Modi
we started with Paulo Court as a you
know a point of talk and so on five
years it only shows that the government
of India run by BJP has not been able to
make any
hello be gone and I am saying what you
are saying I am saying what you're
saying I am saying Congress has not
impressed but Modi has been rejected
that's a different proposition we are
looking at we are looking at the old
church examining boat no one here is if
it had its own account one man I want to
bring in arbitration mr. Modi has been
rejected fair enough sir that might be
the point that you are trying to make
but you cannot run away from the fact
we're both drowned Gandhi and Priyanka
have entered the fray are not having an
impact that will worry the Congress
party if it has to yeah triangular
contest in Kerala okay okay my man let
me let me bring up in your song on one
minutes one test one test that someone
is doing well is when regional parties
look to them as an alliance partner and
I want to ask you I want to ask the TRS
representative here why didn't you think
your Congress was a party that you could
work with sir and what happened on the
back of the assembly no basically we
have been very clear that we do not want
to work with Congress or as well as BJP
one second the Congress like-minded
parties why not
yes Congress Congress also has worked
against the interest of Telangana has
worked against the interest of
minorities has worked against the
interests of the lids and as always
always been trying to scuttle the
movement for a separate Telangana and
the TRS party in the last assembly
elections also you have seen that they
have joined hands with Chandrababu Naidu
in a in a manner which was not totally
political but to damage up local party
which was
coming up and which was being accepted
by the people so they on this ground we
we and our leader have been very
categorical and sir clear that we are
not going to support Congress as well as
very much sir but Sir what if what if
tomorrow the India were to ask you for
support when you give the NBS support
Congress okay sir rhetorical side will
you have said it very clearly we have
said it very no support to the area
today yesterday also to our president
mister is up here to this tiny little
that poor foolish never do you believe
that things will change that this
particular party is also looking at the
larger picture in the unlikely that TDP
will end up because TDP remember nothing
I do is a very very ambitious man he
will take nothing short of the highest
office of the country he was leading
efforts something very big but so let me
bring into this round one more point is
that they are missing somebody likewise
rajashekhar Reddy
we had a time when Dragic already had
money resource people and seats which
could sustain Congress here let me bring
in danaka Danka Danka Danka one who
asked you the TRS says that you are in a
alliance with the Congress to defeat the
aspirations of the people in Telangana I
would have expected that Alliance to
have continued in together with the
Congress party sir a specific question I
understand your problems with the survey
and I'm not going to I'm not going to
even try to dignify your no no your
skepticism with the response we put out
what we put out I'm only asked you a
simple question why aren't you with the
Congress sir
why don't you with the Congress
like-minded parties your leaders shared
a stage with him with Rahul Gandhi in
the capital about a month ago no
alliance why sir
okay okay we are having a few
communication issues let's try to
resolve that line I want to bring up

let's look at Kerala Kerala viewers very
very important State the seat in
puducherry just in case you're wondering
has gone to the upa upa yeah so so you
can see that number and if you look at
the bottom of your screens viewers the
UPS stands at 50 after Kerala the nd at
six the others at three why is this
because in Kerala it's coming down to
numbers and the first numbers that we
are projecting are the vote shares and
look at that number in the top right
hand side corner viewers of your screens
the NDA unprecedented twenty one point
seven zero percent of the vote not seen
in the past let's go into what this
translates into seats it's becoming a
triangular contest in Kerala
unexpectedly so after many many decades
and this is what we are showing the UPA
34 the NDA at at young at 13 I think
sorry Wow that'll be 60 well these are
by looking at Carol actually we're
kidding we're coming back to Tamil Nadu
there can we pull out the Kerala number
where I can tell you the Kerala number
off the back here it is what we are
being told is that in Kerala and that's
the number 16 for the UDF 3 for the LDF
one for the NDA and 0 for the others are
we underrepresented the NDA number no no
what's happening is it isn't happening
question 1 seats in air are about six
other seats where it is coming up as a
good fight to the IDF to topple the UPA
but yet the movement is not complete we
might have to wait for another tracker
to see a complete movement especially
because the way the numbers the
percentage of NDA has gone up it's more
than doubled it was about 11 percent 10
to 11% last silligans it has gone up to
21 percent that becoming the third poll
in Kerala politics the only one reason
is sub Ramallah and may fade away the
great waste faith back into the equation
and it's changing the equation viewers I
want to quickly open this up shut up una
wanna your first reaction to this I
think that the BJP did play a right card
with the Sabri mala thing and I think
they are going to make a
inroads into Trivandrum seat and I think
Shashi Tharoor well after will have to
be very very careful
yeah well just to get the mats viewers
at the bottom of your screens the UPA up
to a flying start at 50 halfway to a
half century there you can see 59
counted as of now others at 3 Andy at 6
but here is what we must look at at this
moment in time the UDF if you look at
this the UDF showing no sign telling
italy yes no signs of any addition it is
here that we have to look because the
india starts coming into the equation
yeah and and and you have the LD f which
is yeah also right pretty much now let
me just do a little broader picture in
the 2016 assembly polls which is free
sub Ramallah the India this is the BJP
and its ally the be de Geus already had
fourteen and a half percent foot
so this 21 can actually go up the 21 is
an increment over the 14 and a half of
the 2016 assembly election so if there's
an increment at all you might see
teacher in the next record so this is
very very interesting here is the room
for growth so dead-even j says that the
india numbers could actually go up yeah
and you already see of the left it'll be
at the cost of the at the cost of the
left which is something that we've been
noticing even in the state of West
Bengal so the left actually has huge
reasons to be worried very very big
reasons to be worried Sanji's reverse
though it's not looking good for the
left if the left really wants to be in
this game it needs to reinvent itself
because its own Hindu vote is migrating
what it is looking like for the left is
frankly irrelevant to some extent for
the left also they were tying up with
the Congress in West Bengal fighting on
their own in Kerala so there were local
compulsions I think what they'll both be
happy with UDF and the left that the NDA
is being pushed to a corner and that
they are making both in Tamil Nadu and
Kerala substantial gains so far so good
but the law of country is still left so
let's see I I think you see the point
the point that we're missing the point
that we are missing about the left and
mr. Raju coupon I want to bring you in
on this the point we are missing out is
because the left as of now could become
a pivot or has been a pivot for a third
front experiment left fading in this
manner is not good reading it's not good
reading
Rahul if I put it left is the glue for
Maha got banned then added to the
Congress if the glue is vanishing if it
is not a fairy code if it is going to be
a temporary one travel type of Chicago
he is not going to be affecting left is
becoming Hindu party very soon and I
think that what is fun you know left is
Brahmin left one one point one point I
would like to make well force is
Sabarimala the entire spectrum of Kerala
electorate has got completely changed
left is going to be decimated completely
and BJP is going to occupy the prime

going to unravel for you what is now
beginning to appear like a one-sided
fight 25 days or so before the first
phase of polling we are seeing a
situation where the opposition that at
least two months ago seemed to be
dictating terms has not been able to get
its ground game off to a very firm start
so you have a situation where the gut
bund ins that was supposed to die the
NDA up in knots and restrict narendra
modi's juggernaut have not quite found
the going easy in fact it is the
opposition that seems to have tied
itself up in knots and I'm not being
partisan here when I say this because
while on the face of it everything looks
okay
the chemistry is not adding up and there
is evidence that we will produce over
the next few moments to prove what we
are saying we've been speaking on candid
camera to a large number of opposition
leaders who are today either in alliance
with the Congress or have allied
together against the Bharatiya janta
party and in each one of these alliances
at least one of the participants feels
that the other is weaker is dragging the
side down that is hardly the kind of
chemistry one would have expected to see
just 25 days before an election because
it means that there is a profound
distrust in the gut bundle and if it is
surfacing now it is not going to help
matters on polling day when you need to
get your booth worker charged up for a
fight
now all the last few weeks in contrast
in very sharp contrast the India which
looked as if it was in disarray seems to
be coming together and let me focus on
that we have seen the Shiv Sena that
seemed as if it was looking the other
way which seemed that it was not
interested in an alliance with the BJP
suddenly agreeing so threatened to split
but ynx an alliance for ideology sake it
says for defending the national interest
in Karnataka the Congress leader Madhu
Gowda declares no party worker will
support the JDS this is the sharp
contrast in two very influential states
let's move on let's look at a son
in Assam we were expecting the BJP to be
on the back foot it played fast and
loose with the sentiments of its allies
by trying to push through a citizenship
bill a large number of alliances said
it's over the nada is over the Alliance
there in the Northeast is over we have
nothing to do with you but suddenly out
of the blue you have a situation where
the home gonna perish it has come back
into the fort and ruther pradesh SP
leaders are downplaying the priyanka
factor says that she is not going to
have a knock-on effect in creating buzz
for the opposition against the BJP again
two vital states and a massive this
location are connect let's look at the
third example tamil nadu PM k was part
of UPA AI DMK fort alone in 2014 but now
all in the NDA in behind the Congress
leaders are voicing discontent against
RJD due to graft charges against the RJD
saying that look at the end of the day
the corruption in the ranks of the RJD
Aurra Achilles here so in tamilnadu a
very very important state 39 Lok Sabha
seats and up in North West Center Bihar
very important state the large number of
seats here again we find the UPA the cut
band on shaky it wasn't looking like
this three weeks back
let's now play out some of these things
we've conducted the first thing viewers
is coming up from karnataka now we have
also conducted a sting on the Shiv Sena
against the Bharatiya janta party and
the reason why it becomes superfluous to
play that sting is because the Shiv Sena
comes out on a daily basis and
criticizes the Marathi janta party in
fact its mouthpiece even now is the most
trenchant critic of the Bharatiya janta
party it's a clever strategy where the
Shiv Sena plays the opposition edges the
opposition out it's very clever they
disconnect when it suits them and they
unite when it suits them so it makes no
sense really to play out a Shiv Sena BJP
stink but we will focus for a few
moments on Karnataka listen to what
madhu Gowda Congress leader has to say
very senior voice in the Congress ranks
listen to this we have been fighting
with jealously I can't I can't ask my
supporters or I can't
I myself can't go and vote for them so
but do you think the you mean to say
yourself will you not would definitely
no definitely no I will not want Wow
even if the coalition leaders ask you to
definitely I will not vote for deities
and I am being with Congress even if I
want to go and what if there is my
symbol then I load and then I can't go
and vote for somebody Congress people
we'll go and work for a JDS candidate no
not through Congress people will go on
road for JT she's maybe say there is no
coalition in Bundy as far as concern but
that Coalition has never worked from
last nine months that coalition was not
there in Monday district it is as if
they have ruled like Anna Hitler ruled
on Monday so nobody what it was a
discussion between de juego de and Rahul
Gandhi and they have given the c2 to the
JDS even then there will be no change of
opinion or difference I don't think
there's a hold on this decision was for
the Delhi and our decision is for Monday
very very important seat manya and here
there is dissonance on the ground so the
chemistry is not quite in place viewers
let's move to 3rd Pradesh where many
people feel that this coming together
almost historic changing the course of
the entire political clock so to speak
where the BSP and the SP were enemies
where the Congress was suspicious of
both the Samajwadi Party and the BSP
suddenly all coming together suggesting
that they're fighting for the same
ideals one would have thought that the
BJP would have really really been put on
the back foot here in utter Pradesh but
that's not quite working out either
listen to this as we spoke once again to
Ravi - maro try all of these are candid
camera interviews in some cases they
know that there's a conversation going
on so they're sending out a message but
in most cases they don't know they're
being filmed it's not a spycam it's a
candid camera cameras there it's visible
all we haven't been told is not a taken
on record so there you go Ravi does
Murata speaking to us very senior leader
viewers from the ranks of the Samajwadi
Party and listen to what he has to say
about Priyanka Gandhi who is seen as a
bit of a game changer in Uttar Pradesh
her brother Rahul Gandhi bring her in in
the hope that
revive the gut bundle listen to this
very carefully parameters of this body
oh look to the attenti animatable
familiar dragon 70 we have a participant
who polygamy
I mean indeed when - now remember
is the militia will not be religious I'm

Salgado signally put the police hope the
policeman party obviously a man in the
rear there you go Priyanka also not a
factor
says the Samajwadi Party look at the
look at the backbiting that is going on
look at the doubts that are creeping in
let's look at be hard very very
important state remember it's in the
north where the BJP could win or lose
this election because it's the hindi /
cow belt where the BJP really swept in
2014 and that's what put it clearly over
the majority mark any setbacks here
could cost it dearly but on the evidence
of the conversations we are having even
with members like HK Varma senior member
listen to this this will sting it will
totally stink here is a man here is a
man who has profound profound
reservations about the Congress giving
support to lalu Yadav listen to this
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yes he's deep well we produce three
stings for you three candid
conversations let's put it another way
for you and each one of them suggests
that the chemistry is lacking that there
are deep reservations and I want to open
this out and I want to begin by asking
consumptive are you of the Samajwadi
Party consumptive re if there is if
there is a chance of stopping the NDA it
is in the north you would agree the mats
the mats is a key here key determinant
but with the evidence of this your own
leaders suggesting that the cut bundle
is unviable there are so much envy
backbiting is there a recipe today for
an implosion and worst of all of not
being able to provide that alternative
the confidence to the voter now I am
confused as this parody news fake news
because it is certainly not breaking
news I have two newspapers of the day
including economic times I saw Times of
India your so-called breaking news did
not make it to any headline you show me
one headline that it made it to it means
that your news is either significant or
it's it's a parody and how do I respond
to parity you are speaking about the
leader I have never met you have never
met but suddenly for your viewers you
want the viewers to believe that that
leader is the voice of samajwadi party
right you must have a vested interest in
making your viewers believe in that I
don't want a cabinet minister sir the
reality was he not at that time MLA is
not a carry ons until about two
have us both smokes was I'm a
spokesperson of my party I am testing of
our cosmic anon entities why a minute
witnessed elastic country that even has
a byline even Times of India even Times
of India that even has a byline of your
so-called most important breaking news
that will shape the election of 2019
come on let's be fair with facts mr. mr.
Giovanni once talking about endorsement
papers we set the agenda we do what we
have to do neither do we pillows to be
pollinate now watch exciting I want to
ask you on the facts why is Ravi is Ravi
- Murata has been in your political
party was here has been when you made
him a cabinet minister - Iago is this
has been where self-interest is not news
tell me tell me Western interest is he
or has been vested interest why do you
make why did you make interest who
havenít minister explained to me was he
a cabinet minister yes or no who or
whoever is telling the view this is the
view of what is telling me this now if
you if somebody who gave you the string
and and they told you this then that is
Western interests if you are using the
string and telling the viewers because I
heard your your introduction you are
telling you this is the view of
samajwadi party I think that somebody
misguided you with a vested interest I
am Telling You the Fantas official
spokesperson it is hard for you to build
a national counter-question coming to
the Alliance this election you know
count two questions allow one one final
sentence we believe we believe we
believe this election is an open book
election the the age of strings is over
as we saw in mother Pradesh UN
BJP gave a set of media
strings of common lots and other leaders
and they did not impact the Alliance
that did not impact the outcomes this
election is an open book election people
have seen BJP MPs hitting their own MLS
with shoes people have seen Vijay
hitting officials with shoes so that
shoe strike the implosion is within BJP
people have seen a Sox team arrive
writing an open letter citing his caste
- Amit Shah saying that if you don't
give me the ticket I am is going to lose
so the only implosion we see in this
election this is a very very open book
election
the only implosion we see in this
election is in the BJP side we are nbsp
BSP Alliance is on the ground we are
unfortunately not in media we are on the
ground shipping the public public's
spirit on routing BJP out okay just
before I bring in mr. Kohli to respond
to you I want to just ask you one
question and I hope you can give me a
straight answer
the man that we are talking about sir
from your political party who you don't
know was here cabinet minister till two
years ago in uttar pradesh sir yes no
well it is for you to research all I am
saying is okay you can put on all in 10
consequential maybe you don't remember
the fact maybe you don't have a huge
body party and its ethos okay fair
enough
I can give you the benefit of doubt
maybe you should have come a little more
researched no wonder it's okay say it
doesn't matter both of us we've done our
research and we'll put out a graphic of
who Ravi - Mara was and is and continues
to be
two-time MLA very senior leader of the
Samajwadi Party until just about two and
a half years ago in the grand and great
Achilles government he was a very very
important cabinet minister today the
Samajwadi Party spokesperson has a
difficult time remembering their own
cabinet minister talk about use and
abuse was fair enough do and have held
up the walls
I know sir even it is a very long time
in politics so I will give you the
benefit of doubt that I was
my was Ryan we are viewed with
discussing the election of 2014 this is
2019 wake up Rahul I know 30 2019 yeah I
know it's okay you can depend on was or
you will you will depend on well it's
okay she will have it's okay yesterday
Tom muttaqun was also summarily
dismissed as a nobody
but a whole Gandhi and today of course
the great Ghanshyam Tiwari is bearing
the knife in the back of a cabinet
minister who was part of your party
remains a part of your party is an
important adviser fair enough it's okay
I know politics is the game of smoke and
mirrors use and abuse it's fine maybe
you play it like that let me bring in
the BJP you need to respond BJP
ministers MLAs MPs whacking each other
with boots many people said ki aapki
baat boot key circuit Thank You mr.
crowd Shiv Shankar I think let's go back
to the whole thing and I will also
answer your question but the fact of the
matter is let look let's look at the big
picture the big picture is that there is
the leadership of Narendra Modi ji the
agenda of circus arts of Caracas and the
sterling performance of the government
which has worked for every segment of
society and I can talk about all the
schemes whether it is seven Corolla the
connections whether it is ayushman Marat
and already 20 lakh people have
benefited from it whether it's 2000
rupees going to the farmers whether it
is mudra and the schemes are in an
enormous amount of work that's our
agenda in front of it as mr. Jaitley
wrote this is clear clear leadership
versus chaos the so called mahogany
London is a photo opportunity Alliance
that does not even know who their leader
will be what their agenda will be except
opposing Modi so in a simple sense it is
like a group of people saying they don't
like a building they take a bulldozer
and they say let's bring down the
building after that we will decide
whether we need an architect who will be
the architect whether we should have a
contractor to build the building there
is no positive agenda except let's
attack mode so that's the chaos that's
the chaos also the engine in one second
in maharaj
ah do let me since we are talking about
chaos let's talk a little bit about the
chaos that we witness a lot daily
between the ships ni in the BJP which is
also sir now emerging and impacting sir
governance as we have seen debt of three
individuals silencer one person their
lives
19 others injured and the Shiv Sena
blames the BJP the BJP says that we've
got the worst partner in the Shiv Sena
the Shiv Sena says that this government
can't even fight on the borders let
alone serving the people that's also
chaos sir what kind of an alliance is
that AI DMK in Tamil Nadu allymeier
corruption allegations you go and
embrace it give it a lifeline no I'll
answer that also it's a fair question
but I'll also distinguish to say how
it's not clear because when I started I
made it clear it is clarity about who
the leader is irrespective of the
differences and positions of every
individual party and everyone's entitled
to add their own agenda being an
alliance doesn't mean we all become one
in everything we are entitled by the
Constitution as on a panel to have a
different point of view of parties are
entitled to have a different point of
view but there is no big problem with
regard to who the leader is and what the
agenda of the government will be which
is sub Cassatt sabka Vikas and na na
moonkin Pumpkinhead which is the new
slogan on which we are working so
therefore on the other side who is the
leader do they even know is there even a
plan that a or b may be the leader and
that this is the agenda as I said it
that's why the word chaos now let me
come to the second part Mugen sham
primary G in pointing out only BJP
examples also confirms they have no
agenda for change all they are depending
on us all we will find holes in the BJP
it is not about this is our agenda
that's why we got together this is our
manifesto this is our agenda for
governance this is what we have done and
we are going to do together nothing of
that sort so that's why it distinct then
you ask the question my question about
Mumbai please there is no question about
it
human beings have lost their life
and somebody will have to pay for it
that will then the chief minister
himself I said so irrespective of our
different positions at parties it
doesn't change the fact that somebody
has died because of something that's an
issue which is being well I appreciate
that Channel come to the fact of whether
somebody picked up a shoe and hit
another person that is not the BJP they
are two individual leaders who have done
so in the party when we were asked also
okay okay I appreciate the candor at
least you know B stands for dodging but
the the reason we are doing this story
is to bring out the inherent instability
in coalition's of compulsion nothing
much more it extends also viewers are
calling the NDA one synchro Minds for
power
oh right sir I don't believe that your
alliances with the AGP despite your
difference on the citizenship issue or
the Shiv Sena and the BJP sub is a
compromise also sir for power I'm sure
it is I'm not going to take that not
face anything believe it in the
leadership of Modi ji they shipibos okay
okay so you're saying alliance because
okay so you're saying that the only
distinction that is being drawn yeah
it's an important one viewers listen to
what the BJP said the BJP says okay fine
we've also tied up with certain
political parties maybe we've had our
differences we're a family in which
people do express themselves differently
this is democracy but at the end of the
day there is no ambiguity about who's
gonna lead us is that a differentiator
enough mr. Raza and I watch attendance
which is why let me ask the question
fine commonality I thought let's let's
hear from the opposition mr. Razak
peacefully tell me there is a problem
all the stains show how there's so much
backbiting on the opposition side of the
fence you have a situation where people
are saying that Rahul is not speaking
for us at the state level he's only
thinking about the big game at the
centre that Priyanka is weak then
myopathy and Malaya
have actually in some way or the other
arrogantly put down Rahul Gandhi and
Priyanka Gandhi that Rahul Gandhi's
alliance with the RJD
is doomed to fail because the RJ
is corrupt Akhilesh is corrupt robberies
kala everyone is corrupt how can this
sort of backbiting give us good
governance sir we've seen already what
back by the is done in matters of the
sort of diamond and the BJP bridges are
collapsing the cities in ruins for
another five years we are going to have
a bunch of crabs in a tin trying to pull
each other down is that is the
alternative then sir we have to be wary
mr. Rahul there is dissent Rahul there
is dissent and there are differences in
BJP as well there is speculation that
even you know if the BJP comes out of
the largest party and if they try to
make you know come to power again but
Modi ji would not be the Prime Minister
again this has been conveyed by many
ministers the RSS Nitin Gadkari G's name
coming up this is their BJP as well look
at the single night so much zeal and
enthusiasm having ruled in 22 states of
the country what the BJP G is and is our
leader and only he is going to be the
prize with less seats in Bihar they they
despite having won more seats in 2014
and settle down to less seats this time
in Bihar so there is you know some kind
of difference and dissidents you were
there so what I'm saying is head is no
leave when it is Vijay becomes the
lan-evo DG will not be the Prime
Minister people will vote for tomorrow
not for his des is wrong I am rejecting
it what you have all of that don't fall
believe me sir okay one cycle store and
point out one by one
that is the scorecard you look at the
manifesto answer the questions on the
business at kink in your heels rather
saw manufacturing one second viewers
single let me tell you even as we are
speaking
look how fluid the situation is Abdul
Razak has been someone who has been
close to the JD s and one of his top
leaders today the initially Member of
Parliament
suddenly switches sides and becomes a
member of the BSP let's listen let's
listen a chose deterrence in Chicago
Sanders also kanata UN suppose a car
connect at Bahujan Samaj Party quenette
go man a cool Kia or my shaman there you
go there you go
JD s JD is the face of the JD s the face
of the gut Bandhan the JD s got Bandhan
in Delhi suddenly decides that he is
going to join the BSP now when people
leading like I said it feels like crying
if you want a coalition with the
Congress well well sir you see this is
where the problem is there is so much
fluidity on the other side if people
don't know what their a spouse what they
stand for
how can they convince the voters and
this is the problem viewers it's a
complete shocker the face of the JD s
mr. Razak you know better than he has
intentions to contest from he has
problem with the qaul' Rosen I
understand Congress I'm joining my avati
he has this a man from Karnataka he's
the writer of the JD s in Delhi and the
JD s cannot contest sir member of money
Raja Sabha is he not yes no Rahul he has
he has intentions he has intentions to
contest from you P and for which he
being a JD s person cannot contest from
you P for that reasons maybe he has
shifted side ultimately he can go female
oh don't worry about days ago sir and he
was with Rahul Gandhi might be well
there it is look at this on the right
hand side two days ago he was standing
with Rahul Gandhi and we know what myath
he has been saying about route Gandhi
she says that he's not capable of
providing leadership he's not capable of
coming to a table and having a
intelligent political conversation with
and she is in fact older entire kada
not to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with
the Congress party now what is going on
and consumptive re now you say you don't
remember this gentleman either this in
the browsable
top job congratulations for a good good
breaking news no no Danny Shelley also
listen for one second Italy Danny
Shelley is also nobody nobody is here
nobody no no I agree with you I said
congratulations for the breaking news
congratulations
I concede it may not make it will it
won't it won't it won't we can have a
bet on it this way oh wow why we can
have a voice and why's it so important
will the amount of significant I
congratulate I want to ask Mike no I
want to ask you try very simply is the
gut baingan is the gut Bandhan so
confused today it doesn't know what to
stand and espouse for it doesn't know
what it stands for and doesn't know what
it is houses what is going on 25 days or
24 days in federal you would know that
route you you would know that the SPB
SPR ldli alliance was announced and we
have not buzzed a budge from that
position if you look at the joint press
conferences between biology and a
kinesiology they are very clear in terms
of the agenda the agenda is going to be
jobs empowerment farmers harmony that is
the agenda and the focus will be on the
misrule of Yogi Sarkar and complete
abandoning of constitution of Modi circa
and a while you and I debate here the
the Alliance is already on the street
working among the people as far as the
nation Allah is concerned he is he is a
big face that he was a general secretary
of JD s and I believe that he is coming
to s PBS realized probably he may become
a candidate to that extent I
congratulate him and welcome to the him
to the fold
he and I have been on the same panels
with you and we have always spoken in
one voice against the the BJP miss rule
so I don't see this
with a lens of Congress this is a very
clear case of somebody coming here who's
in JDS comes from Uttar Pradesh he is
not a member of parliament as you said
and he would want to contest because the
SP BSP R&D alliance is so formidable sir
Sir Donna Shirley the man who brought
the JD s and Congress together may
comment on this please okay not in curly
one second quits the JD s quits the JD s
the man who brought the JD s and the
Congress together quits the JD s two
days after meeting Rahul Gandhi and
joins BSP myopathy saying that I have a
problem with the Congress party and you
are telling me that the cut Bandhan is
the whole solid okay Olli over to you
sir and champion who was snatched away
from su se da without you say not
knowing it this is not the case of
Suresh Prabhu no I I think this is a
very very clear case of alliance that is
working unlike the case of Suresh Prabhu
that left sits in a sulking okay okay so
fine look this is all you can buy so
what my comment logistics very and I
have to give you full marks for being
the most pervasive most most clever most
fluid spokesperson on national TV
Ghanshyam Tiwari but it's a struggle for
you and you will agree you will agree
this is not looking good anyhow I want
to bring in Alan Kohli because you see
you have just given the BJP the bragging
rights
Thank You mr. Rajeev Shankar let me
point out then let's look at the
situation as I would see it it is that
country as Danish Ali is the person who
coordinates with senior Congress
leadership man makes this alliance
possible which is snatching away their
government from the BJP I mean let's not
face the world the Congress the BJP and
all the JD has contested the election
the BJP was within striking distance we
couldn't form that government so it was
a snatching of an alliance then he sees
his supreme leader after being such an
important person in the JD s saying my
position is so bad with the Congress
that I feel like crying I'm worse than a
clerk you see he sees the Congress
people saying we will not work with this
we will sabotage this government so what
does he do in effect is say I am sick
and tired of this and I'm going to the
bsv and I'm going to now contest the
elections with them he has no blessings
of anybody else and the clear rejection
I don't wish to be part of the Congress
that's a rejection of the Congress even
more that he had a choice if he wished
to contest from the Congress he rejects
it completely because he sees so this is
nothing but power games and when you
speak about Suresh Prabhu ji let me
remind you since I am also a student of
history Suresh Prabhu ji was made to
step down in the match by coming out of
the quota of the Shiv Sena then he
stayed out and eventually chose his
option to come back and serve the nation
which he's doing so as a very eminent
and capable Minister thin as I should
say in our nominee and now as a BJP
person and in either case he continues
on the government that Shiv Sena has
never fought and said we don't want
damming the government so let's not try
to create such kind of gymnastics that
is an impossibility even for a rubber
band
well mr. can chant you re a quick
response news that played out when
Suresh Prabhu she was inducted when
Suresh Prabhu ji was inducted is he's
known as a good minister but even then
you made him step down from Ministry of
Railways and when he was inducted by the
way you could look at the news that she
was in are created at that time so
that's fact let's not go go into a
narrative I think with respect to Kumar
Danny Shelley you would see that when
the
the alliance partners were together in
the oath-taking in Karnataka you would
see in court initially standing shoulder
to shoulder with Mahan my OTG and
achalasia allergy
there is a chemistry there and I believe
because he comes from other Pradesh he's
in here to contest on BSP ticket which
doesn't exist with the Congress that's
the basic point I'm making
then everybody doesn't have a chemistry
with the Congress nobody wishes to
everybody get off this is a cure
believes it has a chemistry with
everybody's interest letter you bring in
let me bring in the true inside man of
the JD s Abdul Razak who is today not
recognized by the JD s now Abdul Razak I
just want to ask you this question
set aside set aside your affiliations
for a moment and look upon this as a
political analyst does this inspire
confidence this backbiting this floor
shifting this aisle crossing this
opportunism is this the alternative sir
ahead of any election these kind of
things are tend to happen people with
self-interest well you know dump ship
and just go jump wherever they want this
has been happening from 70 years there's
not something new that you know very
close confident is like yesterday but I
can going out of Congress and today the
initially going out of JD s the sonali's
tend to happen but what I'm trying to
come at is unless we have our common
goal as one we are we don't have any
problems with that now the common goal
is to remove these faces and you know in
tolerant government out of India which
is only given fake and hollow promises
to the people of the nation has done
nothing but only talk talk talk look at
the kind of promises they made today is
there anybody who will talk about shade
in at least for the sake of election
rally will they take out the word our
children from their mouth no because
they themselves know that these are not
achieving at all will they talk about
kala then will they talk about the
argument for the PJ Modi who ran away
from the country no why because you are
North now the people of the country will
be looking at a fair government who can
give them harmony you know who if you
look at the kind of headlines that have
been made in the past five years each
and every day you had some kind of a
familial royal day I am NOT today
wanting to be in any way one of the
other may I just respond to look I don't
want to be I don't want to in any way
sound partisan but today I am forced to
look at this situation yes and nilin
Kohli is at least honest enough to tell
us that yeah there have been problems
there is dissidents amongst our ranks
but we welcome it because it helps
further democracy here you seem to be
sort of rejecting this whole idea of
dissonance and saying or dissent and
saying that this is all opportunism then
anyone who says today they're all Gandhi
from Karnataka from JD router do you or
do you answer
he's being an opportunist he's a flaw
crosser and then doesn't sound quite
right it doesn't sound quite right it is
an example they are they are senior
politicians in their own right let me
give you suggest everything they say is
borne out of you know self-interest is
also being a bit selective because had
this come from the BJP you would have
said the opposite you'd have said see
this is a negation of Modi so I want you
to respond to this sir
don't be selected through a head of a
head of five state elections behind my
OOTD made a statement that she will not
stand with the Congress which
fortunately worked for the Congress and
we came to power as we came to power my
OTG herself came ahead and said I will
give unconditional support to Congress
and that is what she 1719 election she
said why are you putting on fake news
yeah you know what she's told akhada
come on sir I mean look let me play out
something there is no CP hocus-pocus now
and Shyam Temari will say oh you see you
catch has managed to make a comment on
the file that Mister result made okay
quickly make your contradiction and I
want to come to the NCP sting we had
played out a few days 90s not in Cody go
ahead I think mr. Razak made a fair
point to start with he made a fair point
to start with
that people during or before elections
do change sides and those reasons I
would like to add is different for
somebody it may be a change of ideology
from somebody may be contesting a seat
for someone it has be discussed with the
party they are in so different that's a
fair point but the second point then he
decided to be rhetorical and attack the
BJP to say that this is a government
their secret so it's my duty to point
out that this is a performing government
this is a government that when the
wholesale in inflation in this country
was in let 13 percent it was brought
down to 3 when a retail inflation was 11
percent it was bought to two point five
when air travel six point seven crore
people traveled by air now thirteen
point nine crore people travel by air
this is a government when I pointed out
earlier schemes also this is a
government where three units used to
manufacture mobiles in India now 122
when we are the second largest
manufacturers of mobiles not to forget
about meme coating not to forget about
kiss on summer do Gina or pradhan mantri
jump on your general development or
highway construction or rural roads I
shall go on forever that is rhetorical
you are entitled to make it rhetorical
but that doesn't wipe away our track
record okay
what sir that's a track record is also
under the scanner there will be there
will be another time when we will look
and we will analyze it and I'm sure the
voter is now smart enough to know
armored water what has been achieved in
what is not but we are not going there
right now III you know your passion
aside I just want to get into a very
important conversation because one side
the NDA says we are must booth and the
other side is much booth I wanted to
evaluate that claim today and with every
passing day it appears to me that the
other side is laboring under much Murray
now listen to this we are going to play
out another sting we had done this a few
days back this is Chitra Bob she the
spokesperson of a political party the
political face of her party the NCP in
Maharashtra not some side has been once
upon a time minister listen to what she
has to say
can sham Tiwari may not know her and I
will forgive him for that he has a short
memory but nonetheless let me play out
what this individual has told us they
she talks about the as well as the
unpredictability of
[Music]
she points the photograph of Charlotte
power and says you can't say anything
about mr. Sheth power after the
elections you might even switch sides
and join the NDA now sue Muncie Ramon
you're a political analyst we are not
having a contentious you know regular
punch up here but we're just looking at
some of these candid conversations we've
had I don't even want to suggest there
were stings and they don't inspire
confidence today we've had a situation
where initially the face of the JDS
instrumental in bringing the JDS and the
congress together
decides to switch ranks and joins the
BJP rbsp because he says that the
congress is unreliable don't like its
politics don't die here all Gandhi now
this much booth versus much more
alliance which way are you going
is there much booty now visible to you
in the opposition at at the end of the
day at the end of the day many of these
so-called state regional parties will
pitch for whoever gives them a better
shot at power it's a very very simple
equation see what is happening
northeast tomorrow hypothetically if
there is a revival or change of regime
at the center you will find a whole lot
of those northeast you know politicians
crossing sides again so there is no
surprise I mean I have said it several
times that many of these regional
parties will have no qualms in tying up
with the BJP should the BJP be within
striking distance of coming to power
there is no there has never been a doubt
on that having said that it's important
to realize except for utter Pradesh
which is very critical and Delhi where
talks are still going on I think most of
the alliances that the Congress needs
are already in place I mean you P is big
it's very very important and it's and
they seem to be messing up there but
apart from you P and Delhi I don't see
what other alliance the opposition would
have planned and has not executed before
the general election I think that
they've got most of the other states
covered you P is big you P is critical
that's going to happen there we don't
know but your argument that there is no
alliance opposition alliance if you if
if a year ago you had to list out the
1020 alliances that the opposition
needed to put most of it is in place
except for you P and Delhi maybe to some
extent Haryana but you P and Delhi are
the big two I mean it certainly you P is
the big one and if they can get that
right still they would still be in with
a fighting chance okay very interesting
because you is referred to of course
crossing sides and people who lack
conviction and I agree with you yes
there are many people who jump ship
because they see better prospects and I
and I completely endorse that but
there's another seaward and that is
chemistry what our candid conversations
reveal sumon serum on is that the
chemistry that is so vitally important
for gut bundles to work on the ground is
severely lacking there is deep mistrust
and you know what happens when the
chemistry is lacking between alliance
partners BJP shifts in our know
chemistry and it leads to chaos look at
what's happened in Maharashtra on
governance and I am worried that if this
lacking in banos tree gut bundle
were tomorrow to come to power we will
have a governance deficit nationwide
Rahul Rahul in nine out of ten elections
arithmetic Trump's chemistry chemistry
matters in certain elections and of
course event there is a wave of course
wave 10 - even drowned arithmetic and so
on okay here I see this as an election
with where there is no dishonourable may
respond and definitely arithmetic has
got a much better chance of clumping
chemistry okay mats better off than
chemistry okay a final response before I
wrap up yes okay I first then let me
first answer this and I have a second
comment that I would not agree with that
respectfully because if that was the
case then nobody would fight elections
they would simply sit down look at the
votes cast by everybody put them a kiss
and treat the water as a herd that
mechanically goes like a robo and
presses the button based on the numbers
it's not chemistry matters at every
level and pollux from the lowest
election at the grass root to the
Parliament and chemistry of what happens
in the rally how does the local person
speak each thing that is why Dane and
day out we debate on the smallest issues
that happen as well as the biggest and
second I want to just play as I thank
you Rahul there's also the other
panelists we had a very very good
discussion with no one interrupting each
other and it was a pleasure for everyone
to put their point of view across so I
just thought I misplaced that one record
indeed here yeah I absolutely I think
we've had a constructive conversation
thank you gan-chan Tiwari thank you
mister Razak and cement serum on and of
course the ever on-the-spot nilin Kohli
thank you very much let's wrap this up
lots more coming up

remember it was only a day before
yesterday night that China once again
put a technical hold on living up joshan

terrorist and now of course the super
exclusive news break on your channel we
are learning that the NDA government
will not give up despite China blocking
the move to blacklist Masood Azhar at
the UN our national fetish enjoy
Chaudhary is with me from the news but
now to tell us a bit more about this to
enjoy over to you tell us more about the
strategy of the Indian government on how
to deal with China following what
happened at the UN well it is not a
member of the United Nations Security
Council but India is in very close touch
with the three four countries that were
part of this entire procedure now what
we are hearing is that this is at in New
York in the UN Security Council it's
going to happen in three phases the
first could be a no objection procedure
which means that one of the countries
which forwarded this request to make
Maulana Masood Azhar designated
terrorist under 12 67 could write to
each and every country are in the UN
Security Council there are 15 of them
including China of course and say look
what are your objections are to making
Maulana Masood Azhar our terrorist who
so that is really the first part and
then there is a say if nothing is
nothing works out on that there will be
a second part the second part could be a
closed-door meeting with all 15 members
there now at that meeting once again the
Chinese diplomat involved could be asked
look here what is your problem is
Maulana Masood Azhar a terrorist or not
if he's a terrorist then what is your
objection to making him a designated
terrorist now it's one thing for a
Chinese government to send a one-line
note on email to the UN Security Council
saying we want to hold it's quite
another to write a letter and then or as
the second part is to speak to 14 other
members of the UN Security Council and
say look this is our problem this is our
objection so this is a
a way of countering China cornering
China and there is a third part and that
is the most important if these to fail
then the third part would be a public
meeting ending in vote now in that
public meeting the second was a
closed-door meeting in that public
meeting which will be on television the
world's the world's television channels
will be in watching the entire
proceedings at that public meeting all
15 countries will speak about the issue
and clearly it will end in a vote there
is widespread expectation that the vote
if China continues to go ahead will be
14 1 now is China ready to accept that
is China ready to be publicly or in the
glare of the world to be the only
country in the UN Security Council
supporting Maulana Masood Azhar what
will China's position be when there is a
vote when there is a public debate of
the UN Security Council which would be
the third part and there is the
important point because China's so far
can send an email and say look we want
to hold here you circumvent the whole
you go ahead have a public meeting and
add that at the end of it have a vote
this would be a good way of cornering
China on Maulana Masood Azhar because
very clearly there are 13 countries in
the UN Security Council who supported
the initiative there is a 14th country
and then China
can I just request you to stay with me
I'm also joined on the phone line by
strategic affairs experts on serene
social serene look at this strategy this
you know part 2 of our strategy really
that the Indian government is deploying
now I think there are two motives you
are clearly one is that there are other
ways of bringing China on board if the
you know if the things are not working
in our favor at the UNSC then perhaps we
can convince the other countries which
are supporting India in its fight
against terror to corner China by
themselves blacklisting Masood Azhar so
that Corner's China also shows them in a
bad light in a way that they are the
only ones who seem to be supporting
terror
look in theory that seems to be the way
to all but on the practical plane I
don't know how much difference it will
make because at the end of the day the
Chinese have been very prison about what
they have done and they don't care a
damn what India or anybody else in the
world things because if there is they
you know the very fact that is in
countries I was supporting this
particular measure or had no objections
to it
then the Chinese becoming their own
scanned out on this particular issue
shows what their attitude on this is so
I don't know how much difference it will
make at the practical jet but even
otherwise by luck in symbolically it is
all very well for other countries to
prescribe Masood Azhar and his
organization the question there are two
questions one I don't think muscle or
the rest of this bunch actually does
business or have a sense in many of
these countries and even have take who
those are very marginal but more
importantly I think what the world seeks
to understand is that Masood Azhar does
not operate in a vacuum and operates
because of the state support he operates
as a quasi state actor he operates
because here it shows the patronage of
the state and even unless some of these
countries are not willing to take action
against this terrorist state which is
participant",True,en,95755,321,1131

with you are we at a loss of ideas on
how to deal with this bigger bully in
our neighborhood China do we know how to
deal with China because you know look at
the statements that have been issued by
India and us following China blocking
the listing of masood azhar yesterday in
our statement interestingly India did
not even name China while on the other
hand if you look at the statement issued
by the u.s. it is much stronger when it
says that China should not prevent the
committee from doing the job the
Security Council has entrusted it to do
we are missing out on sending a clear
message to China as well would you agree
I agree with you entirely and you know
that was the point I was trying to make
earlier when you cut into other issues
you you have to understand what are your
strengths vis-a-vis China I know there
is a general feeling that China can roll
all over us well that's not true I don't
buy it
militarily the other aspect is that
China is now getting into a
international diplomatic corner where
the kind of friends it has like North
Korea and Pakistan are not necessarily
the people that people would like to
dine with China does have a few other
small ones but all big nations have deep
pockets and they buy out friends and
countries whether it's Maldives or
anybody else wait for bailout and
financial doles and then later repented
what can we do the first thing that we
can do and I think this is a suggestion
for mr. Rahul Gandhi and his lackeys
that instead of questioning whether mr.
Modi's policies have succeeded or not he
could initiate something now in the
election season by telling the people of
India to boycott Chinese goods does he
have the guts does he have the vision
has he decided that he is going to be
able to stand up to the Chinese because
when doe clem happened mr. Gandhi chose
to go to the Chinese embassy for a
briefing and not to cell block so that's
the first thing the second thing is that
our officials have too much of baggage
of 1962 which is naruse legacy in the MA
in fact
the Ministry of External Affairs is
still haunted by the policies and some
of the major failures of Pandit Nehru a
great administrator and a great founding
father of modern India but he got it
completely wrong with foreign policy and
this is where I say we need to break
away from the shadow of Nehru like
Muslim Modi has broken the mindset and
gone beyond the LOC with the airstrikes
and previously the surgical strikes
mr. Modi and his government should now
dump the wuhan spirit should now set
aside any hope of rh4 approachment with
China because they don't even accept the
maps you give them for border
settlements just not interested in the
border session that china is interested
in the waters of the Indus on which it
is building down through which it is
going to get electricity and water to
make microchips to dominate the world
economy maybe even understood that there
is a lack of understanding are
statements from the mea are a kind of
example in doublespeak
we neither named Pakistan nor we named
China in when we go out and give up
doing that Judy but she wants to wants
to pitch in with a point here major to
the jadeybug she has the time come for
us to stop you know expecting that China
will become our friend
dump the Wuhan spirit is the suggestion
from a root side what do you have to say
no I I say we give it it for that we
deal with China we behave with China
exactly the way it waves with us it's
only that which will make China
understand that it is causing pain our
people have been at the receiving end of
an asymmetric war offensive for the last
thirty years eighty thousand Indians
have been killed and it's a rather sad
that our foreign ministry in their
so-called quest for peace are so
insensitive to the suffering of the
accommodate need people that they say
terror and talks can't go together and

the decision on the move by UK US and
France to blacklist Masood Azhar that
proposal in the UNSC the final decision
on that will be out in about three hours
from now but before that what is
interesting is the stang of both the
United States to enjoy and also the
statement we saw from China today yes
absolutely right and also Russia it has
to be said that the Russian and why here
has also spoken with times now and has
said that like almost every country in
the UN Security Council all of them
favor
strong action on terror
was strong action against masood azhar
china has been a bit wishy-washy and
they really are sitting on the fence
right now which makes it difficult to
predict what they will do in the next
two or three hours as you rightly said
the important point is will they favor
or terrorism by doing another hold on
Maulana Masood Azhar or will they sit on
their hands and say okay we stay silent
this decision pass that's the crucial
moment to wait for and you heard Sushma
Swaraj say that look here Imran Khan if
you're such a statesman if you want so
much peace then give us Mawlana Masood
Azhar and we'd be happy but the really
critical stand will be that of China
they may have said today that we are
going to behave in a responsible fashion
but that's neither here nor there will
they put a technical hold as always
that'll be critical to deciding whether
Masood Azhar is designated a global
terrorist or not for now thank you very

now what we're going to show you is a

it's my personal opinion of the

that's the party status area this review
that's the result
thank you they want Sutter Street to be

this goes on but with Jesus are ready
girl will definitely vote for her
not even once he comes to power nah tell
you one thing so no one is left
initially the recession then you could
take it for granted all right it seems
the game is out as far as the wife CPS
can send my colleague Paloma joins us
now for more on this Paul effectively he
has given the game away effectively also
making sure that the chart that
Chandrababu Naidu levels against the
wiles ap all the time in some respect
has now been proven it is the b-team of
the BJP well that's right at there in
fact he is not a low-level party Carter
who speaking and revealing those facts
he is an official a spokesperson of the
ys RCP party his name is Manoj Qatari in
fact speaking to us on candid camera he
happened to say this
ensuring that the camera wasn't on
several times he kept looking at the
camera but we assured him it wasn't on
camera that is when he happened to say
that yes there is a tacit understanding
between the BJP and the y acp an
explosive revelation there wherein he
says that we're in Lakshmi Narayan Akana
Lakshmi Narayana who's the BJP state
president of Andhra Pradesh where he
contests which is most likely going to
be Guntur the voice RCP will be fielding
a weak candidate
very surprising an explosive revelation
there because time and again when we
questioned why I saw CB they have been
maintaining that they will not be going
in a pre poll alliance
the Congress or the BJP whichever party
is ready to grant special category
status for the state of Andhra Pradesh
we will be aligning with them in case
they grant special category status in a
post poll Alliance so this comes as a
shocker to the Vice RCP party because
the I do has on throughout been claiming
that why is our CP is the b-team of the
BJP and now it seems like all those
allegations are only coming quite polls
stay with us we have another agenda
setting news break coming up right now
sources are now telling this channel
that the BJP is looking for an alliance
with the TRS the Telangana Rashtra
sematic and the TRS may be ready for a
post poll alliance another big news
break coming in right now
a lieutenant neuron and my colleague
joining us now for more on their sanity
the TRS has been making noises making
moves as well as the TRS president a
case er does have a working relationship
with marine Samoa the prime minister as
well but this of course coming in from
sources that a post poll Alliance might
be perhaps to the liking of the TRS also
a big breaking news here well as far as
the TRS is concerned over the past five
years we have seen the TRS has been what
we call a fence-sitter party whenever
there have been crucial issues in which
probably all opposition parties come
together to stand up against the
government against the BJP it is usually
the TRS that has usually been remain
either non-committal or in some issues
has also come out and supporting the
government and supported the BJP in that
regard clearly the BJP is eyeing that
probably now this time around they can
get some sort of support with the TRS
after the elections come to an end now
there are certain political parties
across the country other whether we talk
about parties like the TRS or whether we
talk about parties like the BJD the BJP
till now openly hasn't come out and said
that they are not looking at any
alliance or any support from these
political parties and these are the
political parties who have not shown any
inclination either towards the BJP or
towards the opposition so currently the
fight rally will be huqin clinched the
these political parties first can
opposition do that or can the BJP do
that so yes a lot of sad state by the
BJP on the TRS had probably this time
around after the elections come
and given the proximity between KCR and
the Prime Minister as far as issues
within the state of Telangana is
concerned there is hope within the BJP
that properly TRS being a non-committal
party might just come out and support
the BJP all right okay thank you for
that news break in fact saying on the
Telangana Andhra region now the on the
chief minister Chandrababu Naidu has
slammed Prime Minister Modi here
chandrashekar rao and Wiese are a big
mega pardon Jagan Mohan Reddy saying all
of them all three of them I actually a
conspiracy against Andhra Pradesh take a
look at what Naidu said and in fact
before we get you that more breaking
news coming in right now this time from
Maharashtra this comes even as the NCP
and the Congress party continued to face
uncertainty over defections this is a
news just coming in right now the NCP
top brass is in a huddle in Mumbai and
expectedly so they've suffered the worst
of the defection the past two days now
Kajol I and my colleague joins us now
with the latest on this schedule they of
course suffered a few setbacks in the
last couple of days now they're in a
hardened expectedly what is on the
agenda are they going to try and win
back people who have already jumped ship
or is this going to be a fresh strategy
to tackle more decisions
when the defections are being the are
being discussed right now but also
importantly NCP which state had came for
the amethyst seat which led to Suja a
capital defecting to the BJP right now
the discussion is going on about what to
do with that emeth Nagar seed who should
be placed in the as an NCP candidate
there and how to go about the campaign
there so that is one of the major things
that is being discussed in fact NCP
chief Sharad Pawar he's right now inside
with chug-n'-buzz Bell Sunil that curry
and several other giant paddle and
several other leaders of the NCP state
leadership and talking about these
things right now we did try to ask him
about the issues with the Congress that
he has had but he did not want to talk
about it at all he did not respond to
our questions but right now for the past
one or at least they have been in a
meeting trying to figure out their
strategy further ahead and also about
what to do with the ammidon Agassi all
right a kajal thank you for joining us
with those details we move on straight
across to our guest size of our islam of
the BJP joins us rajagopal and Sina
journalists joining us from the studio a
chrushank is a political analyst joins
us from Hyderabad and completing the
panel today is Sanjeev she was the
senior journalist and political analyst
I'd like to start with send you if I
could then I'll go to suffer sanjeev
does it look like in a string of news
that we've seen some stings this channel
has done as well other news stories
coming in is the momentum firmly back
with the BJP and the prime minister now
given the spate and affections given
this weight even the AGP is back with
the BJP now something that we didn't see
coming do you think the momentum is
firmly now back with other in the Modi
well lately to some extent that is true
post poll Varma
post airstrikes there is a general
perception or talk amongst chattering
classes that the momentum has shifted
towards the BJP and by that it really
means Prime Minister Narendra Modi so
you are seeing these few defections some
string operations but I don't think
there is any large-scale defection
happening anywhere yes the momentum is
shifted but there is still about a month
left for the elections
the public mood in the last few weeks
can be very pickled so to to sustain
this narrative is a big challenge for
the ruling party mm-hmm that they keep
the discourse around Palama around the
airport strikes and the big challenge
for the opposition is how do they come
across as not being patriotic patriotic
as is that they are not seen as
questioning the air force of the
government on full wama and air strikes
but at the same time somehow bring back
the narrative ghostly narrative during
December interesting very interesting
Sanjay I want to I want to slightly
explore what you said at the beginning
of your opening statement and so far
Islam even though son you see is
right when he says there are no large
scale of massive defections but these
defections will hurt at the local level
of course we kept bottled Sun being so
joy being the first example there what
we understand what I understand is all
he wanted was to contest from the emag
Nagar seat he would have been a
formidable candidate if mr. Furth never
decides to a contest to me or anyone
else in the BJP but the Congress and the
NCP and other parties in the so-called
Mahatma none were caught napping here
same case in Assam with the AGP or we
are seeing the same thing in Bengal as
well do you think it's just an out
manoeuvring out playing off the so
called Mahad London because you have for
want of a better phrase more 24/7
politicians in your midst that they'll
say the only political party which
enjoys the confidence of the people
today is the passage in the party large
scale confidence and that is something
which is actually troubling the many
opposition party then some of the
leaders which they when they do not
agree with the approach and the conduct
of their own leadership they feel that
there is a time for them to say goodbye
and join another political party we we
definitely welcome but we do not welcome
everyone it's not late there many people
may be wanting to join but we welcome
only people who feel we feel that they
will be in line with our ideological
faith and and the conduct will be in
line with our
in line with our party the pros no I am
the prof you allow me Zafar I want to
challenge in that particular state and
with thanks if you allow me so far if
you just allow me you say ok show show
complete please complete because I don't
completely agree with what you're saying
that you won't accept all my and
everyone that is that's that's not the
case but anyway go ahead zipper all I'm
saying that the gun and muhabba get one
then and the we kind of a we kind of
arrangement the point which I was trying
to make that there's a weak arrangement
is just the in the opportunist to
opportunities party there are few parts
okay what is that coming together
alright save that their own interest
they do not have intend to serve the
people or solve the issues of the people
all right okay the calculus you shiok
now because I have only time so first
chrushank and then rajagopal inclusion
that's not entirely true is it all of
these so-called defections are happening
very close to the polls most of them
because these people either wanted
tickets to contest from or had other
grouses of the local leadership and
they're looking out for their own future
the BJP is happily accepting all of them
and that's also part of it it can't just
be that suddenly they decide the BJP is
the only party that can deliver and the
Prime Minister is the only local ever
and a month before the polls they jump
ship there's also that factor to be to
be taken into consideration
absolutely absolutely after I'm I'm
talking to you this at the point of time
when our former Home Minister of the
state
Telangana has shifted sides to Telangana
rise to some tea
after just winning in the legislature
assembly polls just three months back
she was criticizing the Chief Minister
very recently and in fact was also
present in Rahul Gandhi's
public meeting and the next day she goes
and meets chief minister K Chandra
Shekar oh so these individuals are
worried about their self vested
interests about their political careers
and they're shifting sides the same
thing is happening I mean part ochenta
party parliamentarians going into
Congress and many others also different
going so that doesn't really decide that
which party
is actually inclining towards being into
the power because it is just these few
individuals who want to but having
certain terms insecure
having before the polls are showing
words are not this question to rajagopal
and having said that rajagopal and it
does seem like that the BJP is hitting
the so-called Maha bundle where it will
hurt the most in states like a sama the
AGP is back in states like Maharashtra
where people thought pre Paloma it was
wide open contest and these are not just
any candidates or any leaders that are
coming to the BJP these are formidable
opponents in an electoral setup these
are formidable people with formidable
followings
and that will hurt the market Munda not
only on the ground but perception-wise
and as we all know perception is out the
game in Indian politics rajagopal oh no
need of hurting my husband then attack
because there is no mahogany then today
you see what shattered quad has been
saying that's a part of mahogany and he
says BJP will be 3-digit party in the
single largest party in the next Lok
Sabha want more lensing Yahoo said on
the floor of the house on the last day
of the Parliament that morning will be
primary struggling apart from that I am
wanting to say something very
interesting though you talked about a
team meeting there is a sea team also
for the last three days big thing is
happening without the notice of many no
three times Saudi Arabian Minister met
Prime Minister and Sushma Swaraj what is
fun there is something cooking there is
see team working outside the system
which is going to clear up in the month
of April which will again booster BJP
image like Ghulam and the bulk or
something major is happening therefore
mother is Norma Hartmann then and the
search is for mr. Narendra Modi this is
going to be a one-day election 2019 is
going to be a one-way election I don't
see any
maja got Bandhan throw right ladies I do
Paula it's very interesting what you're
saying because I'm inclined to agree
with you on the limited point that
something is cooking I can't put my
finger on it what exactly is cooking but
something is definitely cooking and we
will try and ask you a bit more about
that after the break please stay with us
we'll be right back with more
more breaking news coming in right now
another jolt for the Congress party this
time in Mumbai Maharashtra the Mumbai
Northeast influential Congress leader
Pradeep poker car has joined the
Maharashtra Navnirman Sena Raj tech
grade this is yet another in a string of
defections of the Congress party is seen
in the past couple of days and this
seems to perhaps cement what Zafar Islam
was telling us just a few minutes and go
but Sanjeev asked them yet again I don't
want to read too much into it because
this is election season after all and
people will of course jump ship from
here to there but there you go Mumbai
Northeast Congress leader for the poker
car also joining the EMA is this time
not to be trippy but I want you to
basically try and read what mr.
rajagopal and told us before the break
he says something's cooking on the
international front there might be a sea
team is there Adi Anglia and you know
exactly what I mean I really don't know
what may be cooking but whatever may be
cooking we'll all know because of what
is being cooked will not be in public
display then it will not benefit or harm
anyone so whatever it is will come out
in public viewing but see id yes the son
of Maharashtra leader or opposition
actually going and joining the BJP
yesterday I consider that a decent
enough mid mid ticket defections the
father is still at the party and I
believe who was not getting a ticket
from very wanted know these things are
while they will definitely put the
Congress on the back foot and in any
case Congress is already on the back put
in quite a large segment called the
country but these are common happenings
during elections time people do change
parties people do move sides people are
opportunists people try and go away they
think they are getting a better deal so
the number of defection is still not
even in double suffer
would you like a common harrowing about
it like as if heaven suffer Islam would
you would you say it's too early to
write off the Congress as a as a
shipyard is sinking in a perspective
okay so far Islam
no no no yeah other I disagree with mr.
Sanjeev Sri Bosco is a political group
but I think he has to understand this
you are and you have to have two
contrasting situation one where the
political parties everybody is attracted
to and the other one that nobody is
trying to leave that political party
that also gives a very positive signal
to the people that nobody wants to leave
Martha Delta party
in fact his message in the party who
well people want to join only because as
I said only because in last 5 years what
did they because with the slogan which
we have given by spelled sol Bonham

prominent members of Raul's closest
allies and we have discovered that
leaders who should be fighting shoulder
to shoulder are come have come out with
daggers drawn out ready to strike behind
Congress's back in fact times now also
conducted a sting on the Congress ally
in Maharashtra the NCP the spokesperson
of the party told us that the NCP took
its cues from Charlotte Vivar who is not
entirely dependable
what if you'll come wrestle and onl not
much Kamini I said coming here generally
I'm not a crier you can make a decoder
open yet neighbor with a pinnacle in
command mika-chan we're able to last any
single path on each other I've done any
press now both which guy sounded awkward
on the election result on ek ladki a
possibility henna already
in fact so clearly troubles mounting for
the Congress party now the sting
operation was conducted on NCP
spokesperson Chitra VAR who came out and
said that the final decision clearly
will be taken by Charlotte Baba she also
said that Babar is not a defendable
Congress Ally salvos mega Prasad is
joining us live on the broadcast Mika
isn't this what we have been discussing
over the past couple of months how on
the face of it all the top political
leaders from the opposition try and seem
to and look together but within inside
there is so much of internal bickering
that nobody is actually sure whether
they will actually be going along with
the Congress both selections or for that
matter even pre elections coming to your
question just a bitter oddity but the
parts that we put out of Chitra wok the
spokesperson of the NCP she talking
about Sharad Pawar
I think perhaps is one of the most apt
description of who Sharad Pawar as a
leader is and mind you he's somebody
who's being seen as the top two or three
leaders within the so-called mahogany
which still has not taken shape as as a
possible prime minister contender and
this is what you hear about him from one
of his own party members to throb as a
prominent face of the NCP and for her to
admit this of course she didn't know
that the cameras are rolling but for her
to admit that it is absolutely
unpredictable with her mr. Sharath
Parvati Li very end you don't know
what's going on in his mind and doesn't
rule out the fact that there could be a
possibility where mr. Sharad Pawar could
actually quit thick you know the
association with the Congress here and
perhaps go towards joining hands with
the BJP now let's just take you a little
in the back in the back the backdrop of
it of course other thing is this that
mr. schirra Tovar in the NCP in 2014 had
warmed up to the BJP quite quite a great
deal in fact the world a lot of talks
about n simply joining hands with the
BJP and come you know becoming an
alliance partner back then though it
didn't happen but then here is mr.
Sharad Pawar who's that
really unpredictable and that is what
her own party member his own party
member is saying this you know on camera
now for us to understand when you're
talking about the mahogany Bandhan of
course this mahogany is a crowd of
different political parties who do not
see eye to eye or in various different
states I mean they might come together
at the national level but in states they
are fighting with each other there are
situations where they're fighting in the
state and then might want to you know
come together at this level so all all
of those differences still remain not
much has been done to remove those
differences they haven't really come
together in the real sense of the term
and yet of course the opposition would
want to portray a picture that they are
all United wanting to take on Narendra
Modi but the reality is much different
and probably maker this also shows how
top leaders like Sharad Pawar who is
much senior inexperienced in his
experience in politics as compared to
Rahul Gandhi how they actually do not
really trust Rahul Gandhi as a figure
who is at least attempting to lead the
so-called united opposition",True,en,20206,30,104

Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra Gandhi I like
a rudderless ship they do not know what

authoritative Lee today national
security and the Bala caught air strike
is a very important issue because
Pakistan has been shown its place and I
would have loved to see Gandhi has a
point where he says Mr Barra Bhatia that
you as the ruling party for the last
five years should be talking about what
happened to employment what happened to
growth what happened to farmers what
happened to women security she's raised

there's a difference between the two in

other hand the Pakistani attack was

secondly the fact that when this
happened the Indian combat air patrol

took on the m16 and other planes that

welcome back to the big story we are
tracking here first one times now what
is Pakistan hiding in the aftermath of
the Bala caught air strikes because
vortex a war tells explains the denial
and the refusal of permission to
international news agency Reuters to the
Javits of our national affairs editor
Shinjo Chaudhary joins me to enjoy for
the last couple of days times now has
put out the proof visuals as well as
satellite imagery that shows how India
punished the terror camps in Pakistan
and now this revelation now coming to us
that Reuters team has been blocked by
Pakistan that's exactly the point
furnish on the one hand Pakistan says
all kinds of things that they shot down
a mig-21 find and know of f-16 was shot
down even though two parachutes were
visible well the fact that they did not
target Indian military bases again and
again Pakistan has said things and
gotten thought they had got away with it
now comes a stage where Pakistan is
asked directly can you take us by
Reuters a respected international
organization can you take us to Bala
code and the answer is no the question
is why why if if actually nothing has
happened in Bala code if absolutely
nothing has happened and the Indian Air
Force did not reach there the Indian Air
Force did not strike there if that is
actually so why don't you allow Reuters
or everybody else to go to Bala Cole let
everybody go to Bala Cote and see for
themselves that is exactly what Pakistan
should do absolutely routes if center
joins the broadcast Ranger Rahul the
question is the Pakistani establishment
that claims that only trees were damaged
in the strike what are they hiding now
well you know furnish let me also tell
you let me also tell you finish that
there is a big issue here and the issue
is this very simply this that we are
being told and we have heard from our
sources who have captured
satellite images of Jabba top and in
those satellite images there is evidence
also of Pakistan and this is what we
were told both to enjoy and myself by
highly placed government sources in a
face-to-face meeting that Pakistan was
also undertaking a reconstruction of
this particular facility the gesture
Mohammed training facility the training
camp so maybe the reason why the Reuters
crew has not been allowed to go up to
Jabba top the training facility and
conduct a physical verification is
because there is this quick repair job
that is being undertaken so that the
whole world can then continue to be
fooled by Pakistan that India missed its
mark now I want to also ask a very
specific question of those doubters here
in this country who have been constantly
insisting on the back of an earlier
Reuters report that India must furnish
proof that it actually struck the camp
because in earlier Reuters report using
some open-source private satellite
channel imagery had come out and claimed
that India had missed the mark now that
was a verification from 60,000 feet in
the air and when reuters wants to go and
investigate on the ground they are
blocked so will those same doubters who
coated the Reuters report to question
the government will those same doubters
now use this Reuters report to question
the Pakistani government and asked them
to furnish proof that their camp that
the Jesse Mohammed camp has not been
struck that's the fundamental question
Colonel Harrison also joins the
broadcast Colonel Harrison big
development on the strike on the Jesse
Mohammed Pakistan is blocked
Reuters team and other international
teams from Jabba top why that's the big
question there are two types of lobbies
you know we're trying to debunk with
this entire
I know a strike one is of course I'm in
the Pro Pack Lobby here or the proxies
of Pakistan I mean the weather is a very
thriving industry in India very thriving
industry they are this because this
industry has the entrenching self you
know not three decades and now there is
of course the arms lobby now don't
compel me to open my mouth I'm more much
more details and a purse I personally
have what should I say have I had
personal experience in this regard
after this bala quoted strike as to how
how the arms Lobby you know is
influencing Realtors it was a fake
satellite photograph you can ask anybody
who has done satellite interpretation
that satellite it made only has values
if it has annotation see I was in
intelligence II than we used to demand
the satellite photographs and then you
know there's a whole lot of you know
exercise goes in it has the details are
furnished to you with the notations and
well it day they it out annotations it I
can pick up you know similar buildings
anywhere in the world on a hillside and
I'm you know pass it off either as a
target so that was a big fraud and I
know why the Reuters and the New York
Times are on overdrive I remember one
thing I might say that well please don't
compel me to open my mouth but the least
to say is to say that the arms Lobby is
very very strong it has very strong
reasons also for this and there are very
deep pockets very very deep pockets and
now I know now I know editor as to why
why there are lobbies here to debunk our
all indigenous efforts I can imagine how
how powerful this Lobby is and how you
know all our indigenous efforts towards
I know that's it's a question to Allah
are sensing will the doubters now
question Pakistan and Imran Khan some of
them even wanted to give a Nobel Peace
Prize to Imran Khan remember booties go
ahead said Boyd
they're got irrigated money from both
the arms Lobby and the birds from
Pakistan I told you it's a thriving
industry so there's a thriving industry
yeah but if Pakistan has clean hands
then Pakistan should immediately give
access to all international journalists
and let me tell you this is a third
attempt that has been blocked in just
nine days third attempt to go and
physically verify by journalists the
infrastructure and the facilities once
they said weather was poor then they
said administrative and organizational
regions reasons and the third time
they've said that listen there is no
school even now there that's been shut
down a year back so why even bother
there's even more or less Rahul there's
even more reason than to send people to
Bala code if there is no school if
there's been no strike if the Indian Air
Force never got anywhere then fine show
it to the world so were two independent
Western journalists that yes this is a
school now actually what has happened is
there is enormous damage and you can't
repair that in a few days well you're
probably right you're probably right
there have been different assessments
coming out from Indian experts and other
including times now conversations we've
had with people in government
face-to-face conversations where a huge
amount of credible data and evidence
were shared with us to establish the
fact that the Indian Air Force struck
home so Pakistan now the onus is on you
Pakistan to come out and explain why you
are not allowing access to this facility
what are you waiting for are you
stalling for time so you can go then
reconstruct it turn Allison is that a
possibility do you think that could be
happening no what I suggest is all those
people who you know peace makes and who
claim to have close affinity with
Pakistan you are absolutely right I mean
they should personally take you redditor
cell Subala Court I mean after all
itself it would be a big gesture that
look nothing has happened we continue to
be friends I mean you know these
characters we lost them they know they
utilize their good offices to reach
reach ball
koten and I've just stay with us John
they all noted human rights activist
also on the phone line mr. Dayal
Pakistan has blocked Reuters team that
wanted to go and see what transpired on
the job atop was behind this move sir
mr. John they'll your own times now sir
if you can hear me will connect with him
in just a bit ginger but the point that
Rahul was making is very damning to say
the least that they were reports just
within hours after the head strike by
India across publications and on social
media that the Pakistani military had
cordoned of the entire area
well there are several things here there
were people who are putting out
photographs some of which have been
described as archival by people in
government now archival is one way of
saying these these pictures were taken
or satellite pictures before the strike
happened then there were people who are
putting out pictures of places that were
burnt as the Pakistanis themselves said
acres and acres of pine trees now the
point is the bombs that were used were
not incendiary bombs there were not
bombs that was supposed to burn up the
whole place they were specifically
designed bunker-buster bombs
so again Pakistan had decided to really
put everybody on the wrong foot and they
have fit because those bombs that were
you know those pictures as well you
thought John they are joint Sbrocco
mr. John they al what do you make of
this move by Imran Khan no I think it
yeah go ahead sir yes you know I think
what is concrete tells this lab talk
media is one thing but when you call in
international media as it is writers or
BBC or the Soviet Russian media then you
must if you have called them for fair
weather you must call them some solid
weather and if your friends who take
them they're claiming that something is
happening something's up this raises
legitimate doubts in the minds of people
saying
would do well to allowed inspection of
the site my international media will you
appeal to others who were demanding
proof from India to say the same things
that you've said sir
no I had even and should allow
inspection of the site and musk I am but
no I say any any claim must be subject
to third-party verification but it is
American CIA so it's in set of three
satellites or whatever otherwise is just
a claim I mean is very subject is a
blackened claim so that is what I'm I am
consistent in my thing you may be
consistent in your thing but what is
Imran Khan trying to hide messages let
me put that question across to him mr.
Chopra how do you see this development
what is Imran Khan trying to hide sir
why blot the Reuters team from the Java
top the reality is that in all these
matters there is an element of drama
it's pathetic because human lives are
involved and people are trying to cash
in on it and when you try to cash in on
the sorry to interrupt you I'm sorry to
interrupt you mr. mr. Prem Chopra one
second just hold on please a second I
just want to very quickly mr. Chopra
just one second I need to read this out
for you this is what I know one second
mr. Chopra one second please give me 30
seconds please sir let's not reduce this
to an evening fight contest please give
me 30 seconds look I'm holding up in my
hand a article that was printed on the
27th of February just a day after just a
day after India surgical strike a strike
and it says damage question mark come
and see it says buck pakistan Prime
Minister will expose to the world in
yourself serving reckless fictitious
claims as foreign minister Shah Mehmood
Qureshi
this was a report filed by nasty Jeffrey
in Islamabad as I told you published at
4:00 a.m. in the morning updated on 27 0
to 19 839 am quoting shah mahmud Qureshi
the Foreign Affairs Minister of Pakistan
saying come and assess and see for
yourself yet three times three times
Pakistan is blocked any physical
verification of this particular jabba
top why why does it say in public that
you can come and inspect the facility
and in private
stop individuals from independently
verifying and we still have doubters in
this country who say then India should
furnish the proof how about Pakistan how
about Pakistan also furnishing evidence
to suggest they weren't hit when will we
put the onus on them general GD bucks he
also joins the conversation GD Bakshi
this is absolutely shocking
once again blocking of why do you think
this is happening if you please much
better higher resolution pictures where
kill the people inside has been you know
clearly visiting the mosque is more
visible the Pakistani ambulance
satellite you know high-resolution
imagery
now these people are up you know the
Pakistanis are a bunch of inveterate
liars
the city is they are being supported by
the vested media and the Western media
you know we have a colonial handle was
what is whatever the wish the velocities
is right whatever vehicles at Brown is
wrong this would be Reuter she just so
sorry to interrupt you the important
point is Pakistan has not allowed
writers to the Bala Court J AM Center
that instead of that should itself be
proof if Pakistan was so clear about the
fact that there was no strike and even
if there was a strike the bombs had
fallen all over the place and not hit
the target
well the first thing that Pakistan
should have done is allowed the Reuters
team to go across now it is important to
restate that there may be more than four
or five buildings in the area they may
be eight or ten and the Indian Air Force
specifically chose four specific targets
now if you show pictures of the other
four buildings or the other five
buildings which shown old bomb damage
because they were not attacked at all of
after the strike then what you're doing
is actually show us for pictures
absolutely that's precisely the point we
have been trying to make on general Saab
that this is the biggest admission of
guilt and this should silence the
doubters on our side will they now start
questioning Imran Khan absolutely the
doubting Thomases deed
click they want to sell us that the
Americans are right and we are wrong the
American media is always right because
they are white this Colombian and bloody
will have to go and they were trying to
fight the Reuters to prove that we are
wrong we were shown visual evidence they
will believe it
we have a bunker busting bombs and
Senators rifle and both decide to kill I
value come on and control target the
brother and the nephew of muscles Allah
that is what we were living for we've
got this for building there is no point
of Arafah this is intact this has been
admitted you know these are a bunch of
inveterate liars
the position is life who their steep it
is amazing that the only people will
give them treatment our people on our
side of the border we either meet
concocting an amazing that's the traitor
very general Saab and Colonel are
sensing has been listening to you very
intently colonel are sensing the more
worrying part like Rahul mentioned that

Swamy this is route Shiv Shankar I want
to begin by asking you firstly the most
basic questions here
are you satisfied by the composition of
the panel that is going to oversee the
mediation well first of all as far as
trifle is concerned he's a very fine
judge I have not I have very high regard
for him and as far as the chichi Ravi
Shankar I've known him for many years
and have worked with him is a wonderful
person and his knowledge of Hindu
religion is superb so I have no problem
with him the third person I don't know
at all so or maybe I've seen him in the
Supreme Court but I don't know him so I
don't know what the third person doesn't
matter
what I do know is that this committee or
any other committee cannot go beyond the
parameters that have already been set
first that there is a fundamental right
to pray where faith beliefs tells us
that Rama was born and this is attested
from the time of Guru Nanak in terms of
written records when he came before the
Babri Masjid was built or the ramen that
was destroyed and he has vividly
accounted out a beautiful temple there
was for Rama Rama was born and 99% of
the Hindus in India today believe that
Ram was born in that particular spot so
there has to be a temple there it's not
just a Ram temple it's a round
lalla temple that is where the RAM was
born second is that the Masjid is not an
essential part of Islamic religion that
the Supreme Court has held not once but
twice in other words the Masjid can be
broken much it can be shifted this is
all recorded in the Supreme Court
judgment and in fact in if you go to the
through the Google to the practice in
Saudi Arabia and all the important
Muslim countries you find that there
even to build a road
to build a road they they demolished
misdeeds galore even Masjid built in
Macao on the direction of Mohammed was
where once broken by this destroyed and
shifted by the Saudi Arabian government
so much it can be shifted it's a place
to read namaz namaz can be read anywhere
so it is actually obstinacy of the
Muslim community to insist that they
will only read namaz where Ram was born
and particularly since they are there
their past generations demolished
existing temple so I think that
compromise can be if the Muslims
willingly agree that they will build a
must did somewhere else which is what
most of the 99% of the Muslim community
today in India want they want to end
this by building up Masjid somewhere
else and the government of India can
give them a handsome compensation for
not laying further claim to the land so
this is the second part third is and the
same allows government nationalized the
entire land including the disputed area
and after the land reform acts and the
constitutional amendment
once that rationalization takes place
where the government the courts cannot
do anything to set it aside they had
most can lay down what the compensation
principle can be and that now applies to
these people also so the government
cannot the Supreme Court cannot turn
around to the government and say hand
over the land to there were so many
Sunni become war but they can say the
Sunni walk of board has a title although
in Halawa die quote that was rejected
and say pay them compensation so what is
the compromise the Muslim community
agrees to take on the compensation and
grows and builds our Masjid somewhere
else and the Hindu community will assist
the Muslim community to find a suit
suitable land that's the only compromise
possible otherwise the parameters set
leave you no room whatsoever to think of
any alternative such a suggestion then
building a temple in where Ram was born
okay let me ask you a question that is
on the
top of everyone's mind because during
the last hearing the benches had passed
a very important sort of observation
they said that this goes beyond now an
ordinary land /title dispute and you
were in the court at that time dr. Swamy
in fact the bench had also gone ahead
and said that this is a matter of
sentiment faith so what you're saying
therefore suggests that if it goes
beyond just a property dispute then the
Muslim side must actually move or
perhaps shift to a more centrist
position
congratulations that's correct that's
the people most people missed it I'm
surprised you you didn't so that's
that's absolutely I don't tend to miss
these things attached yeah
we don't because we've been following
this case along with who now for years
all together but but now let me come to
the bigger question you see Sir the way
we are looking at it is that this matter
can be ended by me it's quite nicely if
only one of the sides decides to
accommodate and I'm not so compromised
I'm only saying accommodate a matter of
faith if they can this matter is done
with its dealt with before the elections
well we could if there it wasn't
deliberately brutally demolished in the
temple and we have fought the Hindu
community has fought for five hundred
years for it it's not going to
compromise by saying you and I share the
same land nothing of the kind
especially when Masjid is not an
essential part of Islamic religion and
Masjid can be read even on railway
platforms so the compromise has to come
from the Muslim community him partly in
my opinion and is not going to be stated
as a part of any agreement but in my
opinion as atonement for what bubble did
to the Hindu community so what you're
saying that Baba's land yeah so what
your land of their own well the Supreme
Court also said look what is done is
done but what you're saying in essence
is that a solution a window if not a
door has been left open now for a
solution within eight weeks
that's what you're saying essentially
what I am saying that this is a
wonderful opportunity for the Muslim
community to show that they are
different from the Muslim community in
other parts of the world they are they
consider themselves as brothers and
sisters of the Hindu community here and
the Hindu community will reciprocate in
a big way if they do it what is one
timber must did to them I want to know
those who broke it unauthorized ly they
are all
facing criminal cases that's all the
Democratic Society can do file cases and
prosecute them and despite the fact that
many of them are tall leaders of the BJP
which the prosecution is taking place so
they this is the gesture they should do
but let me also say supposing they fight
the case and bin the Muslim Sunni waka
board that the title belongs to the
Muslim the waterborne government will
say sorry we have nationalized the land
take compensation and go and there's no
way to challenge that because after the
land reform disputes the Supreme Court
itself has never observed that if under
this act of a section 300 a the
government of India nationalizes the
land in public interest there is no way
you can strike it down only thing you
can do is decide whether the
compensation is adequate well thank you
dr. Swamy for putting this in
perspective for us",True,en,73159,239,864

be responsible for this unit explosion
can you give us more details as I told
in my press conference immediately after
the grenade blast took place at Jammu we
had apart from evacuating the civilians
who had been injured we had constituted
teams to take custody of all the CCTV
footage that was available in the area
and also to talk to the witnesses who
had seen the crowd running
helter-skelter based on the these two
inputs we were able to identify a
suspect who was wearing a jeans collar
jacket and was carrying a red rucksack
this was immediately flashed to all our
knockers and the deers were shared and
all the Nagas were strictly directed
that if any person with this deer is
seen
he should be apprehended a team which
was led by SDP unag rota and SH o
necrotic toll plaza at one in the grata
they saw this person and immediately
apprehended him and we put him to
sustained questioning in the preliminary
questioning that we have done he has
admitted to his crime and he has said
that he was tasked by the district
commander of his Mujahideen of Colgan
namely Farouk alias Omar who had also
given him the grenade and had asked him
to do this grenade throwing incident
what was the intention behind carrying
out his Dinard explosion in Jammu region
we know that normally they are operating
in Kashmir Valley as you are aware Jammu
is always on the radar of these
terrorist outfits they always want to
target Jammu city in order to disturb
peace in the area - - because because we
are living in area which is also
sensitive from communal point of view
the the the nefarious designs are always
there to destroy
peace he was all alone or there was any
other module also walking along with him
besides that is now he would that we
would come to know only when we have put
him to sustained interrogation put the
simple sleeper cells are already working
here operating in Jammu region they were
trying to target geometry because they
wanted to rip up those communal
sentiments and emotions we would we
would try to ascertain if there was any
sleeper cell with which this boy was
associated if the leads come out then we
would definitely take action against the
sleepers well they just heard the top
cop who's investigating and looking into
the dastardly crania attack which has
happened in Jammu unfortunately a 17
year old boy has also lost his life but
four people so far have been arrested I
beg your pardon in fact er many people
have been arrested so far as many as 15
is what we are picking up and as the
police officer have been telling us that
there is a very distinct Hizbul
Mujahideen a park funded terror
organization whose hand and footprint is
very clearly visible in this attack on
civilians and what really has been
unfortunate earlier in phulwa in the
case of full drama remember it was our
armed forces who were on attack and this
time around it is civilians who are also
not being spared let's go across to
Pradeep data Pradeep you've had a word
with the person who has been arrested on
suspect of him throwing a hand grenade
you spoken with the top cop what are you
picking up when it comes to the leads
which terror organisation was behind
this dastardly attack
so what we have been told by IG Jamal
mr. manesis and others it was cool gum
commander of his Lobos Ivan who had
handed over to need to a yasser and
yeltsin yesterday came from kashmir
valley to decision today he loved to
delay and while he was fleeing not to
kashmir valley that was the time when
they were able to nab him gloomier wrote
on Jerusha nagar national highway so
this that way it's a very big success
for you know security forces in Jammu
and Kashmir Police but that with an arts
of this channel attack they had been
able to nab the person who had lobbed a
grenade this Yasin is basically from
conga area and he was handed over
Chinese grenade by none of them his girl
commander operating there in coal Valley
and he is the one who had given the
grenade within a mission that he has to
lava can identify maximum casualty you
rightly said that look these cellist and
first they tried to target our brave
hearts in poleramma now they have
targeted innocent civilians who had
nothing to do with any kind of
counterinsurgency operation and I think
this is a reminder for all the political
party leaders who keep on saying that
there should be a dialogue with Pakistan
it here is a man who is taking care of
his luggage Eisenhower kissing is
allowed him he's sitting in Pakistan
Occupied Kashmir from where he is
calling shots and Pakistan is providing
him a sanctuary safe heaven there where
he is putting up who action is being
initiated against that man but there for
several - degree turtle heads here in
Java Rakesh religion in different parts
of country and this is the third Junaid
explosion in Boston area - the last nine
months
and thirdly - the last 30 days after
poll bomb attack there was another int
explosion in several of the houses where
a damage in south Kashmir area and today
one person died and about more than 30
we are injured the sea
12 people were from Java region 11 we
are from Kashmir Valley I think this
these people have crossed all limits of
humanity they do not bother about who is
getting killed or who is not getting
killed all they really believe in is to
destabilize situation I spoke to my GP
he said that this is a very volatile
region right now because situation is
quite volatile they were trying to rip
up those communal passions and
sentiments so that there is a trouble in
this area but once again people of Jammu
region they have stood united and they
have given and before ting applying to
the various design of Pakistan and the
path proxies who are trying to stabilize
pieces this region it was Chinese
grenade that was loved by these people
and a short while back we spoke tried
and right now his questing is going on
they're trying to find out whether he
was all alone because what it's omission
right now but they're having that he
alone came from that area lobbed a
grenade and was on his way back to kiss
Petrelli
that was the time when because of the
CCTV footage everything that was
available to them and all they were able
to talk to such of people that evidence
corroborated by this police person they
were able to identify this man and you
should think a national I mean your toll
plaza there absolutely it's important
for the police to get to the bottom of
it because at the end of it a young life
has been snuffed out but unfortunately
even in fighting terror India doesn't
stand united and that is the next story
that we are getting for you how India
today stands divided in the bigotry well
all of that was caught on camera in
Lucknow goons who were wearing saffron

that the UN has rejected jamaat-ud-dawa
Chiefs appealed to delist him from
sanctions regime Hafiz says in fact has
been told by the UN that sufficient
information is there to prove a
reasonable and credible basis to
continue the band the ban on name is
going to continue and he will be the
part of the terrorist list he'll
continue to be the part of the terrorist
list his name will not be taken off that
is appealing to do list him from the
sanctions regime has been rejected by
the United Nations let's go across to
our consulting editor conjoining us with
more details after that a big
development a very significant
development swathi the fact it gives us
a window into what the global atmosphere
and the global feeling is currently
against terrorism and all those who are
operatives of terror now this is
important to understand an outline that
most major powers in the p5 including of
us France and the UK did not in fact
opposed sorry I beg your pardon opposed
his appeal to delist him from that
particular list also India obviously on
the side of keeping him on that list the
reason of course is quite simple there
is a global consensus that India of
course has had a very very important
hand in building against terror
operatives like we said the fact that
the UN has rejected as appealed
summarily also gives us an indication
and that this comes just a couple of
days before the all-important you end a
thank you UN list 1 2 6 7 is also going
to be taken up and that of course other
much soldier fate will be decided but
for now this is a huge development as
far as India is concerned the fact that
he tried again and again through a log
base lawyer to get him ourself
off the list has been unsuccessful and
his Jamaat's uttama as well as himself
continue to be on the list of the UN as
prescribed people he will not will be
listed now anytime soon the fact this
has happened just before tails before
13th of March remember
13th of March I keep suggesting because
that is the day when 1 2 6 7 is going to
be taken up and other Masood straight is
going to be decided but this give us an
indication clearly on what might happen
remember Pakistan opposed
has in fact opposed and that should be
understand that is understandable right
because Pakistan even though they have
prescribed is outfit way back in 2008 it
has largely believed that he still
enjoys the support and the tutelage of
the Pakistani military establishment he
is particularly I find it getting
himself in his organization delisted now
has come to or not and that is a huge
victory in the fight against terror
Swati absolutely in fact not just a big
blow to Hafiz side but also to Pakistan
that we often see rallying behind office
aid other absolutely all those people
who still support overtly or overtly
either have to save or all those
so-called non-state actors that have
been there you know operating under the
tutelage really of the Pakistani
military establishment it's a big blow
to them it also it is a question mark
for importantly Swati on Iran premier
Imran Khan's latest promises or
so-called actions against terror
operatives and organizations that have
links to terror outfits and operatives
as well Pakistan claims they are taking
action against them but the fact that
Pakistan of course in fact him being
still on that list would give us an idea
really that whatever Pakistan civilian
administration is saying at least on the
face of it needs to be taken with a
pinch of salt right now it is a huge
victory for India the huge victory
against terrorism of say and the global
fight against terrorism at the fact the
US UK as well as runs for on India aside
here on the side of reason gives us an
indication really that the mood globally
has changed as far as either giving
tutelage or shelter to people who are
prescribed terrorists who have a track
record of being heads of terror outfits
and being involved remember in the
opposite case he is the mastermind of
the 26/11 terror attack on Mumbai so
India of course also played its part
because India has provided
highly confidential so this information
on his activities his prescribed
activities as well as his organization's
activities so clearly India's favorite
spot except it was after the global
community and the UN to actually play
their part now and show which side of
the global fight on terror we are all
and this inter sent a very big signal to
several
years and evidence against office say
thus far as 26/11 attacks are concerned
a third were clearly ignored by Pakistan
they continued to say kiha Fisichella
faction linic liqui-sew booth Amari
passed near the foreign media post
Pulwama and post the airstrike is
reporting that Pakistan is taking action
against or terrorism the the crackdown
against mothers has continued in
Pakistan but now in another development
other today we were told that Mawlana
Vosloo Raymond Kelly joined PTI so the
crackdown was a sham and absolutely half
a sides appeal being rejected by the UN
comes as a double blow to Pakistan oh
absolutely the fact that you just
mentioned more enough a little romance
real whose widely believed to be the
founder of hospital Mujahideen a terror
armed group that was active in fish
meals particularly in the early 90s in
the mid 90s currently they are not
really so don't really have a presence
right now but his track record as the
founder of that organization and joining
now politically even on Khan's party
gives us an indication like I said
before all the action on the grounds
that Iran can government claims will be
taken against either proscribed madrasas
or prescribed there are outfits with
affiliations to other terror outfits
needs to be taken with a pinch of salt
India has made it very very clear and of
course we broke that story a couple of
days ago that India needs to see and
distinguish the world needs to see
demonstrably action by Pakistan on all
those there are operatives and their
affiliated outfits on the ground just
coming out with the list of the Interior
Ministry and saying that we put them
again on a prescribed list is not going
to fool anyone right now it's going to
not going to convince anyone anymore and
that is very clear by the fact that the
UN has rejected office sides but if
particular appeal also going back to
fazool raymond kelly he has also been an
active politician in pakistan remember
he has a political output and overground
symmetrical outfit all the um it's um
which indeed might have been against in
on Khan in the run-up to the Pakistan
polls but him joining grants PTI now
give us an indication now and this is my
personal view that along with the
so-called
if you want to call it sham track down
or
all crack down along with that a
Pakistani there are operators of people
who are in Pakistan under the tutelage
of the Pakistani litter establishment
especially the is I are making a radical
policy strategic shift what they're
trying to do is trying to perhaps align
themselves with mainstream political
parties to escape detection of their
other unsavory activities hmm joining
PTI polemically joining PTI seems to be
a step in that direction it remains to
be seen whether or not if noncom will
crack down on other outfits or other
individuals who have a track record of
either finding military it also remains
to be seen whether whether or not this
rejection of the appeal will put any
sort of pressure on Pakistan to now act
against half this I didn't take into
consideration the doors the air and the
evidences that was submitted by India's
far as the 26/11 attacks are concerned

on jamaat-e-islami now there is a rau /
crackdown on jamaat-e-islami by the

times now had exposed how
jamaat-e-islami was actually organizing
anti-india rallies and recruitment camps
continuously in Pakistan but former
Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and PDP
chief Mehbooba Mufti continues to back
them today as well there are protests
that are taking place in different parts
of the valley
in fact when jamaat-e-islami was a
banned by the center at that time as
well maybe by mufti had said that it
could have dangerous consequences let's
go cross to my colleagues so Vale who is
joining us on the phone line for more on
this today as well so will protests are
taking place what is it that may move
above tea is now saying well Mufti has
launched protests across Valley no she
has started the protest from south
Kashmir so I stone Arbour Mukti this was
the wrong that has been taken place by
the central government to panda
jamaat-e-islami in Jammu and Kashmir
Mehbooba Mufti it is a religious
interference that has been attempted by
the central government to ban the
jamaat-e-islami lead to ban de tomate
Islamic organization and in between the
leaders so for jamaat-e-islami let me
give you there are more than 250 leaders
who have of jamaat-e-islami who have
been detained by the Des Moines Kashmir
Police there across fear valley as well
as possible that the more problems there
is that read against the establishment
as a proper track down though now the
governor of Jammu and Kashmir has taken
an exemption that the schools and other
institutions where students he used to
study have not been sealed those things
but the properties that belong to the
dramatic Islamic organization have been
properly seized by the police - so far
as you know Peoples Democratic Party is
concerned the party has launched its
protest it's a very wise protest they
are saying that the central government
but when we talk about the Ministry of
Home Affairs it is very important for
them to make the revocation of
or it's not the right time to bandit
jamaat-e-islami organization involved in
uplifting the people socially and
morally - this is not the right decision
that has been taken by the municipal
form of a super is a pan of
jamaat-e-islami content okay but the
kind of warnings that we have seen
sohail are quite shocking because
earlier as well when you know it was bad
she said that it will have the same
image of say bgp conducts a pretty big
inner circle in the kill bajalia some
say wake your hottie what the hell but
must who's hotter so there you heard the
baby boom of tea clearly threatening a
pan valley agitation but viewers what's
important here is to note the expose

of an allegation being made by him of
course is a very very serious one
how will of course are the supreme court
look at it in fact the CGI has come out
to tell the AG that Bhushan say whatever
he wants just because we are listening
to him does not mean we are taking
everything on record that's the Chief
Justice of India in fact AG coming out
to say that the Prashant Bhushan is
compromising the security of the country
the Chief Justice of India then responds
to AG k caverna Gopal has says that
according to you sensitive documents
were stolen what have you done about it
the AG then responds saying that there
is an investigation on in this entire
matter this is of course the obvious
coming in from our Asian father that's
massive
it's going to have massive implications
in political circles as well let me just
quickly bring in our executive editor
vivek narayan who's joining me from the
news page we make this is so important
the topmost government lawyer saying
that the certain documents were stolen
from the Ministry of Defense this is a
huge allegation this is a topmost legal
officer of Government of India making
this allegation that Prashant Bhushan
has used stolen defense documents I mean
this would have massive implications as
the case proceeds osa is a law which is
very strict in itself it has a massive
bearing we have with us our national
defense editors enjoy the rich to enjoy
these are documents chosen stolen he
says the topmost legal officer from the
defense ministry which has been put out
by mr. Prashant Bhushan this would even
be that mean that he would be charged
now well even if he is not charged there
is an investigation in place and the
investigation has to find out when the
documents were taken out by whom and for
what purpose and that's a serious way of
looking at things so the Attorney
General is within his rights to call for
an investigation because it's absolutely
imperative today this has gone out
strictly speaking tomorrow or something
even more critical could come out this
is about those 36 planes which India has
brought from France technical
specifications of this plane we Xabi its
rivals to enjoy I mean these are secrets
details which you and I should not be
able to know we should not be aware of
let alone keep it or take it bring it to
public space even if we are aware of it
it is important that a document that is
marked secret or top secret or whatever
it is should not be used for any other
purpose you can use it for you cannot
use it right and should enjoy it I'm
sorry I have to interrupt you thank you
very much for putting things in
perspective but this will definitely
become a big big story today and we'll
keep our viewers right on the top of it

The person worthy of this would be the one who solves the Kashmir dispute according ...,2019-03-04T10:15:33Z,TIMES NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1yts0sb7Kxs/hqdefault.jpg,"hi there very good morning you're
watching times now and I'm making that a
calf let's jump on the bulletin we're
gonna start with some big breaking news
which is coming in from across the
border but right after a resolution was
submitted in the Pakistani Parliament to
endorse Imran Khan the Prime Minister
for a Nobel Peace Prize there's a first
reaction coming in from the man himself
well Imran Khan has tweeted saying that
raking up the Kashmir issue again says
I'm not worthy for the Nobel Peace Prize
the person worthy of this will be the
one who results the Kashmir dispute
according to the wishes of the Kashmiri
people and paves the way for peace and
human development in the subcontinent
so essentially Imran failed to rein in
terror
emanating from his own soil however he
plays the Kashmir card after his nation
floats the Nobel for Imran proposal
let's go across to shrink each other he
was joining us
Shinjo it's quite interesting even as he
declines this call for a Nobel Peace
Prize what he essentially forgets that
he's perhaps not the solution but from
part of the problem yes that's very well
said first of all you one has to
appreciate the fact that he brought hard
for one has been honest he actually
doesn't deserve the Nobel Prize and he
has admitted secondly when he has spoken
very clearly about the speed and how
tests may need development and the
people have to be helped and so on well
he has to understand that the first
thing that has been deed Israeli peace
and tranquility and the only way peace
and tranquility will come is be stopped
if his people is his army if his
eyesight stopped raining people are
farming them financing them and sending
them across a line of control if that
happened there would be fewer problems
in Kashmir perhaps no problems at all
and there will be lot of development and
peace and tranquility in Jammu entity
well absolutely in fact do-seong Berta's
Pradeep is also joining us from Jammu
well Pradeep at a time when people are
hoping from both sides of the border
that there is going to be tension
de-escalated especially when it comes to
me in a very indirect manner
Imran Khan again brings it back into the
focus and essentially says Bala Code the
airstrikes all of that is linked
integrally to the state of Jammu and
Kashmir CR Magna in fact watch Imran
Khan is trying to - he's trying to
internalize Kashmir issue and once again
trying to shift focus of international
community's worst case meal by linking
it with Bala quote attack and everything
but if him rank and deserves at this
stage any award that is Oscar award for
the acting because he is very good at
tell where he's trying to project
himself as messiah of peace but in in
Charvet watch ninja was rightly saying
he is the one who is in fact a part of
the problem pushing interest into this
side of the border if you look at the
situation on line of control - in the
last seven years there has been 56
ceasefire violation innocent kids women
are being targeted
you will nine month old baby is not
being spirit and what is exactly
happening in hinterland they are pushing
in channels they are trying to know what
they are brave hearts they are targeting
innocent case wheelies so how come this
same man in fact deserves a Nobel Peace
Prize what Imran Khan is trying to do
other Prime Minister's in Pakistan had
also been doing the same thing only
difference is that he's such a good
actor that he tries to projects himself
as one who really believes in peace in
fact he was the one who lied to the
whole world that f-16 was not used in
fact now there is a proof already we
have shown the wreckage of the raziel
that was fired by f-16 that came in
South Indian territory they were with
the intention to target and one of the
brigade headquarters and in fact now
united states is asking them question
that how come they use f-16 against one
of their ally so they are being
questioned see then again they said that
they are not allowing this trial to be
used for chal related activities
everybody knows we are Valhalla so
docile is in fact Mawlana amaru is a
brother of Maulana Masood Azhar he in
fact confessed that their headquarter
was targeted and about 300 people were
there they went they are teaching them
concept of jihad so that they can help
people in Kashmir Valley so what more
proof in fact ever evidence Imran Khan
is looking for so he deserves Oscar yes
he's absolutely right no Nobel Prize for
Peace Meghna

well prashanta continues to be with us
before I go across to him I also have
bring the Adige joining us on the
broadcast let me go across to her good
morning to you bring the Adige what do
you make of this comment the opposition
is demanding an apology from the Prime
Minister an apology should come in but
multi before that this whole idea that
leaves the Prime Minister for the entire
country
how can he even make fun of any citizen
what is he talking about when here you
are talking about equality we are
talking of non-discrimination we are
talking of looking at people with
respect and dignity makes fun of her
dyslexia makes fun of people who are
differently abled just goes to show that
he will do anything but putting the
citizens down it doesn't matter who the
person is and if it is a woman he seems
to have taken more pleasure in saying
something this is the way we want to
fight election are you really the
largest democracy of this world because
then we want to say that we are also
very petty politicians who are willing
to put women down against anybody and
anything just to win one vote and
absolutely unacceptable it's so
disrespectful to women and to people who
are affected with dyslexia well thank
you for speaking to us let me go across
to Prashant now Prashant the the
opposition is demanding an apology and
activists believe that this was in bad
taste the Prime Minister actually has
mocked differently-abled people
well absolutely swarthy this is some
clear is also being equalled by the
opposition parties you have top leaders
from the opposition coming out and
slamming the prime minister for what has
said and if you look at the video that
video has a quite apparent reference to
Rahul Gandhi you know he's someone who
Prime Minister always refers to as a
child who is someone who always refers
to as someone who has grown up in body
but not in mind so clearly I mean that
attack was clearly pointed out at Rahul
Gandhi and that's the reason why you now
have and position completely on rampant
against the Prime Minister coming out
and saying that perhaps what he has said
is completely unacceptable and also on
the other hand those prominent people
journalists authors activists those who
have someone dyslexic in their homes in
their knowledge they have also come out
and attacked the Prime Minister for what
he has said demanding an outright
apology from the Prime Minister but on
the other hand from the BJP we have not
heard any word actually coming out
giving any clarification on it and
understandably so because the famine is
the prime minister's statement but we'll
have to wait and see what happens next
because this is something the Congress
party will make a big point and perhaps
attack the prime minister time and again
internal content elections well
absolutely in fact as you rightly
pointed out there has been a massive
backlash pressure on but so far no
reactions from the Bharatiya Janata
Party will actually try and contact some
leader leaders of the BJP and see what
their response to this is but going okay
I am also given to understand that tests
in Pune Bala has also reacted to this
let's play out his reaction Kishan we'll
come back to you after that for somebody
of the prime minister stature to mock
that only and only to target a political
opponent mind your political opponent
whose degrees are known to the world and
acknowledged by the university to mock
him I think it shows the prawn arable
prime minister in bad taste
not only as he offended a lot of people
who work with people and kids who have
special abilities but I just think in
his position he's in a position to make
a difference and help these children out
rather than doing that he took up poor
chief jibe and I think that does not
suit the
office of the honorable Prime Minister
well reactions have started coming and
Siddaramaiah the former Chief Minister
of Karnataka has tweeted he said just
came across the video often arranged
moody taking a political pot shot using
the name of dyslexic people
shame on you Modi this is what cinema
has tweeted he says you just can't go
below this your insensitivity can't be
washed away by dipping in any river they
may be slow in learning but not
heartless like you let me also go across
to senior leader of the NCP margin memin
joining us mr. Behrman good morning to
you what is your response to the
statement of the prime minister I'm
given to understand that the opposition
is now demanding an apology they feel
this is in bad taste in serious issues
like this you see it is very unfortunate
that a person occupying the highest
office of the executive could indulge in
this kind of joking or this kind of
making fun and then you know the he'll
spares no opportunity to criticize the
whole Gandhi enough is enough you have
once you said twice you said ten times
you have said that people have
understood that you are hostile to Rahul
Gandhi you want him to be out of a
picture but then that does not mean that
in every occasion you talk of only Rahul
Gandhi you talk only of about
combination you don't think that the
world exists rather than communist too
and country needs something positive and
children's children and he kept children
etc you know and unemployed youth they
have their own issues you must seriously
examine whatever they say and in fact we
just if I didn't choke with the people
like this absolutely Martin women we are
in fact uh you know yet to hear from the
BJP leaders but I am sure in their
defense they would put out this point
and the Prime Minister wasn't mocking
the differently-abled people but rather
taking a political jibe a trowel Gandhi
let's first in fact sir listen into what
the prime minister said and basically
hemara idea dyslexic people Podesta
dyslexic people dyslexic
pachoo their junky learning or writing

well senior Karnataka Congress leader
has reacted mister Siddaramaiah has
tweeted he said just came across the
prime minister's statement taking
political potshots using the name of
dyslexic people let me go across to my
colleague deeper who joins us with more
details deepak this is being criticized
widely there's a massive backlash to
what the prime minister said since the
Ramaiah are now lashing out of the prime
minister says and the prime minister
cannot go below this this is
insensitivity yes like you said we've
seen leaders from the opposition from
across across the country come down
really hard at what the Prime Minister
had to say but you know we've had the
former Chief Minister of Karnataka was
not signed away in the past as well from
directly attacking Prime Minister Modi
and this time as well you know hitting
out at the statement that was made you
know while addressing students work on a
video conference when he made this
statement squat dyslexia hinting at the
Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi and he's
here going on to say that dipping in any
diverse is not going to wash away these
sort of things then it was just a small
statement I will really have to wait and
watch how what kind of you know counter
comes in from the BJP because it seems
like once again the opposition is
uniting against the BJP and Prime
Minister Modi again statement that which
they believe this quite distasteful and
expecting an apology to come by

America is now seeking more information
on the potential misuse of the
american-made f-16 fighter jets by
Pakistan against India in violation of
the end-user agreement this report
coming in from the State Department of
the United States of America that now
they will be seeking more information on
the misuse of the X f-16 fighter
aircrafts by Pakistan on India Pradeep
is continues to stay with us a Pradeep
earlier as well we had understood from
reports that the United States of
America had pulled up Pakistan for using
f-16 for their attack on India and now
we're given to understand that there
will be more scrutiny in this regard yes
in fact India's ally of United States so
they can't use any weapon against there
alive that is in fact the treaty so if
they got f-16 with them they cannot use
it against India initially we saw that
there were reports coming from Pakistan
side they were denying that f-16 was not
used in fact they were trying to project
it that way they only wanted to target
some of the areas to prove here that
they are capable of entering inside
Indian airspace but the reality was that
it was not only f-16 but they were also
carrying with emraan missile between
medium-range air-to-air missile that was
also fired in fact they fired once such
missile that landed in vyasa area in
which one of the village was injured
also so that dog that Iran remains of
that missile has already been handed
over to the difference ministry in fact
the part of that was short during the
briefing by the senior officials just
two days back and that's why America is
trying to ask them question how come
they use it because this is simply the
violation of the treaty and the
understanding between the two countries
you cannot use the weapon against their
allies and India is one of the important
ally of the United States that is one of
the reason it has come under the
scrutiny all those questions will be
asked in this way once again Pakistan
stands completely exposed because from
day one they had been maintaining that
f-16 had not violated your space the two
things had happened one f16 violated the
airspace second they fired here to air
missile in which one of the villages was
injured or
me a complete report from the state
government police department has been
sent to the central government because
it was a village defense committee
member who was first able to sport that
part of the air-to-air missile that was
used by f-16 in which one village was
injured in Mott village in reality
district and that has been handed over
to the difference right so Americans
have also got proof of that now with
them so they la Pakistan Bluffs we
simply got an even they will have to
answer several questions but they can
try and peddle as many lies as possible
but clearly not only in front of India
but even in the international community
in front of the international community
where the Pakistan now stands absolutely

namaskaram Sadhguru G we meet once again
after September last year but the
atmosphere in which we meet has
completely undergone a huge change in
this country and Sadhguru G we are now a
country of 130 crore people which are
swinging between despair absolute grief
and anger after what happened in full
wama and two days after that security
you've spoken about a lot of steps that
need to be taken but how does a country
like ours deal with the grief and the
anger against a nation that has only
given us grief and anger unfortunately
this is not a one-time incident this has
been happening at a certain regularity
we get emotional when the numbers are
big but we are not counting those there
are almost on a weekly basis one two
three of our security forces are falling
prey to this
how do we respond to this well for those
who have lost their men sons husbands
fathers there is no way we can replace
that we can give some compensations
which is human life cannot be
compensated like that we could make try
to make their lives a little comfortable
that's about it but for the nation
because nation cannot go on bleeding
like this nation is not bleeding like
this by accident as it is a declared
policy of a thousand cuts thousand cuts
are happening variety of reasons but I
believe essentially because of not
sustained focus towards a solution from
one government to another at various
times because in a democratic system
when the government's change somewhere a
whole lot of things don't continue in
the same level of focus as the previous
government might have been doing it so
the foot because of these lapses in 70
years we have not come towards a
solution we have only escalated the
problem further so our time has come
where though such incidents have
happened before at this point the nation
wants some kind of a solution
this is widespread but
internally people who have been giving
financial support physical support and
kind of giving them media space social
media space and variety of things which
are adding to all this I think this is
the time to undo that 100%
what's up guru ji used to complete this
see one thing is this idea blast
happened and it's a mayhem at that
moment when the rest of the force is
trying to go pick up the bodies somebody
is throwing stones at them at that time
well this cannot happen in a nation this
cannot happen
even at that moment there are people
throwing stones at you well always
they've been explained of as boys
they're not boys an alienated boys
political patronage for them especially
coming from the state that is the most
strife ridden state in our nation I am
saying this is the time to deal with
this 100% you're saying the
establishment at the center should even
take on the mobile move these and
whatever it takes whatever it takes the
enemy within must be dealt with 100%
outside enemy is not something that you
are doing sure into without thinking of
all the consequences but at a time when
we want retribution from Pakistan you
think only only looking at the enemy
within people who say they are part of
this country of course they speak the
language of Pakistan but they are part
of this country is action against them
going to be enough I would say as a
mature nation and as a culture which is
always stood for peace and inclusion we
should not seek rest retribution we
should seek solution we want a solution
but what kind of solution is possible in
Yamanaka Stan we've we've tried sitting
across the table we've the Prime
Minister has made several overtures
himself for you know inviting them for
his swearing-in ceremony going across
for Nawaz Sharif's daughter's wedding
all of those no none of those things
will work because we need to understand
they're working for what they believe is
their way of doing things but what is it
that matters to us we must achieve that
rather than getting into retribution
state where you may get enmeshed in
their agenda you may serve their agenda
better in trying for retribution I would
say we must see what is the solution for
this for us one important one piece of
the solution it's not a whole solution
one piece of the solution is support
within the country must be stamped out
all right and and Sadhguru gee you made
this statement in fact you put this out
as your statement saying in the making
of a nation maintaining the sovereignty
is most fundamental there should be no
compromise on this endeavor either in
thought or action either you must have
the wisdom to kill the enmity and I
think you're referring to the enemity
with Pakistan if there is no room for
that wisdom unfortunately it will
naturally translate into killing the
enemy you're talking about killing the
enemy and then you're talking about
peace how can both happen that's what I
am saying if as a part of making of the
nation it unfortunately leads to this
kind of action we have done it in the
past we will have to do it again but not
as attribution simply as a solution for
us as a solution for the people of this
nation that we want to move forward we
are on a threshold of a great economic
possibility we should not get derailed
because we will start running after
somebody else sub ecology we've done
we've taken some steps we've
stopped sending our share of the Indus
wall valley water into Pakistan we've
removed the most favored nation a tag
line that was given to Pakistan are
these enough or are these just spaces
just bug bites bug five water could
affect them a little bit but not big not
big enough these are just bites this is
not going to so when this is being
TomTom as this great you know climatic
nono all these things have to be done no
I'm not trying to say it's not important
all these things have to be done because
you have to rev them to one corner that
is being done at various levels in the
international fora in the diplomatic
process of doing things of course we
will do those things in United Nations
but we must take into account that
Pakistan has a certain geo strategic
significance it's its geography it is
not its government it's not its military
it's not its people it is the geographic
location which is giving them that
significance and that significance is
not going to go away do what you want
and all the other players in the world
will always hold that significance in
their mind no matter what they do
they're not going to completely go
against Pakistan because they have a
piece of geography which is a gift from
us of course unfortunately without
understanding the significance of that
piece of land we have done this in the
past we can't correct that now but do
not underestimate the geo strategic
positioning the Geographic positioning
of the land that nobody is going to
suddenly dump Pakistan all the big
players in the world they are not going
to dump Pakistan because it's become a
face of terror they will talk against it
they may take some steps but they are
not going to dump that country we need
to know that so Sadhguru G you talk
about the enemy within we are talking
about in the last few days there have
been action on the enemy within and
these are the supporters the funding
channels the people in our side of the
border who are giving support
we need to understand it's not just one
or two people there's a whole
infrastructure this infrastructure has
to be dismantled completely so that if
people from outside want to do something
they have to come as a military force
not go on doing these things this can
only happen because there is a local
infrastructure and the local
infrastructure who does it entail
so many people of course we should have
the courage to deal with it now so I'm
asking you Sadhguru gee would you like
to name people who are part of the
so-called mainstream politics who stay
away from elections to make a point but
on the other hand continuously whether
it's Mehbooba Mufti or Farooq Abdullah
or Omar Abdullah each one of them keeps
talking about the Stone belters as being
alienated youth they keep giving them
their political patronage they keep
talking about her youth and the action
against these separatists that has been
taken
are these the enemy within will you take
a position on that say what I would like
to say is after the after all their
politicians who need to win election so
they may not be I'm not making a
clear-cut statement on this but I'm
saying the names that you say may not be
actually infrastructure they may be
playing up because they don't want to
have people against them they have to
stand for the next election so we must
be very astute about this where is the
real infrastructure that must be broken
where is the support of a certain level
of support in the social media in the
media there is support this must be
dismantled see nation is not I am NOT
speaking with some kind of fervor I am
just talking in terms of a solution
nation is not something that descended
from somewhere it's an idea that all of
us agreed that this is our nation
if we don't take care of it if we don't
invest ourselves into it this idea will
not become a wonderful idea this will
become a horrendous idea right now we
have this problem a whole lot of people
have not invested themselves in that
idea they are either actually in the
political class
they're either vacillating or they are
wondering which way is going to go even
for them to wonder the reason maybe the
situation on the ground because I know
from the other side at many points
Pakistan believes it's very close that
they're going to get cash means they
have never understood it doesn't matter
what they do
Indian army is never going to hand over
but Kashmir to them that's never going
to happen but that side there is an
illusion many times in the last 70 years
at least four to five times they have
really believed it's come so close
they're going to get it now because they
start talking locally just so close
another two months we'll have Kashmir
this kind of talk goes on there so that
illusion we have to break and how does
one do that if you take away the local
infrastructure completely there are
there are people who are clearly other
side of the wall we need to deal with
them one way there's a whole lot of
people who sit on the wall not knowing
which way to fall we must deal deal with
them compassionately and those who are
on this side we must deal with them in
terms of protecting them so that they
don't get harmed but in Sadhguru G in
this country any such decision also is
turned around to sound as if it's a
communal decision it's because there's a
certain religion that these people may
belong to or a religion that is not the
religion of the majority community in
this country all of those political
narratives then take over say I don't
think it's a narrative it's a reality we
need to understand the only reason why
another nation can play havoc with us
like this
is because there is a religious
congruence there and we know that a
certain religion
there's been an exodus in the 90s nearly
3/4 of a million people have been burnt
out of that state them going back is
over more than 20 years they've been out
of their state and they live like
refugees and many have distributed
themselves all over the world so there
is a religious dimension to it nobody
should be fooled by thinking see because
we've gotten to this political
correctness you see you asked me to name
the people but you won't even name the
religion all right because you're not
supposed to say it I am saying this is a
fact this is a fact there is a religious
goal attached to it whether you like it
or you don't like it that's how it is
that's how historically it's been does
it mean to say we have to divide this
country no you're dealing with a
particular state where the problem means
keep the problem there and deal with it
as it should be dealt with
don't make the same parallels with the
rest of the nation No so sub guru G at
this time for those who recommend that
peace and dialogue is a process that
should continue what do you want to talk
about what do you want to talk about you
want to discuss each of this
philosophies or what there's nothing to
talk there's really nothing to talk so
what should your eyes then of George
sing seduce the Mehbooba Mufti is the
Omar Abdullah is the Farooq Abdullah is
who keep talking about dialogue is the
only way out the solution that you are
talking about is only through this
dialogue that they talk about no no see
the other side including their Prime
Minister has made it very clear what is
their intent all right
they have stated what they want please
it's time we state what we want yes
Imran Khan was on television on national
television virtually threatening India
yes do you think no it's easy for us to
stand up and do the same say threatening
is not the point if you wish to do
something you must do it otherwise you
must keep quiet what is the point this
is not a in the cinema to throw
dialogues at each other
all right so talking talking is of no
consequence because the solution is not
geography
they have clearly made it very clear at
many points they are said our goals are
not Geographic once we liberate Kashmir
we will liberate the rest of the nation
whether you want to be liberated or not
is something we must decide we want to
be liberated and we don't want to be
liberated so what do you think about the
outrage because we are looking at
tougher calls yes Pakistan has stated
its intent of bleeding India through a
thousand cuts at such a time when India
and Indians are completely outraged
about whether Pakistani artists should
come perform in India whether we should
play a World Cup match with Pakistan in
in the month of June what would you say
to them I don't think we should engage
with them on any level normally I
wouldn't say this but when the policy is
thousand cuts when they have so much
wisdom that they understand one one stab
is not going to kill us and one stab
could be very dangerous for them and
they have they are wise enough to
understand they have to do a thousand
cuts on us we must be wise enough not to
be outraged but work towards the
solution in this corner in that nation
is very important whether it's cricket
art music everything I think this must
stop when I'm when we are saying no
dialogue these are all different levels
of dialogue but then people begin to
distinguish between bilateral cricket
should be stopped but multilateral at
neutral venues that is something that
you can't come out of how will the world
view us instead of isolating Pakistan we
will end up getting isolated ourselves
as such in Tendulkar says why should we
give them the two points sort of Ganguly
comes in and says why should forget the
two points why should we give them the
cup which we can get for India itself
where does all this go yeah everybody
has an opinion as cricket players
because the shelf life of a sports
person is so small obviously they will
be concerned if they don't play the wind
right now India is doing
really well in cricket of course almost
it's certain that we will win the World
Cup
now not participating in the World Cup
could be a disaster for the team I very
much understand that but now even other
nations are willing to come in suppose
three or four nations agree to boycott
the World Cup the ICC will make a
different rule so that's the direction
we should go on other country all levels
and all levels and all levels we thought
they are talking about one kind of
thousand cuts we should do another kind
of thousand cuts
that's not retribution this is see the
retribution is only in your heart action
is towards solution we want a solution
in our hearts we want a solution we
don't enjoy somebody else suffering a
thousand cuts but if you have to do it
for the well-being of the nation the
larger interest of the people we have to
do it
so subdue gee you talked about
compensation for those lives that were
lost when there are large numbers yes
it's cynical but it's the crude reality
of life when we lose 40 of our Germans
from crpf in a ie D blast in polo ama
there's national outrage when there are
ones and twos and threes who die we
probably don't even blink an eyelid
Sadhguru gee I want to ask you for some
who made slipping compensation and mo
Arzo that has become the key word every
time we suffer losses we saw we saw the
home minister going and slipping these
envelopes in the pockets of our injured
Germans do you think that's bringing
down the photo op of guava completely
that takes away the sacrifice of our
Jevons definitely we must deal with this
much more sensitively because we need to
understand this whatever we make up in
terms of somebody's more tired somebody
got a medal somebody went to heaven you
can say whatever you want the fact of
the matter is a man is dead
that song and somebody has lost somebody
was very dear to them that's all the
realities rested all we are making up so
when a 22 year old baby's father dies in
the blast what would you say to that
child what would you say to that mother
say we can go on an emotional trip there
is pain all right
if we think by saying nice words or
giving money this will go away it's not
true
money is only to make sure their
financial difficulties at least are
handled reasonably well that they don't
have to struggle for their livelihood
that's our only intent already what has
happened to them has happened further
they don't have to go out begin tomorrow
morning that is the idea of money money
should never be understand understood as
a compensation for the life that's been
lost a dear one that has been lost is
there some way you can say something
wonderful to a child who's lost his
father that the child may not remember
in another three years time is there
some way there is no way
very simply no way we must understand
that's why I'm saying no attribution
because others said also are human
beings we don't want retribution we want
a solution but whatever kind of action
the solution involves you must be ready
for it otherwise there will be no
solution
I don't know Sadhguru gee whether you
read a report that came out in a
magazine recently that looked at the
cost of all the soldiers who had laid
down their lives and it said it was only
12.5 percent of those who laid down
their lives who belong to the upper
caste and it was the lower caste the
Scheduled Castes and tribes the OB C's
that formed the majority of those who
own these these are the lowest level of
minds in our country unfortunately
they're either through social media or
media also is focusing their cameras on
them please these are not fit to be
human beings please don't put your
cameras on them but so by not putting
the cameras is the altar within salt
sought it cured say if there is an ulcer
in your body you don't have to carry it
on your face but don't you have to deal
with it we have to deal with it how do
we deal with it
see the only reason people make such
absurd statements 'is for one day they
are celebrities don't give them that
status first of all so in this country
it's become like this somebody wants to
be in the on the screen all they have to
do say something absurd bizarre stuff if
you they if you say it and the cameras
are on them they're just enjoying the
limelight please don't give them that
but sir guru ji you know if if these
people are told not to do something like
this or if there is action against them
then there will be battle cries on the
streets of the country that their
freedom of expression their freedom of
speech has been taken away and there is
intolerance in this country see speech
is a valuable privilege that a human
being has it's very very important that
we use our speech as human being should
essentially a human being means this in
what way we are different from other
animals is that there is an intelligence
within us which can respond beyond our
instinctive compulsive reactions that is
we can be more inclusive we don't have
to live within our territories as every
other creature tries to live there is a
way for us to look beyond that if your
human speech is not does not represent
that actually you have no right to speak
you should not have no right to speak
but should there be action against such
people and such speech see there is
there is a pretty law in a country there
is defamation laws in the country but if
you try to put a defamation thing on
somebody you will end up in the coat
more than them so then how do you so I
am saying
first of all quick justice must happen
it's very important when justice will
take ten years fifteen years
you're only punishing the already one
who has been abused by somebody this is
everyday thing happening to people all
over the country it's become
free-for-all anybody can say anything
because there's no consequence
in if it was olden time without all this
Democratic protein in a town or a
village if somebody said something
that's not true and abusive to you they
would go and slap him but that's against
the law if you slap him you will get
arrested not him all right so I am NOT
talking about taking law into your hands
but if you go and act physically that
will be taking law into your hands but
now if whatever he does he can do and
there is no law there is a law but it is
too slow that it is mocking you all the
time so these things we need to settle
one of the important things whether it's
for business is to work in this country
or to settle these kind of issues that
will settle those people who are
supporting people who are working
against the country either in the form
of terror or in the terraform of
weakening the nation in so many other
ways within three months it must come to
justice well you don't have enough
judges right I'm saying it is time we
think about this that responsible
citizens in this city let us say can't
you find a thousand people who will be
beyond prejudice and act as some kind of
judgement five people ten people make
them into jury and clear all the simple
cases what are you saying in this
country where people have come out Omar
Khalid and others and you know and all
of these people who kick an idea kumar
their icons today because they raise the
slogans at least they were part of the
group that raised the slogans bharat
area to create to create a Absalom's on
minbar their battles in world and when
the sedition laws are applied to them
there are political mainstream parties
that come out to questions what I'm
saying as per the law they shouldn't be
walking the street all right they are
not only walking the street they are
hogging the limelight please end this
this is the time right now the country
is ready for this country's emotion is
ready for this this is the time to deal
with all of them all of them because
this is not about retribution
this is about ensuring that the
possibility the threshold of possibility
upon which we are sitting that we could
solve the problems of poverty and bring
well-being to this nation and the people
of this nation who had such a bad deal
for last 10-15 generations they've lived
in poverty now there is a possibility we
don't want some fool to hijack this so
we must act for solution this is the
time I am saying when I said dismantle
the infrastructure I am meaning just
this all of them it doesn't matter who
they do you think the next war is
actually within the country on platforms
in the social media you should not just
be on the social media platforms that
will be a fake war well many years ago
General Musharraf said next time there
is a war it'll happen within your
borders not at the border he said that
well he said it with a certain
understanding and a certain knowledge
about certain things now when people
have come up and openly said we want to
break the country we must decide all of
us do we want to break the country at
least let's do it if you don't want it
we value India for what it is right now
we have broken it once and never again
we're going to break it because when we
broke it we killed over a million people
and over 15 million people were
displaced many of them after 70 years
still not settled and we know what pain
see the reports carry the dead if so
many people died you will report that so
many people died do you have a way of
reporting people suffering do you have a
way of reporting people suffering those
millions of people who are looted raped
and lost their children and wives and
husbands and they came in such desperate
this way and that way both sides I'm
saying do you want to create one more
situation like that I am NOT talking
about Geographic Geographic integrity I
am talking about human suffering we have
seen that suffering unfortunately it's
not well recorded nobody has bothered to
write enough about it nobody is bothered
to make enough movies
out it nobody has brought it alive for
this generation that this has happened
to us
never again we should make the same
mistake so openly in the capital city
when somebody say look at it today what
are you going around with doing all
kinds of nuances of law please do what
you have to do
[Music]
[Music]
sub guru ji I'm somebody who's seen this
at close quarters my parents came across
from Pakistan which was West Punjab then
to here and I've seen this firsthand of
the torment and of the nightmares that
they have suffered for 4045 years after
partition I've seen all that but even
people like me when we object to
something like poverty rate to clear
hunger we are said we belong to a
certain right-wing ideology and
therefore we are a class of bugs I want
to ask you when you say that there
should be people from within the
citizens of this country who should form
a jury you think I'm saying I'm saying
to ease the load on the judiciary all
the small cases but then everybody here
is accused of having some prejudice or
the other see that is what I am saying
this is a very calculated effort they're
not just doing it they have an agenda
they are working when I say this monkey
all the infrastructure I mean all these
things everything there can democracy go
no democracy is to make the nation
function not to dismantle the nation
democracy is not made to dismantle a
nation if anybody has such an
understanding
let them correct themselves now because
democracy is about a graceful change of
power essentially that without bloodbath
you can change power which never
happened in human history only after
democratic crosses came this is
happening so democracy does not mean you
have the right to dismantle a nation if
you want to dismantle a nation then
let's hold a referendum if that's what
you want we are very clear 95 95 percent
of the population of 98 or 99 percent of
the population here is 100% clear we
don't want to break the country once
again we have done it once we have seen
the suffering what it is done and we
don't want such an incident to happen
once again ever in our country so if
somebody thinks they want to do it we
must deal with them what are we waiting
for
so sub guru ji when anybody uses such
language in this country they're asked
what are your political leanings have
you ever been asked that question
political leanings oh of course they
accuse me I am a right-wing extremist
and whatever though I have never taken a
political position ever in public life I
have never taken a political position I
don't wish to take that position because
I am NOT made like that for me democracy
means just this I have enough sense to
see what a per specific government has
done in the last five years and I have
enough intelligence to estimate whether
it is worth giving them one more chance
or no this is all I see as democracy I
am going to the extent of saying one
thing all political parties right left
center everybody will be against me for
this I am saying you must cancel the
party membership party should not have
the power to enroll members because you
are supporting democracy in the sense if
anybody woods n mass there is no
democracy what is the point of secret
ballot when you are already Congress or
BJP or whatever else
suppose you are already wearing the
party tag where is a secret ballot for
you I'm asking because your father was a
congressman you are a congressman where
is the democratic process it's feudalism
you can as well belong to your tribe are
you are you saying this with specific
reference to Rahul Gandhi no no no no
I'm not talking about the leadership I
am talking about the people I am saying
right now let us say 10 million what you
said applies to all no no his father was
I am going on I'm going on this
president said that is a different
matter I am saying 100 million people
are a member of a specific party that
means we know where these hundred
million people will vote isn't it where
is a democracy in this it is just like
saying one religious group will vote for
this party one ethnic group will vote
for that party there is no democracy in
this is feudalism so we must bring this
lot sometime parties cannot enroll
members only three months ahead of
election if they want they can do all
stuff all the time it's already declared
from your birth which party you belong
to where is democratic process after
some time there'll be no democracy at
all it will all be fixed well one would
need a lot of time sub guru ji to go
into the philosophy of the politics that
we in our country lead No I would change
that word it's not a philosophy
some people are quietly working to their
agenda they will do whatever to achieve
that and what is the agenda power they
are not interested in power either see
those who are interested in power can be
dealt with because democracy allows that
possibility if you want power you can
contest you can build a party you can do
whatever that possibility is there we
are not against that there their agenda
is not even for the well-being of the
nation when such a thing is there if we
don't deal with it
we are not peaceful people we just naive
and stupid that's all it is I don't want
to go down as a generation which was
stupid which did not know what to do to
make this nation tick I want to die in
such a way that as a generation we did
the right things and we took the country
to the right place is that for possible
in foreseeable future very much possible
why not security before I end the
frankly speaking show with you I want to
ask you on a philosophical note we have
always been taught in the Hindu Dharma
the same Karim chiesa hulky Jamaat car
we are doing our caroms this whole
nation is doing the caroms what is it
that is being given to the people the
pull Varma's I mean it's not because of
lack of Karim on India's part not widely
lack of Karim lack of cash yes
see when you got your independence why
don't you understand in the making of a
nation one of the most important thing
is the sovereignty of the nation
you did not fix your bodice properly
neither in the West nor in the north you
have not fixed your bodice properly
immediately 1948 you should have
finished it right when you not fixed
your borders how did you imagine there
will be no disputes continuously your
suffering for not doing your karma
properly because you were probably too
excited about your freedom they left you
empty-handed and you cut off your trade
routes both sides trade routes which you
have used for thousands of years you cut
it off it's like a bird where both the
wings are cut off and both the sides and
then you expect the nation to fly how
will it happen if these trade routes
were open we would have railways
pipelines roadways going into European
capitals Arabia and Central Asia and
deciding Asia everywhere we would have
been a developed nation within 25 to 30
years so you cut off what you have used
for 10,000 years to make this nation a
prosperous nation and then you wonder
what's wrong with you where have you
done your car improperly you have done a
blunder all right so now you are trying
to fix the blunder at least do that
properly and karma for the people for
the citizens of India well karma if you
do wrong karma there is a consequence we
must know that we are facing that
consequence at least now let's do the
right karma that there is no more
talkative business happening in this
country 100 percent well I hope people
of this country are not just listening
to you but hearing and understanding the
deep meaning let everybody understand
this an enormous amount of human
suffering we were Unleashed with tooth
to chorus we did know more today anybody
who talks about that should not exist in
this country or they must they can be in
state hospitality well on that note on
that very very important statement that
you make sub Guruji I thank you for
joining me on frankly speaking
always a pleasure speaking to you and
our deepest condolences to
not only the families of this Paloma but
everybody who's fought for this nation
every day it's happening with aging
machines pilots are dying every day and
we going on debating endlessly
about whether we need new aircrafts or
not and now we're going to come to our
senses we are talking about Karma thank
you thank you subdue ruiji I hope the
message strikes home

_cDzOGDnLCE,Abhinandan&#39;s video before leaving from Pakistan EXPOSED #Abhinandan,Disclosure on Pak depravity. Mind behind 90sec tape identified. India's Pak apologists please note. Pak PM Imran Khan presided ...,2019-03-02T07:44:07Z,TIMES NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_cDzOGDnLCE/hqdefault.jpg,"viewers ever since
9 00 pm last evening we have been here
wondering
as to who could have dared
to have humiliated wing commander
abhinandan
as he was being handed over
to india who was this individual
who threw the geneva conventions
out of the window and at the last moment
delayed
the release of wing commander
abhinandam by four and a half hours who
was it
that made him put out this
propaganda trick who was it that held
quite literally a gun to his head
we were being told that he was
intimidated
in a manner which is inconceivable
to prepare a 90-second tape
yes a 90-second tape
that was spliced 22 times
we will not play out this tape in
national interest
he was asked to berate his own nation
a man a man viewers
who stood on pakistani soil and said
jaihind
they wanted to crush his spirit they
wanted to
crush the spirit of this nation
and most importantly they wanted to make
a big drama out of it
the depraved mind behind these
stunts viewers
we have now been told by top
intelligence sources
is none other than pakistan prime
minister
imran khan person who in this country
is called an ambassador for peace
a greek god and most importantly
viewers a humanist
but he is depraved to the core mega
prasad joins this broadcast
and megha prasad is going to give us
some information which will stun you
and shock you and peel the veneer of
sophistication
pacifism that imran khan
hides behind mega prasad these details
that you have been able to access
take us through them they are shocking
they're shocking in the rahul and these
are the details that we have been
told about this has been shared with
times now by very reliable sources in
the government of india
so obviously all of this that we are
putting out right now is exactly what
happened
yesterday now i'm being told rahul that
yesterday off from islamabad to lahore
the trip
that bhinkaman abhinandan was made to
undertake
even before he reached lahore you had a
pakistan prime minister none other than
pakistan prime minister imran khan who
was driving
all of this rahul not only his traveling
all the way to vaga his hand over
pakistan's uh entire proposal this has
that it has to happen under media glare
that he was forced to sit and talk about
india talk about pakistani army eulogize
the pakistani army criticize the indian
media that entire video
which was made edited cut and then put
out on pakistan government's twitter
handle
his entire movement everything was
controlled and driven by
mr imran khan the prime minister of
pakistan
in consultation with the isi and
instructions then given to the pakistani
army all this was happening yesterday
rahul
and what we are being told is that like
i started with saying
the trip that he made wing commander
abhinandan
from islamabad to lahore even before
that you had
the prime minister of pakistan reaching
lahore to officiate
oversee and control all of it ming
commander abhinandan we are being told
upon reaching
lahore was taken to an isi
office there which is where they decided
that he would be made
forced to say all of these things for a
video which obviously we now
understand a heavily edited video we
don't know exactly what he might have
said because pieces have been cut and
put together to make it seem like he was
trying to criticize india before his
release and i can tell you one thing
megha we've looked at this video very
closely and some of
our editors video editors
who look very closely at how videos are
put together
have told us that it's certain instances
in this video
wing commander abhinandan is saying
nothing
his lip movements suggest that he is
giving out details of his name
but the audio recording that has been
done
and it's also not closely matching
the voice tonality of the wing commander
himself that has been inserted
to say all sorts of things against the
indian state
now you're telling us you're telling us
megha that this has been done
only after imran khan landed up
in lahore from islamabad and then
he personally escorted wing commander
abhinandan
to an isi facility where this video was
made and you can see the stark wall
uh that he has been pushed up against
you can see and he's been made to wear
his uniform
remember he crossed the border in
civilian clothes in a jacket
in an open shirt trousers but this
was made for propaganda and you can see
that he bears
the marks of ill treatment so mega this
is very big
so you're saying that it was imran khan
who oversaw all of this you can see
there he's in grey trousers a jacket
which seems to be
sort of bluish in color navy blue in
color
and a white shirt and he doesn't wear
and he's wearing dress shoes
but in that video he's been kitted out
in his
air force uniform deliberately mega well
rahul
imran khan was driving it all you know
in one line if he will have to
understand
what happened yesterday and why it
happened the way it happened
remember right in the in right in the
beginning yesterday early morning first
half we were told that pakistan
wants all of this to be made into a huge
show
a gesture of peace that pakistani prime
minister announced in the parliament
they want uh wing commander abhinandan
to walk
through the waga border into the atari
side of india
and it all should happen under media
glare that is what they intended to do
that is
that's that was the plan of imran khan
now we are being told that that is
something imran khan planned with the
isi it was his brainchild he wanted it
this way
india resisted india protested and even
then rahul
they still managed to do it the way they
wanted that is that's why we saw number
one the delay that is why we saw
this kind of a video that was put on the
twitter handle
of pakistan and then is handing over the
way it was done yeah and it was put on
the
official handle of pakistan and then
deleted
viewers it was deleted because they
realized
that in their be mindedness in their
peak
they had actually exposed themselves now
pakistan viewers
doesn't deserve our goodwill
he used this as a big propaganda prop
to aggrandize himself but his
as they say he is so mean-minded
cold-hearted that he couldn't bring
himself to even rise to the occasion
and at the very last moment tried to
berate
humiliate yes humiliate
are brave this is humiliation
in the garb of humanity and i want you
to listen very closely to the words he
used in parliament
when he said that he was going to
release the wing commander
listen to this viewers pay attention
as a peace
he says i have forgotten to tell you
but by the way we have detained an
indian pilot and we want to release him
tomorrow
this is how much of an afterthought it
was this is not goodwill
they were always planning to use him for
their propaganda
and india must make pakistan pay not
militarily
that would be actually to vindicate
pakistan
we should make them pay in this context
only in this context
in the international court of justice
it's imran khan himself who presided
over this depravity
pakistan prime minister imran supervised
the recording of propaganda video using
abhinandan
imran khan reached lahore from islamabad
to oversee the recording of this video
megha prasad has broken this story imran
and the pakistani isi had planned to
humiliate abhinandan for its propaganda
more than that he was taken to an isi
office a safe house most probably in
lahore to record a propaganda video
now colonel this is standard
pakistani dirty trick yeah stand
i i agree with you imran khan actually
must have planned to have a photo
operation of this prisoner being
released from his country
and when he reached lahar probably he
realized that
they have done something wrong he became
party to this recording thereafter
and thereafter he detached himself due
to whatever the circumstances was built
up from the indian
diplomatic side and the media agencies
like yours and they couldn't
do a commercial of that entire release
process having said that
brave avenue had no television he by any
means did not know
that what his government or his people
or his media is doing for him
so he that is why he asked the question
where am i at every stage he would ask
the same question till he found somebody
whom he could trust and when you are
talking
in sedation or otherwise it is very easy
you are a media man you will understand
i can frame a question to you 30
questions which look positive
where the words like not yes yes no will
come and then i can stretch them
together
and this propaganda is not for you and
me they know we will not trust it
even the intelligence of pakistan is not
a fool even the peacemakers in the world
are not a fool
this is a propaganda for a two dollar
army they're creating with a 10
transition to india that jihadist so
this propaganda material in a military
uniform

the pictures that are coming from Atari
it is through that gate that we can see
that Wing Commander a beam and on will
strike through most probably viewers we
will only see a fleeting glimpse of him
because he might be in a car he might
wave to some of the cameras he may not
but today this one brave officer
represents the pride of India viewers on
the 26th morning 12 air fighters risk
their lives to protect India sprite a
day later Wing Commander a beam under
vert amar selflessly chased Pakistan's
f-16 that dared to cross into India he
didn't stop till he shot down the f-16
the visuals are there to the right of
your screen as the f-16 comes plummeting
down and you can see in a parachute the
pakistani pilot falling to the ground
i've been undone didn't flinch even when
he was hit he didn't blink when he was
tortured in captivity for our forces our
pride sacrifice not self is supreme it's
because of their guts and glory that we
avenged the carnage at pull Verma in
less than two weeks in precisely 12 days
but unfortunately viewers there are some
among us who want the abundance of India
to give a hiss up an account of their
valor
they are doubting viewers their actions
they are saying give us proof that you
struck inside Pakistan
give us evidence that you actually did
some damage to Pakistan here is what
some of these individuals have been
saying listening closely as we expect
our hero to return
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
man will go to any extent because
someone the Prime Minister we said
Narendra Modi and
ameesha together the both combination
together they are identified at all the
Germans body
what is the terrorist body till now they
could not able to show to the people
Mamta banerjee believes what she read in
the New York Times and The Washington
Post over the words of our Braves a
Congress leader says he wants to see the
bodies of the terrorists yes now these
demands are an outright insult it's a
well-established fact that India struck
deep into Pakistan territory listen to
our most decorated officers as they
revealed what actually transpired listen
to this viewers the Amira birth evidence
here heejoo I'm Colonel charity do hum
target who did not destroy can agitate
it do affect amphitheater who honk Oh
effect million Abu Gorman kill per head
he hardly dissipated kiss track up or
Cassie who evidence denying a degree for
the record viewers here are some hard
facts up front that encapsulate the
spellbinding achievements of our air
warriors let me put them out for you
twelve mirage 2000 fighter jets entered
Pakistan on February 26 no one doubts
this claim not even Pakistan these Jets
decimated the biggest gesture a camp in
Barakat they dropped thousand kilogram
explosives 80 kilometers in sight inside
the LOC on Pakistan soil viewers they
chased out a PF package
or a Pakistani Air Force package of
eight f-16s for Mirage three and four
jf-17 I have strikes down one f-16 and
the park pilot is forced to eject and
who shot this f-16 down
it is Wing Commander I've been under who
fired an arch 73 air-to-air missile at
the f-16 if conformation is further
required then watch these pictures of
how Wing Commander amine and then hunted
down in f-16 with a mig-21 bison it's
never been done before viewers forcing
the Pakistan pilot to reject and that is
the reason why all of India viewers
today all of India has its eyes on those
gates at the Atari border we are being
told as we speak that our officials at
least three of them are waiting for a
banana and vitamin India's hero India
zero viewers to walk through those gates
or be escorted through those gates by
our forces I'm going to go across to
Tamil sigh in just a few moments to the
right of your screens look at those
pictures that is visual evidence of a
Pakistani pilot you can see in the
middle of that circle is the pakistani
pilot who has ejected from the cockpit
of his f-16 and on top is the canopy you
can make out it's a little flick of a
flick rather in the sky there it is on
top that's the parachute you can see it
very clearly and it is coming down
unfortunately it fell on the Pakistani
side
the occupied part of Kashmir and that's
why today Pakistan can go to some extent
student
denied that they've lost a pilot but
that's visual evidence viewers doesn't
get clearer than that
it doesn't get clearer than that and
today viewers all over Pakistani social
media websites
there's commentary on how Wing Commander
have been undone brought down an f-16
and that x16 coincidentally was also
being piloted by the son of a retired
Pakistan Air Force officer yes it's a
coincidence but it is also a fact yet
there are some viewers yet there are
some who question the evidence despite
the overwhelming nature of it and it is
being done to settle political scores at
the expense of the dignity and integrity
of our forces and I want to open this
out as we await as we await a hero's
return I want to open this out but
before that a quick update from tamil
shahana mal tell me what's going on
we've had a bit of a delay we were
expecting the Wing Commander India's
hero to walk through or perhaps be
squatted through those gates I can
already see a car actually approaching
that gate but to come through it around
six o'clock that hasn't happened we're
still awaiting
well that's right Rahul it all started
say about around 4:00 4:15 this evening
when he saw in the airforce convoy
getting inside and then we saw the qrt
following which the Indian army convoy
getting inside so yes these speculations
have been doing rounds since 4:15 this
evening but then no one expected the
delay to reach to this point it's 804
Indian Standard Time and Wing Commander
Abu Dhabi London where the one hasn't
reached that one who can confirm he
hasn't touched or the Indian soil as yet
we have been given to understand that
documentation work took a lot of time
immigration work took a lot of time but
then there after what is the reason
behind this delay something which is yet
to be explained
we're also expecting a small media
briefing by but by air vice-marshal our
GK Kapoor after receiving him because
Indian Air Force contingent comprises of
air marshals sri kamal proper current
and air vice-marshal rgk kapoor and you
also know that indian army has also come
here to receive him so yes they have
been waiting inside and as you see right
behind me
that is the gate Rahul welcome to
integrated check boy a post that is the
very gate that takes you inside till the
border gate but then we were also given
to understand that VSM doesn't you know
accept any kind of transaction any human
transaction after 7:00 p.m. but then of
course an exception has to be made now
the way India made an exception to give
a very strong message to Pakistan by
calling off the the body retreat
ceremony and the beating retreat
ceremony because many would suspect that
Pakistan's delay had a reason or a
method behind it because they wanted the
repatriation process to coincide with it
with the beating retreat ceremony anyway
reported it first yesterday in fact as
how they had been planning this they had
proposed this and India had reached its
strong reservation had registered strong
reservations suggesting that nothing of
that sort of of is happening because
Pakistan's intend could occur could be
to score some brownie points
highlighting the cooperation card and of
course humanitarian card but India
they cannot be any de-escalation at this
point India believes that the human it
humanitarian approach of Pakistan can
already accepted when Pakistan takes
cognitive bill action corrective action
and affirmative action against our
terrorism which is emanating from
Pakistan soil so at the moment all the
weight is on the frame would be there
are on the screen animal because we
don't want to miss the moment we're
going to keep a window open on our
screens to ensure that we capture this
moment this glorious moment in our
military history viewers when Pakistan
crumbling under pressure hands over one
of our soldiers in less than 36 hours
but unfortunately that's not good enough
for a large number of India's political
parties lot of movement now once again
at that gate I can see to the left of us
more cars coming through hopefully one
of them will bear will bear the news
that Wing Commander
I've been undone is now on Indian soil
hopefully that'll happen the man I'll
just check back with you in just a few
moments let us know I want to I want to
go across to some of our panelists and I
want to begin by asking is it even right
on a day such as this to pose questions
to our forces asking them to give an
account or his up of their valor I want
to begin with you mr. Cedeno Kulkarni
social political activist and columnist
do you think we should be doing this
Rahul today and this particular moment
is really a moment that belongs to a
beam and on a beam london k'vin and then
it's the moment that India has been
waiting for with bated breath and the
fact that one of our brave soldiers is
coming out of Pakistan's captivity has
created an atmosphere of both relief and
joy so he deserves all the all the
congratulations of 1.3 billion Indians
later in the show I hope that you'll
give me an opportunity to also speak
about another person who deserves a bin
Laden and that is our foreign minister
External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj
II she made a wonderful speech today at
the Organization of Islamic Cooperation
meeting in Abu Dhabi which also is
extremely important in today's context
now coming to your specific question I
don't think today is the question today
is the time who raised those doubts and
questions but you think we can do it
tomorrow and day after and the day after
that because you heard multiple because
you know if India has made a claim and
many international international media
outlets are questioning that claim the
people of India have a right to know
what exactly is the truth but today is
not the question today is not the time
to ask those questions so we must
believe some half-baked media reports in
some international publications even
though the countries that those
publications are printed in the
governments of those countries have
accepted in totality the claims of our
forces is that what you're saying mr.
Kulkarni you know I know I am NOT
getting into the discussion today
because I don't believe that today is
the right time to discuss that question
today is not the day to discuss that
question Anandi
but you do agree but you do agree that
we have to give his up general Gd Bakshi
he Saab has to be given up doctor Patra
he Saab will have to be given at some
point of our valor now I want to ask
general GD Bakshi the military man sir
how do you feel when the month of
energies of the world when Congress
politicians say there has been no terror
strike because you see it's been
reported in the New York Times that the
targets were missed and our Air Force
hasn't quite hit the right coordinates
how do you feel sir when the Valor of
our forces and the integrity of our
forces is questioned on the basis of
foreign media report sir I trust my
forces I trust my forces Rahul and when
they are engaged in battle my simple
advice to the other Indians
if you can't help get off their bloody
backs if you can't help get the hell off
their backs let them fight this is the
time to tell you a boy boys don't look
over your shoulder go for it go for it
we'll take care of your family they are
safe they are with us we are there to
take care of them we are there to [ __ ]
you up all right go for it this is not
the time to squabble this is not the
time to solve dissension and discord
this is the time to be united in a fight
which is just and which is absolutely
necessary it has been forced upon us by
30 years of restraint by 30 years of not
letting 80,000 Indians and now please
make that figure 80,000 and 48 have been
martyred Rahul over the last 30 years so
we are forced to ask a simple question
how long Bo
we have started a very right course of
action to hit back
despite the nuclear backdrop to hell
with the nuclear backdrop we have to
force Pakistan but general hold back
this proxy what we've started well my
advice as a professional
my advice is a military professional
this is not the time to de-escalate not
the boss is not what general because
there is a very strong growth there is a
very strong group generals up in this
country that says that what Pakistan has
done is in the spirit of peace and
dialogue this is a massive goodwill
gesture on the part of Imran Khan and we
must reciprocate in kind I'm sure I'm
sure the Nishant Varma would agree with
that point of view it once again mr.
Vemula look let's not force relax one
minute I'm asking Nishant Varma this
question on the basis of the Geneva
Convention okay one second one second
just calm down
one second mr. powner relax don't jump
the gun don't jump the gun sir I know I
know you're desperate to ask questions
of our forces tonight relax just 30
seconds please Nishant Varma know our
forces so then so then wait wait did I
address wait till I address you don't
don't start spoiling the decorum of the
debate I'm asking some straightforward
questions I want to ask you mr. Varma by
questioning the 2016 surgical strikes
and now the cross-border air raid on
Tuesday is the opposition suggesting it
doesn't trust our armed forces
Nishant Varma is that what's happening
first of all first of all I welcome my
boy back home number two who is not yet
in number two very important me there
should be little careful when you have
general didi buck she's sitting and I am
sitting here we are two different
parallels he is on the military aspect
we probably talk of the political aspect
and Apple can only be compared with an
orange he is absolutely right in his
terms but when a politician or a person
who is looking up at politicians or
political analysis asks the government
it cannot be said that I am asking the
military we don't question our military
by the way we only question about
governments and when we questioned the
government it is based on certain
reasoning when politicians are being
asked they need to answer we don't ask
questions to military but if we ask
questions to mr. dr. Sabet Patra he
cannot say q military ki baat nahi kar
rahe oh no we don't ask questions to our
forces we ask the questions to ok people
serving in that government and I was
suggesting you rightly pointed out one
second one second mr. mr. Varma let me
just come in I want to actually get in
deeper into that response and I want to
bring in dr. Patrick ear am I then to
assume sir that when you question your
government you are suggesting that the
government is forcing our military to
act according to some political script
and that they wind up the top officers
of the military to hold a press
conference and spread fake news is that
what you're saying mr. Varma because
I'll tell you and I want to play out
that soundbite again this they have I
smash up no no no listen
one minute sir you answer when you ask
me a question ok tell me tell me sir Ted
so you asked me a question later on sir
tell the military does not function as
what BJP or Congress would want but when
the military takes an action the the
party in power you know they start
behaving in stubborn API and is the
province just country then stop that one
second if you know that if you is not
reading out of a political script one
second mr. Varma let's not get rancorous
if you believe that the army and the
forces and the Air Force in this
particular instance is not reading out
of a prepared political script if it is
not misleading this country then believe
them at face value when a VM Kapoor came
out yesterday he
believe one second I hate this these are
my let's play it out let's play it out
there can be no argument once the forces
have spoken where's the argument wise
man thumb energy putting out these
questions let's put it out the amira
pass evidence here kiju i'm karna chatty
t do a hum target KO did not destroy can
agitate it jus effect amphitheater honk
Oh effect Milligan Oh
Gorman Cooper head he hardly dissipated
historic up or Cassie who evidence
denying a degree when there's evidence
why are they doubts dr. Petra perhaps
there are doubts because a couple of
leaders from the BJP have come out and
said that this strike is going to win
them the elections you know who I'm
talking about is that the reason why the
opposition today suspects the integrity
of our forces have you dragged them into
a political squabble the first I would
like to begin Rahul by saying that if I
mean Pakistan is not doing all this the
frustration of Pakistan is evident and
Pakistan is not doing all this sending
f-16 flyer planes etc to India only for
failing six trees just because six trees
were bombarded Pakistan is not doing
this so I believe the people who are
always the naysayers the pessimists and
in the ones who always provide oxygen to
Pakistan the ones who always provide
ammunition to the Pakistani media they
themselves know within deep within their
soul as to what they are talking about
that they are talking only Buncombe the
issue is why they talk like this the
answer is in for the hatred of mr. Modi
they're left with no other option you
know when we lost 40 of our Jevons
immediately they took no second they
lost no ii ii ii ii they came out and
they said we want revenge Modi should
avenge just a second sir I was not
shouting when you were sir I was not
shouting in the middle of anyone let me
complete then you'll have your turn we
went we had lost their lives of 40 of
our Jevons immediately the next second
these people jumped into the bandwagon
that we want revenge we want revenge
where is Modi where is Moe Dee what is
he doing political will was shown we had
D we had the courage of Indian why you
Sena and we saw became of Pakistan and
then where is the evidence in 2005 in
India may not get into this today is a
proud moment in the spirit and therefore
the air vice marshal of the Air Force
that represents this country has come
out and said we will give it as we have
achieved we have hit our targets who are
usually tilde moving you to sit in doubt
sir and why are you giving Pakistan a
hand oh why are you giving wannabes and
handle we all
I feel that he is a spokesperson of the
finalists on a Pakistani media channel
this is exactly the kind of narrative
Pakistani media channels are peddling
you won't believe it in the Pakistani
national assembly yes yes regarding the
[Applause]
second one second sir this is not a
movement one minute one meets I can see
a lot of movement at the Atari post
let's go straight across to thermal
viewers this might be the moment let's
quickly check let's quickly check with
Tom on I can see a big bus now rolling
through those gates let's go across to
Tamil Tamil we are being told that Wing
Commander have been undone might be
coming through any moment what can you
tell us
that's right Rahul that's what even we
have picked up from our sources between
8:45 and 9:00 is the time when he could
be handed over to Indian authorities
just not us even a group captain JD
Korean the air Itachi's is cutting there
at the Atari poster he had been waiting
there since our 4:30 in fact he came
there expecting that the handover would
happen soon but then it did not happen
well there is movement behind you if you
can pass across the mall even there is a
bus that is coming across is this the
Atari bus service the Lord so so yeah
it's it's a bus service which was stuck
there because the entire movement inside
the integrated check post was stalled
temporarily because for long they had
been expecting that Wing Commander a
beam and then what the man would be
handed over the reason why the entire
area was kept sanitized security people
had taken charge of this and thus all
movement had been literally taken off
it was stalled okay so maybe because
there is a window frame of about two
15-20 minutes as a reason the bus has
been allowed that has got nothing to do
with Wing Commander I mean on the
the might at this point in time but as
you rightly mentioned Rahul another
couple of minutes between 8:45 and 9:00
is the time when you were expecting him
to be handed over to Indian authorities
here on the soil of India and he's being
accompanied by two Indian High
Commission to Islamabad the officials
along with Pakistani authorities so yes
the moment can arrive any moment the
frame is there what has taken so long
what has taken so long why we had so
many false starts today he was supposed
to be handed over at 4:00 then it was
pushed back to 6 then to 8 now it is at
least 24 minutes past 8:00
still no sign or wing commander will
Rahul very interesting at around 2:00
this afternoon who reported as how
Indian High Commission in Islamabad had
completed all the documentation process
which was required and according it was
communicated convey to Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of Pakistan and there
after a meeting was convened and in the
meeting the entire idea was mulled over
as how he should be handed over and
thereafter there is no communication
from Pakistan saying as what caused this
delay yes we know as a matter of fact
that Pakistan wanted this to coincide
with the meeting retreat ceremony which
did not really happen and then
thereafter the beating retreat ceremony
from the Pakistan side was on for which
the delay happened once again then we
know that group captain JD Korean came
to complete the immigration process at
the atari post that too is now through
so what really caused this delay we
really don't know we have to wait for
some clarity we know that air
vice-marshal
our chika Kapoor might just hold a small
briefing where he can give him a sage
maybe a welcome message and if he if he
kindly takes some question possibly our
queries would then be addressed as what
took this long it's just not us in fact
the entire Indian contingent comprising
of Indian Air Force officials ok Indian
Oil officials are there waiting inside
so well well tomorrow we'll check back
with you there'll be more movement I'm
sure and you will keep updating us and
I'll keep coming back to you very
suspenseful viewers very suspenseful
there's already been a four-hour
25-minute delay and we're hoping that
Pakistan is going to keep its word
there's a lot riding and I'm sure they
want to milk
this opportunity they really want us to
be eternally grateful to them for
fulfilling their obligations under
international law so the Indra Kulkarni
this delay by Pakistan is not in any way
covering them
one second Nishant Wilma stop stop it
stop it
[Applause]
stop this stop this please okay I'm not
going to stand for this
let me bring in the whole you know last
time also the D GMO had done the press
conference of surgical strike one
these people had questioned it as for
sickle strike they are saying we don't
question the army the same Nishant war -
gang called it physical strike when the
D G mo did the press conference the
telling the body do the press conference
at that time
these people are congenital Liars and
this has been used in Pakistani media
and it has been used in international
forums okay one second I don't want to
get into this one minute mr. Varma
please one minute one night mr. Varma
peace Japan tiger topic okay Rahman
durbar Brahman
Voyles the whole debate I have
understand this you're some sales voices
ok mr. Varma I'm going to ask mr. Hsu
the Indira Kulkarni a straightforward
question do you have the patience to
listen quietly please I beg your
indulgence sir mr. Kulkarni there are
two schools of thought today one school
is let's first verify if our forces
achieved the ends that were assigned to
them I am NOT going there for now
I think it's a disgusting insult to
question the efficacy the abilities of
our forces and to suggest that they've
been lying to the nation sorry that's my
view people can differ but I want to
bring you in on another point many
people are also saying this is a great
goodwill gesture from Pakistan and we
should now reciprocate in kind where do
you stand on this point
I believe that where credit is due we
should give credit Prime Minister
Imran Khan of Pakistan has taken a
decision of returning Abuna and on to
India of course under Geneva Convention
Pakistan had to do it but the fact that
she has done it so quickly and has said
that hope he hopes and people of
Pakistan hope people of India also hope
that this contributes to de-escalation
he deserves appreciation there is us
there is a fair degree of no you're
talking about the escalation sir no just
category if I am wrong the scene
diplomacy is happening which also has
contributed to a banandles return okay
mr. mr. Kulkarni you know you seem to
suggest that this is part of some larger
script of de-escalation should I tell
you that we have been breaking some news
about the number of ceasefire violations
48 ceasefire violations in just the last
in just the last few days viewers in
just four days
48 ceasefire violations you should see
the site at our border posts and on our
side of this LOC people can't go to
school they are cowering in bunkers it's
the civilians our brothers and sisters
who are being targeted viewers so don't
get fooled today by Imran Khan for this
reason for which reason sir
for which reason for which reason it's
for this reason for this reason there
should be the escalation of tension
between India and Pakistan
you horrible in your body
we have the escalation after every
crisis Marine Colonel Colonel Allison
wants to come in colonel or is it
no no just a second yes okay first
doctor pathogens they want a small
caveat smoke a small caveat one minute
Colonel Harris ng with a big apology
Colonel Erickson I beg you apology I'll
have just 10 seconds of indulgence and
then you can take over sir I just want
to say that please for God's sake let's
not use this word de-escalation as far
as India is concerned because India has
never escalated India whatever had done
it was a preemptive strike we had never
escalated escalation was done by
Pakistan in a wrongful way they tried to
attack of a military installation so all
those who feel that India should be
Skelly are wrongly using the word mr.
Varma mr. Varma I don't want to hear
your Bankim side I hate you in Hama look
at each other one on one meet one make
one make one is extremist buna sir today
quoi Joseph a senior member of the
Pakistani establishment has said that
Pulwama was done as a revenge attack and
that he has disclosed what Pakistan's
hand is in it how can we say that this
is the same Pakistan that is doing a
peace initiative with us by releasing a
beam and an under pressure of
international organizations and under
the law 10 mr. Sood indical can emerge
how hodges's statement aligns into his
peace process from Pakistan how he sees
doves are flying from Pakistan today
when the cease fire violations have
taken place mr. Kulkarni Gillette will
keynesian sir please
one you know there are many Pakistanis
who have been saying that Pullman wama
was a staged incident stays like Indians
themselves and for political benefit of
the ruling party I don't believe it in
at all this was a terror attack for
which - a moment has claimed
responsibility and it is the
responsibility of the Pakistani
government to take verifiable quick
action against Jesse more month on this
there is absolutely no doubt in the
minds of all those including those who
want de-escalation who want peace
between India and Pakistan and I am one
of them Quadra I suppose admitted the
Pakistani role is responsible they are
not saying we can action but they I
think peace is being given a chance the
coalition how do you respond to these
individuals who say now's the time for
dialogue and also the time to question
our armed forces and our government over
what exactly was achieved by the
airstrikes yeah yeah yeah yeah
no he implies the escalation to a level
that you know the no business of proxy
war you know starts just Reno commences
once again and that is what he means by
de-escalation but yes it's a very good
suggestion mr. Kulkarni and you know
given your links and you know
proclivities towards Pakistan may I
suggest to you and also member Baum of T
and Nomura and and Sidhu given in branch
you know preference and proclivities for
both and you included please go and
implore a branch on to handover Masood
Azhar and half each side and and serve
after that I mean we will I will
personally recommend him for a Nobel
Prize and maybe then that I can assure
you I will I urged the government to
appoint to you as the spearhead for the
talks as it is you have been talking for
you know people in Pakistan for very
long and it is for because of proxies
like you so that their Kulkarni that
this proxy war has passed
nude for so long you you are a proxy of
Pakistan
I dare say this and because of you we
talked to so many of Africa Latin King
okay okay
strong word AB cabinet on duty we love
it you are a big piece make you are a
big business you think mr. Kulkarni that
India is cut them to suffer see on the
television tell me why is Indian attack
why was Rajan even like that why won't
you put under attack why most 26/11
turned out you devil won't warn you
cause it for territory
it was pure jihadi terrorism mr.
Kulkarni and you you have am sorry to
say have been acting as a proxy of
Pakistan and get out of my sight if you
can mister mister no Colonel Harrison
please let's not go there I understand
you made a good point okay let let let
him respond mr. Kulkarni the point is
we've always return to talks after every
provocation it hasn't got us any more
anywhere today we've opened a window to
achieve something you are seeing the
results
Pakistan is never ever cooperated with
India within a window of 36 hours surely
something is working perhaps your line
needs to be improvised mr. Kulkarni
you know I was called a proxy of
Pakistan I'm a patriotic Indian and will
remain so till the end of my life but I
am a proxy of peace I'm a fighter for
peace because freeze is the interest of
both India and Pakistan and South Asia
and the entire world now coming to the
role of Pakistan in promoting terrorism
cross-border terrorism they let there be
absolutely no doubt I made this point
earlier I want to reiterate it pull wama
was an evil act by gesture moment which
is given a free movement free run inside
Pakistan in Pakistan cannot and must not
do so Pakistan will have to take strong
verifiable and real with masters calling
himself against all terrorist groups ok
but mr. Kulkarni surely if you have to
talk you must talk to a government that
is not prepared to go to war to defend
terrorists India did not conduct strikes
against Pakistani military installations
the Pakistani state or the Pakistani
civilian it conducted strikes to extract
revenge from terrorists terrorists sir
surely there is a distinction and if
Pakistan can't see it then what is the
point of these talks and I think sir the
amount of energy you are investing in
convincing us perhaps you should invest
that in convincing the Pakistanis of the
need to hand over people who have a site
Saladin McQueen and luck we and the
other horrible miss miss forgotten
mullahs Oh daydreaming no mullahs of
hate and war I will continue to do so
because I will continue to do so but I
will also raise my voice and all
we have conditions for a lasting and
durable peace no no otherwise and I
never have mr. cylindrical Kearney
please you don't agree doctor you don't
agree well doctor you don't agree no no
I don't agree I mean I don't see any
reason as to why anyone on this panel
should agree with Pakistan because for
70 long years we have suffered we have
seen blood it's not in India has not
given a chance to Pakistan impede number
of chances every regime has given
chances to Pakistan but what did we get
in return
oh we got backstabbed in return desk
five matter for if - and I don't think
this is the one piece I do me this time
and I escalate as in no one wants war
but to release the pressure valve to
release the pressure valve if we do that
we will lose the advantages that have
accrued to us said I'm coming out - I
just want to bring in acid bomb blasted
Bangla the more disturbing element of
this debate and nishanth firmly lacks
one minute the most disturbing element
stems from these comments multiple
entries comment let's listen to it once
again mr. Bhalla first is a month of
energy listen to what she said
okay we're just going to play it out
Nizam PI says it's going to take ten
seconds ten seconds have we got it
let's play it out okay this is mamta
Banerjee and she's coming out and saying
very very clearly viewers that as far as
she's concerned she believes The
Washington Post and The New York Times
that these strikes miss their mark
listen to this
[Music]
[Music]
once one of them captain vandal okay
Ashley Pamela give me two reasons why
you endorse Mamta Banerjee's line of
questioning tonight tell me firstly let
me tell you that I'm not endorsing month
abaya
a month of energy statement and let me
open with another statement that the
country is glued to watch the glorious
moments to see its Jabez and Sheldon
sippy
that's a banana because I've been and
then to obviously the armed force
I've been undone to the honorable Prime
Minister to the external affairs mission
and or Benenden to the opposition also I
think they all joined please set a
strong narrative to Pakistan and to the
world that India is united has been
using the behaving more like this as
much dangerous to UPS it was to the NDA
it is the first is a lot to UPN and
both opposition leaders who are seeking
you can come out of Congress in the gore
Congress of the state Pulwama is the
stage manufactured attack by India we
put the blame on India which is Amla
stop it
please let me bring in Denise Raj
nationalism has nothing to do with the
UPA or don't get these passionate let me
ask you it is you have no right to ask
the Indian Air Force for evidence let me
ask you let me ask you know in 2016
after the surgical strikes then H Raj
Nair the opposition said that these were
farcical strikes and I can tell you the
names of not even individuals in the
opposition but those that actually had a
working relationship with the BJP came
up with this word for a sickle strike I
don't Sheree - one sec intellectual par
excellence as he refers to himself he
came out and said farcical strike today
the narrative is being repeated why why
do you undermine the integrity of our
forces around in an attempt to commit
for 45 minutes yes agreed answer the
question look first of all no operative
first of all no opposition leader
question of Avella amaldi' of our armed
forces we respect the Valor of our armed
forces they are proving their mantle
during 47 48 60 to 65 71 so we are proud
of them we welcome of inulin by 3 L
Sigma 3 is rank to us whether it is
under general right other mutual
protocols number two number two I would
like to state a fact that patriotic
patriotism is not d'ivoire mongering
diplomacy is not jingoism it should be
understood by all and if if I stand by
the 21 party statement in queue just day
before yesterday and we stood by the
Government of India taking action
against terrorism after the poleramma
attack but what we will do with the
other APPA soldiers of the country to
show you how you are being used okay one
second radio resistant wheelies can the
camera focus on the street yes
Radio Pakistan official Pakistan radio
light or in the radio but when t1
opposition parties expressed deep
anguish over more these blatant
politicization of prevailing security
situations show big picture of I want
this to be I am showing it to you this
is very formal accountable you do pocket
this is the radio Pakistan tweet viewers
look at this it says and if the camera
can focus that that that's what it says
there you can see Radio Pakistan there
very clearly visible what does it say 21
opposition parties
expressed deep anguish over mu these
blatant politicization of prevailing
security situation
today a beam and then a beam and then
and our forces are putting their lives
out on the line to unite India and
certain political parties scared that
they will lose the election on the back
of perhaps an explosion of patriotic
fervor are trying to bring down the
morale of our forces by tweeting this
and making our forces suspect the
government of the day this is not in
national interest at least I don't think
so after you yes because I am NOT able
to general Bakshi as we wait for our
hero's return general Bakshi how do you
feel how do you feel today when the
Valor of our forces is being questioned
the application and the integrity of our
forces is being questioned do you think
this is going to have an effect on the
morale of our forces at a time like this
ah you know we have had reverses in the
history of our nation right we have had
debacles you know the Battle of Britain
the Dunkirk was a debacle but no courts
of inquiries are held while the war is
on that is left for after the fighting
is over then you can do Commission's of
inquiry courts of enquiry lessons
learned etc etc etc I have said at the
beginning of this interview anybody has
any doubts over what has happened well
support the Armed Forces called for a
continuation of the pressure stop stop
raising a racket about de-escalation and
how nice Iran
Conte has been if you feel Pakistan has
not been punished enough when you say so
dress for continuation of the pressure
let me tell you all NATO's whether
they're in the BJP lil Park is bringing
from the president of the BJP down to
the last soldier of the BJP the foot
soldier of the BJP to the Congress the
president the Congress to the last foot
soldier of the Congress in several other
opposition parties all need to adhere to
the red line don't use our forces to
make political capital for yourselves
because then once you do that you are
actually denting the morale of our
forces who will wonder what cause are
they actually fighting for they need to
be clear about it they can be no no
compunctions about the fact that
politics must be distanced from our
forces and I want you to and I want all
Anita's today to see the great feeling
of love and affection and respect that a
public has not just for a banana but for
every man woman in uniform I want to
play out these pictures from you from an
aircraft today as a beam and ins parents
were exiting the aircraft everyone stood
in their seats they were sitting in the
back and they allowed them to pass and
they all clapped I want to end this by
showing you those pictures

YoUhdGOKBeE,Times Now accesses the dossier given to Pak which proofs the JeM&#39;s involvement in terror activities,TIMES NOW has accessed dossier submitted by India to Pakistan which gives proof of JeM's involvement in terror activities.,2019-03-01T07:06:55Z,TIMES NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YoUhdGOKBeE/hqdefault.jpg,"well remember viewers time and again in
rongkhun and the rest of his pakistani
cabinet has been demanding proof they
said chores proof and then we will act
against terror camps and terrorists so
times now is now going to expose the
proof which has been handed a cross to
Imran Khan that's right we've managed to
access the dossier which has been
submitted by India to Pakistan which
gives solid evidence of James Josh's
involvement in terror activity over the
years now this dossier that we are going
to show to you viewers will give a
point-by-point rebuttal about every
farce of JM being a social organization
and it shows that terror agenda its
leaders have attempted to indoctrinate
attempted to cull collect funds for
jihad you're also going to show you
pictures of James terror camps in Bala
code all of this has been presented to
him brown khan in the form of a dossier
which has been given to him submitted to
him yesterday and this is the actionable
proof that Imran Khan ought to be
working in yes they are going to today
return wing commander up in London what
the month but now we are going to prove
to you exactly why I'm wrong Khan has
decided to free our brave because there
is so much evidence that he cannot
possibly refute he's being forced his
hand is being forced to start acting
against terror camps and terrorists
which have been emanating and being
shielded and nurtured on his own soil
there's also proof of James terror
activities which is now staring and
Imran and the Pakistani Prime Minister
is going to be on test india has
welcomed that wing commander be none
that what the man is going to be sent
back to India later on in the day but
this is just the beginning in the strong
diplomatic tactics which India has now
undertaken the message to Imran Khan is
very clear clam down on terror camps
it's a blunt message
Imran Khan will do well to heed this
warning
let's go across from nikunj car a
redditor for Internal Security nickens
explain to us page by page the dossier
you've managed to access for us
what is the actionable proof that Imran
Khan ought to be working on against
Masood Azhar well Magna the fact of the
matter is that this is a compilation of
the entire recent Jaya Muhammad activity
which according to the Government of
India and this dossier has that very
much written in the print handed over to
Pakistani government is happening right
under the nose of the Pakistani
government which clearly means that it
cannot happen without the knowledge of
the Pakistani authorities at various
levels at the level of the state
governments where this is happening the
provincial governments as they're called
in Pakistan and then the central
government so very very clearly Pakistan
government is allowing Joshi Mohammed a
free run in the territories that it
controls contrary to the promise that it
has given to India in 2004 that its
territory will not be allowed to use not
be allowed to use further anti-india
activity now what does this dossier
actually says it starts from it this is
very these are all very recent episodes
it starts from 2018 and ends up
somewhere in 2017 so last two years we
are just in 2019 this is a one Episode
one can go this is may 328 een and it
begins with JME chief Maulana Masood
Azhar alias sadly in his column rangoon
or writes that if he earth offered
Pakistan should exchange dr. Shakil
Afridi with Aafia Siddiqui as Aafia
Siddiqui is the pride of Pakistan now
these are all individual characters with
about whom the mentions are there in in
context to the terror that Pakistan is
sponsoring on the Indian soil and then
he goes on to on May 14th itself that he
goes on to say that he again talks about
Abdul Hafeez Amir Puri and same you know
Jay I am Emile Mujahideen Maulana Masood
Azhar motivating his companions and OMA
the Muslim body said that existence of
Masood Azhar in itself is a blessing of
Allah so that so a man who is you know
going to be very very shortly hopefully
and if China moves away from its stated
position certainly most certainly a
globally prescribed terrorist the
dossier says that he is a blessing for a
land
and all his activities are happening
right under the nose of the Pakistani
government now it again on February 20
2018 just about a year back during its a
six-day visit to Lahore the JME shop
Shobha at Peru's department of
introduction delegation held 13
interaction sessions in which 700 people
including 65 ulemas participated during
these interactions around 30 people
expressed their desire to take part in
je m training dora at Arriba so all of
this right happening right in the one of
the most prominent cities of Pakistan
Lahore huge export a huge conference 30
people right then and there saying that
they want to become part of the je M
training course and what is this
training course the entire world knows
and that is why Josh Yamaha Mott is a
sanctioned organization by most
countries but Maulana Masood Azhar is a
proscribed man individual by most
countries of course UNSC resolution
there is a problem with the China and
about that the Indian government is now
very aggressively working on again you
know if this if you read from the
dossier itself now see the terror
complicity of Joshi Mohammed which says
you know on multiple occasions it says
we are only into religious activity JM
JM Mujahideen carried out a suicide
attack attack and when February 10 2018
just about one year back on Indian
Army's son Jiwon camp in which five army
officers were killed and five army
officers were killed and many more were
injured the Mujahideen have given a gift
to the Modi government Mujahideen have
given a gift to the Modi government
direct reference to India's central
government direct reference that number
you know any civilized government as an
M Ron Khan has been offering Olive
Branch must take note off and if this is
the kind of activity that is going on
inside Pakistan at least if you know
unknown Imran Khan has now been in power
for close to an years time and if he is
serious about stamp it out or at least
put a lid on all this kind of activity
now this is the musa Mujahideen give
gave a gift to the Modi government on
the on the occasion of the martyrdom day
of absolvo roof Maqbool but and also for
the captivity of hazzard emile Maulana
Masood Azhar who wore Indian jails and
released in exchange for ic8 one for as
we all know clearly mentioned here again
by killing
five Indian Army officers five Indian
which are hidding took part in the
operation of which three were killed two
escaped successfully the revenger
operations launched by the observer
shahid squad India has been continually
blaming this particular squad
there have been documentary evidence
that has been recovered from the
encounter sites on multiple occasions
when India has handed over that proof to
Pakistan Pakistan has chosen to remain
in denial and disbelief and always
maintained that part nobody from
Pakistani soil is involved in such
attacks again the dossier very clearly
mentions it now this is another visit
March 27 2018 during a four-day visit to
Sialkot district joshi Mohammad again
show by a roof which is you know it
largely looks like it's a process or a
program to bring individuals who are
uninitiated into jihad and related and
religious activities to their fault
the allegation comprising Maulana mod
there that the name of these individuals
including including the delegation
require recruited 20 peep 22 people I'm
sorry back for 22 people for Dora 3
there be a training course and 91 for
the riots after training on jihad and
Quran very clearly 91 people recruited
in one camp in Sialkot
for the training for training in jihad
and Quran now this is the kind of
activity that is openly going on
individuals are being recruited
motivated then sent to camps like Bala
court which was bombed by the pocket by
the Indian fighter aircraft jets or just
few just a few days back and from there
again launched back to India to carry
out the strikes that this dossier
mentions and the entire world knows
about so the fact is that is a
completely uninterrupted jihad factory
that is running inside Pakistan right
under the nose of the various provincial
and the central government and when
Imran Khan comes out and says that you
know we want peace we want to choose the
path of dialogue this is why the
government of India with the continuous
input from the intelligence security and
the Indian Army and allied security
forces cannot accept that olive branch
on it at its face value this is that
this is the big problem then you know
when we come back after the recruitment
the participants also promised to take
in religious events organized by JM and
Halima's and expressed satisfaction over
the schedule for training prepared by JM
chief Maulana Masood Azhar the man is
directly in charge his complicity leaves
nobody in doubt if if the Pakistanis are
in doubt
Hara here is the name of the city name
of the individuals name of the people
joining name of the people who
participated the mallanna's I am quite
sure that if a government is serious in
any part of the world then if it has so
much of leads at on its hands and if it
is aware of so much of religious
activity or activity for recruitment
purposes going on which India says only
the recruitment is being done for anti
India terror activities to be launched
from the Pakistani soil it can at some
point or the other halt or stall such
activities clearly various Pakistanis
provincial governments and the
government of Pakistan has had shown
zero intent and allowed individuals like
Maulana Masood Masood Azhar a complete
free run this dossier now again given to
Pakistani government will again provide
them great amount of details leads and
inputs if the if it provided the wish to
choose to act upon it and work on these
indices Maulana Masood Azhar we know but
there are individuals by their names
mentioned quite prominent individuals
who are going around various parts of
Pakistan and propagating what India
calls religious jihad and if they wish
to stop those individuals at least at
the first point they should call those
individuals for questioning ask them
about the activities that in data that
have been cited in this dossier and
Pakistani CID and counterterrorism
Department of Punjab itself would also
be very very well aware of those
activities now again on November 20 17
27 27 2017 Joshi Mohammed organised
gazoo I him holy war against India
conference now this is specifically an
anti India terror activity terror camp
terror activity dedicated just about
against India in district
Okara attended by over 2,000 people the
conference was addressed by JM leaders
mufti Abdul Rauf Asghar Maulana max
and Maulana Abdul Malik Tahir his
address
must've in his address Mufti Abdul Rauf
Asghar highlighted the virtues of
martyrdom and congratulated the parents
of killed terrorists Sajid and talha
both killed in an encounter or in
various encounters with Indian security
forces he stressed that indo-pakistan
friendship these are the words we must
watch out for he stressed that
indo-pakistan friendship and bilateral
trade would not end jihad as there were
many youth ready to sacrifice their
lives like Sajid and Pell ha ruff called
upon youth to follow the footsteps of
Kilda terrorists Sajid and talha in his
address mallanna Madonna Abdul Malik
Tahir paid tribute JM chief Maulana
Masood osku other for his contribution
to jihad and wished him a good health
and long life now here again clear proof
name of the place name of the
individuals name of the slain terrorist
name of the places where they died and
also a direct hint at the fact that
whatever and they was were being done by
for indo-pakistan friendship or
bilateral trade to promote
people-to-people contact are certainly
not going to help the entire situation
between India and Pakistan now if this
is the kind of input how much do you
promote India Pakistan from a friendship
and this is also clearly a message for
all the peace nicks in this country who
say that you know people-to-people
contact will improve will give a better
chance to peace in the subcontinent and
governments can then also come together
certainly these individuals have
something completely different on their
mind and something that no government in
New Delhi can avoid taking note of at
and if you avoid it you avoid it at the
cost of your own peril as we have seen
it in full wama as we have seen in
multiple previous strikes by likes of
joshi mohammed or lashkar-e tayyiba in
this country
absolutely yes always said that it is in
favor of dialogue but only after there
is action and crackdown against terror
any kind of actionable proof Pakistan
has said give it to us we will act upon
it",True,en,3287,5,46

abide by its UN Security Council
commitments to deny safe havens to
terrorists and block their access to

to release the captured Indian Air Force
pilot deprived Jamal motherf Resources
says the United States of America to
Pakistan that's a direct message going
across to Pakistan it's been asked to
abide by the UN Security Council
commitments to deny safe havens to
terrorists and also to block their
access to funds well let me begin by
offering our condolences to the
government and people of India for the
attack of in the middle of this month
the United States has designated Jem and
its leadership under our domestic
authorities to cut off the flow of money
to deprive them of the resources they
need to commit attacks like the one we
witnessed just a couple of weeks ago
it's also important to amplify those
unilateral efforts that were taken under
our own laws with multilateral efforts
we call in other countries to follow our
lead and we call on the international
community as a whole to follow our lead
in designating this organization and its
leadership well let's go across to our
national visitors enjoy children should
enjoy up America definitely wants to
amplify this issue and rightly so that
Pakistan needs to cut down funds
completely isolate terror organizations
and abide by the UNSC commitment well
not just Russia Mama's very clearly this
is a very strong message from the United
States are they are clearly very shocked
by what happened in full wama and then
of course are the escalation the bombing
on off focused by Pakistan interests of
attempted bombing of Indian military
installations and so on America is
really making it very clear in this case
saying to Pakistan just make sure that
all one two terrorists are blocked
whether the consumers whether it is full
food items the lashes and mascara toda
with any other organization the Haqqani
is and thought it has to be blocked and
your message and it's particularly
important that America is looking at
this because there are problems of their
own they have issues of their own they
are dealing with either be North Korea
but despite that there is a clear focus
on the subcontinent and on Pakistan way

There is a particular section of India ...",2019-02-28T19:09:19Z,TIMES NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ob6HmpUB88k/hqdefault.jpg,"[Music]
good evening and welcome to the news are
at denim petraju she and the agenda
seems to be set by someone else in our
country today all of us are naturally
talking about the release of Wing
Commander up in London but there is a
particular section of India which is a
goal about Imran Khan short of
conferring the Nobel Peace Prize on him
they have pretty much gone the whole hog
and called it a great gesture by the
Pakistani Prime Minister a step towards
reconciliation branded him a statesman
and wanted India to meet him more than
halfway at the talks table what is
interesting though is that the
announcement by Imran Khan came even as
India refused to budge from its stance
of not seeking consular access and
demanding that wing commander been and
then be released without any
preconditions soneji's Kenny Burgamy
induced Anka pilot of Nepal away as a
peace gesture Harman who spoke allocable
again
a male mid curtain monkey is spoken to
Pakistani acre it's a great gesture of
peace and reconciliation though man omid
cartoon monkey hamari tariffs subido
ahmadi leadership hey boys could
reciprocate karegi or koshish carry
giggles your situation is so funny now
is Cody Escalade correct so here's the
thing I am completely at a loss to
understand exactly how is a brand cons
action a gesture of peace or even the
remotest concession to India it's a
result of a stamp taken by us where we
have refused to be blackmailed by a
country which by the way had zero
compunctions in using an air force
officer as a bargaining chip and exactly
how does Imran Khan's action under
pressure take away from all that he has
done in the past are we forgetting that
this same man sent in his Air Force into
Indian Territory to bomb military
targets something that is an act of war
he wanted to escalate the situation and
today we are branding him as some kind
of Nelson Mandela
what on earth explains this delusion and
self-loathing on part of some people in
our country to figure out the answer to
this question is my simple agenda today
there was a dollar given so how do you
see
[Music]
all right before I go across to my
entire panel of guests I want to start
by bringing in Air Chief Marshal a white
TIPNIS former chief of the air staff so
I want to start by getting your point of
view on what is being put forward as a
gesture of peace that's what imran khan
called it when he announced the release
of wing commander here and then do you
think that's what it is a gesture of
peace a huge concession to us but Raja I
not to show that I have received your
entire conversation so I expect the
question is asked to me am i right
that's correct about the significance of
this Wing Commander been released yes I
mean certainly Pakistan is doing no
favor they're just following the
international norms according to the
Geneva Convention and it was incumbent
on them to treat a wing commander what
the man with the utmost of respect and
care and return him to his country as
soon as possible but naturally one would
expect I mean it is according to norm
that Pakistan will try and get some
mileage out of it because it does find
itself in the corner it has sympathy
from no one today including China who in
China has not you know unambiguously
supported Pakistan in fact they are
given a bland statement that both sides
should exercise restraint now normally
China would never speak in those terms
unless it is a clear signal to Pakistan
that listen in this system I'm afraid we
are not able to help you and your honor
old she better take care of self so so
he is trying to get as much manage as
possible everyone is defaulting 40 for
harboring and
creating terrorists not only against
India but several other nations
therefore certainly Pakistan needs to
mend his ways so why is going to few is
very important today's because you will
portray stuff sorry for interrupting you
but you were Chief of Air Staff
retirement something similar and
happened during the Kargil war in 99
with Pakistan returning flight left Nana
Chiquita do you think like then they
will now tomorrow try to make the return
of Wing Commander been undone into some
kind of PR coup for them a PR spectacle
as it were I think if you could tell
your technicians to improve the audio
please and be grateful because your
speech is cutting them all the time
now if I got the import of a question
you are asking how different is this
situation from Nikita being released
during the Kargil war and the position
you know in this instance what has
happened is China as I said earlier
Pakistan is finding itself in a hole in
Kargil it didn't believe that it was in
as such a big predicament as it is right
now and therefore they you know we're
playing a little harder to return this
prisoner of war Nikita
so that's the situation difference and I
believe they wanted to make the rest of
the world believe that this time India
has entered into Pakistan territory and
yes it is true that not only did we
enter Pakistan Occupied Kashmir but we
went beyond it and made an attack on
Pakistan but what we have made
absolutely clear is that this is a non
military action and it's a pre-emptive
action to prevent this terrorist groups
and others from taking similar action
and if Pakistan takes action against
them okay dismantle the organization and
destroys their camps
then India would have nothing to do with
it but for India to believe that
Pakistan is doing anything in the sort
we need visible and credible evidence
that this is so and until that happens
despite whatever has happened and there
is a good will from our side but if you
are not satisfied that there is a
possibility of this terrorist camps
being used as launch pads or training
camps then it is our responsibility as
security to the our people and a tell
tree that we destroy them and try and
dismantle this organization that it's
our responsibility as per international
law as I understand it every nation has
the right to take care of its security
and safety well these are seeing and
some words from someone who has led the
Air Force I wonder the peaceniks in our
country are going to be listening to
that because they already want us to
forget everything that Pakistan has done
to us in the very recent past and start
talking with them thank you very much a

us with your point of view I want to go

Royden roach why are you making a virtue
out of a necessity Pakistan needed to
release Wing Commander been undone
you're making it out as if it is some
great favor they have done India what's
the compulsion Royden roach well let's
see what happens during the doing an
attack when somebody is taken into
custody from any other country let it be
the under the Geneva Convention Act or
whatever it is we have them they've kept
for longer time longer period in the
country till they get the proper
information proper sources we all know a
prisoner of war he has to be taken care
of and respected but I don't think I

ever done it so fast all right judolette
so fast I'm glad you can see it's a
rogue nation appreciate them for
whatever initiative they've taken
yes it is a rogue nation and we
appreciate them and appreciate Imran
Khan for the since he's come forward do
you expect us to annouced him now fall
at their feet and start talking to them
because a statesman has made a departure
from an otherwise rogue nation we no one
ever says fall at their feet
sorry our hands rise up our heads rise
up and we look up above them let me tell
you that our heads rise up and talk
about them with a rising how do we start
talking totally shot put something as go
down or our knees we had never said that
we'd never do that and we never want a
country or a prime minister to do
something like that okay we need a
dialogue we I always said from the time
he had they shown yourself and Cindy
went to Pakistan and there was a big
huge cry about it I've always said about
it I said we need a dialogue why wasn't
the dialogue initiated so understand why
this desperation for a dialogue with
someone people themselves admit is a
rogue nation it's almost like what they
say in India our del mu tomorrow there
is no way I can make you understand
because I don't understand where these
people come from because you know puja
if India had never had a dialogue with
Pakistan
we have never entered into negotiations
with Pakistan if we were constantly on
war with Pakistan then I would
understand you know these kind of voices
coming around then have you not had a
dialogue with Pakistan you know people
keep saying you know this is this this
this nonsensical tagline give me such an
say no to war haven't we been saying no
to war for the last 30 years what have
they got in return you know they are
making such a human cry had the has the
Air Force pilot
been weeping and wanting to come home
has he shown
any kind of weakness in resolved or
resoluteness that these people are using
him as a kind of a prop to try and you
know push the point that please go and
talk to a rogue nation exactly calls it
has has the family of the pilot has the
family of the pilot the Air Marshal his
wife his son have they come and done
breast-beating on television or on the
streets to say that no no they all know
here is an intrepid man who has been
fighting for the country unfortunate he
has been caught on the wrong side of the
border he hasn't he hasn't given up
there oh I didn't know he hasn't given
up his dad is the moot point you are
using when commander up in I'm dying to
further your interest you discuss
inexplicable reason want to talk to
Pakistan want to surrender our national
interest and this time you just got a
convenient you for all of your for all
of your we think for Wing Commander a
bit under and he's nothing more than a
pawn for you is war we seen the attacks
we see in the Arctic oceans of war
that's life it is not me being a minor
and then I've seen bigger repercussions
of yes but me say something so
challenging for two years we have been
facing unrelenting war from Pakistan you
know here are these people who have made
this one gentleman who has been caught
on the wrong side of the border you are
questioning me what about my people and
we can see and by saying go through for
whatever these five for the block that
when do the Iowans are photograph you
only dead bodies were not found these
shameless people are making this thing
out to be
do they not talk about the tens of
thousands of thousands and I use the
word advisedly tens of thousands of
people have been killed in Pakistani
sponsored terrorism we have been saying
no to war we have been talking to
Pakistan we have been
leaning over backwards to accommodate
Pakistan we have for the first time
exact mr. Modi horse so you know let's
let's let's let's talk about let's talk
about specifics here another angle
nothin what does the Geneva Convention
say and a lot of people are finding it
very funny that suddenly India has woken
up to Geneva Convention thankfully we
were not in such a situation very
frequently in the recent past
unfortunately we were day before
yesterday forced to take a look at what
the geneva convention dictates and
according to the Geneva Convention
section to release and repatriation of
prisoners of war at the close of
hostilities shall be done without delay
after the cessation of active
hostilities active hostilities are over
Pakistan thus had to release the
prisoner without any delay how is this a
concession to India and wrong another
yeah thanks yeah thanks very much for
having me actually you know I this is
one of those enix clip this is one of
those things that is just so appalling
that you you begin to wonder about the
logic that people are using and most of
them I'm sorry to say are from a lot of
them are from your fraternity and
Shushan has addressed them is it
appalling to say that this you know we
hailed this as a peace gesture first of
all a Pakistan is doing something it is
perhaps paying playing a mind game so
even if it had to release through the
auspices of the Geneva Convention it
need not have done so Asha shanz has
said and neither did our brave pilot
actually asked for it
but leave that aside I mean for people
to say that we must have a dialogue not
I like to ask this gentleman you know
who was there before the first one who
spoke he wants a dialogue
dialogue is between two people it's not
a monologue it's a dialogue so since
1999 since you know five or six or maybe
half a dozen major terrorist attacks on
our soil perpetrated orchestrated by
Pakistan he had nothing else but
dialogue in fact in Sharm el-sheikh
agreement we even inserted what Pakistan
coerced is to insert so when we go to a
dialogue with Pakistan we will put the
following things on the table that is
you hand us over
dowered Hafiz Saeed Oscar you close all
the terror camps you you know dismantle
all the terror setups another one to add
with that and I want to ask specifically
to all of those the fans of Imran Khan
were on a panel right now for them Imran
Khan is a hero I want to ask them
beginning with Abdul Razak on Garga
Chatterjee Royden Roach William grant
can act on the pull Varma does you're
given by India will he act against
Masood Azhar will he hand over doubt the
brahim and half is safe will he give
consular access to Col Bhushan Jadhav by
the way will he do all of this mr. Abdul
Razak on can I replace Raja
yes gone he's asking for peace coverage
you know saying no to war kind of
present I'm just saying since you're so
blown away by Imran Khan's action do you
now expect him to act on the pole vomit
awesome 40 people were killed there I am
sure your heart bleeds sucessful for all
on 28 August 2018 when but major first
of all of 20th August 2018 when Imran
Khan became the prime minister of
Pakistan in his first address he said
that he wants friendship with India
solely 18 I am talking about 2019 14
February 20 1940 men were blown to bits
by a terror organization that finds
refuge in Pakistan will your hero act
against the JJ Mohammed and will he act
on the Dozier that India has given him
what do you think what what's the gut
feeling you get we need to negotiate we
need to start a dialogue we need to
negotiate and he should
and make him a man Khan said give me
actionable evidence that you no no don't
you around Khan should act on that
docile no two nations have come together
after a military action mr. Cardew is a
seasoned diplomat let me ask in the
first years we've had an act of
aggression we have given $1 to Pakistan
now do we need to initiate talks before
expecting Pakistan to act look up
Padmaja let's be clear Imran Khan does
not matter what the people who matter
are the generals in Pakistan and
therefore I do not know why is there
such obsession with Imran Khan that is
0.1 0.2 our position has always been
that yes we will talk but terror and
talk cannot go together and that is
valid 0.3 let us not forget that in the
gufa joint statement signed between
Prime Minister Modi and or decided
between Prime Minister Modi and Nawaz
Sharif on July 24 2015
the Pakistanis and we had agreed that
the first item of discussion will be
terror yes and that that discussion will
take place in India the Pakistani
generals refused to allow this and the
Pakistani generals have never changed
their stand
so therefore to those in India Sri Lanka
who themselves in it is proton Clarence
French I only have to say rule and we
should have Claire don't understand
Pakistan they just don't understand this
beast then you must understand the
nature of the behind forward
not given us anything more than tensions
troubles and tears to the people of the
nation a hurried attack on power is
talking to our warrant Ted you are being
pure horror you should have been given
time in the army to take action well for
some gains within the government
everything is pulling if you look at the
statements made by Prakash javadekar G
ba said Europe and the Prime Minister
has a lock on it what what what what
great you hold is Imran Khan getting to
the table just a second since you're
sowing oh and love with Imran Khan okay
let me tell you exactly what raka stands
in true today about the cause here like
we have given them we spoke to Abdul
Basit who other than being a seasoned
diplomat was our High Commissioner to
India
the Pakistani former High Commissioner
to India here is what he thinks about
that they asked for actionable
intelligence this is how intelligence
today how do you see this Abdullah
Zarkon it's a piece of literature 40
people died and Pakistan says this is a
piece of literature this is the country
that you want to talk to but there has
to be some kind of approach please go to
EJ's dose here come what is the approach
but this dossier you asked
you said there is no Jessie listen this
is the dollar on Gemini Reba when you
say let's approach them further what
exactly is this approach that you
approach a year I tell me Hari watched
by jika approach on a one-coat derocker
aunt guita kite a bus mela [ __ ] that
bigoted I shall be analogy because we
know it wasn't it
Anand wrong in Athens that's a great
example to give let's set ourselves up
again yes absolutely and let me let me
just add a couple of things you know
there is a there is a very easy very
easy question or almost like a tepid
test for mr. as akan you know let me ask
him does he consider Burhan Bonnie or
observe guru as terrorists anything else
is subsidary yes yes they are yes they
are terrorists who's denying that they
are not receive and you talk of peace
and yes so okay can I just finish my
point please can I finish my point mr.
Khan
can I now hold of people since yesterday
have been saying this is a country of
Gandhi
we must act like Mahatma Gandhi we want
peace so let me just give you two
instances permit I'll take only 10
seconds
Gandhi's appeal to Britain's on the eve
of the Battle of Britain and Nazi
invasion fight not sysm without arms
invite her Hitler to take possession of
your island if he refuses to give a free
passage out
allow yourself man woman and child to be
slaughtered
Gandhi's views on the Holocaust and what
the Jews should have done this arm
Hitler by praying to him okay what do
you have to interrupt you at this point
because we're just getting news I
believe the jamaat-e-islami often you
need to crackdown by the Indian
government on them in Kashmir now
there's a complete ban on the
jamaat-e-islami in Kashmir this is huge
remember over the last two weeks a
number of their activists were picked up
by the center and now the crackdown
gets much bigger the real trigger of the
unrest in Kashmir has now been banned
Rajesh uncle joins us for more on that
finally the Iron Fist is beginning to
show rouse yes indeed it's a very clear
message you're with India or then you're
against India that's what is being sent
out now remember in the Kashmiri
discourse and also in the Pakistani
discourse and in some sections of the
moderating view in this country these
are the prime stakeholders in what is
often described as the Kashmir process
so today the message that is going out
is that if you have sympathies towards
Pakistan or if you have funding that is
routed via Pakistan or if you depend
upon your moral sustenance on Pakistan
then you're no longer going to be
tolerated in Jammu and Kashmir by the
Indian state you will no longer be
recognized as an entity worth engaging
in the state of Jammu and Kashmir now
where will this end
but mature that's the question we have
to ask what is the red line is the hurry
up next and if they become persona non
grata as they already are in a sense
then obviously this will complicate
matters in Jammu and Kashmir for those
who have always tried to play this
sphere against the Indian state
there's also another subtle message
going out now to the valley and that is
that there is no alienation the
alienation is bred because of
individuals who act as conduits for
Pakistani propaganda that on the back of
money from the ayah in the Pakistani
deep state and a network of radicals is
spewing a form of anti India hysteria
anti India
sort of paranoia in the valley and
therefore the center is going to justify
its band by suggesting that these are
the individuals that are actually
pushing the youth of Jammu and Kashmir
which would happily go along with the
Indian mainstream and allow themselves
to be absorbed by the Indian mainstream
but for the presence of this sort of
influence so that's really the message
that is going on path mature well that's
got to be really awkward Rahul
considering that we have a huge section
of very influential voices in India
pushing for talks with Pakistan which
actively aids abets and funds the
jamaat-e-islami and here you have the
centre actually saying sorry we are
actually going to first crack down on
Pakistan's agents right here on our soil
thanks very much round for joining us
with that bit of very very big breaking
information again coming back
Royden draw up the Razak on and now I
want to bring in dr. Garber Chatterjee
because in the evening we had mamta
Banerjee also saying this is a great
gesture by Pakistan are you also an
advocate or for talks again with
Pakistan we should go back right well
let me please don't interrupt a couple
of things to say first of all you
characterized me as a imran khan fan so
please don't miss characterize you know
this is not journalistic integrity
having said that what I would like to
say is that Abdul Basit said that
dossier is a literature after patent
code we gave a literature we gave this
literature in his opinion okay we gave
one dose here after pattern coat
right now we have given another dose
here is this a resolute government
number one number two today Donald Trump
he was president has claimed publicly on
video that he has mediated between India
and Pakistan has India ever done very
nice question you're not answering my
question my simple question to you is we
have given rules again and again now
that is proof also of how Pakistan which
you are pushing us the dog to is funding
people in
organizations which today have been
banned which are radicalizing Kashmiri
's the jamaat-e-islami has been on the
radar of our intelligence agents
agencies for long and now today it
stands bank funded and abetted by the
same Pakistan who you find an apostle of
peace how do you react to that
since you've since you break first of
all jamaat-e-islami is a horrible
organization anywhere in the world it
exists it should be banned everywhere
first batch them secondly since you
bring in Mamata Banerjee and want to do
a political yeah since you want Brio
brought in Mamata Banerjee and want to
do a political twist let me ask what was
knowing the was he doing doing his kilo
India app while Okinawan was captured
why is being increased and you are
pushing the government but all with the
Pakistani feelings of alienation let me
finish let me finish let me finish I
would like to suggest at every test to
some big buckaroo does he consider or
the Tamil son doing business still do
these they're doing business with the
Pakistani say you everything except the
question that I have asked you on what
basis do you give Imran Khan a clean
chit they caught you again coming back
to you on what basis exactly is Imran
Khan being given a clean chit none of
his actions in the past betray any kind
of trust that India can have in him look
Imran Khan has shown no genuine desire
for peace or good relations with India
it's only being routine
talks as I have told you he really
matters very little in the Pakistan
scheme of things the people who matter
are the generals let us see what is he
asked he is asked for actionable
intelligence that is laughable if JJ
Mohammed is in Pakistan
everyone knows the whole world knows
about its activities its prescribed and
we will give him actionable intelligence
about
an organization which is there and which
breeds terror from the territory of
Pakistan he has asked for joint
investigation that is the same thing
which Pakistan has wanted every time
wanting something which is impossible
because it will never achieve its
purpose
after petrm court we allowed their joint
investigation team that was a Pakistani
team and they never reciprocated it
mr. Modi very generously allowed them to
go to patent code now what did I yield
nothing so what will Imran can't bring
new to the no idea he was supposed to go
to Pakistan as the roeckl gesture that
never happened the actionable
intelligence and can the other three
gentlemen respond to this the actionable
intelligence was with the railways
Minister of Pakistan in Parliament he
spoke about haba haba mother said a lot
at a inertia Sahab came mother said he
maybe he could have just hopped across
to him Ron Khan and delivered that
actionable intelligence to the prime
minister he would have had to ask India
for it listen to what the Railways
Minister said in Parliament of Pakistan
believe it on full we knew for what
matters Iowa is all suhaka care
actionable intelligence key from say
guar Megara iran kentucky le bas de que
el empuje so much namagachi even Imran
Khan is a victim of some terror outfits
within his country as well Imran is a
big war dialogues he has said all this
why shanties yes exactly in his country
I must respond to this country I see
office by Imran Khan will respond to
this kind of stuff how does one respond
to this you know this guy is so
ridiculous
within this country India as well we
cannot deny her this is why we cannot
deny that there is terrorism in India as
well Sri Lankan cause a victim obey we
attribute leadership it is letting down
mr. Cardew Pakistan is a terrorist
he has big tolerance for terror
why shouldn't India give him a chance we
should not give him a chance because
he's a puppet see violated our
territorial integrity try to bomb our
military targets and they give shelter
to an organization which kills our
people in his which is why we should
give him a chance
did I cut you I am amazed I mean why did
we give him a chance if we have a dialog
button said I am amazed at the
gullibility of people just because Imran
Khan is saying something routine some
make playing to the gallery
international guarantee we should
believe him second point on terrorism
Pakistan has spawned terrorism some of
these terrorist groups have turned
against them and that is the terrorism
that they are suffering from no one is
responsible for their terror then
they've created Frankenstein's which
turned against the Pakistan State they
attach totally different from the
terrorist organizations that operate
here whom they sustained won't a Volm
Capuchin capala have oh and this is our
economy echoey
Cardew sir don't you also feel that you
know the kind of situation we are facing
in this country we need to resolve this
cross-border terrorism infiltration we
have been spending three lakh sixty
thousand crores every year on our
defense why not give a chance to
dialogue when the Prime Minister has
time and again himself said I'm a branch
if India I will tolerate tell but
Monsieur I must initiate come on once it
do had been to possible to get Curt our
port for India so why not a delegation
who can go ahead and speak they care the
military action Arianna donas Iacono
Nakia but I will tell you some some
facts we have been talking to Pakistan
ever since this phase of terror began in
1990 I have been personally involved in
these negotiations and these talks with
Pakistan when I was working as a
professional diplomat in the Ministry of
External Affairs I've seen Pakistan from
Afghanistan where I was ambassador my
simple question is has it yielded any
results Garvie Chatterjee has a real it
any results well who repeat the same
thing without hope the other one by
repeating the same no results why do you
find beating that drum category or are
you more desperate to give the credit to
Imran Khan because politically should be
disastrous for you god forbid India was
to look superior in a diplomatic
standoff
because then the ruling government would
walk away with the credit you much
rather have Pakistan take the credit
than someone in your own country again
again these dialogues have not helped
and we are in the shameful situation for
the first time since the Simla Agreement
that the Kashmir issue is now being
talked to talked about by US president
he's saying that he is it has been a
challenge I realized what kind of
government this is a classic case of
tracking your nose really hide your face
you know you know Padmaja Padmaja this
guy is a one-trick pony he has been
trying to pressure this line at the DMV
the problem with him is and the problem
with many of the people is watching your
show is they don't use the kind of
poisonous stuff against India you beat
this fellow rice in the Pakistani press
but having said that the young like I
would have I will have to take a bath
after this program because I have been
on the same show with you you are such a
despicable character but forget about it
that is a clever tension between India
and Pakistan POW Power Shia but you have
to look at get your size and the size in
today's food that the pressure is on the
Pakistanis to disengage the pressure is
on the Pakistanis to not behave like a
criminal enterprise and use the Indian
Air Force pilot as a hostage as and
demand some kind of ransom in terms of
talks or whatever so there has been no
real pressure on India the pressure has
been on the Pakistanis to deescalate
there has been no real pressure on India
now I don't know where this guy is
getting his information from but not
know what Scott is saying everything
ties we have dollar I don't like that
the first 70 years we are talking to
Pakistan or we are being proposed to
talk to Pakistan every time we talk to
notice and establish the bank do not
tell me not
Pakistani Prime Minister who very
aroused to avoid extra does not make
these noise when you have good relations
with India
what has he do after that he does not
stop India he is always a puppet who
plays in the hands of the Pakistan when
we have terror and talks we need a plan
B also immediate action if terror talks
do not go on then we have to have a plan
B please understand the gentleman you
said you're part of the delegation who
has talking to Pakistan and wheeling
action what do you do what do you do
some comic books and look who you are a
comic book analyst you come up and you
say that we should have suddenly you
should have action but what kind are you
a serious and earnest also another
friend you know what is interesting what
I find very interesting about about
gentlemen like Royden Roach Gaga
hydrogen Abdul Razak on that we are at a
place today where our External Affairs
Minister is invited to a meeting of the
OIC
of which incidentally Pakistan is a
founding member Pakistan threw a tantrum
and said if you do not disinvite India
we may just boycott it despite that oh I
see did not withdraw its invitation to
India we have the entire world standing
with us but strangely Abdul Razak
Chondroitin Rose garbage @eg are giving
Pakistan cover fire isn't that strange
okay mr. Obree days please the question
was addressed to me can i dun Dada
nuttin
can I please answer what prompts this
color file yeah you know Padma there is
one thing that I think mr. zarkan said
about five minutes ago he might not be
that off the mark
Imran Khan probably is a victim but as
much as Osama bin Laden was a victim now
let me explain you see thirty years ago
there used to be when Indian Prime
Minister's would meet with Pakistani
Prime Minister there would be some
credence you know something tangible
would come out of that discussion you
remember when is Alberto Rajiv Gandhi
things of that sort
people forget that in the last 30 40
years the frightening pace of religious
fundamentalism of fanaticism that has
overtaken Pakistan you know it is almost
over come with it the Islamic Republic
of Pakistan is almost there not quite
almost there in becoming Islamic state
and which we are trying to push it to
India Englishman yes yes so the point is
you know there is a substantial middle
class upper middle class population
people like prosperous people like Imran
Khan they will they have spawned as mr.
diplomat said they've spawned these
terrorist organizations they will be at
the receiving end of it because
religious zealotry is not going to spare
anyone
and either have a life don't for me for
Imran Khan just as yeah and see what
happened with that that the Christian
lady the bla of the blasphemy case
millions came onto the streets
even so can we make you take a back seat
so when it comes to religion all these
people are if we only the whales are
part of the hands of the horse again it
is the all rising
terror and if we don't proceed with
talks and if we think that only a
military action can be a resolution I
think we are wrong from the past we can
learn that a military action can never
be done by mr. Khan do you not realize
that the military aggression was carried
out so Shawn serine by Pakistan
is this country or a portion of it
incomplete look denial about what was
done day before yesterday yes no no is
no no it's not denial it's not denial I
think it's advocacy it's not denial the
problem is that forget about military
nobody is saying that military action is
the only action you need to take mean do
need to take military action we need do
need to put you know if we need to use
force to crush some of these fellows but
we also need to use a whole lot of other
things which does not include talking to
Pakistan because there is no point
talking getting into a dialogue of the
Deaf where you are going to be misled
what you will have to do is you will
have to create conditions which force
Pakistan into a point where they come
for a dialogue with you you don't have
to go for a dialogue with them and the
conditions for that will have to be
created by you by squeezing them in a
360 way 360 and that condition will
definitely not be created if overcome by
self-loathing we take every opportunity
to rush in and paddle Pakistan for all
their sins of the very very recent past
do not forget for a moment even though
Wing Commander up in London comes back
tomorrow just two days ago Pakistan
tried to enter your country and bomb
your military targets they are
sheltering people who are attacking us
or planning to attack us every day every
time somebody tells you let's talk to
him rank on the Statesman these are the
people that he is actively abetting or
at least turning a blind eye to at the
very least think about that even as we
welcome
Wing Commander I mean I learn back
tomorrow for the time being thank you

Till now the Pakistani's ...",2019-02-28T18:16:29Z,TIMES NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8iG8dYpYVWU/hqdefault.jpg,"viewers for the first time on television
for the first time on television the
video that links banner coat tera camp
to the Jesse Muhammad is out till now
the Pakistanis had been claiming that
the facility in barakat was a madrasah
they had pointed to all sorts of
ancillary evidence in defense of their
claim
but now viewers we can tell you with
certainty that this facility was a
terror camp earlier we had shown you
viewers how we had spoken to the
caretaker of this facility who had
confessed that the facility was run by
Masood Azhar's brother-in-law he said
that he was the driving force behind it
the brother-in-law as we know was the
mastermind of the ic8 one for hijacking
of 1999 now video evidence video
evidence which is on your screens
viewers of training that was undertaken
in this camp is available to us mother
does gopalakrishnan will join me in just
about 30 seconds to explain what you're
seeing on these visuals on your screens
nickelsburg also with us additi also
with us we're all here to bring this
exclusive to you this is the facility
inside visuals for the first time of the
videos that have been handed over to
Pakistan of what goes on inside this
bana court hilltop facility this is no
madrasah
teaching innocent young children the
virtues of Islam this as someone said in
a newsroom is a terror training ground
for suicide bombers I want to bring in I
want to bring in mother does Coppola
Christian mother of this is footage that
has been accessed by Pradeep data a
bureau chief in Jammu and Kashmir he has
been able to pull this out from deep
sources which obviously contributed to
the
Asya that India's handed over to
Pakistan describe what we're seeing
well absolutely Rahula Pradeep has
access this footage has rightly put it
but look at the manner in which this
particular you know footage and it's
absolutely shocking to see the kind of
terror training that happens here for
individuals who are coming they're
running into this gigantic dreaming of
fire and they're jumping right through
that circle on to the other side just
look at the manner in which this is
actually happening it is not you know an
individual by himself these are big
groups of people running across and
jumping into that entire Ring of Fire
now what exactly is happening over here
this is a camp where there is a Doric
Haas training given or the three-month
specialized commando training that is
given to these terrorists and also of
course specialized arms training as well
along with that this process of
indoctrination this process where
clearly of course these individuals are
shown how they need to run right into
the fire at that clearly of course is
part of the training that is being
individual that has been given to these
individuals and look at the number of
people who are gathered around who
clearly are coming around to see the
spectacle the manner in which all of
this is happening these people once they
jump to the ring they come running
across the screen right to the other
side where again they will jump through
that ring of fire and then take a circle
and come right back this is what was
going on as far as Barakat is concerned
and whatever pakistan chooses to say
whatever means it uses to try and deny
that there was actually a terror camp
that was there at that particular
location this proof is absolutely
undeniable rahul it just goes to show
the kind of manner in which there was
indoctrination happening indoctrination
and training of suicide bombers as is
very clearly evident from this visual
that we have over here all very shocking
and it's no surprise really because
Pakistan has been trying to bury this
evidence for very long but unearthed
here once again by times now times now
nails Pakistan again the lies are out
the deceit is for all to see including
those who are today pressing the Indian
government to press for dialogue anyone
has any doubts viewers it's on your
screens the ultimate bala caught proof
is out i want to bring in aditi as well
as nick owns Gurkha internal security
editor first
Nicholas disallowed part of a dossier
that he had accessed some parts of the
dose here but the visuals tell a story
well absolutely Rahul and it is actually
crucial that this kind of video graphic
evidence that zip has accessed from his
sources in that trouble town region of
Jammu and Kashmir qudsi Pakistan is
shared with the International Committee
of nations and I am quite short than the
ambassadors and High Commissioners of
the neighboring countries as well as the
p5 nations and other countries were
called by the Ministry of External
Affairs in New Delhi post the Pulwama
strike and then post when the matters
escalated a bit further post India's
aerial strike on this particular this
very facility in Bala code deep inside
Pakistan beyond the imagination of the
security establishment of Pakistan that
strike took place at the heart of this
facility it this is the kind of video
graphic evidence that is required to be
shared with shared with the entire world
because it is it is not as if the world
is not aware of what Pakistan is doing
and it is only because the world's aware
that there was a unified condemnation
against Pakistan and each and every
civilized nation from Australia to New
Zealand to the United States told
Pakistan that they need to pull back
from the terror activities and they need
to drop their backing for the terrorist
training facilities inside their own
territory but other than the Americans
and other than the Americans and
Russians very few European countries
probably are privy to the kind of terror
facilities an actual terror training
that is going inside the camp so India
has to expose that and that expose has
to be done against Pakistan time and
again on all multilateral forums all
pilot or all platforms that are
available to work bilaterally with these
nations or again whether this is on in
this videotape is part of that dossier I
want to go across to Aditi Aditi you
were reporting earlier today how from
eight districts of Pakistan at least 42
identified suicide bombers were being
trained at this facility just talk us
through what goes on here is very clear
they talk about the kind of training
that is given to them it's not only a
training regarding how to deal with your
bombs but they also are given a
psychological training they're trained
in language how to communicate if they
cross the border what sort of training
they should be given as far as
complete brainwashing is exactly what
happens in this particular video that
has also been accessed now exclusively
by times our Rahul and this becomes part
of their dossier that has been submitted
the doctor also talks about how Jessie
Mohammed not only now but in the past
couple of decades now has been carrying
out these particular training camps the
camps also has very high technology
facilities they have virtual walls they
also have a fire testing Ranger so that
they can be fully equipped in using all
these are all the ak-47 that usually are
provided to all these design attackers
they have they also have a unit
specifically to test bombs and what
style of bombing facilities can be
provided to the new recruits is our that
are the Fijian attackers and also to
mention here all I'm just digressing for
a minute even as we are talking about
this we pretty much this is exclusive
video right now the three service chiefs
have arrived at the Prime Minister's
office along with that home minister
Rajnath Singh and mahadji the wall have
also arrived the very crucial Cabinet
Committee on security meeting - betrayed
by the Prime Minister is going to begin
anytime from now the Government of India
has every detail of what really happens
in the Jessie Mohammed training camp
what really happened in Bala fold all of
this became part of the doors here all
of this came from the Intel inputs that
the government has been working upon and
that's why the government declared that
is a non-military pre-emptive action
taken by the government so after the CCS
we have to see where does the government
and where do our forces really go after
from here Rahul well it's very
interesting mega Prasad that you were
telling us this afternoon and in fact
about a couple of hours ago that India
is not going to rest on this so-called
concession as Pakistan is described it
of returning to us our own Wing
Commander who was in their illegal
custody that India will give Pakistan a
reasonable amount of time to act on
taking out some of these individuals
failing which it might act
how far is India likely to go
absolutely Rahul and let's just
understand at this stage it's important
for all of us to not forget that at the
crux of the situation we are in right
now Rahul is not the skirmish that
happened in the skies yesterday it is
not about one of our mig-21 bison going
down and one of our pilots being
kidnapped by them it is Pulwama it is 40
of our men being martyred in Pulwama and
that is why we are in a situation that
we are in today and for that India had
asked for action on terror camps and
India stands by that even if you are
going to release our wing commander you
have to do it anyways as per the Geneva
Convention you would be forced and bound
to do it so you are doing it it's not a
gesture of peace it's not a favor to
India and that is why I am saying Rahul
than the meeting that is to begin here
at the Prime Minister's residence which
is the CCS the highest security body of
the country post to the skirmish and
post the kidnapping of our Wing
Commander by Pakistan this committee is
going to take some strong decisions
Rowell do expect strong words from India
today do not do not think that we are
going to zero scale down our attack on
Pakistan as far as putting pressure on
Pakistan is concerned we'll continue to
do so because India all that it wants
right now is credible action and
evidence corroborating that action that
would be taken by Pakistan against
terror accounts we have faced problems
we are faced pain because of those care
accounts and that is where our focus is
going to be so that line continues to be
taken and if at all there's going to be
a briefing today you should expect
announcements on these lines Rahul well
may God do stone with us let me also
bring in our guests who are joining us
Maroof Raza consulted with times now is
joining us Maru diamond again Pakistan
specifically to be precise Imran Khan
has said give us the proof show us the
proof and we will act this is the proof
we've managed to access this is going to
be part of the dossier to be sent to
Pakistan it is this going to be enough
to ensure that Pakistan acts or are we
just fooling ourselves I think we are
being
I think they're being a bit delusional
because proof like this and much more
has been given to Pakistan over the last
several decades I I want to recall a
short conversation I had with the former
cab SEC and then ambassador to the u.s.
mr. Naresh Chandra and he said to me
years ago that we have given even to the
American dreams and reams of evidence
but they have refused to act against
Pakistan please understand it's not now
but at least for the last decade and a
half America had been using Tomahawk
missiles to accurately target Taliban
and al-qaeda camps in Afghanistan
because they insisted they had been
pointed information Obama's foreign
policy was often known to be the drone
foreign policy again hitting targets
within Pakistan based on very specific
information which politicians in
Pakistan as Akbar ahima that has
admitted in his book the drone and the
Thistle and the drone to say that yes
they are there but for peace saving
please don't make it so public because
we've got to live with our people so a
fact of the matter is this evidence and
much more is already available with the
Americans and others because of the
accurate satellite information and I'm
sure if we talk of a strategic
partnership with the US it's either
being supplied to us or we've not
received it but received assurances so
the fact is the world knows but Imran
Khan repeating the same lie again and
again actionable intelligence knows
however what seems to have changed this
time around Maru fine let me bring in
they look the richer as well a former
bureaucrat and author who's joining us
on the show as well people they look the
way show do you think this time around
what has changed is the fact that India
is not the same India of 1999 that India
stands has changed Pakistan now has
conceded that this is a very different
India and this time around if a dossier
comes draws here after dossier cannot be
overlooked let's not forget about the
global isolation either
[Music]
you're very right this is a very
different India the very fact that those
airstrikes were done showed how much
India has changed and how different
India was because you went right into
Pakistan to hit Pakistan where it hurt
the terrorists we didn't we sort of
broke the shackles of restraint that we
had put on ourselves all these decades
so it's a very different India
you know at that I think the message is
gone across to Pakistan then you cannot
and I hope they kept the message that
you cannot fool around with terrorism on
in with India again because rightly that
India will react again and again and
again and this time around the reactions
are swifter and they are sterner than
ever before do stay on with us well
earlier today remember times now track
down one of the survivors of the Indian
air strikes in Bala called more proof
which has now mounted he too has
confirmed that the jesh terror camp

recovered Pakistan once again exposed
they were trying to actually instigate a
war with India under this big cloak of
peace they were trying to attack us with
a fully loaded f-16 carrying compatible
munitions this is the proof it's dead-on
times now this is the bit of a munition
which has come with the American fitted
f16 jets and this will get Pakistan into
a lot of trouble because Pakistan was
not supposed to use under the end-users
agreement with the United States us
weaponry against India because India is
an ally of the United States and they
have gone ahead and they have carried
out all of this in a desperate attempt
to try and target our military
facilities now this f-16 fired Amran
missile would have caused untold damage
but the f16 was intercepted it was
intercepted and they had to go back one
of them was also dropped by Wing
Commander have been under which incurred
the wrath of Pakistan as you know and
there you can see that's the missile
system and I'm going to bring Vivek nine
into this we make talk us through this
yes Rahul if you can hear me let me just
say what you're seeing on your screen
the right over there is a AI m120 Amran
missile now this is on the screen right
now this missile is used almost
exclusively on f-16 this of course is a
b v ra m or beyond the visual range
guided missile you do not need the pilot
did not see the target actually
he just needs a guidance from his helmet
mounted piece and then he can actually
shoot the missile that the body that he
wants to shoot out fortunately the brave
Indian soldier who was or these or the
office
was flying that mig-21 happened to hit
the Pakistani f-16 and bring down that
plane that plane since it was flying at
supersonic speed happened to land in
Pakistani airspace we did see in dint of
planes and soldiers on ground did see
that airplane land in Pakistani
territory the pilot bailed out of course
but some of the pictures which were
brought out by Pakistanis themselves
they were trying to say that a mig-21
has been brought down but actually it
was an f-16 and a clear evidence is
Pakistan general putting out some of
these pictures on social media there are
clear evidence is the missile which is
clear carried as I said almost
exclusively yes a fire-and-forget
munition is Vivek - put it for us well
viewers the proof is mounting against
Pakistan and I told you when we will
return from our break the commercial
break we would now begin the process of
exposing Pakistan to the core now
Pakistan has been telling us that what
India struck in balla Court was not was
not a terror training facility our
director will just remove these visuals
and we will go to the next story now
because this is the times now exclusive
this is a massive story viewers that
needs to be told
the Baloch or terror link is out and
fakest on can't deny this it's been
confirmed and confessed to by whom by
none other than the individual who was
tasked with running this facility that's
right times now was able to contact the
caretaker of this particular
installation which as it turns out is
directly controlled by the Jesse
Mohammed and not some school madrasah
for children that Pakistan has been
claiming in fact the caretaker tells us
that there were more than 300
individuals or students at this facility
at any given time so India is clear
instead a massive number of casualties
would have been inflicted by their
surgical strike on Barack or Tara camp
is presumably right now listen to this
conversation we've had with the
caretaker massive expose a viewers this
is the first confirmed link off banner
coat to the jetty Mohammed this is what
India handed over to Pakistan in the

Osmel confesses conceits magna very
important three big takeaways coming
from that you as the reason why this
exclusive is so very important to remind
our viewers what happened right after
the Bala code strike there was major
general awesome gurus the Pakistani army
spokesperson he came out and said there
was no infrastructure which got hit that
there were no casualties he also said
that Indian Jets and released the
payload in haste while escaping that
they were essentially downloading
offloading this payload which he says
essentially bombs which were dropped
because it was in haste and it returned
immediately also we have Terry K himself
a spokesperson who on the floor of the
Pakistani Parliament IRA home will
remember said that the Indian media
cooked up stories for the air forces
retreat so the big takeaways which then
appear first that yes indeed there was
what this manageable is calling a mother
say in Bala code essentially a mother
saw of terror training he do and this is
a vindication of what the Indian side
has always maintained that they were as
many as 300 people terrorists who may
have been killed he too has said yes
there were over 300 people who were
there in this terror camp now well all
of that now tumbling out of the closet
in fact Vivek the nine also there with
us our executive editor Vivek yes Rahul
this is a clear evidence which Pakistan
cannot ever ever deny all through the
attack Pakistan said that the Indian Air
Force was in a desperate situation and
happened in its desperation dumped its
munitions all over on on a barren hill
the casualties were only a few trees and
a crow well nothing could be farther
from true we spoke with the manager of
the man who runs this madrasa the first
person to dial actually let me put it on
record was from our input des Akash
Goswami who tried to get in touch with
the madrasah manager the madrasah
manager saw an Indian number and refused
to pick up and that's why we asked Donna
Chacon
our London correspondent to dial
vanishes called was very detailed he got
took this man into confidence and spoke
to him in detail about what happened

officials have said that India believes
that Pakistan's air intrusion was an

the Indian Air Force pilot was ill

this is something that times our date
put out yesterday the fact that they
were targeting at least or the brigade
headquarters on the Indian side and also
the fact that the pilot is the pilot
Wing Commander Worth man has been badly
treated we don't have to believe we
actually know because we've seen the
videos where he has been beaten up and
the videos show very clearly how badly
he was beaten up before some other
people took him away so in both cases
you're absolutely right
yes a wing commander what the man was
badly beaten up and that the evidence is
there for everybody to see and also the
fact that Pakistan was actually
attacking Indian military installations
is also very clear the Emir has also
said that very clearly that while India
went went across Pakistan to strike at
terror targets in this case the
Pakistani Air Force there are no terror
targets here you see so they had to
attack and they attacked military
targets which is very very reprehensible
it's a way of escalating well the

sort of understand why we chose the
Mirage to carry out these operations
when we also have other variants of
aircrafts the particular Mirage that
we've had Mirage 2000 I which is the
highly upgraded one is far superior to
the Mirage that was used to do pinpoint
targeting of targets on the during the
Kargil conflict particularly at the
Luling Tiger Hill and various other
important objectives so the Mirage has a
proven capability of flying below radar
hitting at targets at pinpoint precision
and it can also carry nuclear
wherewithal if required the second thing
is it has long-range ability to identify
target and fire at targets without
getting close enough to the target which
you called beyond visual range targeting
and the third and most important
capability that the Mirage has that it
is a tried and trusted favorite of the
Indian Air Force which has been around
for at least three decades but highly
upgraded ones that we have today so
therefore it was expected that we would
not be doing the usual surgical strike
that we have done in the past because
unlike the Pakistan Army in all their
military operations since 1947 they
followed the same plot the same
predictable pattern and the same set of
lies follow we know what our options are
I have said all along that the military
is very capable it has various plans in
place and the intention is to convey a
message to Pakistan that we can hit you
at a place in time of your choosing you
want to scale it up we have the capacity
you want to keep quiet about
so be it but it's once again exposed a
very glaring lacunae in Pakistan or a
very glaring weakness and that is their
air defense capability the Americans
exposed that but unlike the Americans
every time our troops have taken over
operations we have shown our ability to
achieve hundred percent success because
we practice so much in peace so that we
don't bleed in war this is very
classically an example of practice to
perfection which has been put on to
place and ground and I think the Cabinet
Committee is now taking stock of the
situation but very important very
important is to give out the footage in
the public domain and humiliate the
Pakistan Army because you can only do
away with terror mechanisms in Pakistan
if the Pakistan Army is suitably
humiliated in the eyes of its people
they have built up a reputation of being
demigods and the guardians of the state
of Pakistan they're neither demigods
neither guardians and they must realize
that there is a capacity in the
neighborhood which can be exercised if
the political will exist and I think my
compliments with the Prime Minister and
his team for exercising the political
will we were offered a similar option by
the Air Force after the 26/11 attacks
and whatever the political opposition
now says is nonsense this is recorded
the x8 chief at that time has gone on
record to say that we could have hit
them in the next 48 hours and we got the
political go-ahead first time we got the

in don davara in Jessel mayor and this
is an oil india well with supplies gas

also our well had leaked in this area
for more than 10 days and that's the
information that's coming in i believe
that we already have a arvind on the

that's right these are the exclusive

telling us that officials have called in
the ONGC officials to control this and
this leak there in this gas well there
and this kind of incident had to happen
earlier also as you have already told
that in 2017 there was an well which
will leak for more than ten days but now
oil india what we've been told is
putting efforts on war footing to
control this leak because the nearby

spread then obviously there would be
some danger to their lives and
properties also so efforts are on onward
footing to control this leakage but this
has been going on for last two days they
are in van de valor in Jeselnik well
before I let you go out with just one
quick question with you half the
residents of the nearby areas evacuated
so far there is no evacuation because
the residents are a few kilometers away
from this well but obviously the local
people are fearing that if it is spreads
and there can be some danger but what
officials are maintaining that there is
no danger as well as right now to these
villages nearby because they are at a
few kilometers distance so obviously
they are doing their best to control
this well leakage there but this has
been going for last two days and you can
clearly see in the visual

slightest dissent but will keep on
giving sermons to India now why we are
saying this because former eyesight
chief general Asad Durrani has been
found guilty of violating the military
code in his co-authored book the spy
chronicles were being told that Pakistan
has stopped his pension and other post
retirement benefits following this
shrinkage all three are national affairs
editor joining us on the broadcast more
on this option joy this is the face of
now Pakistan that Imran Khan keeps
talking about going to tell you the
truth
this is Pakistan at its desperate was
because not only is it hitting out at
India and also hanussen and Iran but as
its own people a left-hand general Assad
to Ronnie was a very is one of their own
he was a DGM I that his Director General
in a military intelligence and then he
was head of the ISI and after being head
of the ISI he also did enormous amounts
of work for the Pakistan Army and for
the Pakistan government he is a very
respected commentator and so on now
today is be our general kapoor has said
that he will be stripped of all his
honours he will be deprived of his
pension simply because he co-wrote the
book spy chronicles with mr. Doolin now
the important point is that if general
Durrani has been such a terrible man why
has Pakistan been given him so much time
and space all of or we for years and
years it's only now that they realize
that yes he's written a book and so on
yeah general Durrani it has to be said
is a highly respected commentator he has
written several monographs and books he
was a head of the ISI at a certain time
so he is part of the Pakistan
establishment now it appears that
Pakistan apart from anything out in just
anybody outside is also hitting out it's
its own people what kind of government
is this and what kind of organization
would that would actually do that yeah
and that's the reason why we are saying
stranger that perhaps Pakistan cannot
tolerate dissent and that's the reason
why it is taking this kind of an action
against the former chief now
interestingly in this book you know he
has also touched upon issues around
terrorism Mumbai attack Kashmir and
those are the points perhaps that have
hurt Pakistan the most of course at
least general Durrani has had the
ability to be honest and that honesty
that he has displayed over the years is
actually now hurting him and that is the
unfortunate part because Pakistan for
all is talk about democracy it does not
have the democratic values that you
would expect a democratic country to
have that is really a problem the
elections are are actually managed in a
real sense someone sitting in Rawalpindi
decides that this time we want five
years from this man and this man should
sit in Islamabad and that is precisely
why bran Khan is Prime Minister and not
anybody else
because the because the military and the
eyes had decided that Imran would be
their man for the next five years and
this is the price that Imran Khan is
having to pay all right thank you very

viewers if anyone had a doubt if anyone
had a doubt that India does not intend
that this government does not intend to
punish Pakistan for its treachery those
doubts would have been removed today as
an Indian who puts the interests of this
country first I am now in no doubt about
the fact that Pakistan is going to feel
terribly disadvantaged beginning this
very moment because in an unprecedented
almost surgical strike like action on
Pakistan psychology and most importantly
on the lives of its people who condone
acts of terror this government the Modi
government has decided to block the flow
of waters to Pakistan decided to stop
India share of water which used to flow
to Pakistan the government had said that
it will divert water from Eastern rivers
and supplied to Indians in the state of
Jammu and Kashmir in the state of Punjab
and parts of Haryana now viewers let me
tell you since 1960
since this water treaty was signed there
have been many provocations from
Pakistan just five years later there was
a war six and a half years later there
was another one between that and Kargil
there were numerous provocations
and following Cargill there have been
some grievious terror strikes all funded
and fueled by Pakistan's deep state but
no government has thought it necessary
to choke Pakistan's water supply and hit
it where it hurts the most
now here are some hard facts which will
explain to you what is going on there is
the sharp or candy dam the status of
this dam right now is that an agreement
to resume work began in September 18 you
can see those pictures it was lying
completely abandoned for years all
together why God alone knows why we have
no answers except perhaps because there
was a lack of intent that work has begun
at a very fast pace so much so that
today we can actually extract water and
divert it away from Pakistan the subtle
edge biast link in Punjab the Punjab
government is still preparing a
feasibility report and then the pooch
Dam project it's been cleared by the
Ministry of Water Resources and let me
tell you viewers that Pakistan is
beginning to feel the pressure a third
of Pakistan's 192 million population is
dependent on the Indus waters the next
graphic that we put up will explain that
to you
ninety-five percent of Pakistan's
irrigated land is in this Indus River
Basin viewers and the diverted water
could help 600 million Indians facing
water shortage I want to bring in as we
look at some of these graphics which
puts this entire story into context
viewers I want to bring in internal
security editor Nicole Scott nikunj this
is a big statement of intent perhaps the
biggest psychological blow that India
could deliver on Pakistan
massive massive step taken by the
government not only in the display of
intent this is a display of intent it's
all right you know for the optics but
there are two three very crucial reasons
why this step is important number one I
have been to that particular point from
where India's waters travel into
Pakistan it's huge quantity of water
flowing into path while traveling into
Pakistan now the fact is that both India
and Pakistan are waters starved
countries our hinterland continuously
suffer the suffers from the lack of
water or particularly our irrigation
suffers in such a scenario it is
criminal it is criminal for that what we
have done in terms of not building the
proper infrastructure in the last six
decades to at least completely consume
our share of waters that were allotted
to us number two it takes that if the
legitimacy machine of legitimacy from
Pakistan that in the international
community a community is mined is there
that despite everything Pakistan is a
member of the international community
and we continue to do business with it
at it as if it is business as usual
despite all kinds of terror strikes this
shows that India is not ready to take an
approach of business as usual with
Pakistan anymore number three and that's
probably the most crucial point and
entire Pakistani effort whenever their
teams come to Indian side for this
so-called joint inspections is only to
make a big song and dance about the
entire project and then complain
internationally that India is over
exploiting the resources and trying to
deprive Pakistan of its legitimate share
all that Sherrod and tamasha would stop
from here on once the government of
India decided to bar those visiting
teams also water diplomacy globally
world over is a very important and key
component between the nations who share
water resources and India for the first
time in its history has decided to use
that leverage visa with Pakistan I think
a very important significant step so
what is the difference in the DNA
between this government and the others
who did not ever contemplate this step
even though there was 26 11 which was
and I don't mean to equate terror
attacks but was also a deep inflicted
wound on India tell me well I hold the
fact of the matter is that this clearly
shows that Modi
has not not only has got the
determination to go ahead but is ready
to is willing to take international
criticism if any comes its way it has
that kind of diplomatic muscle behind it
it has that kind of diplomatic push
behind it that it can sustain any kind
of international criticism if it comes
it way of saying that you know look here
this is a multilateral he brokered TT s
World Bank and food Zealand where
important stakeholders and you can't
take a unilateral decision and that is
probably my own senses in the pearl the
governments have not wanted to sort of
fall for fall flu of all of the
international community and that is why
they probably then contemplate and act
on such a step that will come because
unlike what the opposition constantly
tells us this government has built
diplomatic capital for itself which it
is today expending in India's interest
and secondly most importantly nickens we
forget that this government has a
majority status it is not compromised
because it is a coalition it will not be
held back by individuals or MPs who are
in the left who are in other political
outfits who even today can't bring
themselves viewers to name Pakistan that
is the advantage of a government that
has political muscle on the back of
numeric strength absolute majority now I
want to open this out and ask some basic
questions Nikhil stay on with me I'll
come back to you in just a few moments
but I just want to open this out can
there now be any doubt that Modi intends
on punishing Pakistan for its treachery
can there be any doubt when mr. Modi in
2016 came out and says water and blood
cannot flow together he meant every word
and he waited and Pakistan has provided
an opportunity and I want to ask mr.
Srivastava of the Left parties vix
awastha tell me
we do now still doubt we do doubt this
government's intent see Raul it's a
government of jameelah's and Norton key
five years there were so many attacks
and the Prime Minister was sleeping I
asked you I asked you a question see you
can you can be disrespectful today you
can you can today take on the government
you're within your rights to do that but
let's find found your criticism on some
hard facts right there was a surgical
strike
you saw the aftermath of that surgical
strike we have taken action by turning a
large number of collaborators of
Pakistan allies of Pakistan on the
international community against it so it
has to go with a begging bowl today to a
client like China which is reduce
Pakistani see see this way anyway great
and we were fighting for Kashmir and the
United Nations we were you're anywhere
there on a stronger foothold always this
government did not act for five years if
it has the guns do you know what it
takes to go against some international
media government stop the trade with
Pakistan ask them this question it is
never stopped at a MF n because
capitalists reverse their duties have
been raised by 200 to 300 percent of
certain board reading
why are you trading when there is an
attack on you that why are these
businessmen trading the tree mister
mister vivix device for all his bluster
Rahul if I can come in you know a couple
of points I Robot this mr. awake who was
supporting the government during the
26/11 no one second
he gave you two please please you know
have this decency for all your bluster
two points you are the same party wanted
to have blood for the absolute you know
the actions now listen miss do we accept
that we are at war
I believe we are I believe then one
second okay Pakistan's idea of death by
a thousand cuts is nothing else but war
now if we are at war yeah this is a
first good step but the point is that
you are being congratulated on Twitter
with aging this stand because I am being
told in my ear right now what you're
saying what you're saying is being
applauded but we have to but there is
something after this step can any
Pakistan inspection team come across no
it can't
for some days welcoming yes in reverb we
allow must be allowed because the attack
hadn't taken place yes so we demonstrate
a rework that we are not a person we are
not a rose water
we are not Pakistan but push comes to
shove sir we know how to hit back well
let me bring in dr. pastor adductor para
the left says this is tokenism this is
symbolism it's not substance would you
like to respond today
very respectfully to everywhere on the
pattern we all are Indians at the end of
the day what is worse days after having
lost 45 of her Jevons if strong strong
there are some Indians today who are
telling us that we should go back to
talking to terrorists that we should
engage I'm sorry and I drawing this
analogy needs to be won but plays like
them but please you are taking the moral
high roads not play and I congratulate
you for doing that but let's not ignore
that there are some Indians today I
believe 150 inside our beliefs although
there are some who are taking out a car
census in magazines you see I don't like
to personalize this because I know
constantly there is a lobby that
constantly targets times now I will not
dignify this terrible journalism by
taking the name of that publication but
there is a publication that has today
taken the caste census of those who were
martyred in Pulwama there are those who
say that there is no export of terror
from Pakistan it's all homegrown and
that party is the Congress party there
are others who say that the person who
carried out the suicide attack is
because he was tortured alleged
terrorists he was he was an alleged
terrorist who was tortured by India's
armed forces look at the alibis that are
being made today for Pakistan and when
the government takes a decision which is
not sending nukes irresponsibly across
the border but exercising what is well
within its own rights
it is dismissed as a symbolic gesture
without substance
now I am only asking you dr. Potter to
respond to that point tell these people
why you believe this is substantive
now in fact that was well explained by
your channel and the reporter as well
first and foremost I believe and very
solemnly belief that when the country as
a union has taken a decision as
unprecedented as this the first thing we
should do is applaud it the first thing
we should do is rather than saying that
this is rather than providing ammunition
to Pakistan
I'm not taking any need to stand and
guess what he was the most disadvantaged
the most disadvantaged treaty the most
disadvantaged treaty he worked out with
room with Pakistan may I tell you why I
wanted to be abrogated I am so happy
that by this action Punjab will be
punished bajwa spender Punjab will be
punished Masood Azhar's Punjab will be
punished
Hafiz sites Punjab will be punished and
Punjab has appropriated all the waters
of the Sindh if you look at the Indus
River
it is like an mala it is like an Allah
already secondly what did Jinnah say
editor sir you remember his famous
speech he said that we have different
different language different customs
different culture different different
set of heroes and by all canons of
nation state we deserve to be a separate
nation mr. Jinnah here is the here is
the reality you are not different
you are not at all different the
secondly because you you can religions
can be religions are born and they they
they die but reverse don't reverse that
the you know we we share reverse we
share evil lid third is that tell me I
mean should we quench it jihadism the
thirst of jihadism with with water
fourthly what did Babu remove t say
yesterday she said
that we are condemned we are to you know
[Applause]
let me answer that question excuse me
can you give me 30 seconds the BJP
walked out of that coalition one second
no sir no sir
it was upholding the government was
upholding the mandate of the people of
Jammu they also know no one second one
second in your sir can you please stop
heckling
you want an answer it's been given if
you want to obstruct that cell you take
over the show so I'm I'm saying it very
very clearly we always see the state of
Jammu and Kashmir only through the lens
of a few districts in Kashmir we don't
view it as a whole state of Jammu
Kashmir and Ladakh the people of Jammu
deserve a government as much as those in
Kashmir by the way most of those in
Kashmir are not even thankful the same
PDP the same National Conference boycott
elections and I want to bring them in I
want to bring them in today I want to
ask them straight off the question and I
want to begin with Nishant Verma and I
shan't Verma instead of calling the
decision a stunt hasn't the time come
for the opposition to begin to back the
Union government at a very very trying
time I was amused when you were
congratulating Samba patre and BJP for
something that they have not even done I
don't understand whether you are sitting
in June 2016 or February 2019 June 2016

extra mile
I will walk an extra mile let me be the
devil's advocate today supposedly
supposedly what mr. Gadkari has said and
what the Indian government has said does
not in fact do a great amount of harm to
Pakistan despite that if the Indian
government announces something the first
duty of all Indians is to stand by the
government's decision and to say that is
going to suffer
we have others over here Indian
government Indian government won't be
able to do anything against Pakistan
these are basically the entire set of
perilous warned here the total
abrogation on the ominous warning treaty

further some big breaking news at the
top of the bulletin Nitin Gadkari had
made a massive announcement this in
retaliation to the Palama attack he sent
out a tweet saying that under the
leadership of Prime Minister Modi as
government has decided to stop our share
of water which used to flow to focus on
we will divert the water from Eastern
rivers and supplied to our people in
Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab but that's
the big breaking news that we are
getting for you remember one of the ways
of retaliating has been recommended by
the experts should be the shutting off
of the Indus tap and there is now intent
being shown by the NDA government to do
just that this is going to hint the
Pakistani establishment hard if their
water supply gets affected let's go
across to other team other team what are
you picking up from the government house
as soon as this likely to happen well
this is a big development coming in from
the Government of India remember the
issue of what the sharing between India
and Pakistan has been an issue that has
cropped up on the various instances in
fact that the last time also during the
patent code attack and during the
surgical strike as well there was a lot
of clamor that was growing that India
should are closed its waters that are
flowing through Pakistan and now
officially missing Guthrie who's also
the Water Resources Minister has said
that in consultation with the Prime
Minister of India the government has now
decided to stop its share of water that
used to flow to Pakistan and is now
decided that that water will notice
oddity our editor-in-chief now Shiv
Shankar also joins us Rahul more the
government shown the intent to strike
Pakistan and make it hold where it hurts
the most absolutely this is a massive
massive move it's in line with the
national sentiment here to boycott
Pakistan every which way and this step
viewers is a step that has been taken to
signal India's intent
it's the biggest strike against Pakistan
thus far by the Modi government and it
now appears that India is very very
serious about sending a clear message to
Pakistan that it means
business that it is going to make
Pakistan accountable for the actions in
pol Verma it comes moments after Imran
Khan once again struck a very very
strident tone suggesting that India was
misleading the international community
over allegations that Pakistan supported
the pull Verma attack but this
particular step where Nitin Gadkari has
come out and in no uncertain terms
viewers said under the leadership of
Honorable Prime Minister shimmer in the
Modi ji our government has decided to
stop our share of water which used to
flow to Pakistan we will divert water
from Eastern rivers and supply to our
people in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab
how much of that water can actually be
diverted is a matter of debate
India does have some capacity but it
cannot completely stop the flow of water
now this will be seen by Pakistan is a
dramatic escalation as a dramatic
expeller escalation by India it will be
seen also by Pakistan as a clear sign
that India will no longer stand by and
watch as Pakistan repeats the games that
it has been playing we will be bringing
in Nick Owens Clark in just a few
moments on this we will also be going
straight across to Maroof Raza a
strategic affairs analyst we will be
talking to a large number of experts to
make sense of this but this is by far
the biggest statement of intent now let
me give you a little bit of background
on this the Indus Water Treaty is often
described as the world's most generous
water treaty viewers between any two
nations leave alone between two nations
in conflict why because it is lopsided
in favor of Pakistan India gets just
nineteen point four eight percent of the
total in the system waters is the
world's only inter-country water
agreement embodying the doctrine of
restricted sovereignty
which compels the upstream nation to
forgo major river uses for the benefit
of downstream State and many people have
been saying for a very long time that we
must scrap this lopsided treaty so Shan
serene also joins the broadcast so Shan
serene how do you see this look the
point is that the Eastern rivers in any
case if the water was continuing to flow
into Pakistan that was our mistake and
if we are stopping whatever little is
the water is trickling into Pakistan
then there's a lot to be said for it but
it doesn't really hold every in this
waters treaty and in this water sweetie
pretty much stays intact so I think this
is a bit of grandstanding if if from
whatever understood right now this
correct because mr. serene as a
statement of intent I think it's quite a
dramatic one it's quite a demanding one
because Rahul Pakistani insecure no
Bravo as a statement of intent this has
been declared by the prime minister
himself you know at the hustings are
using the Punjab elections so there is
nothing new in this statement ready if
the only new factor would have been if
the government had draw allowances
intentions of either suspending or
walking out off or reviewing may be a
step at a time
suchan serene let's not throw all
caution to the winds
escalation there's much to be said for
incremental escalation also otherwise
otherwise Suzanne serene there is
nothing really to fall back on there are
no aces there are no aces then left with
India to table
stay on with me I also want to bring in
my roof rosamma roofer coincidentally we
were having this conversation this
afternoon when we were going over some
of the steps that India could take to
signal its intent yeah
actually both UN sushant have very valid
points one is that any messaging that
has to go to Pakistan should not be all
nothing it can be graduated and it can
be brought to bear systematically I have
Pakistan response accordingly also but
while Suzanne serine has rightly said
that the three bottom rivers of the
illness waters system that is Indus
Jhelum Chenab the complete water flow
accepts some limited water flow is
allowed to us where is the other three
Ravi biast a pledge we can do as we
please with projects so technically we
are doing what we have been allowed to
do but we haven't done effectively all
these years but this is the
psychological impact of such an
initiative because the waters issues
since independence has been a very sore
point with Pakistan more recently you
had the likes of happy faith who've gone
on record to say that if they stop and
works to that effect if they stop the
flow of our waters then they'll have to
pay in blood which means that water is a
very sensitive issue particularly in
Punjab in Pakistan and also waters in
case of Pakistan is now being
channelized by China very aggressively
in the Indus in the peop region and
gilgit-baltistan where China has
initiated for victims because in
anything Pakistan has Pakistan has
always gone to the International Court
of Justice to try and put India and show
India and war light even when we have
decided to use waters the members that
we were allowed to do so I think you
know here is a very strong message to
Pakistan that you can go where you want
but we will use what we want and if you
don't fall in line we will abandon the
treaty well of course we will look into
whether this will be efficacious enough
but the fact of the matter is that a
statement a very firm statement of
intent has gone out to any cons no one
can deny this this is perhaps the
beginning of a slew of measures that
India is going to be taking to punish
Pakistan's adventurism Rahul I have
physically seen this spot from
this water actually travels into
Pakistan and it is actually not correct
to say that India does not have the
entire infrastructure the infrastructure
is in place we have the capacity and the
capability driver but not probably not
all of the water that flows additionally
into Pakistan remember this is
additional water we are entitled to draw
a certain quantity of water under the
treaty which we are not fully exploiting
at this stage so I would say that with
this we will also put an extra
additional push to the infrastructure
that has been lying in limbo all this
file and to the benefit of our people
and why not absolutely why not that's
the fundamental question Colonel
Harrison also joins this broadcast
Colonel Harrison big big statement of
intent by Prime Minister Modi perhaps
the most significant step the first one
was of course the vigil of the MFN and I
just want to come straight out to you
India has decided to hold back its share
of the Indus waters the three rivers
that flow into Pakistan that is
induction evangeline now as the liquid
rightly pointed out that they know the
excess of water also going there we may
not have the wherewithal and the
complete wherewithal the in order to
divert the entire water at the moment
but it is not a technologically
impossible feat it may take some time
but the intent is very very important
and remember this was this whole water
sharing business was done by the machine
machine nations of you know the colonial
powers and you know who were supplanted
by America as well Canora sent blood and
water cannot flow together this is what
the prime minister said in 2016 internal
meeting on the IWT which is the Indus
Water tribunal and it appears that he is
now very very serious about sending that
particular message blood and water
cannot flow together talks and terror
cannot go together blood and water
cannot flow together that's that's
really the linkage that is being drawn
he
and we can say that this will actually
have a massive impact general Gd Bakshi
also here with me the Kabul River
originates in Afghanistan also we know
that there are many rivers that come
through there's the Kabul River that
comes in from Afghanistan which Pakistan
is wholly dependent on and the Indus
waters which Pakistan is wholly
dependent on and this is one strike on
the Indus it-- general absolutely Rahul
the fact of the matter is this is where
is the terms of the SS water treaty the
waters of the eastern rivers were
allocated to it yeah we have been
letting them flow into Pakistan for the
bloody driver reason yes and all that we
we have not even violated the terms of
the treaty we are well within our rights
as for the treaty to take recourse to
all the waters of the eastern Devils
they belong to it yeah and I think we
have just about given that concrete ship
it should have done long long long ago
well in March 2017 India approved six
hydro projects on the river Indus and
the Chenab yes there is a small point
here also the fact is that when you call
the Pakistan's inspection teams during
those you know bilateral water diplomacy
meets it gives a kind of legitimacy to
Pakistan and Pakistan so you know
overall standing in the International
Committee of nations with this step you
can completely ban or completely bar the
entry of any Pakistani water inspecting
teams which gives them needlessly vais
into projects and what in the past they
have been trying to do is always put a
spoke in the developmental works being
initiated for the welfare of people and
Jammu and Kashmir so it's it this is a
welcome step in barring those schemes
which are which we are coming here and
literally only created well let me tell
you Hina dance let me tell you
absolutely let me tell you that the
Prime Minister in 2016 had said that
blood and water can't flow together
after which NoCs were given to at least
six projects
nickens six projects they were
fast-tracked they had been stalled for
decades altogether God lono
why and after that between September
2016 and March 2017 India approved these
six hydroelectric projects on the river
Indus in China so by doing so you create
dams check dams reservoirs with which
you can then begin to divert the waters
right now the capacity is not as great
but Pakistan will begin to feel the
pinch viewers it's not as if it's not
going to have an impact at all on the
ground Marouf psychologically as well as
physiological II this will begin to hurt
agriculture the second largest sector of
the Pakistani economy and most of the
agriculture takes place in Punjab
solutely Rao you know let me bring out a
few things one is that Pakistan claims
to be a water starved country but really
the reality is that it gets an abundance
of water but it's a country which
mismanages the water flow so in all of
punjab the waters of the Indus and
systems get completely drowned out and
Sindh gets a little trickle and the
blame goes to India likewise please
understand that Pakistan's intention is
not to allow India to make any dams even
within the waters that we are allowed
because that will generate electricity
that will improve the lot of the Kashmir
ease and the level of disillusionment in
Kashmir will then go down and make
Pakistan's case weaker when it tries to
woo the Kashmir is to say India is doing
nothing for you so we have been decent
by many halves by allowing them to get
away with this nonsense
having said that nineteen point four
point eight percent of the total waters
were allocated to us under the treaty
between narrow and a Yukon of September
1960 Pakistan was allocated eighty point
five two percent so by now claiming at
least the nineteen point four two
percent we are going to be able to
achieve a lot lot in terms Union PLO
minister Maru just give me 30 seconds
Union PMO Minister Dr Jitendra Singh
joins this broadcast dr. Jitendra Singh
massive massive step
by the Modi government first you remove
the layers of security against Indian
nationals then you have decided to
revoke the MFN status and now the
biggest step we are all incidentally
both these rivers which which find
reference in the city girl green street
yes now the eastern river and and ugh
would you which also happens to be a
tributary of river are we yeah are
actually benefiting the model districts
of Jammu Kashmir and Punjab incidentally
happen to be part of my constituency
namely particularly district Kokua
and what was happening is to give you a
chronology it's a strange irony the the
entire water from River Ravi because in
under the Indus Water Treaty we had
three rivers which fell in India share
the three others which fell into
Pakistan so the Pakistan called Jhelum
Chenab and since India got ravi sattva
Jia said Ravi was the biggest river that
came to our share now it's also be a
question mark on the earlier governments
why they were so callous about it ever
since the in this water treaty attire
virtually water from River Ravi was
flowing into Pakistan then West Pakistan
somewhere near mother port which happens
to be the border town between Devon
Kashmir and Punjab and a dam was
conceived way back in 1970s so for 40
years the shop or container which finds
reference in she regarded any street and
it was primarily with the impersonal
intervention of Prime Minister Narendra
Modi and we had been following it up for
years and years even in the earlier
governments but it could make a headway
so this is a joint project which is
hunted by the central government and the
beneficiary is going to be the Couture
district primarily of Jammu and
Kashmir's they could ask for district on
the other side bordering Punjab entire
water was flowing in the absence of the
dam and nobody cared to move this
forward so it is private so Modi's
intervention that they work on this dam
has started on the only Punjab side of
the NK Punjab border it will be complete
in three years so that is one aspect of
the entire water which was inadvertently
flowing into Pakistan
then we held back the second river would
you JHS has been spirit happens to be a
tributary of Ravi now here a dam has
been conceived to be constructed but the
the utilization capacity or the
utilization requirement of distinct / -
of Jammu and Kashmir which happens to be
the border district is just about
one-third or little more than that of
the total amount of water which is about
750 MCM which is going to be available
after the construction of this dam so
the manner in which the DPR and the
earlier project was planned would have
allowed almost 2/3 of water again
flowing into Pakistan now which is also
a tributary of river so I think this is
a very pragmatic decision which was
taken at a meeting which was recently
held city category was there the border
of Jammu and Kashmir was there I also
happen to be there and now canal system
would be put in place so that the
surplus water which is not of
utilization to the border districts of
Jammu and Kashmir along patois
would then be put into this canal system
so that it can benefit Punjab Haryana
maybe even Rajasthan instead of allowing
it to flow it to Pakistan so I think
this is a huge huge course correction
besides of course as you said it has
political connotations it has technical
Corrections and it will also put a
question mark on the earlier
government's
why I mean at the drop of hat you would
have seen the UPA leaders saying that
Pakistan copani ro2 etc etc without
realizing camera from share cup on TV
was throwing into Pakistan in Prime
Minister Modi had said that blood and
water can't flow together well today we
have seen the political intent to do

The government has said that ...,2019-02-21T15:14:39Z,TIMES NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k8O6h5jaRx4/hqdefault.jpg,"an exclusive exclusive here for for our
viewers détendre singh MOS in the PMO
has just spoken two times now this is
his first reaction after this move was
announced we'll play it right away that
this is a correction of a long-standing
and Emily and I think this will be
interesting for media friends to also
investigate why this could not happen
all these years the Indus Water Treaty
happens on the 1960 the two dams the two
rivers which find mentioned in mr.
Guthrie's tweet happened to be part of
my constituency and the of the two dams
which find mentioned in mr. category
sweet sour candy was conceived so very
1970s
now imagine 40 years have gone by and
the earlier governments did not find it
important enough to be pushed forward
and though this was a this was a joint
project of Bacchus Punjab and one kiss
me to be funded by the center and in the
absence of this project the entire water
from River Ravi was flowing into
Pakistan the then West Pakistan knows
because Pakistan because according to
the treaty we had three rivers which
fell into India's share namely Ravi such
Lodge be ours and three other namely
Chand have Ravi and Jhelum SR each and
have elements in the into Pakistan but
because of the absence of this dam the
entire flow of river Ravi somewhere
around Madhopur which happens to be the
border town between German retreat was
and Punjab is going into into into into
Pakistan with the construction of the
dam and let me also share with you this
bit of information that the personal
intervention of Prime Minister Modi the
construction of this dam has already
started it's been now registered as
national project by the Government of
India it will be ready in three years
also after declaring that the MFN status
that is being provided to Pakistan that
would be revoked
this clearly is the biggest jolt that
will hurt Pakistan a lot and clearly
this is also coming at the backdrop of
what we saw happening in pull Varma and
the Primus has assurance that it is now
time that Pakistan will realize what
India really stands for certainly so and
you would also recall that during his
visit to Jammu and Kashmir on the 3rd of
February Prime Minister Modi made a
mention of this
shop for candy he said the work is
started he'll be complete in three years
then then Italy he gave the entire
border district of co2 and you won't
catch me in the garage for the water
destroyed up a job and and he also said
that we would not allow a single drop of
water going into Pakistan and I think
now the questions would be raised why
the earlier comments could not have done
this while on one hand their leaders
would you know at the top of head say
Pakistan copani rogue though whereas the
matter of fact was that their own money
was flowing into Pakistan the other
project which finds mention mr.
categories tweet which is a tributary of
river Ravi and the manner in the
ironically the manner in which this dam
had been planned would have allowed
about one third of the water to be
available for utilization for the co2
hardest-hit on Kashmir which is the
modern history and the other entire 2/3
would have gone into Pakistan and this
is the pragmatism of that water as well
but so when we talk I would just
accomplish I would just conclude by
complimenting the Modi government mr.
Gargery a high-level tea was meeting was
held and now it has been planned to put
a canal system in place so that if the
utilization capacity of the ketubah
district is not enough to take consume
the entire share of water and these let
it go to the neighboring states of
Punjab Haryana Rajasthan instead of
flowing into Punjab Pakistan so just my
last question to you before I can wrap
this up how much do you feel as a
minister in the current government is
going to hurt Pakistan because this is a
massive step this is a huge step this
has been a demand that has been coming
in from a really long time and this is
exactly what the Modi government is
doing today yes at the same time as is
also a member of Lok Sabha from that
constituency I would say that this was a
demand which had been pending for almost
half a century half a century and nobody
had any answers to this question why
they were not going ahead with that and
of course Pakistan by default was making
the benefit of the three rivers which
hadn't been you know rightfully given to
it as a share under the treaty and also
utilizing reach the the entire water of
the biggest river which fell in India
share namely
River Ravi so obviously this is going to
and the manner in which this ogee
multi-purpose project plan had been
conceived by the earlier government
would have given
another 2/3 of the water to them so I
think the entire course correction will
now not only be pinching Pakistan but
would also be giving a huge relief as
far as irrigation of power generation is
concerned to the modern districts of
Punjab and watch the previous
governments could not do dr. jeté the

what the Modi government had promised
that Pakistan will suffer the India will
ensure that Pakistan chokes and this is

this is big britain inputs that tanks
now has access black money report has
been given to standing committee times
now has access the details of the report
the Standing Committee on Finance that
is now the black that has the black
money report and in its second report in
Parliament on in 2009 there were certain
observations which were made and now
kina Gambier my colleague is with me
inna what are the details you know now
the details the time star has access are
actually the details of three reports on
black money the remember there were
three different institutions which were
asked by the then UPA government in you
know two thousand eight and nine to
conduct studies as far as the black
money in India is concerned now these
three institutions in fact we are being
told had submitted their reports are
into December 2013 July 2014 and August
2014
so by August 2014 the government had all
the details as far as the amount of
black money that's there in the country
and what is the unaccounted wealth that
perhaps Indians have had absence of 1990
and till about 2008 that was the time
period that these institutions
considered for studying the amount of
unaccounted wealth in the country and
the black money that is sent out of the
country now the findings are quite
interesting finish and then the
conclusion that I am going to talk about
firstly the findings one of the
institution which is ni PFP studied the
data from 1997 till about 2009 and it
found that the total our financial
outflow or illicit financial outflow or
black money that has gone from India to
outside from 97 to 2009 was in the range
of 0.2 to 74.4% then the another
institution was NCA er which found that
you know black money worth three hundred
and eighty four billion dollars to four
hundred and ninety four billion dollars
went out from 1980 to 2010 that was the
amount of unaccounted wealth and then
the third institution was ni
which actually showed that the illicit
money that has gone out of the country
was around 10 percent of the total
unaccounted well that people had in
India to put things in perspective this
simply showed the three reports showed
the government of the day which took
that big decision of D monetization in
November 2016
the reports showed that how most of the
unaccounted wealth or rather black money
is actually within the country not much
has really gone out of the country that
was the you know a broad idea that was
given after these particular reports
were really submitted then these reports
were sent to the Parliamentary Standing
Committee on Finance and the inference
was that these reports are not giving a
clear picture now this gives a ground
clearly to us to say that perhaps you
know this is the reason why the
government decided to go ahead with
something called SD monetization to
actually find out about the unaccounted
wealth that the people of this country
have which according to these three
reports was actually within the country
not not much had really gone out of the
country so that's the sum and substance
of the details of this report that times
now has accessed and in a way it is
justifying the big decision of D
monetization that the government had
taken in 2016 so he now what helped me
understand this so what you're saying
that on basis of these three reports the
decision to but the decision of D
monetization was taken by the government
and that this is a report that has gone
to the standing committee but they are
saying that the estimates are not
reliable is that the case
well yes see there were three different
institutions which were asked to carry
out studies to find out the total amount
of black money that is there in the
country or perhaps that has been sent
from the country to other up safe havens
across the world this report that times
now ab has accessed the details of this
was submitted to the Parliamentary
Standing Committee on Finance in 2017
and you know this clearly had given us
an idea that perhaps there was no
clarity as to what
at least the amount of black money
that's there in the country so even
government tilde doesn't know what's the
total amount of black money that's here
even these institutions could not really
figure out so this war on black money
that happened that we have been talking
about so far we still don't know how the
government is going to really fight it
out because according to these three
reports which the government was going
to rely heavily on even their reserve
you know a final conclusion was not
satisfactory alrighty now Tom beer thank

the scone I am grateful for this
opportunity to present the second round
of foreign submissions on behalf of the
Republic of India responding to the
points that were made yesterday by
Pakistan I start with some issues sir
mr. president and honorable judges which
should never detain this court and waste
its precious time
but since they arise and have been
raised and almost given center stage I
propose to deal with them briefly
Pakistan through its counsel made a
scathing attack on India on India's
memorial and also did not spare the
legal counsel who have assisted India in
preparing the memorial they overlooked
that there is a fundamental difference
between proceedings brought for example
in a United Kingdom Court under the
rules of the court and proceedings
brought before this Court the
proceedings in this quarter applications
filed by sovereign states no private
party generally has a right to bring
proceedings in this country under
Article 38 of the rules an application
before the court has to be signed by
either the agent of the party submitting
it or by the diplomatic representative
of that party in the country in which
the court has its seat or by some other
duly authorized person the signature of
a person other than the diplomatic
representative has to be authenticated
by either the diplomatic representative
or by the competent authority of the
applicants foreign ministry under
Article 14 all steps after proceedings
been instituted shall be taken by agents
memorials our founder the article 49 the
original of every pleading shall be
signed by the agent and filed in the
registry consistent with the dignity of
the sovereign states who file
applications there is no requirement for
Salomon formations of any kind as to the
truth of the contents of the pleadings
errors and miss statements in Memorial
are addressed by the other party in the
count of memorials or in the rejoinders
where the meeting the last pleading the
last word even in oral submissions
always is with the respondent a
criticism of one sovereign state of the
case made out by the other state must be
in language consistent with the dignity
of sovereign states and the majesty of
the Scott and the solemnity of the
proceedings in this Court humpty-dumpty
has no place in this Court this Court
has jurisdiction over sovereign states
and conducts proceedings in which
sovereign states are given directions
which are binding upon them this court
therefore conducts itself with restraint
and respect which does not undermine the
serenity of any other states or shows
disrespect towards any of them the
language which was which has occurred in
this court sir in these yellow precincts
is and so that such misadventures are
not repeated perhaps this court may in
counsels word lay down some red lines of
how proceedings ought to be conducted
the transcript is peppered with words
such as shameless nonsensical laughable
breathtaking arrogance on a quick count
shameless and nonsense occur five times
each arrogance four times ridiculous
four times and disgraceful four times
and these are addressed to the
submissions made in the memorial in the
reply by the sovereign Republic of India
India takes exception to being addressed
in this fashion in an International
Court
beyond saying this I would let the
matter rest for I do not and the Indian
culture prevents me from indulging in
similar language of invective and
insults India believes we have a strong
case and so we have sir as the saying is
hammered the facts and hammered the law
as the old lawyer saying goes when
you're strong on the law you hammer the
law if you are strong on the facts you
have other facts and when you have
neither on your side you have on the
table bereft of a case Pakistan has
hammered the proverbial table since
counsel brought it up I must mention
that I have received a letter from him
containing a veiled threat for my role
in certain submissions and extracts of
certain reports found in Indian
memorials reply this again is not a
matter for this court but since it was
brought up my only response is to say
that there appears to be a fundamental
misunderstanding as to the role of
counsel in preparation of pleadings
under the rule to the court which were
followed by India no Indian pleading has
been signed by any lawyer and like
Pakistan's filings and the rules the
Scott do not countenance filing by or
through lawyers
unlike the pleadings filed by Pakistan
India has filed pleadings in its own
name sign buyer's agent and takes full
responsibility for the content of its
pleadings on 5th of June 2018 Pakistan
wrote a letter to India demanding a
confirmation that the contents of the
reply are an old material respects
accurate and requesting India to confirm
whether its lead counsel had reviewed or
approved the reply as filed India
replied on 27 June asking Pakistan to
raise any issue they desired before this
court in accordance with the rules and
that and I quote the details of the
preparation review process including
leading to the final submissions is
purely internal to the Government of
India the queries raised by the domed of
Pakistan are therefore inappropriate
and irrelevant Alacoque on 17 June July
2018 I'm sorry
the rejoinder was filed in which
Pakistan pointed out the alleged
mischaracterizations and Miss quotations
the matter should have ended there
leaving it to the court to hear
submissions and deal with the expert
report appropriately if necessary since
the original of the report was in any
event on the record of the court on 18th
January 2019 India received from the
Scot a letter attaching a communication
of the same date received by the court
from Pakistan paragraph six and seven of
the letter raised the issue of the
alleged mischaracterization and miss
quotation it make naina mostly offer the
government of India an opportunity to
consider its position and Pakistan's

display yesterday demanded a forthright
apology an undertaking not to repeat
these matters before the court this
letter raised various issues in relation
to the cross-examination of mr. JP Singh
a response was given to this letter on
23rd January 2019 in which on these
issues India maintained its position the
matters arising out of these letters of
18th January 2019 and 23rd January 2019
were dealt by this court and its
communication of 24th January 2019 the

in the Kasab case where the Supreme

application filed by a Pakistani
terrorist apprehended red-handed and
caught by a brave police officer who
absorbed on himself

court on the High Court this is called
review I would like to conclude my
opening presentation by dealing with the
part made in India's memorial and reply
repeatedly and which was the subject of
severe criticism yesterday Pakistan
suggested that in refusing to answer
questions or wrongly characterizing them
including its request for legal
assistance as propaganda measure India
had done something wrong let me explain
to you why India calls all this a
propaganda and not serious legal steps
Pakistan has continued to misuse the
opportunity provided by the saugus
institution with false and malicious
propaganda on issues which are not part
of substantive legal issues for this
court to consider also one of the
reasons why India seeks Javas release
apart from showing propaganda is that he
has become a pawn in a convenient tool
for Pakistan to try and unsuccessfully
divert global attention from its own
conduct and Pakistan's conduct is well
documented by information and material
contained in public domain these
includes firstly state sponsorship of
terrorism by including and allowing its
territory to be used to train armed and
financed and launch terrorist attacks
against its neighbors some of the recent

in arts in Fine Arts in cinema and in
commerce over the past one week in or
period of time we have done all that in

that's the question you because you

you are you also here goes on to state

to Pakistan is not the solution or also
going ahead and saying that the

that clearly is not the
prime issue is very surprising because
it really looks like the leadership of

I'm grateful for the privilege of
appearing in this court once again and
consider myself deeply honored at this
opportunity to present India's case
before you in this unfortunate matter
relating to the life of an innocent
Indian this case honourable mr.
president and members of the court
arises out of an application filed by
India under Article 40 para graph 1 of
the statute of the court an article 38
of the rules read along with article 1
of the optional protocol concerning the
compulsory settlement of disputes done
at Vienna on 24th April 1963 the basis
for the application on which India's
pursuing the reliefs which are
articulated in its memorial is an
egregious violation of the Vienna
Convention on consular relations 1963
which I shall be referring to as the
Vienna conventions the case is simple
Shaun of the irrelevance is sought to be
injected there are two broad issues that
arise in this case the first issue
relates to the construction of the
Vienna Convention particularly article
36 of the Convention and its application
to the facts of the
on this the admitted position being that
consular access was not granted if
Pakistan's strange defense of exclusion
of such cases is not accepted then it
has to be found that Pakistan is an
egregious breach of the Vienna
Convention
the second relevant issue then is the
relief to be granted in this case the
Charles olfactory principle of
restitution in intagram is now the
settled basis for relief the only issue
is whether past precedents of this court
relating to a violation of the Vienna
Convention which granted relief by way
of review and reconsideration have laid
down law an inflexible rule which has to
be followed in all situations India says
that the court would have to decide
whether the rule can apply to military
courts like the Pakistan military court
and whether courts that do not rise to
the standards of due process can be the
repository of faith of the kind in this
court reposed in the American criminal
justice system in a veena in the ground
finding itself bereft of any substantive
defense Pakistan has rose raised a host
of issues which do not have any real
relevance to these proceedings on the
issue of construction Pakistan seeks to
run one and only one defense for diverse
reasons it suggests that despite the
plain language of article 36 it stands
jettisoned when the host state alleges
espionage and national security its
submissions run counter even to the
authorities it chooses to cite Pakistan
runs and meritorious defenses under the
chapeau of abuse of process abuse of
rights of extre picasa it misstates the
law it misleads commentary's it relies
on material that is not recognized as
having any presidential value and
finally having failed in its propaganda
against India
and the feeble attempt to counter global
criticism of its role in cross-border
terrorism Pakistan seeks to raise issues
such as India's refusal to allow it to
indulge in a freewheeling inquiry into
high functionaries without even
disclosing the fundamental elements of
the alleged offenses that are to be
investigated and of passports that it
allegedly has ceased it is India's is
that none of these issues call for
resolution and decision by this court in
the structure of my speech I will first
focus on the relevant issues the
relevant issues are the constructs the
construction of the Vienna Convention
the second is applying its language to
the conduct of Pakistan which leads us
to the step of deciding the appropriate
relief to be granted I will also make
submissions on the evolving
jurisprudence in this area of the law
and of the role of article 36 in the
rubric of due process
I will then deal with defenses run by
Pakistan
they are gonna not scam okay bye I will
resist the temptations are to engage
with the allegations being made as to
the passport issue and the legal
assistance he should be on saying it
would really be for this court to decide
in the first instance whether fact to
what extent Pakistan should be allowed
to use these hearings as a platform for
propaganda without establishing the
legal relevance of this wanton
allegations
Pakistan is obviously embarrassed to
disclose the judgment given in the jar
of case the specific charges against him
the evidence against him and while the
statement of the advisor on foreign
affairs to the prime minister's office
of Pakistan makes a slew of allegations
against Java in relation to the
incidents that date back to 2014-15 the
Pakistan story has always been strong in
rhetoric and blurring on facts India
therefore seeks relief by way of
declaring that the trial by the military
court in Pakistan in the fact certain
circumstances hopelessly fails to
satisfy even minimum standards of due
process and being violative of article
36 of the Vienna Convention it should be
declared unlawful dadoes continued
custody without consular access should
be declared unlawful and amongst other
things considering the trauma to which
he has been subjected for over three
years it would be in the interest of
justice of making human rights a reality
to direct his release India invokes the
jurisdiction of the court based on
article 36 paragraph 1 of the statute of
the court an article 1 of the optional
protocol India and Pakistan have
accepted the Vienna Convention and the
optional protocol without any
reservations and the hearing for the
request of provisional measures Pakistan
maintained that the jurisdiction of the
court is excluded by a number of
reservations in the party's declarations
under article 36 paragraph 2 of the
statute it does not pursue this in the
counter memorial
the optional protocol read with article
36 paragraph 1 confers jurisdiction upon
the court to remedy the violations of
the Vienna Convention one of the defense
is raised by Pakistan is that India's
failure to explore the remedy of
arbitration and conciliation under
article 2 an article 3 of the optional
protocol constitutes an abusive process
India disagrees this court in the Tehran
case has held that article to an article
3 are not preconditions for the
applicability of article 1 on the facts
of this case this defense is facially
farcical I shall first set out the facts
on which India claims that a violation
has been established and indicate the
areas of differences in their context
Pakistan asserts that an Indian national
mr. Kaul Bhushan sued each jadhav was
caught arrested unquote on 3rd March
2016 this is the publicly stated
position taken by Pakistan India claims
that there is evidence to suggest he was
abducted and found himself in the
custody of Pakistan security forces from
at least the 3rd of March 2016 a
statement made by the Honorable Minister
for external affairs in Parliament in
India sets out India's position in the
matter and I shall refer to it
endocrinology for maintaining simplicity
in my narrative I shall use the word
arrest without accepting the lawfulness
of his detention on 25th March 2016
India was informed of this so-called
arrest when the foreign secretary raised
the matter with the Indian High
Commission in Islamabad Pakistan issued
a dommage
indicate making allegations of an
illegal entry of a are aw officer and
his alleged involvement in subversive
activities on that very day in 25th
March 2016
India sought consular access to Jadhav
Pakistan notified the p5 states of his
arrest on that very day and created a
12-page document making allegations
against India it publicly add a video
that purported to be a recording of his
so-called confession by Jadhav some
significant tracks emerged from this
document produced by Pakistan
it states that security forces
apprehended Jadhav
it's a fair assumption that he has
continued since his detention in the
custody of Pakistan's security forces
the document doesn't indicate the date
of his apprehension it mentions first
week of March 2016 it states that quote
the agent has confessed uncle it is
obvious that soon after his arrest and
in the custody of security forces the
confessionals extracting information
subsequently made available by Pakistan
establishes that a first information
report the acronym for which in India
and in Pakistan is if I are under the
Pakistan Code of Criminal Procedure 1898
was registered as late as 80 April 2016
and that under the code marks the
commenced and under the court the FI arm
asks the commencement of an
investigation into a crime but the
confession obtained on 25th March 2016
before the FIA was used as a propaganda
measure and it's paraphrase finds place
in the document circulated to the p5
countries the document notes that this
gentleman had been operating as a
businessman in Jogja Bihar which alleges
Java crossed over from Iran to pollute
Euston and the document alleges he's a
commander in the Indian Navy he
concludes it concludes by making serious
allegations against India of
state-sponsored terrorism and of
repeating it efforts of 1971 in
Balochistan you will be surprised to
find despite all this towards the end of
their member
counter memoriam one of the defenses is
that India has not established his
nationality
there is no manner of doubt that
Pakistan was using this as a propaganda
tool Pakistan was bound to grant
consular access without delay
India's request for access did not evoke
any response in Para nine of its
memorial India asserts that Pakistan's
conduct suggests that even Giada was not
informed of his right to consular access
and this is not contradicted in the
counter Memorial on 30th March 16 India
reminded Pakistan of its request for
consular access and received no reply to
its communication 13 reminders was sent
by India on various dates and I will
deal with them in my narrative Pakistan
acknowledges that as early as 30 March
2016 the Indian High Commission in
Islamabad sent an order bulk to
Pakistan's Minister of Foreign Affairs
requesting consular access Pakistan
obviously had no difficulty in
recognizing that the request related to
the other India has no papers or
authentic information of what happened
in Pakistan the information in public
domain in relation to Jadhav alleged
arrest and trial was first found in the
statement of mr. Sartaj Aziz made on
14th April 2017 the public announcement
by the advisor to the Prime Minister
sets out the steps that led to Giada's
conviction in the award of a death
sentence assuming them to be correct my
narrative will set out the course of
events which follow a to April 2016 as I
said NFI art was allegedly registered on
15 April 2016 Pakistan notified in voice
of the members of the Arab League and of
this association of the Southeast Asian
Nations the asean who were quote-unquote
briefed after the registration of the FI
our gather was supposedly interrogated
on 2nd May 2016 and again on 22nd May
sixteen India sent a reminder the first
reminder for consular access on 6th May
the second reminder was sent on 10 June
the third reminder on 11th July
proceedings appear to have continued in
the meanwhile in Pakistan and on 12th
July a jointed Cote joint investigation
team unquote was allegedly constituted
the steps taken by the so called joint
investigation team including any further
interrogation of Yadav is not known the
press statement states that a quote
confessional statement unquote was
recorded under what is Section 164 of
the Pakistan Code of Criminal Procedure
in the meanwhile India continued to
remind Pakistan of its request for
consular access and sent a fourth
reminder on 26 July and a fifth reminder
on 22nd August 2016 on 6 September 2016
it appears that a supplementary F IR was
registered purportedly basing its itself
on the alleged confessional statement
the supplementary fi are named high
functionaries in India along with other
persons connected to smuggling
syndicates on the allegation that these
were jobs court handlers organisation
person accomplices in facilitators on 25
September 2016 it appears that the first
hearing of the field general
court-martial was held on 24th September
the summary of evidence was recorded
India sent Pakistan a sixth reminder for
consular access on 3rd November 2016
even this received no reply
the next field general court-martial
proceedings appear to be held on 29th of
November 2016 on 19th December 2016
India sent a 7th reminder to Pakistan
for consular access but there was again
no response on 2nd January 2017 the
adviser to the Prime Minister mr. Sartaj
Aziz wrote to the secretary-general of
the United Nations stating that the law
enforcement agencies had
pretended an agent of Indian
intelligence and that Java had made a
confessional statement admitting his
involvement in court activities aimed at
destabilizing Pakistan uncork it went on
to add that the arrest of Cole Bhushan
Java when his confessional statement has
vindicated Pakistan's long-standing
position that India's involved in
activities at destabilizing Pakistan
uncooked it invites invited the United
Nations and its bodies to open court
play the role in restraining India from
these activities Hong Kong on 23rd
January 17 Pakistan sent a note verbal
without seeking assistance in what they
called the investigation of a case
registered in the fi RS six of 2016 of 8
April and 22 of 2016 of 6 September in
police station CTD Balochistan against
Indian national the letter of assistance
that was attached sense stated that
during the process of investigation and
interrogation Javed revealed the name of
his so-called handlers and it sought
India's assistance and obtaining
statements of high functionaries and
other named officials of the Indian
Naval Service surprisingly it also
sought assistance in obtaining the
evidence of Java's wife it's sort
assistance in coercive steps such as
searching Darrow's house is certified
record of his cell phone for the last 10
years and certified copies of his bank
accounts in his and his family's name it
attached a number of documents such as
the first information report etcetera on
3rd February India bytes not verbal
reminded Pakistan for the eighth time of
its request to provide immediate
consular access it expressed concern
over the continued denial of counselor
axis and about Javas treatment in
Pakistan custody we said especially
about his cost purported confession and
the circumstances of his presence in
Pakistan which remain unexplained it
appears that the trial was concluded on
12th February 2017
India central 9 3 mano on 3rd March 2017
for consular access on pretty fast March
2017 Pakistan replied to the
communication of 3rd March stating that
the case for consular access to Indian
National Coal Bhushan gather shall be
considered in the light of India sights
response to Pakistan's request for
assistance in investigation process an
early dispensation of justice the court
would have noticed that the trial
already had concluded on 12th February
2017 on 31st March 2017 India replied
Pakistan's communication of 21st March
2017 pointing up that consular access
would be an essential prerequisite to
verify the facts and understand the
circumstances of Java's presence in
Pakistan and for the tenth time
requesting immediate consular access a
press release issued by the
inter-services public relations Pakistan
on 10th April 2017 which announced that
Jarrah had been tried by the F GCM under
the Pakistan Army Act and awarded the
death sentence and that on that day the
Chief of Army Staff had confirmed the
death sentence awarded to him it stated
that quote the accused was provided with
defending officer as per legal
provisions and cook no lawyer Pakistan
bites communication of 10th April 2017
responded to India's not verbal of 31st
March 2017 repeating that the case for
consular access shall be considered in
the light of India's response to
Pakistan's request for assistance in the
investigation process which was spending
with the Indian side India responded by
it's not verbal on the same date
protesting that despite repeated
requests access had not been permitted
and pointed out that Navin the offer of
consular access after his death sentence
had been awarded in confirmed appeared
farcical
[Music]
a statement was made in the Indian
Parliament by the Honorable External
Affairs Minister on 11th April 2017
setting out the position of the
Government of India the statement
described him as a kidnapped Indian and
a victim of a plan that seeks to cast
aspersions on India to deflect
international attention from Pakistan's
well known record of sponsoring and
supporting terrorism on 14th April 2017
the adviser to Pakistan's prime minister
and foreign affairs mr. Sartaj Aziz
issued his press statement the
statements of significance to the
present case are as follows first he
said data Court is serving commander of
the Indian Navy and working with Indian
Intelligence Agency our aw uncorked was
apprehended on 3rd March 2016 after he
illegally crossed over into Pakistan
from the Sarabande border in Iran he
said he was tried by the field court
field general court-martial under
Section 59 of the Pakistan Army Act and
then the three of the Official Secrets
Act
Jarrah was provided with the legal
counsel in accordance with our
provisions of law he said he said Java
confessed before a magistrate and the
court that he was tasked by Indian
Intelligence Agency our aw2 plan
coordinate organized espionage and
sabotage activities aimed at
destabilizing and waging war against
Pakistan and surprisingly the court
found out of guilty as it has found many
others the espionage case against Java
was tried by the F GCM and concluded
under the Pakistan Army Act and the
official secret act his sentence five
Spenard was endorsed on 10th April 2017
the steps which as per this press
statement were taken to ensure
transference
his confessional statement was recorded
before a magistrate under 164 of the CRP
see this was of course much after his
first confession had already been aired
to the world a law qualified field
officer was provided to defend him
throughout the court proceedings a
statement of witnesses was recorded
under oath in the presence of the
accused
and in the court jadhav was allowed to
ask questions from the witnesses during
the trial a fully-qualified law officer
of the Judge Advocate General Branch
remained a part of the court it went on
to assert and something which would be
relevant for the final relief that all
political parties are unanimous that the
award of death penalty awarded to a
foreign spy is the correct decision the
whole nation is solidly united against
any threat to Pakistan's security on
14th April 2017 India sort consular
access for the 14th time and also sought
certified copies of charge sheet and the
judgment of the military court these
have not ever been furnished by Pakistan
on 19th April 2017 the government of
India again requested the government of
pakistan for handing over certified
copies of the chargesheet proceedings of
the court of inquiry they were requested
to share the procedure for appeal to the
relevant court to facilitate the
appointment of a defense Lord to
facilitate the contact with the High
Commissioner High Commission of India
and Islamabad and to issue appropriate
visas to family members who travel to
Pakistan for the 13th time Pakistan was
again requested to provide consular
access on 20th April 2017 a spokesperson
for Pakistan held a bell press briefing
in which he mentioned quote regarding
consular access we have said earlier
also that we have a bilateral agreement
on consular access and according to
article 4 in all such cases as the one
of commander Col Bhushan the request of
the this nature would be decided on the
basis of merits
uncaught this statement by the
spokesperson is not reflected in any of
the communication sent by Pakistan to
India on 26th April 2017 India handed
over an appeal and a petition on behalf
of the mother of Java for being filed
with the concerned authorities in
Pakistan on 27th April the Honorable
minutes External Affairs Minister of
India wrote two letter to the advisor
the Prime Minister of Pakistan
requesting him for certified copies of
the charge sheets Proceedings of the
court of inquiry summary of evidence
judge the judgement etc no reply was
received to this letter it wasn't these
circumstances that India made its
application on it to make making a
request for indication of provisional
measures on 18 May this Court made the
order indicating the provisional
measures on 19 June 17 India responded
to the request for assistance in
investigation it pointed out that not
only had dad have been denied consular
access but no crebbil credible evidence
had been provided by Pakistan to show
his involvement in any act of terrorism
and his purported confession clearly
appeared to be cost there were no
details of the so-called trial being
made available to India Pakistan remind
India reminded Pakistan that it is the
government of Pakistan which has not
ratified the Sauk Convention on legal
assistance in criminal matters 2008 and
had not responded to initiatives in the
past to conclude bilateral mutual legal
assistance treaty India accordingly
returned the letter of 23rd January 2017
on 22nd June 17 a press release by
Pakistan inter-services Public Relation
stated the military appellate court had
rejected Gathers appeal and other had
made a mercy petition to the chief of
army staff and if rejected he could
appeal to the Pakistan President for
clemency
yet another confessional video
purportedly made in April 17 was also
made public on 30th August 17 Pakistan
responded to the communication of 19
June by which the request for mutual
legal assistance had been declined being
faced with no mutual legal assistance to
treaty
in decline being faced with no mutual
legal assistance treaty some resolution
imposed overriding obligations on member
states to afford one another the greeted
measures of assistance in connection
with criminal investigations India
continued to request for counselor
accessed bytes letters of 20th September
and 9th October Pakistan's later however
considers India's regrettable stance
quote-unquote in the International Court
of Justice which ignored what they say
repeated attempts by the government of
Pakistan to provide an opportunity for
the Government of India to give evidence
either exculpatory or inculpatory of
commander zoraph
they failed to notice that Pakistan's
misadventure in trying to publicly err
the confession and raise the issue
relating to a spa sport did not succeed
in the court the Pakistan data requested
stated that the request took the form
that is internationally recognized I
will show you why this is plainly wrong
in due course the letter stated that
some of the evidence underpinning the
allegation has been made available to
India to be clear Java is unlikely to
have been convicted and awarded the
death sentence merely because he had as
alleged by Pakistan a passport in a
different name which would hide his
identity he was presumably found guilty
of serious offenses which carried the
death penalty as a punishment Pakistan
has steadfastly refused to disclose
which specific events which specific
offenses related to which specific
events in relation to which Jadhav now
stands convicted the letter than
audaciously states that it was caught
incumbent upon the Government of India
to explain uncor the passport issue and
it closed by saying open court office
the Republic of India's compliance the
request is provided again on 26th
October 2017 Pakistan wrote to Winnie
reiterating its stand which it had taken
in the communication of 30th August but
added and I caught without prejudice to
the proceeding so far government of
Pakistan is prepared to consider any
request for extradition that the
government of India may make in the
event that commander Java was considered
to be a criminal under the law of India
go India responded to Pakistan's offer
for extradition it pointed out bites
communication of 11th December that
Pakistan's communications of 30th August
17 and 26th October 2017 were again yet
attempted propaganda and India was not
possessed of any material which would
give them to suspect that Java will
committed any crime for which he could
be tried in India Pakistan offered to
allow daga's family to visit him the
terms were agreed and the meeting was
held on 25th December 2017 India was
dismayed at the manner in which the
meeting was conducted and wrote a letter
on 27 December marking its protest at
the violation in the letter and spirit
of the understanding which had been
arrived at in relation to the meeting
Pakistan responded to India's
communication bites no 12 out of 19
January 2018 on the same date Pakistan
responded to India's communication of 27
December contesting saw the allegations
made by India in relation to the meeting
India responded on 11th April 2018 to
Pakistan's communication of 19 January
2018 pointing out that the passport
which had allegedly recovered from the
other was characterized being fittingly
false and to investigate any such
allegations India would have to inquire
into the circumstances in which the
pasta is recovered having finished with
the factual narrative I now move sir to
the first issue of relevance the
construction of the Vienna Convention
Article 36 of the Vienna Convention is
in language that admits of no
big Uwe T paragraph 1b of article 36
requires the competent authorities of
the receiving state if requested by the
national of a sending state to inform
the counsel of course to the sending
state that a national of that state is
arrested or committed to prison or to
custody pending trial or is detained in
any other manner in addition to this
right conferred upon the arrested
national paragraph 1 C confers upon the
sending state the right to have its
consular officers visit in national of
the sending state who is in prison
custody or detention to converse and
correspond with him and to arrange for
his legal representation paragraph 2 of
the treaty as place is added to an above
national laws for it mandates that while
the rights to consular access shall be
recognized in confirma T with the laws
and regulations of the receiving state
this is subject to the proviso that the
laws and regulations must enable full
effect to be given to the purposes for
which the rice accorded under the
article or intending article 31 of the
Vienna Convention of the launch e t--'s
1969 which I shall be referring to as
the vclt requires that a treaty be
interpreted in good faith in accordance
to the ordinary meaning to be given to
the terms of the treaty in the context
in the light of his object and purpose
the expression context is defined in
article 31 paragraph two in relation to
the Vienna Convention it's in his case
that it is the text that would govern
its construction the first approach
based on little imprint interpretation
of the language is the objective
approach as against a subjective
approach which searches for the elusive
intent of the parties the teleological
approach is a wider perspective and
emphasizes the object and purpose of the
treaty as a black backdrop against which
the treaty should be construed these
conflicting principles the objective
approach is subjective approach and the
object and purpose approach have been
codified
in articles 31 to 33 of the vclt and
need labor there's no more because the
construction of article 36 of the Vienna
Convention is no longer rests in Tigre
in the lagron case this court construed
article 36 in health and I quote article
36 paragraph 1b spells out the
obligations of the receiving state has
towards the detained person and the
sending state the clarity of these
provisions viewed in their context
admits of no doubt it follows as has
been held on a number of occasions that
the court must apply these as they stand
in the 2004 Avena judgement this Court
held that the court would recall that it
has in any in any event essential to
have in mind the nature of the Vienna
Convention it lays down certain
standards to be observed by all state
parties with a view to the unimpeded
conduct of consular relations which as
the court observed in 1979 is so
important in present day international
law in promoting development of friendly
relations amongst Nations and and I have
taken the liberty of emphasizing this
ensuring protection and assistance for
aliens resident in the territories of
other states recognizing the duality of
the protection afforded by article 36
this court in Para 40 of the Avena
judgment said that quote it would
further observe that the violations of
the rights of the individuals and
article 36 may entail a violation of the
rights of the sending state and that the
violations of the rights of the latter
may entail a violation of the rights of
the individual Eric Bergen is book the
evolutionary interpretation of treaties
cites Berman's community law and
international
which argues that vclt and the rules
when they were adopted in 1969 and I
quote slept away at the same time all
the supposed special tenets of
interpretation that had enveloped the
subject like carpets and goes on to say
one is today most unlikely to see an
international tribunal repute deciding a
disputed point of interpretation by
reference to special styles of
interpretation such as a restrictive
doctrine of interpretation or other
supposed special doctrine thought to be
specially applicable to particular types
of cases the jurisprudence of article 36
of the Vienna Convention has evolved
with the march of human rights and human
rights jurisprudence at various levels
at the international level the
International Covenant for Civil and
Political Rights the ICCPR
is a major milestone in the articulation
of principles that govern basic civil
and political rights of mankind the
interpretation of article 36 of the
Vienna Convention must therefore be
informed by the contemporaneous state of
the law in relation to human rights and
in relation to the protection of the
rights of those accused of serious
crimes in the eye on rhine arbitration
the tribunal interpreted article 31 para
3 C of the vclt as not requiring an
interpretation oblivious to all later
legal developments the tribunal went on
to note that and I quote there is a
general support amongst leading writers
today for evolutive interpretation of
treaties unquote it cites the ninth
edition of Oppenheim that court
notwithstanding the intertemporal rule
in some respects the interpretation of a
treaties provisions cannot be divorced
from developments in the law subsequent
to its adoption the concepts embodied in
a treaty may not be static but
evolutionary matter of pakistan's
interpretation based on the overriding
overarching right of a sovereign nation
to protect itself against internal and
disruption is a restatement ultimately
of the principle of serenity and is
reminiscent of the restrictive rule the
travelin eye on Ryan sites from free
zone and SS will build in cases and
extracts the latter from which the
following passage in which the permanent
court caution that it would nonetheless
and I quote feel obliged to stop at the
point where the so-called
restrictive interpretation would be
contrary to the plain terms of the
article and would destroy what has
clearly been granted the iron Ryan
traveler goes on to hold that the
restrictive interpretation thus has
particularly little role to play in
certain categories of treaties such as
for example human rights treaties indeed
some authors note that the principle has
not been relied upon in recent
jurisprudence of international courts
and tribunals and that its contemporary
relevance is in fact doubt treaty
article 36 does not admit of any
exceptions besides it would erode
significantly the reach of the
provisions if an exception is sought to
be made as sought by Pakistan article 36
requires consular access to be given
without delay upon arrest such access
has to be given before the case is
brought to trial at the stage of arrests
there were merely be allegations of
wrongdoing which are under investigation
if at this stage on allegations levelled
by the host state it is relieved of the
obligations under Article 36 and if
consular access is jettison it would
render article 36 a dead letter the more
serious allegations the greater the need
for ensuring that an accused has full
and meaningful right to defend himself
against charges brought against him to
exclude the operation of article 36 in
matters of serious charges of terrorism
that were flying the face of criminal
jurisprudence there can be no doubt that
article 36 was engaged in the present
case an Indian was detained purportedly
arrested a confession extracted then he
was tried and convicted by a military
court about a death sentence and all
along
requests for consular access for eg
rejected this quite plainly
is an egregious breach of Article 36
[Music]
Pakistan's fundamental approach where it
says that the Vienna Convention is not
engaged in such cases as erroneous for
it looks outside the treaty for state
practice to support consular access
which we say is an irrelevant exercise
it fails to engage with the consequence
of its statement then the issue of
espionage was present to the minds of
those who negotiated the Vienna
Convention and yet no exception was made
to the Vienna Convention to deal with
cases of espionage
India does not base its case on
customary international law or on state
practice but on the plain language of
article 36 Pakistan asserts that the
effect of the Cold War on the exercise
of codification of international law
cannot be overstated but again fails to
acknowledge that if despite this no
Express reservation was made in article
36 of the Vienna Convention for charges
of a spent espionage it establishes that
unsurprisingly states did not want a
vital safeguard recognized in article 36
to be a hostage to allegations of
espionage made by the whole state the
absence of such exceptions in the Vienna
Convention is unsurprising because the
fundamental principles of due process
recognize that the more serious the
charge the greater the need for
procedure of safeguards besides there
are some basic rules that must prevail
between civilized nations and cannot be
displaced by unilateral allegations
levelled by the receiving state
recognizing that the needs of security
and efficacy of investigation may
require the receiving state to withhold
the notification of arrest by a few days
the draftsmen of the treaty Britain some
play in the joints by using the phrase
open court without undue delay plus a
state may be able to explain a few days
gap between the arrest and the
notification if time is spent buna
feeding in investigating matters
relating to espionage before the sending
state of the national is notified it is
one thing to explain
the lapse of time between the arrest and
the notification to the home state and
quite another to suggest that charges of
espionage
chitosan article 36 Pakistan courts
sa'ada Watts QC in his authoritative
commentry explaining the alcide draft
convention in his commentary so Watts
explains the manner in which the
interest of a state in a criminal
investigation we're balanced with the
right to consular access in paragraph
six which is extracted he states and I
quote the expression without undue delay
used in paragraph one B allows for cases
where it is necessary to hold a person
incommunicado for a period for the
purposes of criminal investigation close
code the coventry explains how paragraph
six six accommodates the need of a state
to converse conduct investigations
during which it may hold a person
incommunicado this would perhaps be
unnecessary if serious allegations of
espionage in terrorism would jettison
article 36 Pakistan draws attention to
comments made by mr. Duncan the chairman
of the International Commission while he
was mentioning espionage cases he
suggested that it may be desirable that
local authority should not be obliged to
inform the council but the Chairman
remarked that if the Commission went
into the question with the cases of
espionage should be made an exception to
the whole principle of consular
protection and communication with
nationals would have to be reopened the
extracts suggest that the problems of
espionage was very much on the table and
yet no exception was made to such
allegations in the language to our 2:36
Pakistan brings up the issue of problems
confronted in implementing the
provisions of the Vienna Convention in
the context of pleas for asylum and in
situations of dual nationality both
these also establish that the Vienna
Convention is indeed the exhaustive
rubric of consular access it is
invariably the provisions of the Vienna
Convention that provides the basis for
resolving situation finding solutions
consistent with the convention one of
the matters brought up by Pakistan is an
application of article 30
six to a person or dual nationality
which presents legal challenges no doubt
with us were generous but they need not
be explored in this case Pakistan gives
a series of example which in its
assertion are historic and modern
examples of espionage that states often
operated on the footing that they were
not entitled to or were not going to be
able to gain access to the espionage
agents when they had been captured India
submits that the material relied upon
for what happened in those cases was
hardly reliable for it is one thing in
relevant detail the plain language of a
treaty if it is contrary to the conduct
of States cannot be whittled down by
reference to state practice a treaty in
fact is set about at times to bring
about uniformity in state practice so
even assuming that the conduct of States
even seeing a consistent conduct which
is sufficiently clear documented so as
to satisfy the rigorous standards of
what constitutes state practice it
cannot alter the plain language of a
treaty the random examples given by
Pakistan in any case do not assist the
court will coming to any such conclusion
of state practice on the contrary recent
instances of arrest by China and Russia
facts and public domain of persons on
allegations of espionage based on
information in public domain show that
the conduct of the receiving state was
compliant with article 36 these the
court would find in the judges folders
at tab 1 and to Pakistan in the Smith's
adventure does not push it to the point
of suggesting that there is an
established practice to show that
consular access is invariably denied in
such cases individual incidents can then
at best establish that Pakistan may not
be the only state which has violated
article 36 of the Vienna Convention or
similar provisions and bilateral
treaties that preceded the Vienna
Convention there is no material place
that would establish the giving consular
access try to extracting a confession
would have so imperiled its national
security or so hampered the
investigation
counselor access was denied there is no
explanation for giving consular access
after that also I now move sir to a
discreet issue the 2008 bilateral
agreement in no official communique to
the Government of India has Pakistan
ever suggested that consular access to
jaha was circumscribed by the 2008
agreement apart from a reference in a
press briefing by a spokesperson of
Pakistan government on 28 April 2017 the
bilateral agreement of 2008 will never
refer to and rightly so the question of
consular access provided for article 36
is being circumscribed on account of
provisions of a bilateral treaty does
not arise article 36 is the provision of
a multilateral treaty and bilateral
treaties covering the same subject
matter can be accommodated as long as
and I quote they are treaties confirming
or supplementing or extending or
amplifying the provisions of the Vienna
Convention this is the clear language of
article 73 of the Vienna Convention the
2008 agreement was entered into and I
quote for furthering the objective of
humane treatment of Nationals of either
country arrested detained or imprisoned
in the other country and by which the
true signatory States India and Pakistan
agreed to certain measures these
included the release and repatriation of
persons within one month of confirmation
of their national status and the
completion of their sentences the
agreement recognized that in the case of
RS detention of sentence made on
political or security grounds each side
may examine the case on its own beds and
that in special cases which require
called for a required compassionate to
humanitarian considerations each side
may exercise discretion subject to its
laws and regulations to allow early
release and repatriation of persons
India does not seek any early release or
repatriation

I must confess with the degree of
ambivalence it doesn't seem to gather
the courage to suggest that article 30
of the ECL tea would override 73 - of
Vienna Convention instead Pakistan
claims that a bilateral agreement is a
and I quote two words they use
supplement and our amplification of
article 36 India generally agrees with
this assertion but point sort of the
premise is destructive of Pakistan's
case on the interpretation it seeks to
place on Paris six of the bilateral
treaty article six cannot destroy
article 36 paragraph six cannot destroy
article 36 the point is as simple as
that the phrases political and national
security in paragraph 6 are amorphous
and indefinite in the report if both
countries can unilaterally decide upon
and police the application of article 36
to individual cases article 36 would
have lost its meaning arrests and thumbs
up front up charges are frequently made
by Pakistan the present case of the
textbook case of such conduct all that
Pakistan would then have to do to
wriggle out of article 36 is to add a
ground and can provide a hook to later
claim that political considerations go
turncoat in the arrest even if it does
not show up in the final charges and
conviction was the basis for denying
consular access Pakistan may then well
denounce article 36 itself
having finished my submissions therefore
on the construction of article 36 and
the irrelevance of the 2008 bilateral
agreement I move now to an important
point article 36 is a facet of due
process the obligations of States
towards aliens features of the recurrent
theme of international law in the
evolution of the jurisprudence of
international law in Barcelona traction
light and power company this court X
postulated the principle that created
obligations or gormless upon the States
the court held that such obligations
derive for example in contemporary
international law from outlawing acts of
aggression and genocide as also from the
principles and rules concerning the
basic rights of the human person
including protection from slavery and
racial discrimination some of the
corresponding rights of protection have
entered into the body of general law and
the example of the Convention on prevent
prevention and punishment of genocide is
reverently others are conferred by
international instruments of a universal
or a quasi universal character these
words perfectly applied to the Vienna
Convention the protection of human
rights generally and specifically in the
context of aliens has been a significant
strand in the evolving jurisprudence of
international law the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights proclaimed
and adopted in 1948 in the words of the
secretary-general Ban ki-moon is and I
quote become a yardstick by which we
measure right and wrong it provides the
foundation for a just and decent future
for all and has given people everywhere
a powerful tool in the fight against
oppression impunity and efference to
human dignity
the principles incorporated which
recognize the universality of human
rights reflect contemporary
understanding of what constitutes due
process the principles of recognition of
human rights have also evolved into
principles of international law binding
on all states era unless the observation
of this court in Terran case bear
repetition wrongfully to deprive human
beings of their freedom and to subject
them to physical constraint in
conditions of hardship is manifestly
incompatible with the principles of the
charter of the United Nations as well as
the fundamental principles enunciated in
the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights powerful words this general
principle would apply not merely to
members of the diplomatic corps but to
all human beings and in present context
to Nationals of sending States the
International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights which came into force
on 23rd March 76 in the preamble states
the recognition of the inherent dignity
and of the equal and inalienable rights
of all members of the human family is
the foundation of freedom justice and
peace in the world recognizing that
these rights derive from the inherent
dignity of the human person it goes on
to state that considering the
obligations of states under the charter
of the United Nations to promote
Universal respect for an observance of
human rights and freedoms the parties
agree upon the articles article 14 sets
up what is recognized of the rights of a
person in relation to determination of
criminal charges hundred president and
honorable members of the court I
strongly submit that the Vienna
Convention is a powerful tool that
ensures at the multilateral level almost
at a universal level the facility of
consular access to foreign nationals who
have been put on trial in if
country this is based on the recognition
of the rights of a national of the
sending state to put up a fair defense
at the determination of criminal charges
in the host state and this becomes
meaningful when he has the benefit of
consular access in its various
dimensions recognized not over thirty
six one of the vital areas of human
rights is the treatment of those accused
of crimes the principles of due process
expressly recognized in the ICCPR must
jurisprudentially be considered to be a
universal obligation binding upon all
states her de omnis consular access to a
national of a sending state charged with
the crime in a sending state evolved as
a practice and found codification in
article 36 at a time when human rights
jurisprudence was in its in Kuna below
it was recognized by those who wrote the
treaty to be a right without exceptions
they went further and wrote the right
not just in favor of the sending state
and its consul but also in favor of the
Nationals of the sending state with the
universal acceptance of the right to a
fair and an impartial trial and the
right to defend oneself against criminal
charges including the right to engage in
lawyers of announced rights in a foreign
country as a rudimentary rule of due
process article 36 becomes a vital cog
in the wheels of justice as was said of
the Geneva Convention by this court so
can it be said about the Vienna
Convention that in some respects the
principles enshrined were a development
and in other respects no more than an
expression of the fundamental principles
of humanitarian law and diplomacy these
measures are designed to put in place an
instrument essential for the effective
cooperation in the international
community and for enabling States he
respective of their different
constitutional and social systems to
achieve mutual understandings to resolve
their differences by peaceful means in a
document delivered
20:10 in the Diallo case this court
considered a challenge to the actions of
the Democratic Republic of Congo in
respect of detention and expulsion of
the national of the Republic of Guinea
er in the backdrop of Rights and the
obligations under the ICCPR and the
African Charter this court also
considered allegations of the violation
of article 36 paragraph 1 B of the
Vienna Convention in the context of
article 36 this Court held that the
provisions as is clear from their very
wording are applicable to any
deprivation of Liberty of whatever kind
even outside the context of pursuing
perpetrators of criminal offenses and
cope this is consistent with the
absolute nature of the obligation as
also a fundamental principle of due
process that the greater the severity of
a charge the greater the need for
punctilious compliance with procedural
safeguards and this is recognized as the
elements of due process this course in
the aloes case went on to say and I
quote it is true as the DRC has pointed
out that article 13 of the common end
provides for an exception to the right
of an alien to submit his reasons where
compelling reasons of national security
coat and coat
individuals who are not Nationals of the
countries in which they live recognizes
that article 10 that an alien shall be
free to communicate at any time to
communicate with a consulate or
diplomatic mission of the state of which

Fedayeen in Pulwama can India allow this
and that's the tweet in fact that he has
put out a short while back he's trying
to suggest that Pulwama Bombay other
Emma Dodd became terrorists after he was
beaten up by the troops
let's go cross to Aditi for more on this
oddity this is like justifying what has
happened in Pulwama instead of standing

you have somebody like Prashant Bhushan
trying to justify and give an alibi to
this suicide bomber
you know it's an absolutely shameful
this is exactly what we have been
discussing since yesterday as well Hina

an entire as a whole needs to be

Jevons who were martyred in this
absolutely dastardly attack but then we
have a legal luminaries like Prashant
Bhushan who come out and justify and put
the entire owners on a Jevons bag this
particular tweet that has been put out
by Prashant Bhushan is absolutely
shameful for the mere reason that we

of the kind of misery they think that he
had to face at that point in time in the

question that we are asking here is that
at this juncture when the entire country
is standing by the families of the

Prashant Bhushan to come out and speak
literally in the tone over the terrorism
I categorically remember that one

just for our nation but also of course
for those who have lost their loved ones
and I have to agree with the sentiments
that are being expressed here tonight on
times now we have seen we have seen an
unprecedented in fact not since 26 11
have I seen visuals of citizens in every
capital in every village banding
together in a show of solidarity we have
also seen remarkable unity across the
political spectrum I am yet to witness
any belligerent voice barring perhaps
those that occupy the noisy peripherals
of a political system who have come out
and tried to politically point score so
here it is a scene that India won't
forget will never condone but a scene
that we would not like to see repeated
and there will be a time when questions
will be asked as to what our government
can do to secure us and avoid a
repetition of this that time is upon us
viewers we are not going to shy away
from those questions but very
importantly tonight at this moment you
have to think of the embalmed Valor that
lies in these coffins these individuals
who serve us selflessly who God our
borders without exception who work day
and night
sometimes sacrificing their own sleep
and privileges to ensure that we can
live privileged existences tonight we
must for a few moments introspect as a
nation as a polity in this white common
comity of humanity viewers and think
back on the sacrifices these individuals
make to ensure that our territorial
integrity and India's abiding serenity
is maintained without blemish and we
must also ask ourselves what have we
done to ask the right questions of those
who have tried to divide us politically
who have tried to evoke sentiments and
disaffection against these men for a
moment times now and I have to bring
this on record you may have noticed
viewers that we have not followed suit
in the frenzy of seeking retribution and
this is very important to note because
there will be a time and a place and
that time in a place will be decided by
the men who know how to get the job done
it will not be decided by a rabble of
individuals and it will certainly not be
decided hopefully not decided by the
exigencies the polls and pressures of an
electoral a political system today we
must leave that job to the men who know
best how to do that job we must also
restrain ourselves simply because it
would behoove us
to supplement in sentiment and ensure
the sanctity of this moment if we are
all going to break out into a cacophony
of chest-beating demanding retribution
then we will let ourselves down in the
eyes of those that are contained in
these coffins to valor and to sacrifice
so let's let's take a deep breath
viewers introspect and think a little
bit about the sacrifices that have been
made in a short while and I want to
bring in a padmaja as well as mother on
this in a short while Padmaja I believe
that the Prime Minister and other
leaders of the Opposition will arrive at
this at this site which has witnessed
many such moments before
that's correct Rahul in fact even as we
speak the Prime Minister Congress
president Rahul Gandhi and Delhi Chief
Minister Arvind Kejriwal are all there
in order to pay their last respects and
nothing could be more beautifully
symbolic of how as a country everyone
gets together these three figures
perhaps have had the most sharp
exchanges with each other in election
season in the last three to four months
but they are going to be they're all
paying their respect to these men who at
the end of the day in the most selfless
way died dying died fighting for the
three of them for us as a country now
what's also happening is that in
addition to of course the empathy that
everyone has with the families of those
who were killed in the terror attack
India is also upping the diplomatic ante
even as we speak travel we're learning
that the Chinese envoy was also briefed
by India he was informed about how
Jessie Mohammed has time and again right
from the Parliament attack to
yesterday carried out offensives against
India how we have proof of their
involvement how we have proof of their
presence on Pakistani soil and India in
a sense has conveyed that Park China
might decide to maintain a stoic silence
and Pakistan's involvement and might
keep blocking an attempt to prescribe
the je Muhammad and its chief but we
will keep trying and we have evidence to
show their involvement in the attacks
that play take place on Indian soil in
the last one and a half hours there was
a steady flow there was a steady
movement of the vehicles of diplomats in
the heart of Delhi 20 countries were
briefed by us about Pakistan's
involvement and the involvement of
Jasher Mohammad in the killing of 40 of
our soldiers and most of them when they
have spoken to our colleagues have
walked away convinced well indeed
padmaja of course what you're saying is
true there will be people those who
think that they can keep India down that
they can prosper by dividing India that
will be seeing this as a golden
opportunity to drive the wedge deeper
and we as a polity and as a people must
not allow this
this is rancorous political season but
we do know that we have it within us to
come together viewers to come together
behind a common purpose and that common
purpose right now is to serve the ends
of justice
remember I've told you that times now is
not sitting here calling for nuclear
strikes against Pakistan we are not
calling for immediate military action
against Pakistan because that would be
not very suggestions that would be
reflective that would be vengeful and
that would certainly at least today
undermine this solemn occasion what we
today require
is a degree of forbearance a dignified
silence as we introspect as to how we
got here
and what has caused this catastrophe of
massive proportions now remember against
the forces this has been one of the
biggest attacks we have seen
bloodletting of this scale in the Maoist
heartland of India but never in Jammu
and Kashmir some people tell me that in
the last three decades we have not had
casualty figures this high in the state
of Jammu and Kashmir yes there have been
intelligence failures there have been
lapses and they have been accepted by
the governor of the state of Jammu and
Kashmir mr. Malik there must be
accountability viewers individuals who
sit at the top of the superstructure of
the intelligence apparatus must come out
explain must be show caused and where
necessary
they must be asked to go because we
cannot return to business as usual
already India has stated its intent it
is withdrawn the most favored nation
status to Pakistan now we can argue
about whether that is efficacious
whether it will actually serve a
salutary purpose we can have that debate
and we will get into that debate but the
fact is that there is intent and there
is common purpose agency and that agency
was underscored today in a very
bipartisan spirit by Rahul Gandhi when
he came out and said that tonight we
will stand together I would stand by my
Prime Minister as we pay homage to those
who have sacrificed that everything for
the cause of our sovereignty and I will
not give in by amplifying the rancor
that accompanies political season to
those who are going to stir emotions so
that we
become even more confused and paralyzed
in our response that is not going to
happen and I think that for that the
opposition must be saluted today because
certainly India needed this moment this
galvanizing moment it is unfortunate
that it has come on the back of the
martyrdom of 40 of our bravest but
nonetheless we have seized the moment
and we must continue to seize it till
justice it not mother I want to ask you
a couple of questions we have been
seeing over the last 24 hours
visuals that have suggested that this
attack was pre-planned can you give us
some details about how this attack was
put together and who were the
masterminds well I think it's quite
clear now and quite evident isn't it
that this kind of the fact itself that
the magnitude of this attack has been
something that has not been seen
anywhere close to the scale in the past
several years in the Kashmir Valley the
fact that this was JJ Mohammed that was
itself trying to carry out a retributive
strike for the killing of two of the
nephews of Maulana Masood Azhar and that
is a very well documented fact and
that's why we've seen the JJ Mohammed
rear its ugly head once again with this
kind of a massive scale of attack yes
they have tried to use the loopholes in
our security apparatus they have tried
to exploit them to carry out this kind
of a massive strike and as you rightly
put it those responsible must certainly
introspect those responsible must
certainly be held accountable they must
come out and explain as to how this kind
of a strike was allowed to happen but
Rahul the sheer volume of the explosive
that was used we are talking about 350
kilograms of plastic explosive and
that's not something that can cross over
the LOC in one day it's been a very
meticulously planned operation that has
been carried out over
months if not years and very slowly but
surely and trying to influence young
minds to carry out this kind of a
dastardly strike just goes to show the
levels to which groups in Pakistan are
desperate well any woman not robbed we
are going to see the Prime Minister and
other leaders of the opposition stride
into this arena this arena which has
been quickly reorganized to pay homage
to our bravest of Braves we are joined
by former former army chief General VP
Malik general Malik today times now and
in fact throughout the last 36 hours
times now has not for even a moment
suggested that there needs to be
military action and the reason why we
have steered clear of that is because we
believe that in a sensitive time like
this what is required is the agency of
some degree of application of mind and
we believe that the time right now is
not to sully this moment by war talk but
to pay homage to those who have laid
down their lives
the embalmed Valor that is contained in
these coffins so that we as a nation can
honor them without the rancor the
breast-beating of frenzy and and I want
to ask you this
general VP Malik do you believe today we
should be selling this occasion by
thinking of punitive action thinking of
playing to the galleries suggesting
total annihilation
or should we tonight ask ourselves some
fundamental questions as to how we got
here
to the point where we forgot our
responsibility to our own boys to
our own men
Rahul all these activities have to carry
on simultaneously there is no doubt that
we have to pay homage to people who were
maakad yesterday and give them full
respect also look after their families
all that has to be done and that is
important for any nation which goes
through such a tragic incident
now the yes there is also need to
investigate in fact I would say that the
first important aspect is to carry out
investigation
how and why this incident occurred they
were the lapses if any whether they pose
a question of collection of so much of
explosive material putting it into a
vehicle getting it ready or the
radicalization of the fiend who carried
out this particular attack also if there
are any lapses in a road opening party
why did they occur if there were any so
all those aspects are required then
there is also a requirement for us to
look at the entire internal dimension of
this whole incident of how
counter-terror as well as counter
radicalization measures have to be taken
and done more effectively than we have
been able to do so far and there again
there are certain activities which will
have to be looked into seriously and
then the last three comes the external
dimension as to what we intend doing
across the border or across the line of
control now that should not be done
without detailed thinking without
working on a proper strategy in which it
is not only the political aspect are not
only the military aspect but we also
have to think in terms of the economic
aspects and more important the
diplomatic us aspect and for that we
have to carry out an action or carry out
a strategy which is cool which looks
into account it takes into account the
counter the measure that we can expect
on
the other side and then thereafter the
one or two more steps fee that will have
to be sorrowful if at all day take
animal th some people have called it I
must say some people have said that we
must today today contemplate today
contemplate the value of cold fury
rather than combustible action that is
what some people have said and I think
that I tend to agree with you general
Mallik because yes what is required is
cool thinking we can get swept up by the
emotion and make grievious mistakes
which will compound the original problem
and make a massive massive mess on our
own doorstep come in simple form of
foreign secretary is also here with us
times now has steered clear common
staple of the more visceral demands that
are being made in certain sections of
our polity and our society not to say
that they will not that there should not
in fact be some amount of give on that
but but I think as of today we need to
ask ourselves how we got to the point
where Pakistan has dared to take action
on Indian soil at an unprecedented level
of nihilism when it very well knows that
doing so would be to incur the wrath of
a government that has shown itself not
hesitant to take bold steps commercial
well you know Pakistan knows how to
handle these problems through experience
they have been responsible for killing
of so many American soldiers in
Afghanistan they have protected the
Haqqani group but United States has
sessioned them with sanctions apply some
sanctions and openly accuse them of
duplicity and everything else yet
Pakistan has not over the years changed
is thinking and approach they even took
the risk of stopping the flow of NATO
traffic through Pakistan to Afghanistan
so in that context the kind of threat
that India poses or the kind of threat
that Pakistan takes in their poses to
their mind seems manageable which is why
they have not seized their support for
terrorism in India and hence this attack
the other background of this attack is
that Pakistan currently seems to think
that it has got over the hump in its
relations with the United States the
United States is now looking positively
at Pakistan in terms of a facilitator
for u.s. eventual withdrawal from
Afghanistan through a dialogue with the
Taliban they have also continued to
receive support from China right and now
the Saudi Crown Prince is visiting there
the UAE has been generous so they think
that the overall situation is more
manageable and hence this risk that is
one aspect the other if you allow me you
know we have been saying for you so many
years and I've been saying that in my
talks with various people that if next
time there is a big terrorist attack
India will have to react which means
that we should have had we should have
had contingency plans about what we are
going to do in case there's a major
attack so I can't at all think or
imagine that we've been caught unawares
or off balance which and if it is so
which means that we have not given any
sort all these years about what
would leave this amazing attack and if
you have thought this through and we
have a plan on the table then what's the
point at this stage to say that we
should react with the with not
combustible whatever you set when cold
fury we should have a plan on the table
and act on it and if according to that
plan we have to be cautious and careful
so be it but we shouldn't give the
impression that we are now going to
begin to find answers to the problem of
a major terrorist attack from Pakistan
we should already have the answers ok
but Pavan Varma former diplomat also
joins the broadcaster Parana I I want to
ask you a basic question what what
astounds me is the fact that and I posed
that question to mr. Kummer say but I
don't know if you heard me but I asked
him why has Pakistan upped the ante to
the extent that we have seen the
bloodiest terror attack in Kashmir
against our forces in almost three
decades why do you believe this has
happened is it because the Modi
government sort of catapult corridor to
the other initiatives that happen over
the last six or eight months been
extended these peace offerings or what
have you - Pakistan have emboldened the
leadership there into thinking that
India suffers from a certain weakness
institutional weakness that there is no
cohesiveness to its foreign policy and
therefore there will also be no
cohesiveness to divide it to react in a
manner which will convey the agency of
unity
you know Rahul there is a Verity that
Chanakya stated he said that if you give
milk to a snake it only produces more
venom not nectar so as far as Pakistan
is concerned we must proceed as though
as in fact it is a terrorist state and
our handling of Pakistan must be various
and promised entirely and solely on this
fact and in that I think there are three
or four four prong measures that we now
need to take but I wish we would do it
in future already prepared for such
eventualities and other that react to it
as we are doing now the nation is one we
are united to the last man in dealing
with this threat to our sovereignty and
national integrity but I would suggest
that there are three or five measures
that we have to think of now the first
is that we have to make Pakistan
accountable for such terrorist camps and
that has to be done in a calibrated in a
planned and effective way with the
element of surprise but that we mean to
the state authorities and our brave
armed forces to do secondly we have to
run a vigorous and sustained campaign to
isolate Pakistan internationally not
sporadically but a sustained campaign in
particular I think with the United
States whose pressure can bring to bear
on Pakistan in a manner that hurts
Pakistan thirdly I think that very
serious sort needs to be given to
upgrade a great reform the operational
capabilities of our armed forces and
that include
even perimeter security surveillance and
of course our Intel operations the
intelligence gathering operations so
that our own capabilities are upgraded
substantially and the army gets the
money that it needs for these purposes
without reservation and lastly we have
to do an analysis and that is not one of
acrimony but must be done in the right
quarters of what if at all went wrong in
pure gamma so only for this game in mind
that if possible such an incident is not
repeated again so I think there are
several measures that need to be taken
now because we are dealing with the
terrorists period and if possible in
whatever and action we would take to
make rankest are uncountable we must hit
out either metaphorically or physically
and Alaska remember and the gesture
Mohammed see Pakistan must hurt when
such an attack is made with its direct
sponsorship otherwise we have a
situation where they get away with
tactical appeasement as with Kartarpur
and explosive aggression and we are left
finding the response which we must not
do in future we must have a proactive
plan ready to take into account the fact
that Pakistan has the strategy against
us well you've been very comprehensive
commercial as well as general Malik have
also underlined one area where I think
all three of you agree which is to
analyze in the right quarters of what
really went wrong in pull Verma and I
want to bring in the BJP spokesperson
tonight mr. Bhatia mr. Bhatia one visual
today sticks out most is when the Home
Minister the Union Home Minister are not
saying
had for a few moments decided to turn
into a pallbearer and I felt that he was
creaking really under the burden of
guilt today because we know there has
been an Intel failure and we also know
that it comes at a time when Pakistan
has been increasingly bellicose flexing
its muscles continually will there be
accountability for this failure and at
what level drought first of all it's a
very emotional moment for the entire
country for every citizen we would like
to pay homage to the brave hearts of our
country and their mortal remains draped
in tricolor evokes a very strong emotion
in everybody including the Prime
Minister The ministers mr. dad not
saying even you know a citizen of the
country today in the morning there was a
meeting of the Cabinet Committee for
security which took place under the
leadership of marine Modi be they are
very few you know there are very
important decisions that have been taken
and I would like to highlight those
first is that Narendra Modi ji has made
it very clear that army has been given a
free hand because they are the ones who
are expert in the area and they need to
decide the timing the place as well as
the magnitude of the retaliation second
is the most favored nation status that
was provided to Pakistan has also been
revoked
third Narendra Modi ji has also made it
very clear that Pakistan will be taught
a lesson for all the misdemeanors that
have taken place and I think you know at
this juncture to also say that you know
whether there was an intelligence
failure what was the reason would not be
appropriate because I think a detailed
report and examination would be done and
this is the government which is very
sensitive the priority right now is that
Pakistan wanted to weaken us but yes we
are in pain but the entire country has
been united irrespective irrespective of
our political ideologies race
region firmly behind a red line a moral
Lux Monica that it is drawn for itself
and one must congratulate the opposition
also to exhibit this spirit of
bipartisanship I just want to bring in
Padmaja Joshi some developments now at
the Panama K'Ehleyr eeeh we're seeing a
host of host of personalities and other
dignitaries who have made their way
there admit her what's the latest what
do you what are you learning from the
ground there Rahul the Congress
president Rahul Gandhi the army chief
and the a chief all three of them have
already paid their last respects to the
40 CRPF soldiers whose mortal remains
are at the Parliament technical area
we're also learning of the meeting that
took place in the evening more details
are coming out of that well India spoke
to diplomats from 25 countries and in
fact they have said that a very strong
damash was made to the Pakistani High
Commissioner by the foreign secretary
earlier today what was said the heads of
mission were left in no doubt about the
role played by joshimuz which India very
categorically said is based and
supported by Pakistan and it is in
Pakistan that the entire terror attack
was planned the foreign secretary did
not pull any punches and said our demand
is that Pakistan ceases fought with all
support and Finance to terror groups
operating from areas under their control
and that terrorism is an instrument of
state policy 25 countries today were
told that Pakistan as a neighbor has
again and again provoked us we have
shown restraint but we cannot
in the same way father even as we speak
more leaders are now coming in that's
Rahul Gandhi and the Delhi Chief
Minister Arvind Kejriwal and the Prime
Minister also expected shorty
okay let me bring in mr. Vivek are two
and my roof reza also mr. Kazu the
question that everyone is asking is what
should be done now mr. Pawan Verma has
sort of broken it down
general VP Malik Kumasi per have all
broken it down for us
what in your estimation is the priority
Rahul I've heard my colleagues over
traversable and Pavan Varma very very
closely the first point I wish to make
is that we don't have the luxury which
the Americans have the Americans can
happen to leave Afghanistan and
therefore get out of Pakistan's
neighborhood we can't we have to deal
with this menace
we are in this area and we will remain
there and hence to my mind the very
first determination that we have to make
as a nation our political and strategic
classes have to make is about the nature
of the threat that Pakistani terrorism
poses
I'm afraid that since the mid 90s we
have treated this threat as a question
of diplomatic and political management
not as a strategic effect there are
members of our strategic classes who
argue that even while this threat has
been going on we've been able to absorb
the losses and continue the nation has
continued on its path to progress I
think today for the first time I had the
feeling that the pain of and the fame of
this
a ahadith pane of the shahadat of our
brain has really hurt the nation and
perhaps this we will turn now and
recognize the threat that pakistani
terrible's for what it is that it is
strategic and 1/3 of knowledge there
then we bring to bear all elements of
our national might to deal with it
diplomatic military intelligence we will
not and the nation will stand behind
this endeavor I am afraid it's not going
to be easy to deal with it it will be a
long battle but we have to steel
ourselves for it obviously the steps
that have to be taken can't be discussed
on television troop but there are steps
where we can bring Pakistan to its knees
and my last point is we have to
re-examine the fundamental position of
our foreign policy which is that
Pakistan's stability is in India's
interest we have to re-examine Pakistan
is a malignant State for us is it
stability in our interest all the time
we have acted on this fundamental
premise that a stable Pakistan is in
India's interest unless we examine the
very fundamentals and the postulates of
our Pakistan policy I am afraid we will
be we will condemn ourselves to these
repeated cycles this is what my appeal
is to my colleagues these think of the
very fundamentals and the basics of our
policy and examine that after that
everything else can flow after that
strategies and tactics can be worked out
ok
till that is done why I'm why do you
believe will why do you believe if you
do agree wait with a car - why do you
believe that we have failed to identify
the strategic nature of the threat that
Pakistan poses to us
well Raoul at the outside let me say all
your distinguished panelists have made
some very important point there is no
area that I can disagree with them
because I think they have a lot of
wisdom and lot of experience in their
comprehensively spelt out a number of
issues the fact is there is no dearth of
expertise and understanding in India and
unfortunately we've been reading to a
certain set of principles on how we need
to war about in our engagement either
with Pakistan or to project ourselves to
the international community but I I
strongly say that many of those
principles are theory outdated and that
is what I we have often been at the
receiving end let me spell out four or
five quick points to take this entire
discussion forward one is you cannot
have stopgap measures or you cannot do
anything in piecemeal when you deal with
a strategic problem so it is not that we
will first address the intelligence
failures or the the operational issues
in the valley then we will address the
diplomatic issues and then we will
consider the military options everything
is as mr. simpleness brought out as
general Malik has also hinted mr. Pavan
Verma said there are options that are
known our armed forces our diplomats
have not been sitting and twiddling
their thumbs the point is the government
of the day and please remember elections
around the corner so mr. Modi and his
team are not going to be able to get
away with it half-baked
reactions in a sense that you did the
surgical strikes but then you thought
everything else was settled and you got
on with the business of engaging with
rest of the world the amount of
political and diplomatic capital that
has gone into engaging with other parts
of the country that diplomatic capital
has now got to be put to use and
countries that support and proper
Pakistan when the IMF
the world is wanting to isolate it
economically we should stop engaging
with those countries or make them
understand that you may have to make the
choice either you deal with Pakistan and
stop taking the benefits of dealing with
the Indian economy or you deal with us
and then you pull the stops on Pakistan
and let them wallow in their misery and
the economic pathetic states at the end
the second thing is that you know there
are only three instances that come to my
mind over the last decade or more which
have really galvanized national
sentiments to the extent as this attack
one was the attack on the Parliament and
that really got a political classes got
going because for one reason was that
the politician suddenly began to feel
the pain after many thousands have died
in Kashmir because when the Parliament
was attacked they suddenly felt
vulnerable and they decided to launch
our forces and then under American
pressures we could not go any further
whatever other hogwarts we've been
treated to I don't believe it because
otherwise the evidence says something
else the second thing is that when the
attack took place at URI then there was
again a lot of public emotion we
responded and I continue to maintain it
was the finest offensive operation by
special forces in memory since world war
ii which was carried out with exemplary
proficiency establishing the fact that
we can use military force and we want to
extend the battle if we want to
beyond the LOC then we can it is not
just fighting on the ground it is to
expose Pakistan's weaknesses and soft
spots it is so good you greater pressure
on Pakistan to be so I'm coming to my
last point our my last point is and that
is equally important that while the
Prime Minister has suggested he's given
the army a free hand it was a similar
agenda that the Prime Minister has spelt
out for the military chief after the
surgical strike that's a very clear
indication that there are military
options below the nuclear threshold
his fan has sponsored insurgency in
India and we've been at the receiving
end because there are a whole lot of
people in India who believe that any
counter reaction by India will lead to a
nuclear war
they don't understand war and strategy
there are many stages before you really
go to consider using nuclear weapons and
Pakistan can be penalized and punished
without a full-scale war but with
certain amount of calibrated military
action and I believe general Malik will
agree with me Kargil was a case in point
where he led the army to success okay we
can exercise those options let me know
this about time we called their bluff
okay let me ask him as we are getting
visuals of what appears to be the Delhi
Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal now at
the technical area paying his home age
and we're also seeing now the Union Home
Minister mr. Raj not Singh in the
Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman at
the technical area of the param airport
remember there's a wreath laying
ceremony here and after that the coffins
will be moved
I presume by air to the families of
those who are grieving tonight for final
funerary rites now I want to ask you
general Malik have we have me also and
when I mean the we I mean the NDA has
the NDA fallen into this trap that we
make our to sort of elucidated upon
which is that Park stability is in our
interest and therefore it is also in the
words of Pawan Verma undertaken tactical
appeasement before realizing that it
made a mistake and then reacted with
explosive reaction
for quite some time we have been
following that policy that the Pakistani
stability is in our interest because we
all felt that if Pakistan is stable then
there will be no infiltration from the
other side and they will live happily
alongside but that obviously has been
proved wrong
now Rahul I want to say one thing let us
stop focusing on jashub Mohammed are on
je M all these outfits
let's forget let's not forget that these
outfits are working under the ISI and
ISI works under the Pakistan Army and
therefore if you want to cause any
damage it has to be done to the psyche
of the Pakistan Army and that is why
because these surgical strikes that we
took it did hurt the Pakistani army so
whatever action now you want to
undertake it must hurt that has to be
our center of gravity that has to be our
objective and we do any other any
further action as far as a military
prospect is concerned and for that I
don't advise that we just jump into the
fray of course we will have some plans
but there is a need for us to modify
some of those plans to this particular
situation and then go for something
which hurts which hurts the Pakistan
Army particularly in the eyes of their
own people
ok well mr. Bhatia obviously I can't put
that question to you because these are
matters that will be decided by a very
small group of our leadership including
of course the Armed Forces leadership so
that question becomes in fractures but I
do want to ask you many people today are
saying that the one way of rectifying
the situation is to revisit your earlier
hard diplomacy postulation which is that
we will not have any talks with Pakistan
many people are saying that Imran Khan
being the face really of the deep stage
holds out the best promise for a
dialogue
with deliverables what do you say about
this Syrah I was hearing the eminent
panelists here and I would like to say
that they have tried to adapt the
sovereignty of our country there
wouldn't be any half-day reaction and
neither there would be any knee-jerk
reaction yes the experts are looking
into it and we all should be assured
that there are competent people within
the government holding ministerial
positions bureaucratic positions but
what do you save those people who have
been insisting and there were voices
today and some very prominent months
that we are paying for the hubris of a
foreign policy based on heart power and
that we need to go back and start
negotiations what would you say to those
people or I I would respectfully say
that talk and terror cannot go hand in
hand has been the policy of this
government and let's not forget the
policy of the government has also
succeeded in a very prominent way
because Pakistan today has been isolated
also in the international community
there have been sanctions against
Pakistan major powers like the US Japan
BRICS all have always supported India in
our fight against terrorism and I think
we need to have a formal result to
ensure that Pakistan is isolated here
has been a learning of India who are
ruling out a reengagement of Pakistan I
am not the right person to be answering
that question okay I would only say at
this juncture the policy of the document
is very clear like I'll give you another
example for 31 years India has been
actually pressing in the United Nations
for a comprehensive Convention on
International trade you know that we
held a mature in a row that in in United
Nations yes for an evil hand stands
exposed no I understand the policy of
promoting terrorism but there is still a
lot of diplomatic work to go into
evolving a consensus because there are
many countries who can't even agree on
the definition of terrorism now that
aside I want to bring in mr. Pawan Verma
mr. Pawan Verma
what is the way forward dialogue because
many people are saying dialogue is the
way forward you have paid the price for
exercising hard power for yoking your
foreign policy to the exigencies of
electoral politics many people are
saying that today what do you say to
that law lobby of people are those
groups of individuals I say to those
people Rahul that there is a time and a
place and an occasion and a context
photons after you've lost over 40 of
your Braves in one of the most
disturbing terrorist acts which has a
direct link to support from the
Pakistani state yes we don't make the
overturn to begin talks we read we are
not against talks because that is part
of the international diplomatic
framework with neighbours yes but
certainly not at this time and certainly
not under the shadow of terror and I
think this needs to be made clear
secondly and among the many measures
that were talked about today if we
assume or if we proceed on the premise
that Pakistan is implacably hostile to
India and while civilian governments may
come and go the deep state consisting of
the ISI and the army will continue to
target India then we must have to weaken
that state and I have to say here that
we need to invest very heavily in
upgrading our covert operations in
Pakistan unless we are able to do that
right in terms of intelligence and in
our larger tactic of weakening
Pakistan's ability to hit at us we will
be at a disadvantage mr. Kavon Cybil do
you believe that Pakistan
is implacably disposed towards India and
it is led by revanchist compromised
prime minister who we cannot contemplate
having normal relationship with and do
you believe that the High Commissioner
of India to Pakistan who is being called
back today is going to add an input
which is going to take the direction of
our relationship in a different
direction
well there are a couple of things that I
would like to comment on first before I
answer your question one is that I don't
think that we have had any active policy
of stabilizing Pakistan or pursuing this
thinking that a stable Pakistan is in
our interest yes this can be said in
diplomatic terms what we have really not
done is through come back operations
disturb the internal situation in
Pakistan so much in Balochistan Sims or
elsewhere where the Pakistani state
becomes unmanageable to that extent
perhaps yes that we've not actively
pursued the policy of destabilizing
Pakistan but we've done nothing insofar
as the opposite concern of pursuing an
active policy of stabilizing Pakistan
because it is not in our hands if
Pakistan has become more and more
Islamist in character radicalized in his
thinking yes right his complexion has
changed it is nothing to do with us this
is an internal dynamics there and if
they are distinct terrorist groups who
are attacking Shias or MDS and others in
nothing to do with us it's the nature of
the Pakistani State so therefore we
should be clear on this point in the
secondly we have some options on the
table which I would like to spell out
you know but before that let me add
another thing now there is a point that
has been made and I'm very surprised
that you are saying that a lot of people
are advocating that we have pursued a
hard policy towards Pakistan and
therefore we should change our approach
and we are paying the price of that
policy to my mind this is absurd this is
really really absurd because we've had
years of dialogue with Pakistan we've
had a composite dialogue which began in
1996 and continued till the end of the
UPA - yes and in that period just to
count the number of terrorist attacks
that took place true so therefore and we
even separated dialogue from terrorism
and still we had terrorist attacks
therefore this is all bogus this this
kind of self defeatists almost anti
national thinking that we should now
actually go and
you know have a much softer approach to
Pakistan I don't know where this
thinking comes from thirdly what needs
to be done is this we have not found an
adequate answer to Pakistan's policy of
promoting terrorism against us now what
we really need to do are two things one
that we should declare Pakistan a
terrorist state it is not it will not be
a declaration of the kind that the
United States makes but it will actually
mean therefore that there will be no
further dialogue with Pakistan right we
can all we will break diplomatic
relations with Pakistan and also say
that all companies which are operating
economically in Pakistan will not be
allowed to operate in India but even if
you don't want to do that we have I have
another option that we in my mind which
is that we immediately suspend the Indus
Water Treaty and link it specifically to
the conduct of Pakistan with regard to
terrorism against India now Pakistan
will have no answer to this and if
anybody gives an argument that it's a
treaty and therefore cannot really
booty-eight it I'd like to remind those
people the United States walked out of
the ABM Treaty they are walking out of
the INF treaty they walked out of the
climate change pact they they repudiated
the pact with Iran so many trees look at
the Chinese they totally dismissed and
OPD repudiated and ridiculed the
judgment against them by the
International Court of Justice and they
have signed in law of the sea Accord
Convention therefore this is the step we
mistake and there is nothing that
Pakistan will be able to find an
advocate answer to what can they say
because we we will be a very firm ground
to say well some guys will share not
conceding the ice water tourism against
us in the system being the lifeline of
Pakistan would be an act of war and that
we could therefore trigger hostilities
which could spell you know mutually as a
short destruction given the fact that
both powers and nuclear powers
mr. Simba nothing of that nothing of the
kind because we are first of all going
to suspend it and secondly suspension
doesn't mean that we're going to stop
the flow of water right we don't have
the means to do that and even if we had
a policy of stopping the flow for 20
years
to implement that but the signal will be
very clear there no further talks with
regard to our projects our plans on the
rivers that have been allocated to us
and our rights under the Indus Water
Treaty to build run of the river
projects on the ones allocated to
Pakistan the CCS this morning we go we
actually the Indian High Commissioner to
Pakistan has been called for
consultations maybe some of these
options are on the table we don't know
but what I can tell you now is that the
Prime Minister has arrived at the Panem
technical area he will also be laying
the wreath and I we also expect the
President of India who's the
commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces
to also be here in some time there is
Prime Minister Narendra Modi he is
riding now up to the area where the
wreaths have been kept and then he is
going to pay his homage to these 40
brave men who have sacrificed their
everything in the service of our nation
those are the pictures very solemn
occasion viewers
there it is the Prime Minister paying
his homage to these brave men
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
well very moving and emotional scenes
that the Prime Minister paying his last
respects
he was preceded by several cabinet
ministers we've seen the pictures they
will remain forever etched in our
memories it's difficult to bring oneself
to say much in these circumstances
general Malik you've commanded men what
impact would this have on the morale of
our forces
I think it's a sad scene I have no doubt
that everybody feels the pain when we go
through these scenes but then you also
feel proud that the nation respects our
sacrifices and the nation is supportive
of the armed forces or the central armed
police in this case so it has both the
sad effect
indeed very sad effect but there is also
as I said support that is taken into
account when we go through these
incidents these events Maru Fraser
obviously within the forces there will
be a very palpable desire to work
correct the scales of justice how do you
think it's going to be addressed by the
commander's
well Raoul that's a very important
question and I was actually going to
bring that point up in any case you know
in case of the CRPF which has been at
the receiving end on this occasion they
have actually been used quite
extensively across the country and in
fact in common parlance they call
themselves LT the ha PRA CRPF because
they are always on the move and the
reason is that they don't have such a
cohesive system of command and the kind
of attention that you need to pay to
issues related with equipment training
etc so mr. Pavan Verma's point that we
need to further arm and equip our forces
I further add to that we need to arm
equip and provide better leadership to a
central armed police forces which are
really also on the front line of
fighting this war in Kashmir modern wars
are like Rashmi like Afghanistan like
Syria elsewhere we are not going to have
tanks rolling across the plains of India
Pakistan of the scale that we saw in 71
and at a bigger level I want to also
bring out a quick point that you know
while we talk of using the strategic
options and people have been very quick
to turn around and say that we've
achieved a lot diplomatically in
isolating Pakistan actually we've always
been punching below of it with Pakistan
our policy has been reactive and in
terms of isolating a country
diplomatically you only achieve it when
on a scale of 10 you achieve a scale of
at least 9 I think with Pakistan right
now our achievements and the range 5 to
6 because we have not been able to
isolate them effectively therefore you
have the Saudis funding them you have
the Chinese funding them etc and finally
and most importantly all this talk about
nuclear war please understand if you
want peace then understand war and
nuclear Wars don't happen just because
you press a button like dr. Strangelove
but the fact of the matter is that it
takes a lot of military action and a lot
of aggravation for any country to
consider the nuclear option for major
war
games have been enacted with us one
decade and in none of them it has shown
that either Pakistan or India was
willing to use the nuclear option and
Pakistan pushes insurgency and
terrorists in India under that premise
that India is scared of the nuclear
option okay it is a deterrent it will
remain a deterrent but there is room for
action and options below that I'm not
saying you do it on day one but keep
that option open well for now we can say
that the foreign secretary has told us
that Pakistan needs to take immediate
and verifiable action that has been
communicated to Pakistan against JME
that is the JJ Muhammad and that it must
immediately stop any groups of
individuals associated with terrorism
from operating on its soil that is a
demand we will have to see how far
Pakistan goes to comply that'll also be
weighed up by us when we articulate our
response we will I suppose give Pakistan
a few days before we contemplate a
reaction along military and diplomatic
lines we leave it at that the news are
coming up
we are leaving you with these poignant
moments from the wreath laying ceremony

deep mourning tonight India is angry
tonight India demands justice after the
loss of 40 of its bravest servants in an
absolutely abhorrent cowardly attack in
Avanti pour upon Rama in Kashmir when a
Jay Z Mohammed dastard rammed a vehicle
carrying explosives weighing 350
kilograms into a crpf truck carrying at
least 45 Germans and this was a truck
that was part of a convoy of 78 trucks
carrying 2,500 Germans 40 families today
have been devastated a mother has lost
her son or daughter has lost her father
a wife has lost her partner a nation has
lost its Patriots these decorated
soldiers were all targeted by cowards in
the line of duty ladies and gentlemen I
cannot describe in words the aftermath
of such an attack pictures that will
make your stomach churn your heart will
wrench if you are human and ladies and
gentlemen who will have the courage to
make that phone call to a family who was
waiting for its son for its husband for
their father who will call them and
break to them the news that your son
will never return because absolute evil
unleashed on our security men who keep
us safe
apart from demanding payback tonight
ladies and gentlemen India also wants
accountability accountability from those
who govern us accountability for every
single life because if a 350 kilogram
card just rams into a truck
ladies and gentlemen why didn't we know
about it
was the route not sanitized was somebody
sleeping on the job or was somebody
sharing this information with the evil
ladies and gentlemen questions will need
to be answered and questions will need
to be answered by those who everyday
make it their political business their
political Tunde to eulogize terror and
say this is a disenchanted and alienated
Valley what will you answer to the
families of those 40 soldiers today
think about it as I play out the story
in fact the horror that unfolded a
blood-soaked bodies
[Music]
mangled limbs strewn all over
severe parts being gathered bike leagues
from the blast site
these images have plunged the nation
into despair
the death toll making it deadlier than
the restrike of 2016 this was an idea
attack the Shia Pia bus came under the
attack and later fire was opened on the
bus which was carrying the CRP a
personal gesture muhammad has claimed
the responsibility for this attack and
they already had come up with their
posters giving threats that they will be
conducting attacks in Kashmir Valley one

what kind of explosive was are used for
this terror strike a crpf Jevons
who were travelling towards free negra
came under attack and lost their lives
on the national highway 44 times now
salutes the ultimate sacrifice of our
Braves
[Music]
tonight a nation wants payback no more
lip service
India wants justice
Bureau report times now
[Music]
and on the case tonight ladies and
gentlemen if I can ever make a case out
of this I want to ask just a few
pertinent questions questions that
children of these soldiers may want to
ask the authorities may want to ask are
natha's questions based on facts that
will completely startle you over 2500
Germans many of whom were returning from
leave to rejoin duty in the valley were
travelling in a convoy of 78 when he
kills ladies and gentlemen not one or
two 78 vehicles 2,500 lives on the line
when they were ambushed on the Srinagar
Jammu highway in Avanti para so does
that mean that India cannot even secure
those who secure us
India can't even provide cover to those
who were going to the border in extreme
climatic conditions to safeguard you and
me reports have confirmed that over 350
kg of explosives were being ferried in a
Mahindra Scorpio and there was specific
Intel regarding a security threat then
why did the intelligence agencies
undermined the scale of the plot and our
team of reporters on the ground have
confirmed that the Jesse Mohammad had
since November been issuing open threats
of a terror strike in the form of
posters posters that had been put up in
that area then why wasn't action taken
to beef up security in the state why
wasn't that route of these Javan
sanitized how could a car with 350 kgs
of explosives escape the eye of our
intelligence agencies and get into the
way of this convoy of 78 trucks and most
importantly reports have also confirmed
that the attack was carried out by the
Afzal Guru squad of the JJ Mohammad then
shouldn't the lobby that you know
the likes of Afzal Guru be punished
tonight will there be any retribution
for them because ladies and gentlemen
they have written these letters to the
Prime Minister asking for the mortal
remains of abyssal guru to be handed
over back they are worried about the man
who attacked the Parliament in a
dastardly terror attack but they will
never they never ask about our soldiers
come and share attire with their family
and ladies and gentlemen the answers are
not difficult to find while monetary
support comes from across the border

introspect okay and introspect about
what about going down on our knees and
every day I want to mr. Bhatia before I
go across to Colonel Harrison Singh mr.
bata Bhatia mr. Gaurav Bhatia look at
the language of your first white partner
you had shaken hands with this PDP to
make a government in jammu and kashmir
tonight mr. bata bata I want to ask you
I want to ask you what is the political
ideology of the BJP that made it shake
hands with the PDP which does not call a
terrorist or terrorist which wants our
soldiers to go down on their knees in
front of Pakistan and mr. Barr up on
yahoo mail tell you at a time when they
pol United States of America is
condemning this terror attack terror
attack that's taken 40 lives away from
us 40 of our Patriots away from us mr.
Gaurav Bhatia on that day there is not
one word coming from
Imran Khan and these people all the time
want a dialogue with Pakistan mr. Gaurav
patia answer this country today that
unholy alliances for the sake of power
is that what is the Dharma of every
political party in this country we are
paying the price for the last four years
lore of yes
yes nah Vika I agree with the mistress
who she'll pundit that let's not
trivialize the debate by shouting over
each other I first start by offering
deepest condolences to the family
members who have tears in their eyes and
I am praying as an Indian that the brave
soldiers who have been injured recover
soon but I must also say on behalf of
the BJP and the government that yes as a
nation we are wounded by a terrorist an
but we will retaliate so strong that
this terrorist and will be dead because
they have attacked our country and I was
hearing the PDP spokesperson and I felt
really bad as an Indian he referred to
this incident and he said our state our
state no sir you are wrong it is our
country our country has been attacked
the sovereignty of the country has been
attacked and as rightly said by p.m.
Narendra Modi ji the sacrifices of a
brave
security personnel shall not go in vain
and as we discussed this I will not
politicize the debate now occur because
that would be trouble izing the
sacrifice of these brave martyrs also I
just want to assure a nation that is
looking up to the ruling party that we
will respond with all our might and have
faith in the leadership of Narendra Modi
ji and valor of the Indian army as we
discussed this the Prime Minister is
also taking stock of the situation the
Home Minister of the country is having
meetings with people who are experts in
their field and I'm talking about the
Indian Army in this convoy were being
attacked Mr Barra Bhatia where were
these experts then what where were these
experts went 350 kgs of explosives came
in the way of this convoy sir where were
these experts would you like to answer
this country about that question as well
I will I will like to answer why is that
the intelligence agencies the Indian
army with a firm support of the
government work day and night to keep
the country safe
850 terrorists gunned down by the brave
Indian army with the support of the
government in the last four and a half
years Pakistan has been isolated
internationally they're begging bowl to
the Chinese government from the US
because they is actually statistics
statistics and with statistics yeah
playing a key sorry arts or terrorists
mari guy easily up Roy Emmett the
Pakistan people rise up up is yeah but
I'm gay Aker Marco disco beta Shailaja
post oh yeah but I'm gay ki Pakistan aaj
isolated her internationally Kamath
eyeing your answer no because no because
let me tell you as a strategic analysis
these these fellows were onions
oh no whether Marriott for me to judge
yeah but but but let me tell you let me
let me tell you that tomorrow it could
happen with anybody a normal person a
civilian who is moving he or she or in a
group of people a new inflection point
has arrived arrived in the India in the
inner in the trajectory of proxy war and
this is the first time I have seen a
suicide bomber being used like this in
India and and let me tell you I was I
was apprehensive what is happening you
know how the Taliban is getting you know
I mean foothold in Afghanistan and the
Pakistanis are finding their feet there
I knew that this will arrive but I did
not know that this will
I'm so soon and the worst is yet to come
remember just you know few days back
your intelligence and agency's unraveled
a plan of enoch plans to launch coming a
chemical attack against a you know mass
targets in india so if you if you
combine these or all these factors the
no because the problem is i you know i
mean let's not be episodically you know
why I'm telling you this because when
when when seventy-three CRPF personal
hurricane and somebody knows some the
group of the students danced around alna
whole night maybe we you know we had a
different take on the issue when there
was a to create to cry there was a
different take on the issue when you
know the Hindus were you know driven out
of the valley we had a different issue
and now is you say that why have you
have you arrived at this point and and
what is the solution this solution for
God's sake is that what have we done -
what have we done with the proxies
within what have we done with that let
me tell you know attack of this nature
when a highway or otherwise can take
place without the support or
facilitation of people people within and
who was who are these facilitators if I
may remind you observe observe guru now
Mehbooba is so passionate and concerned
about about this man but she was not
concerned that the temple of democracy
the parliament was sought to be
destroyed by this man and let me tell
you her father her father had appeal for
clemency the Hajis I imported magic
tonight and I'm telling you to advocate
his country miss mr. ma gta3 tonight I
want to ask you at least today will you
have any mourning for the forty Germans
who've lost their lives art comes to
come up is - say mafia manga a cabman
observe guru jasonkelly atoll art a a
flick in Charlie's Jevons Omari gay
uncle I octopus
Sonia Mehra my first time agree with
Goro Bhatia ji that it should not be a
shouting match it is not only the
killing of 40 Jevons it is massacre of
40 families on the day of Valentine's
when it was supposed to be read of
happiness it was the blood of these
Jevons who have come from across the
country getting spilled over the Safran
Carabas in south Kashmir towards on the
side of Gateway to Surrey Nagar but the
point is that should I only mourn these
killings this mess a car or should I
also mourn the operation all-out failure
or should I only mount these killings or
should I should I political dialogue
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
dr. dr. John they are you are a man of
peace or that's what you've claimed over
so many years when you've been debating
with us today I want to ask you dr. John
they are when mr. Margit hi3 with whom
you are often in support asking for a
dialogue with Pakistan with whom you are
in support when you are saying that
there should be talks with the
separatists for those who are Pakistan
proxies today I want to ask you dr. John
they are should our head not hang in
shame when people like mr. Majid hi
three draw a binary and actually talk
about conditional morning on a day India
has lost 40 of its bravest sons
conditional morning no morning he'll
never be conditional and I think nav
occur today you asked questions of
everybody including the government and
the government also has not been able to
answer the questions four battalions of
the Sierra going single-file after a
window of opportunity in dice the
sitting ducks I'm not going to do that
the solution lies in eliminating the
complex machine which creates these
things it can be not just done by
surgical strikes alone we have to
incapacitate external aggression Ukraine
incapacitate internal insurgency by old
means military attack for military
attack dialogue for dialogue peace
offering for peace offering it's a
corporate thing and I think here is the
larger question you have asked at all it
is not saying withdraw somebody's
security and they will feel threatened
and there
try for peace it is not that infinity of
giving through security to ensure that
the peace process goes on and I
appreciate this but legitimately lately
today the people of this country blues
widows of these soldiers the mothers of
these soldiers will ask the question you
will gain a basic culture in local
Killian children sitting on me resulting
in Kootenai Mary better Kenya Kootenai
Meerut husband can you put rain we know
III think it is our country every person
tent is our own relative our own kin as
an Indian and I'm more like you have
done thank you for shedding a tear for
us also because our tears would not be
seen so clearly iin teddy agree with
what you're saying the country moods for
the death of these soldiers the CRPF
Chauhan's
as much as we moon when the Maoist kill
them in chapters guard or when they're
killed in the northeast they are doing
the duty they don't deserve to die
without seeing the enemy I - I facing
bullet for bullet and shooting this is
not the way soldiers should die having
said that let me repeat it I'm asking
the Prime Minister don't tell us what we
will do do it do it in a composite
comprehensive thought-out Manor value of
thought of the end lovak attorneys come
and the middle do that please just
saying that you are in the relationship
a strong wave on this strategy as ye
Hoxie when your party went knocking on
the doors of the separatist marking for
dialogue with them
also take their orders from Pakistan you
want the Indian state to bow down before
them go down on me I give all day we
speak
yes thank you for yes yes yes yes yes
thank you for letting me speak finally
after 40 minutes and I do not know why
I'm not sitting inside the studio with
you I don't think he's a good friend
miss Monica I want to make only one
point to you tonight you will hear me
tonight
Jeeva stuff you're talking about you're
right I will hear you with your
opportunity to speak have been silenced
forever they will never speak this is
very shameful you have any decency left
in you mr. Vivek steve-a stuff today you
will actually take back your words yeah
and and give a message to those what
family words who are grieving instead of
coming down to your cluttered level
college and sound stood off notice no
negative level politics man is disgusted
to academia or is disco yes everybody
happy every six months chaotic hots all
right every six month
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
this is the last thing that I want on on
the news are tonight tonight as and as
we are talking up of new politics of a
canary current to October tau terrorists
have attacked the police station in show
PR that's the latest coming in from
there and what do we see in our studio
we see once again warring politicians so
he joins me on the phone line so al
what's the latest information that you
have when we talk about this incident is
as éponine Kagami area where a grenade
was locked on the police station
followed by firing but the police
personnel who were deployed at the
police station retaliated back the areas
under cordon and meanwhile the security
forces have also launched search and
cordon and search operation in 15
villages of Palama
and this is being seen and in the
backdrop of the attack that took place
today on the national highway 44 in a
montipora area of Kashmir Valley Thanks
so Hill for that update the attack has
been thwarted by our soldiers today by
our police forces and I want to get in a
jam Oh suck it once again I want to ask
you this question tonight will you still
talk about your politics at a time when
you should be talking and you
should be worried about the security
forces who are putting their lives on
the line for securing India for securing
your own leaders dialogue we talked
about securing the lives of four
security forces when we talk of dialogue
we talk about securing the interests of
this country when we talk of dialogue
with Tata we talk about saving the lives
that are lost
okay today one you want dialogue with
separatists today every one of them
because the surgical strike is not war
all right because the watch in 65 70 199
resort works this the level is
increasing every day people are losing
nothing else in Fela Kuti you you are
the voice citizens of this country I
cannot the dialogue verbal level they
care
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
you know we've seen which coming in from
booba conditioning that's going on by
Mehbooba Mufti as well as Omar Abdullah
is condemning attached enough through
tweets while you continue to support of
the Guru and terrorists and separatists
and Pakistan supported people are we are
we only going to express our
condemnation through sweets mr. Ginetta
topeka each one of these jabs have well
none of the two twin mainstream parties
they are identical twins none of them
could give a damn about the sufferings
of the people or of zel guru or what
happened then they these are purely
seasonal rhetorical changes as I told
you ahead of the election season the
party which imposed AFS PA or PSA and
put people in prisons under PSA is now
opposing PS
so these are election time tactics and
glimpses of sarcasm of self-motivated
sarcasm I will just you know in plain
and clear film say this that we need to
condemn terrorism we need to condemn
violence unequivocally there is
absolutely no place for violence of any
sort in Kashmir and every political
party every political leader in Kashmir
should say this without any ifs and buts
there is no room for the gun in Kashmir
and the it is not a friend of the people
terrorism or militancy is not the friend
of the people of Kashmir well well
Janene motto I want to also ask you that
those who are shredding fake tears will
they give up the demand when when their
own members of parliament writes such
letters to prime minister to hand over
the mortal remains of observe guru mr.
Junaid motto yeh yeh captital tárrega a
garam terrorists co-star eulogize
carrying a free actually eulogize
terrorists like absol guru do you think
we'll ever see peace or ever see any
sense coming back and returning to cash
me well III don't think that it is
prudent to connect you know the demand
of mortal remains by the family of Rasul
of the Guru with this you know that that
is a completely different issue why if
that is it is important to take a stand
it is important to take a stand mr. matu
you have to be one way or another you
can't you can't be both sides appeasing
this side and appeasing that side you
have to take a stand mr. motto
you can't sail in two ships no no listen
to me Novica if the family of officer
guru legally demands his mortal remains
they have a legal right to do that if
people play politics over that Afzal
Guru was hanged during the tenure of mr.
Omar Abdullah as the chief minister so
if if politics is played over that now
that is ironic if his family demands his
mortal remains under the legal purview
of their rights under the Constitution
there is nothing wrong with that to
connect that with this terror attacked
is a far-fetched connection I have
clearly told you that the condemnation
needs to be unequivocal and it needs to
be very clear and unambiguous is it
unambiguous and clear I told you I just
read a tweet from Miss my form of tea
and unfortunately it is extremely sad
that even when you know more than two
dozen personnel lose their lives in the
line you you have to condemn it and by
at the same time make political points
that is unfortunate and and and and that
shows you know political waywardness and
immaturity well so she social pundit
he's saying
legal rights of absol guru's family I
want to know tonight how many of these
politicians are thinking about the legal
the emotional and the moral rights of
the families of these forty Braves
who've lost their life okay how come
cava okay but Judge hoh-hoh tiene una

announce your television what action you
are going to take can be better prepared
are you saying that it's a lot about you
I'm only saying that proper and very
strong action will be taken
and beyond that I do not think when it
happens we'll see some image or today it
says it by saying this will be done that
will be done I'm sure neither you nor I
will once again be taken by our soldiers
by our Braves mr. bata bata so let's not
let's not get into this kind of a
situation where the government
ultimately decides and the government is
firmly with the Indian Army at this

just the government the entire countries
with the Indian army and with all our

Jamaica lamella international preppy
who's Nebraska many PR net the valium
let's go back to Samia for more on this
ami it's the same Congress president
Rahul Gandhi who in the Parliament only
says chalky that your hair and then he
says that there's no hatred that he has
for Prime Minister Narendra Modi well we
have a third question time and time
again to discuss in the Congress parties
to get more clarity on this front of the
Congress party president but they say
that's all Gandhi is targeting Narendra
Modi but the manner in Lewisham he has
heated the people of India by paying a
middleman in Gothel seen favoring Anil
Ambani but now he does not harbor any
such personal hatred against Prime
Minister Modi and that is the reason why
he went ahead and a hug him to try and
ease and neutralize the hatred the Prime
Minister harbored for the Gandhi family
and the Congress leaders per se so but
that seems to be more than what meets
the eye over here because the we see
Rahul Gandhi using the politics of love
after a convenience of sorts between
otherwise he is making some very
striking attack against the Prime
Minister in all of us teachers recently
awakened a crystal ball syndrome Modi
it's how we have seen and do that so we
have to see how in the days ahead as the
political temperature and the elections
are nearing and whether all Gandhi will
stick to his politics of love or will
the political discourse and lower
further down absolutely but here we are
seeing that Rahul Gandhi is trying to
change the strategy change the narrative
and trying to suggest that it's the BJP
which indulges in politics of hatred but
it is the Congress party which only
indulges in politics of love so Asami it
seems that you know as elections come
this is what we see
otherwise the leaders keep on
using derogatory language for the prime
minister but as elections come suddenly
the strategy really changes the
political parties parties as well where
on one hand you would be seeing that
they are propagating a different sort of
politics but when it comes to practicing
it it's going to be a big departure from
what they are preaching and that is
exactly we see what is happening over
here with the commerce leadership as
well but Anwar has all gone he does say
that yes he went ahead and hug Prime
Minister to ease out the hateful to the
Prime Minister Harper's against his
family and the Congress particle state
but on the other hand we have been seen
her all gun is making direct attack and
he says but we always whittling on front
foot and we are not going to be cows
down by the operational back plate so
all the politics of hatred for the BJP
is trying to carry out against us we are
not going to ask them the same points
but at the teams are all tally asked his
charger and his people to not cow down
and do not back back out from this
particular point and take the BJP head
on so it means to be a head and a bigger
play of politics with both sides not
willing to provide any functions anymore",True,en,400,6,1

gains in procurement of this deal and
let's cut across to oddity who's giving
us more inputs on the submissions oddity
made by the Ministry of Defense to the
CAG if you can tell us a bit more about
that
well the note that has now been to the
report mission that has been made by the
Ministry of Defense to the CAG when they
were asked to submit a detailed report
under the fall deal in that regard the
the government of india in the form of
the Ministry of Defence as entity field
report they have such fun about a sixth
of all existence unfortunately Albion
Waterloo has been the price per state
has spoken for the pricing in fact
people talking about the angle obsessed
view of the top aviation but they have
just put in detail about what really
have been the contact and happens I saw
a bee usage but I don't mean all of this
in the figures of an efficient mode that
has been and further effect to be edgy
they also in detail speak about it more
or less focus on the animal as well
and what is in the ceilings in the
aircraft that happen yeah it becomes
they also have to mind will only be
picking as a report it is only suppose I
haven't you will be focusing on the
orbit of the entire deal so I will come
out once to see eg default actually
submitted but yes this is no submissions
by the Ministry of Defense to the PhD
where they clarified that the reason why
hodges's polish searching because there
has been a decrease in the amount of
money that's being here during the UPA
regime answer thank you what the NDA
government fine life as okay okay are
they the can adjust request you to stay
with me
even as we speak to you we are also
putting out those those documents that
we've got exclusive access to and my
colleague sheikah is joining us from the

a bit more about the pricing that you
were referring to while he was speaking
and how the mo D has conveyed to the
National Audit body the kind of gains
the the the country has made as a result
of this deal yes please like you said in
my hands are the documents which have
been submitted by the Ministry of
Defense to the gortak body which says
that the procurement under the UPA was
bought and bought for nine thousand five
hundred and two million euros while in
under the India India era those
documents were bought for seven thousand
e over seven thousand eight hundred and
eighty nine billion euros and there is a
gain of thousand six hundred and twelve
million euros in the procurement so this
is the document which we have accessed
from the Ministry of Defence in the
document the government claims gained in
the procurement of Rafael files all
right so that's the stand of the
Ministry of Defence while conveying the
details of the file deal to the National
Audit body at least gains of more than
twelve hundred million euros have been
referred to in that note thanks very
much chicka for getting us those input

why is it that Anil Ambani was in the
know of things about whatever use the
Prime Minister will be signing prior to
it was done and now you have a defense
coming in from Reliance defense let's go
across to brandish brandish evasion tell
us what they said right Meghna this
defence by Reliance this statement
rather from Reliance defense comes just
hours after the Congress president held
that press conferences was referring to
the letter the email that round Gandhi
was referring to and let me just quote
from this statement that they've
released to the media they says the
purported email being referred to by the
Congress party is regarding the
discussion between Airbus and Reliance
defense pertinent to civil and defence
helicopter problems under the making
India program it goes on to say that
discussions on the proposed MOU were
clearly held with reference to
cooperation between Airbus helicopters
and Reliance and then in bold it says it
had no connection whatsoever with the
government to government or even between
France and India for 36 Rafale aircraft
so the reliance is saying that the facts
are being deliberately twisted and
reality is being ignored so this is a
direct rebuttal to what the Congress was
claiming Magna well do so on with us
let's go across to other hand also who's
joining us very interesting reliance is
saying that their world this was not in
connection to the
government-to-government agreement does
it mean Rahul Gandhi again has pulled
off another shoot and scoot oh that's
clearly their charge now being put
forward or preferred by the lines if as
a Spanish just told you all the phone
line and this is the the visual
confirmation or exactly a water relies
defense is claiming it says in I quote
now from the paper if my camera wind
could just focus here the purported
email being referred to by the Congress
party is a good regarding the discussion
between Airbus and Reliance defense
pertinent to civil and defence
helicopter programs under the making
India programme that's part number one
then it goes on to say that discussions
on the proposed MO you were clearly held
with reference to cooperation between
Airbus helicopter and Reliance it had no
connection big big denial coming in here
McKnight has no connection whatsoever
with the government-to-government
agreement between France and India for
36 Rafale it goes on to say
for the record the MOU for Rafale
aircraft was signed between France and
India on 25th of January 2016 and not in
April of 2015 from the above it is
evident claims ruffled egg apart in
reliance defense that the facts are
being deliberately twisted and reality
be ignored this is very clearly a
statement coming in from a company that
is under fire currently from all
quarters all kinds of charges being
levied against allamani personally and
the company that he owns regarding the
integrity really of the contract that he
has gotten he says that the Congress
party especially Rahul Gandhi is
deliberately and might I add my own word
there Meghna maliciously being twisted
that's the gist of it you'll have to
wait and see if it stands the passage of

from Rahul Gandhi the Congress president
- all lawyers who are part of the
Congress party against appearing for
Anil Ambani his reliance Kapil Sibal one
of the key lieutenants that Rahul Gandhi
still has has appeared for Anil Ambani
in reliance in the Supreme Court in a
contempt proceeding this is what we
understand is playing out we've in fact
confronted Kapil Sibal about the same
he's given an answer which on the face
of it comes across as a weak and thin
argument but we'll unpack that later
currently we know that couplet symbol is
maintaining its as professional
obligation to appear in this case let's
go back to my colleague but many are
joining us on the broadcast right now
but Miller no matter what couples symbol
might say any is of course good at
legalese it is a clear violation if I
can call it that of Rahul Gandhi's
earlier dicta that no Congress lawyer
should attempt to help assist or appear
for Anil Ambani
couple simple clearly is doing that this
is where we can show you that for the
respondents here are the counsels who
are appearing for Anil Ambani among them
and the first name here as you can see
as kind of viewers the author is Kapil
Sibal there are others like mr. McCool
Roja G there is Chaitanya sapphire
pretty Gupta Madhvi Agarwal but leading
this entire list is couple Sybil now you
just mentioned a third that there's been
a directive from the Congress president
that couple Sybil should not be a lawyer
should not extend his professional
services especially to a case like this
why did that directive come about
because there have been cases in the
past you would remember a third where a
couple Sybil and of course there has
been a clarification that this is purely
in his professional capacity as that of
a lawyer but what are the two
significant cases where the Congress
party has been embarrassed and been
forced to distance itself from mr. Kapil
Sibal and said that he's acting only in
his private capacity
case number one was where he was the
lawyer for the suni Vox Board and what
he had made the second day I've been
told that Harish Nara legal editor has
just joined us right now on the phone
nirisha I believe you did try and speak
to couple simple he did give you a
clarification
but on the face of it the clarification
comes across as quite weak and thin he
says this is my professional obligation
he of course the member also was talking
about yesterday about certain conflicts
of interest I'm sure this is one yes
either exactly but this clarification
you're talking about was when during the
last hearing when I am not today but
last year I had asked a Kapil Sibal on
what capacity you can appear for Anil
Ambani when you are criticizing him out
left out incentive in Parliament and he
said that yes in Parliament I am against
him but today I am appearing him as in
my professional capacity to today even
today he appeared for an Ambani in this
matter in this direction contempt matter
against and Ambani clearly it goes
against what Rahul Gandhi has been
fighting for politically even couple
symbol and all other Congress
spokespersons leaders kill you tenants
in Rahul Gandhi's employ would perhaps
have a tough time arguing and convincing
people that this is not clearly a double
standard Thank You Harish and thank you

Congress president Rahul Gandhi has
asked Camilla the government to correct

that has been pointed out to the

has a sure no innocent will be punished
loin order is an issue to be decided by
the chief minister in the DGP and I had
assured yesterday and let me reiterate
again mr. Camelot has categorically said
that the law will take its own course
nobody nobody who is innocent will be
persecuted or punished in any manner and
nobody who's guilty will be spared
Congress party does not decide these
issues based
on the prism of caste or religion we
decide law and order issues strictly on
the prism of law and order
it's a domain of the prime of the chief

should leave it to his seasoned wisdom

there in Madhya Pradesh is a Carmel Nath
playing his own politics remember during
the campaign he was perhaps one of the
only leader from the Congress who tried
to champion the cause of the Hindus Ram
Benghazi path on one hand the
construction of Mondays on the other
hand so is he trying to play at least to
that community not wanting to listen to
what the central leadership of his own
party is saying exactly mega now what's
exactly happening in multiple nations
that the parameters of invoking NSA is
looking somewhat confusing in Uttar
Pradesh when the NSA imposed her or
invoked own cows logic issue Congress
put the question on this action of the
police and the government of yogi in
other position the same incident took
place in Madhya Pradesh in the
government of cabal not the NSA is was
invoked first in conv on three people
four cows slaughtering following on to
people in agar Marva for cows smuggling
for cow smuggling and [ __ ] cow
slaughtering on total five people now in
Madhya Pradesh the NSA has been invoked
and the surprising thing is that here
themselves the Congress leaders are
opposing this action even the senior
leader of Congress party Digvijay Singh
said that this is certainly not matching
the cow slaughtering of cows mug lling
is the reason of invoking NSA on someone
else and so these are the questions also
being put by the opposition that if on
the cows issue the NSA is being imposed
so this is completely questionable and
we also confronted the Home Minister
Bala Bachchan in Madhya Pradesh Bhopal
he clearly said that it's not the issue
from posing NSA for cow slaughter eager
cow there must be some other crimes
included in the and that a fire but it
was not exactly looking in that a fire

good evening miss Nirmala Sitharaman
Raksha mantra for joining us on a day
when your government and Prime Minister
Narendra Modi have once again been
targeted by Rahul Gandhi and the
Congress party on the Rafael deal miss
Nirmala Sitharaman today there is a
letter that has been exposed by mr.
Rahul Gandhi a letter that appeared in a
newspaper and he said that that letter
is tantamount to the Prime Minister's
Office
exerting pressure on the Ministry of
Defence and spoiling the negotiations
that the Ministry of Defence was doing
with the French counterpart for the
raffle tea
can you hear me can you help me miss
Nirmala Sitharaman
mr. bellusci Donovan good evening and
thank you for joining me your news our
direct hello once again
Rahul Gandhi has targeted your
government and Prime Minister Narendra
Modi for misleading the country and the
Prime Minister's office interfering in
the negotiations of the Rafael deal and
actually hampering the negotiations that
the Ministry of Defense was doing was
this undue interference miss Nirmala
Sitharaman by the prime minister's
office in the Rafael D Novica thank you
very much for having me and I think it's
also very important that you're holding
a co a G a quorum
this discussion I'd like to tell you
that based on a newspapers reports today
the opposition party has raised this
issue to just make things very clear the
newspaper which published this has done
a half-baked job if their intention was
to get the truth out or not on this
matter
I wished driven by the fact that they're
bringing out the truth they should have
actually put the entire paper which they
seem to have obtained from wherever and
not stopped and cherry-picked and just
revealing the first half of the paper
and not the second half after all the
note which they have so proudly boasted
that we found the source based
information from a file noting here we
go the defense secretary has mentioned
it drawing the attention of the dendrix
Amin three simple logic would expect the
reader to say all right what did their
exam on three say so if your
investigative journalism has taken you
that far to get that front page noting
it was obvious that immediately after
that different secretaries the then
and Secretary's noting what's the
response of the minister that then
Minister if only you are really fair and
committed to their tics of the
journalism that you profess you should
have also produced the reply of the den
rock shaman three by not doing that and
by revealing half of the picture and
sensationalizing it and the opposition
party which is anyway on a fishing
expedition trying to call names of the
Prime Minister and trying to say that
there's something majorly wrong in this
in spite of the Supreme Court in spite
of me answering in spite of as
yesterday's honorable Prime Minister's
speech even they don't have the patience
to go through what could have been the
matter there they carry down this
newspaper and try to use the fouls later
that was I am really entree to answer
this a half letter matter miss Nirmala
Sitharaman that was presented do you
think it had a deliberate motive are you
saying that well I can't understand what
else could explain it and before even
uttering those words which you have
actually erased now I can't see how a
half a page of the page it's not even
the reverse site you know it's not even
on the second page it's the same page
which they have sourced from wherever
they have sourced which they've
selectively cropped the first half and
the reference of that noting actually
relates to drawing the attention of the
den rock shaman three and investigative
journalists would at least then look at
what the den Broek shaman tree said by
not revealing it suddenly I think you or
I or any reader would be on right ground
to say what is it why did they have to
hide this why did they have to
cherry-pick
that's where the suspicion actually
raises the question whose music are they
dancing to their mother sita ram beside
the music i would i would
to come in here and say that army family
report newspaper any channel that does a
story will be accused of probably
playing the music of one side or the
other so let me be the devil's advocate
let me let me ask you from your own
answer that you've just given two
questions arise question number one that
somebody gave a cropped letter through
this newspaper to put out which was then
picked up by the Congress party that
could very well have been the case so
who in the government is actually
wanting to give out cropped letters with
a certain narrative to the outside world
miss Nirmala Sitharaman instead of
blaming others does your government need
to look within No very well thank you
for suggesting that but as an
investigative journalists as an imminent
newspaper as an opposition party which
is keen which has been in governance for
more than 60 years or 50 years wouldn't
we want to ask that question which was
obviously at the end of reading that
little note which is written by the then
defence secretary which is obvious in
your face this was a note drawing the
attention of the den Rashomon 3 wouldn't
then you or I or a reader raise this
question saying what did after all the
Dendera commentary say for this
comment allez-vous every government is
for the paper you have an answer the
question of who within the government is
trying
all right that's something which I will
take care of while I'll try to
investigate I'll try to find out I will
find that out I'll check that out it's
all right I can I will do that
but before you print it out before you
publish it wouldn't it be the moral
responsibility then I thought there was
a culture of you know sending emails and
we don't representing you
you have not answered none of that was
done it's a crop thing let's assume I go
with you let us say somebody from the
government has revealed it or something
like that which you're suggesting who
from the government very well assume
somebody from the government I'm not
saying that's right but still wouldn't a
senior journalist or wouldn't a
newspaper of repute at least before they
print it out check up as to what are
they printing out I don't mind
today I can stand up in the parliament
and answer or the government can always
give a rejoinder rebuttal whatever but
what kind of a journalism is this then
and I'm surprised a reputed paper which
has gone through the befores the way it
went through and of course succumbed to
pressure at that time in spite of crying
 about freedom of expression now
succumb to pressure at that time to
suppress that investigative journalism
and hear a half-baked investigative
journalism to serve whose agenda pray to
serve the agenda of truth or so the
agenda of something else what's this
well you're making accusations but see
when I asked you you would want to ask
the question I want to argue you've
raised the question that if somebody was
looking at the defense Secretary's
noting why were they not looking at the
ruction monthlies response okay now we
have the full page and we've seen the
Raksha Montrese response but does the
story end here miss Nirmala Sitharaman
after the Raksha McGarry who has
suggested here that this issue may be
resolved in consultation with the
principal secretary to the PM was there
anything else that came on file after
this was there a resolution or did
differences continue to persist between
the Prime Minister's office and the
Ministry of Defence
nah Vika you may take a tooth comb and
go through this whole process the extent
to you to which you want to to which
anybody would want but tell me in um in
a garment in any garment we're
collective responsibility is the thumb
rule after all this the person who even
earlier some people were pointing out
saying there was a dissenting voice and
all that signed the cabinet notes
details which were then taken the draft
which was taken to the cabinet the
different secretary or the rack shaman
three if they had difference of opinion
would they all have had the cabinet note
go through for discussion in the cabinet
and in the cabinet any opportunity would
have been lost is it before it got
cleared it got cleared through the
cabinet after due processes were
followed in the ministry signature
without the approval of the different
secretary of the oximetry the paper
doesn't even go to the cabinet so what
is the difference all of you are
searching for what is the difference
that Congress party is fishing for and
what is driving this whole campaign even
after the supreme court has given its
verdict and even after me standing up
and showing piece paper of after one
another every piece of paper and coating
and reading out from them in in in spite
of all that despite all that you still
would want to go with a tooth comb
you're very welcome
but then let's also ask this question
what are the objections being raised one
of the milepost which have been
addressed and where are we moving
towards this is a larger fishing
expedition seeing array we started on
this campaign letter how can we retract
now that these answers have been given
let's keep bashing at it and if luck
would have it I might get something more
you know this kind of a fishing
expedition who is only going to harm the
country it's going to harm the
motivation and the
you know the skill and the spirit of the
air force and end of the day whose
purpose or costs are we serving are you
trying to say that something is driving
the opposition some power is driving the
opposition to continue to charge you
with rough air I think that's a question
which all of us will have to ask the
opposition party the Prime Minister
himself yesterday in the speech very
clearly said what's happening point on
point answers have been given the
Supreme Court has commented we have
disclosed everything that we need to
disclose to the CAG after that to the
brace and language with which the
opposition can glow go about calling
this country's Prime Minister chore you
were saying today's newspaper
they've even cut stuck and paste on the
pasted on the top saying
Prime Minister Modi said sure but what
is all this newspaper with the
newspapers name but at the top edition
of their own generous attributes to the
Prime Minister what is all this is this
done with a genuine interest of wanting
to know the truth or is there something
else which is driving them is a question
media should be asking the opposition
not mean I'm on every time to answer
every time to give a coherent answer I
am NOT speaking one one day and another
another day like the figures which the
opposition leader she Rahul Gandhi is
going about blurting out every way one
number today one number another number
tomorrow I'm not doing that I'm giving
you a narrative which is truth and which
is truth because it's only when you're
speaking the truth that you can say
inside or outside or anywhere the same
thing and we're doing that so resident
mother Sita ramen before question your
message it all Gandhi who persists with
his allegations on Rafael deal and
continues to call chalky doubt your head
what's your message to him
no no um I first of all want to very
clearly put up my arms like this and say
I will answer any number of questions
any time any way on Rafael because I
strongly believe the decision on Rafael
has been taken in national interest in
making sure that the Indian Air Force
does not have to got from it in the
eventualities have to have face to have
to face a situation as and when it may
arise I don't know I don't want a
situation of that kind but they should
be combat-ready this decision has been
taken in that national spirit in that
national interest point of view so I'm
not here to advise anybody but I repeat
this line you can wake up a person who's
genuinely sleeping but you really can't
wake up somebody who's pretending and
who's pretending continues to pretend

how things change and we will break them
down for you in a quick snapshot in
January 2017
this is beginning to increase the below
five-year trend underperforming sectors
the above five-year trend decreases and
those that are maintaining the trend
going nowhere
are at six now let's look at the next
and the most latest figures here you see
a massive a massive June 2018 below
five-year trend corrects a little bit
above five-year trend goes up quite
substantially maintaining the trend is
at three now let's look at the latest
situation there comes January 2018 look
how things have changed that number is
almost reversed so something has
happened in just the last quarter or so
in the last six months Novica and this
is really where the problem has begun
because it's good
it is the NBF sees it is the credit
squeeze that happen which is made some
of these sectors actually come down in
their performance and and that's been
the real change why are we seeing the
more of these sectors coming out in into
the red is only because the RBI and and
that's that's the entire controversy of
why orgeat pétain had to do why why a
new RBI chairman was god because there
was a
credit squeeze the RBA was not
interacting with certain industry
certain sectors and these sectors were
expecting money wasn't really coming in
there was a face-off between the
government and the RBI that's that's
waste look at my sector di to resolve
there has begun in fact three months ago
absolutely let's just look let's look at
these in detail and is Amba if you can
just bring out some of the sectoral
breakdown yes look at this consumer this
is consumer economy look what's been
happening these are four graphs viewers
here is passenger sales vehicle sales
down tractor sales down and look at this
domestic passenger air travel down a
little bit and two wheeler sales also
down that's it negative two point two is
down because of the credit squeeze and
that's that's the fact that was red flag
by the government and that was the
reason of the face-off between the RBI
and the government because it was these
sectors that were not getting very
important points so let's let's you know
for a moment be realistic about what is
actually going on let's look at the next
one Nizam I couldn't quickly fire the
next graphic let's just go through them
very quickly because we need to get back
yes that's the industrial sector have a
look manufacturing PMI not doing so
badly but look at this here you have a
situation core growth slowing down a
little bit it's below it's a average
last quarter here you have rail freight
traffic also they're three point three
again middling it was at a high adjust a
quarter ago there you can have a look
banks non-food credit again not really
doing very well but beginning to pick up
so you have a mixed record you have
problems let's go to the next indicator
very very quickly because I I just want
to get back external sector look at this
this is really where the problems begin
exports down rupee versus dollar we know
that story's been recovering just a
little bit trade balance well this is
another issue that we need to look at
and then current account balance very
very important they're also taking a bit
of a dip so all of this is taking on a
shape and look at this the ease of
living very very interesting statistic
here and you can see all of this core
CPI there down job outlook that's the
big one point Nava Quebec one point for
this govern if you
it's been picking up it's a minor minor
dip there but it's it's overall the
trajectory is going up for sure and that
it is really wanting to come into this
debate guys you know this is very useful
data but you know at the end of the day
mr. Modi made three promises and that's
why he got elected in a big way in 2014
his promise one promise was that he
would bring down inflation second
promise was delivered on that is
delivered on that I would give him an a
he the second promise was corruption and
he's delivered to a great extent
although corruption I mean but he's at
the bottom level he hasn't really been
erratic although it because by going
online the Ease of Doing Business has
improved and jumped 30 points but not
enough the third and the main reason why
he got elected the word codeword for
because mojo Joseph and I think both the
CMI data as well as the NSSO data which
was suppressed both point to a very
damaging story and I think we have to
accept the fact that the voters the
voters are upset and that is a budget
like this will not be able to correct
that big announcement MOS finance coming
out saying we'll take care of all what
does that mean it means he doesn't know
too much about the budget here",True,en,1569,1,11

TIMES NOW-VMR Poll Tracker ...,2019-01-30T17:28:49Z,TIMES NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RMdnRsSdaok/hqdefault.jpg,"let's go across let's have a look at
Karina there it is the Carolyn numbers
on the screens look at this this is an
interesting number isn't it here in your
poll yeah
the C check coming up first yeah so we
short-circuited it for a reason because
the BJP opens its account yeah and then
you have au change here is it yeah the
LD f so it's the UD area the UDF area
you'll mix up for yeah
and the LD a collapses from eight to
three well I need to give a caveat here
from the war chest what has essentially
happened in two thousand out the war
chest the bjp-led alliance along with
the s NDP polled about fifteen percent
of the vote
pause Sabri mala that has risen to about
twenty two percent most of it has
happened with a leaving both of leaving
the left and that is why the Left
suffers a dent okay in Kerala where
there comes the votes I just look at
this gorgeous interesting yeah look at
this vote sure it's actually going down
yeah
for the UDF it's not as if it's
increased but this is where the real hit
is now this is a Hindu vote base of the
left which is suddenly deserting it so
shabarimala is actually perhaps this
polarization that has taken place on the
back of shabarimala is actually hurting
these gentlemen more the left than
anyone else and I think I'm not being
overly optimistic here on your behalf
but I really do believe that the BJP
will have a quibble they will say if our
vote sure is going to go up that much
why soon toshite share also go up the
caveat in this projection there was one
seat where the BJP was reasonably ahead
of the margin of error to say it's
winning if you discount the margin of
error
there are several seats like Trish or
Putnam theta and even cos are wood where
the BJP is within striking distance so
if this twenty to one go up a bit the
tiger would leap substantially well look
at the numbers at the bottom of your
screens viewers the India now has opened
its account it is at one the UPA
coursing ahead to state scored the
projections are in Tamil Nadu Kerala
up8 fifty-one the others
the others really are drawn yes yeah
Kerala is concerned for a BJP you have
given one seed but that one seed may be
from Thiruvananthapuram which was almost
at the touching in the 2014 election now
if you see the northern part of column
especially the in and around the supreme
Allah through Shu
for example there are border region
every activity of a Cyprus so we
definitely will have to give at least
three seats to I gave is if you aren't
slowing this is very interesting I mean
I may not be from South India would have
know enough about Kerala in Kerala the
RSS has always had a cada you have not
been able to convert it into seat yeah
what also happens is because of the
blood war between them and the left in
the end they start shifting the words
through the UDF yes no Kelly yes
tradition in Kerala and match my word
please no doubt there is no see allow me
allow me I would like to add to her
Nishant Varma I will tell you so I would
like to act to double speak on stream
Allah is going to hurt you you can't
tell your workers to take off their
black bands you can't tell you animalist
and MPs to take off their black bands
make a statement in support of the
Hindus in in the centre come to the
state then pretend that you have taken
the wrong call say some other dilatory
words your mother is saying something
your party is saying something this is
going to hit and this is ready and you
are not why I have not change the past
I am internship on the numbers that you
had the percentage that you are showing
here expect what she says is reflecting
there because the 14 or 15 percent fall
of the LDF
will not go to the party and tapa
- misty oh they use the echoes handy if
this is if this is the command the
crucible to determine the way the Hindu
what is perhaps going to go then there
is silver knots to call viewers there's
a state of Uttar Pradesh remember there
the maths is working in one neighbor but
the chemistry not go this could actually
be a microcosmic laboratory for what
could happen if the politics of
polarization Ram temple etc the Hindu
consolidated before we take a break okay
let me go to the net state entities
andhra pradesh we are calling andhra
pradesh up Nizam by let's pull out
Andhra Pradesh the under potential very
very interesting viewers Andhra Pradesh
is a state where a man is fighting with
his back to the wall really yeah why
assess our PCP or whatever why as our CV
that's that's it's a tongue-twister yeah
but why is our Congress okay that's that
step that is that is the man's and
joggin Jagan there look at the games for
Jordan ready victory now this this
individual has shown himself to be
amenable
he hates the Congress he's amenable to
the NDA so you will suddenly start
seeing our grid at the bottom of your
screens reflecting numbers in a
different sort of way the others growing
232 viewers because he is offense it
isn't he he how is this working out J
what has happened is last time the Vice
RCP was just two percentage points
behind the TDP BJP Alliance now with the
swing away from the TDP and the BJP also
walking out of the lines he were truly
has an empty field to run to run his
race he gets 23 on 25 the TDP retains
some strongholds and coastal Andhra
that's it so they get two seats Jagan
will be the kingmaker big relief
big relief for the Bharatiya janta party
a man whose amenable to their side yes
yes yeah what happened in Andhra Pradesh
yeah television party which was which
was with BJP till last one year back and
who got every
you know the scheme's from the central
government from his state unless a
sudden ditching the NDA and going and
fighting with the Congress in Telangana
it is going to hit him very badly on
that is like did another Lanka big - why

very very clear that after Jagan Mahanta
t join hands with case he are 5 crore
are napadas people self-respect markets
at the footstep of the case he are every
individual in the on the producer eating
right I think they are casting both MP
of the TDP welfare schemes which are
already here like a manufacturing units
which care forward with employment and
the pension which rise 1000 to 2000 and
1500 to 3000 which is implementing not
after election okay remember and the
bottom of our great is really
interesting the NDA 84 out of 5 for this
leaf rejected that's what we'll see you
P 851 others 832 you would think that
there's a calamity or for this road you
not let's look at the larger picture for
a few moments picture from southeast
Tamil Nadu was a long expected lines in

Andhra Pradesh is cancelling out
Tamilnadu yeah for you p and ND yes so

good evening ladies and gentlemen a poll
tracker is right here with you you've
seen the numbers of the south and
welcome to this very special broadcast
tonight where we are getting you the
election poll tracker for the entire
India
it's our news headquarters it's our
election news headquarters and we tell
you election results and numbers like
nobody else and with me is general dis
same thing and jamrock is going to tell
us where his numbers stack up from and
what his numbers really do mean so Jay
is going to guide us through this entire
broadcast this evening ladies and
gentlemen you've seen the numbers from
the South the South numbers are stacked
up right at the bottom of your screens
India is at a 17 UPA at 71 and others at
another 43 so the story from the south
is UPA and the others where is India but
first let's look at the east this
evening ladies and gentlemen and the
first numbers are coming up on the
screens right here and these numbers are
going to tell you tell us what's
happening in West Bengal 42 seats and
look at the seat shed this is 2014 the
Congress was it - now it's going to be
at I think I think we have the wrong
numbers here I think these are numbers
from another state this is some data I
just clarify the missed this is 34 of
the Trinamool last time it goes down
marginally becomes 32 this is - Safran
go by the color Safin BJP huge swing
it's become nine the Congress was four
it's going to be down to one what's
essentially happening in Bengal is a lot
of vote of the left and some vote of
tenemos la vaca has come to the BJP
somebody somebody's got carried away
this is not HD Kumaraswamy this is
actually Mamata Banerjee we need to
correct that graphics and I hope the
graphics are going to be corrected there
on your on on our screens we have the
numbers 32 Ford Mamata Banerjee one for
the UPN and that's of Congress seat and
nine is where the BJP is going to be
huge gains for the BJP in West Bengal
which is why you've seen Amit Shah and
mr. raw and vomit apology locked in a
battle they're right out there in West
Bengal and joining me this evening uh
let me get in I'm getting in
Abhishek bhakti he is a TMC supporter
also with us this evening
Ashutosh Mishra and Sanjeev Shrivastav
Sanjeev she has some huge gains coming
in what's the takeaway thirteen percent
gain in the woodshed that could spring a
saffron surge that's the word person
shared and Santa really gone up 17 to 30
to become it's got the threshold of
winning seats 30 percent works nine
seats for the BJP for BJP if these
numbers come out true and from what we
saw in South the number the numbers do
look quite acceptable and believable so
and the manner in which BJP has been
building up in West Bengal and trying to
polarize and mobilize their waters in
the count and how all the other words
are kind of going it's just a two horse
race there yeah so if the BJP comes up
with this performance where do the make
up for the loss in some states like you
face so perhaps some loss is being made
up here if these numbers are right some
not KB at this 30 percent incidentally
tallies with all the word shares of the
BJP in the by polls of Bengal and the
local body elections
it's been around semester baapji yes mam
technology is going strong she's got 32
seats even this time around but in an
equation where you are looking at a
third front where you're looking at
Mamata DD to become the prime minister
if those are the kind of numbers you are
looking at 32 might just be a little bit
of a setback because the BJP is making
huge inroads and the big takeaway is the
left completely goes out for
sighing since 1977 to 2011 the Left
parties the cpi-m was ruling west bengal
and now from 2011 to 2019 just look at
the sharp decline the left wiped out
from West Bengal white cloud from
Tripura only got one bastion in Kerala
mister Abhishek Bachchan I want to ask
you is this also the warning signal for
Mamata Banerjee
so now because transform asking the
question so if you see if even if we
assume that the vote survey is perfectly
correct
so if we see that the left votes are
moving lock stock and barrel to BJP and
the vote share of TMC is more or less
intact so the nine seats is a bit on the
upward sight because there are multiple
issues where people are knowing the
facts the fund share of the different
projects like IC das and programme on
the ground sorry yo you know those
things have been reduced ayushman funds
we are not getting and out of the 30
lakh Bengali Hindus have been excluded
in NRC so these issues are burning
questions and we don't we know that till
the time the vote is actually cast in
the EVM week with these predictions are
just predictions but yeah if it is a
search if we can't tell it just a search
but it is a shift of the left vote to
the BJP and we have always told that
there is an alliance between the left
and the BJP but the burning issues that
are there I mean if you've heard
anything more bizarre than this then
please tell our viewers to not join them
no actually you know I am NOT very
astonished with this finger because the
politics of polarization is very strong
in Bengal and now it's a it's a TMC
versus BJP the Congress and and and and
left completely evaporated in Bengal
so the the both share of the left hand
Congress the aunty BJP board and BJP for
BJP to the non Bezier and you just
recall after he becomes the president of
the party Amit Shah said that now we
have to concentrate on the non base area
of our organization and that is east and
south and and and that is the I mean the
goal is to be pan-indian so now the the
polarization we are not talking about
communist and Congress in Bengal so the
fight is now between BJP and and this
figure whether it is nine or it is 10 or
it is 11 that's these are minor things
but it is true that the space which is
NP TMC space district wise it is going
to even a Chopra your politics is
clearly being booted out of West Bengal
once a strong bastion of the viel a
state that you've ruled undisputedly
for almost four decades wipe out is what
is being predicted by gem Roga this is
suni Chopra any lessons for the Left
parties if you left it for mr. Latura
mutually and any lessons about the blow
hot do cold relationship between the
connection both of you are thinking the
entire anti TMC space has been occupied
by the BJP missus you are giving me a
long speech okay you get this pizza
nobody is listening to you in Kolkata
nobody's listening to you these two of
us tonight if wishes were horses beggars
would ride
that's what said I would like to point
out that it is not the left
shifting to BJP rather you saw in
Tripura the whole TMC became BJP and now
they are resigning from the BJP in the
same way there is no such single you
in West Bengal until we can prove that
such a unity will emerge the left will
definitely have a presence don't bleed
or see it's predicted by gem road and
the looks of ah let me get some in the
last Lok Sabha a CPM had to switch mr.
blood cell in one narrowly ah you think
you're going to improve on that
performance reelection kala Bhatia
good evening coming across to you big
gains are not much happening for you in
the south but definitely West Bengal is
a story that's catching on do you think
there's going to be much of an advance
that you are going to be making from now
up until April or May whenever the
polling is held in West Bengal Malvika
you are a terrific mind reader because
yes I do agree that we will be getting
far more seats than what your surveys
showing in West Bengal and let me say
this with some confidence that it is
clear even from your survey that BJP has
become the main party in West Bengal and
it is challenging the TMC and the month
of Banerjee government there and the
reason is very very clear that you know
the appeasement and communal politics of
monta Banerjee the bengali the people of
West Bengal do not appreciate that and
we have all seen that against the miss
rule of month apology it is the BJP Amit
Shah he was there and also our workers
have been brutally murdered there the
issue of NRC apology came out and said
somebody is speaking in between I do not
appreciate that you know we are at a
remote village I think it do you mean
extend the courtesy oh yeah each other
in the opposition and the opposition
voices are going to keep coming but yes
you've read the facts on the ground
and Gaurav Bhatia while we are looking
at the West Bengal story there are two
other important states in the east of
India that you will definitely be
looking at in terms of the arithmetic of
the NDA in the looks about 2019 so let's
pull up Bihar and charred corn let's
look at B hard first that's we have 40
seats in Bihar 30 was what the NDA tally
was it's going down to 25 so Nitish
Kumar and Modi coming together some
rough edges in that alliance five seat
loss for the India there the UPA goes up
from 10 to 15 the entire loss of the NDA
goes to the UPA and of course there is a
no other player left so Lalu Prasad
Yadav gaining from what we can say is
somewhat of a sympathy vote all the
Enforcement Directorate CBI cases
against Lalu Prasad Yadav mr. Gaurav
Bhatia counterproductive Marika I
completely disagree with this number
again because I think one hallmark of
this government has been fight against
corruption and you know Lalu Prasad
Yadav has been convicted by the courts
and people in Bihar have stood with the
leadership that the centre provides in
the rainbow DG and Nitish Kumar both are
symbolic of the development in the
centre as well as in this state and you
know I think even going by your numbers
we still your surveys showing 25 but I
am very hopeful that we'll cross the 30
mark as it has been even in the earlier
election second I think there is a lot
of you know friction between the RJD and
the Congress and where we have settled
our seats
the JDO and the BJP they have settled
their seats and we are coming together
as a cohesive force but
the long strategy look at the numbers
and let me get in both mr. a kibosh my
national spokesperson of the ljp who's
with us in our studios here and
professor novel Kishore Yadav
spokesperson of the RJD novel Kishori
other deep clearly Lalu Prasad Yadav and
Congress some we're making the cocktail
actually work for you in the Bihar
elections do you think it's going to be
the same results that we are putting out
15 seats for the Alliance no no I think
you are you are not going to the point
you know the whole of Bihar after the
mandate has been stolen by Nitish Kumar
at the behest of BJP the whole situation
in we are a changed now the people have
we are again to put BJP and nd out of
power and in 2019 also you will find
they will lose all the Saints they will
they will not gain they will not get
more than five or six seats that is what
is our imagination and you will see that
all the by-elections after Nitish Kumar
has gone back to India they have lost
and and look at charcoal the numbers
from charcoal coming up next and
charcoal what's the story
the BJP the NDA Airlines reduces from 12
to 6 that's a 50% loss and the you'll be
a goes from 2 to 8 Thank You JM m rj
DCPI and we put together including mr.
Babu almirante are putting a formidable
challenge up to the BJP individuals the
plan B for the BJP going to be I do not
know they might just try and work hard
and get Babulal Morandi their old
acolyte back to them alright so joke on
the big takeaway clearly is that it is
the Mohammed month on which is gaining
and it's hurting the BJP and and and I
want to I have got to get in mr. mr.
botch by on this mr. batch by story not
quite working out in Bihar and shot
as well as me is concerned I think it's
too early to say and go buy these these
numbers because reason I tell you the
entire survey and Counting is depending
on the caste combination theory
according to me which is not work
because ultimately the people is
concerned with the development agenda so
that will again come on development
agenda that's the state of Odisha that's
going to be extremely important let's
look at the Odisha numbers and ladies
and gentlemen look at the bottom screen
ticker which gives you the numbers of
the NDA Alliance and the UPA look at the
Orissa numbers Oh
Naveen Patnaik is coming out from twenty
to eight NDA goes from 1 to 13 that's a
huge jump it's also Congress party stays
a non-existent 0-0 yeah so I want to ask
you and I want to ask mister Ashutosh
mr. Rahul Gandhi come magic hug a rough
LD Lord rolls rolls your Chokey that
your hair or the shaman the questioning
or I'll get ya what are we seeing in
Odisha 19% watch again that is coming to
the BJP alone so BJP is becoming an
opponent Runa mean for Thai Congress is
nowhere to be seen
Peter throw up could be the car Iran
radical Bihar Jharkhand South a bit
north much anger though Mojave dikenga
additionally Troy Arisa the vote is
against Naveen Patnaik utter or again
only a ground an alternate or maybe the
Kia Optima P a veto Bobby it's a growing
party Mahaprabhu I know president a
would be I mean a a vehicle or natural
Odisha what's the story actually
actually you know you should not
underestimate the BJP s strategy in
Orissa for the last I think more than
two years consistently sending Herman
the pradhan then slowly this
anti-incumbency what he is also saying
that the anti-incumbency
against have been
but nag but still Naveen Babu has a
charisma still and that's why this
result is also showing that but this dip
again Congress is the main loser yes
like where's banal like we've seen the
story in West Bengal where there are
huge gains for the BJP plus NDA Alliance
BJP going up to nine seats in West
Bengal in Odisha up to 13 seats Bengal
and Odisha under their bed Bihar there
are minor losses Chartrand there are
losses for the BJP more than making up
in the states of padishah and West
Bengal that's the story of the East we
still have the Northeast coming up right
after this very short break ladies and
gentlemen don't go anywhere
[Music]
welcome back ladies and gentlemen in the
south of course the NBA was at its
vulnerable worst but the East has given
it a fillip now let's look at the
Northeast let's take a look at Assam
numbers that are coming up on your
screen and ladies and gentlemen 8 8
seats for the BJP plus that we are
seeing that's the NDA we're seeing three
seats for the Congress party that is the
UPA and we are seeing two seats for the
others that's the Assam story Assam the
citizenship seems to be bill seems to be
what we observed before the BJP yes and
what we observed when we went on the
ground is that there was a consolidation
of even the smaller parties like AGP
losing their words and going to the BJP
as far as the national election is
concerned okay
so join the Casal you know I want to I
want to pick your brains on this one the
fact that the BJP is single handedly and
single-mindedly going up to the
citizenship bill it's it's paying
dividends for them it is beneficiary for
Bengal and throughput also in Assam
maybe there is a reaction in AGP AGP
said that we will quit but you know in
Silchar again it's a karcher area the
reaction is different so so it's a very
interesting and specially in Bengal 70%
Muslim vote
I think highest Muslim more time in this
country 30 percent sorry 30 percent 30
percent
so the 70 percent popular I mean the
population non Muslim population BJP is
targeting that percentage and this
citizenship issue you look the speech of
Amit Shah he is concentrating on
infiltration issue why so again and
again concentrating on infiltration
citizenship issue so this Hindu Muslim
political polarization and earlier you
know you know sent a very funny I am
remains polarization yeah
you believe in the one thing that in
Bengal I have seen donkeys ears that the
Bengali Vadra Lok community so called
this upper middle class middle class
desertion they were there sorry actually
they are very reluctant to be sin as a
pro BJP all this is hama Prasad
Mookerjee state but Bengali has a cooler
and the influence of the where are these
coming from eleven more seats that are
left out of these eleven there are nine
seats that go to the India one to the
UPA that's it nine to the NDA so nine
plus eight the HEA gets 17 out of the
twenty five in the Northeast
you know with between Assam and the
other states start sukoshi Mishra
Congress time so two things first of all
we were talking about Bengal so in
Bengal earlier the Hindus used to work
for Communist Party that that's why
that's how I the Congress started losing
votes share because it was seen as promo
slippin in those voted for Congress or
Communist Party now that vote is
shifting to BJP that's what do you say I
don't know about not East because just
yesterday we had this news that ten
northeastern parties have said that they
will not be a part of her India so maybe
this is before that this citizenship
bill is going against BJP in a bit of a
setback in Bihar but overall the east
and the Northeast story really picking
it up for the NDA look at the numbers
when we started the show the South
numbers were on it was 17 for the NDA
they picked up 70 seats in the east and
the Northeast mr. Pawan Varma do you see
a story
and I think it'd be hard at least I can
say that we will be more or less
sweeping the state the NDA the BJP the
JD you and mr. Ram Vilas Paswan Sparty
we should get a comfortable in a
sizeable chunk of the 40 seats anywhere
around 30 or above and the reasons for
it are very obvious the opposition is in
disarray rhetoric cannot match the
grassroots cutter organization on the
ground yes the yadah vote will go
perhaps to the opposing side and some of
the Muslim vote but the rest of the
wards and largely I think mr. brand
Nitish Kumar when on whichever side he
has been it has traditionally won the
elections handsome men just come in
there as per this poll tracker 30 was
the seat said if you put the Nitish
Kumar and the BJP of the 2017 together
now the combination together the
marriage between jdu and BJP once again
is actually coming down bringing that
tally down 2/3 from 30 to 25 do you
think people are having questions in
their mind about Nitish Kumar walking
out as the RJD spokesperson just said
that this is an alliance that's put in a
government by stealing the mandate of
the people is that going to be
counterproductive not at all I think
that is all rhetoric of the past mr.
Nitish Kumar's administrative acumen and
his transformative profile in Bihar is
such that when you look for a leader to
lead the state or to be the leader for
whom you vote for it is undoubtedly mr.
Nitish Kumar I mean there is no doubt in
the mind of the water the options and
alternatives don't exist
and so the combination of the jdu and
the media BJP as in the past when we
were together in the past along with mr.
Ram Vilas Paswan as together they
constitute of winning entity and I don't
think there is any erosion in the number
of streets if anything the streets will
go up as there is a complete disarray in
the manner in which the streets are
distributed among the opposition parties
there there is no unanimity there and we
have yet to see clarity or light at the
end of the tunnel so the water is more
and more convinced that that that the
only option is a strong mandate for the
NDA mr. Kumar and we are well-well-well
fair point
Shekar Iyer and mr. Raju Gopala and here
mr. Raja Gopalan South hasn't really
held despite your support to the NBA not
too many seats coming from the South for
the east and the Northeast showing
positive signs for the old tracker
indicates apart from the number
crunching
apart from these toll states whatever
you have discussed one thing is
important now every day if mr. Rajiv
Gandhi is willing to speak one like
Congress will be losing one state that
is going to be the formula now let him
speak more lies now the poll tracker
next time when we meet you are going to
see the way in which it goes the BJP
will cross minimum of two sorry can you
agree with that analysis well I see the
South was in any case not BJP is great
shape but in terms of what you are
projecting in Bengal Bihar uneven
Junction I think they are very close to
the ground situation and what is I think
is it's a quite a rosy picture for BJP
but I think the wheel would still battle
it out though BJP is putting in lot of
efforts of course Congress has been
unable to set its house in order in
Odisha that has been there for almost
now I would say for almost twenty years
because I just want to ask one question
at this stage when you've seen the South
the east and the Northeast
mr. Sanjeev Shrivastav
do you think is it thumbs up for Rahul
Gandhi or is it Narendra Modi still
holding the cards close to his chest see
there is definitely some gain for the
Congress party but the problem of
Congress is the different states like
Reis and West Bengal they are seeding
the opposition space to the BJP then it
really doesn't offer well for them in
terms of getting to the pole position
post poll right so that's the problem
which the Congress and ladies and
gentlemen once again I want you to
tighten your seatbelts because the west
of the country is coming up and we're
going to go across back to the board
here and let's look at Maharashtra
because that's where the big story is
coming in from Maharashtra can we see
the numbers of Maharashtra that's the
state where there are daily rumblings
between the Shiv Sena and the BJP is it
impacting like or no the NDA is going up
from 42 to 43 consolidating and this
India is Shiv Sena and the BJP together
together together no that's the question
that you've asked yeah and look at the
Congress party from 6 down to 5 that's
the story of Maharashtra and what's the
takeaway ladies and gentlemen
Maharashtra said to be the BJP super
Pradesh in the left and that's the best
storage this is going to be the BJP
zetha Pradesh in the West and huge gains
Judy it this has happened primarily on
the back of a very politically proactive
administration of the Chief Minister
they work schemes on schemes they've
gone consolidated the ground they have
taken care that every even a panchayat
elections part in the party symbol the
Congress is not truncated to its
strongholds the Congress to its
strongholds in around non-date and
around Baramati
over rest of the state the BJP ships in
our lands primarily driven by the BJP
there's no Alliance given the
muscle-flexing that happens every single
day between the Shiv Sena
and the BJP what's that story change I
will rush to analyze
30 or 32 mr. Manohar Parrikar is more
admired in Maharashtra today after his
letter to Rahul Gandhi that number will
be 44 one mosquito particle coming in
Mahabharata has got more you know the
following and this is an unprecedented
watch share that we are going to be
seeing in Maharashtra the NDA Alliance
is going to get that's that's the word
shared on your screens ladies and
gentlemen 51 point in fact it's going up
to fifty three point five up from fifty
one point three in the last elections
and while the UPA is making gains 34 to
40 not the running in 13% gap in but but
they're not converting enough mr. Clyde
crosstalk trouble if you are backing a
sinking walls what does it mean for you
yes mr. Kristo is there a question for
me or someone yeah your survey shows 43
yes go on
can you have in Erika because I'm
getting at all kinds of voices on my
tell you your is that you show 43 seats
we are showing 43 seats here I mean I it
sounds you laters because I'm sure I'll
be back on your channel when the results
come out and I'm going to actually pin
this you down on this one because 43 is
not the number that they're going to
definitely get because you look at
everyday look at everyday what is
happening between the Shiv Sena and BJP
I don't see any way they're going
together in this elections every day
they come up with something new and you
know the bishop is gone or to say there
are going to get well it's Karenga thump
attack thingy you know this is see this
was porn a chance for them coming
together and you talk about 43 seats
it's it's it's not possible absolutely
not possible it's not possible Gaurav
Bhatia it's not possible says that mr.
Clyde class no mr. Gaurav Bhatia do you
think it's time to be a little humble
with your alliance partners because Shiv
Sena and the BJP have been slugging it
out in the open do you think it's time
to be a little more accommodating
because this combination seems to be
working for you on the ground in
Maharashtra do you want to jeopardize
this because of your ego issues now Vica
first of all there is no ego issue I
think the same kind of speculations were
also made when it came to the Alliance
in Bihar and we also that the jdu and
the ljp are with the BJP and it's a
relationship of mutual respect we have a
very dynamic leader in Devendra Fadnavis
ji coupled with the fact that Narendra
Modi ji will be the future prime
minister because people of the country
will be electing a much booth circle
they do not want a much more circus and
let me share a fact with you that out of
the 20 seats that ships in a contested
last time they won 18 of them so even
Shiv Sena is aware that then they they
should be part of the Alliance
why I have Goods coming very small point
on Maharashtra
Maharashtra our RSS leader from
Maharashtra who is also a farmer leader
has said that they should not make Modi
the Prime Minister only then America's
good draft me BJP had 26 on 26 in 2014
ant incumbency means 24 on 26 and the
Congress huge gains came so close in the
assembly elections getting to that's
nearly two hundred percent more than the
zero they got last time
so massage without media two hundred
percent gain for the Congress party
would you like to celebrate that I would
like to celebrate two hundred percent
also and I would also like to celebrate
the fact that you are showing that
Congress is making gains oh I am sure
that unlike the state elections this
time mr. Modi will not have any issue on
which he can cry and try to get votes
no no sympathy votes no sympathy votes
this time where a mistranslation of my
head was not going to happen this time
what money Shankara it funny Shankara
here comes you think the game on each
other you've got BJP there otherwise you
know why should this condition is
blabbered like that Congress gives early
November he's a mouth water mouth all
right mister mr. Shanmugam you think the
Congress would have expected to do
better in Gujarat than this currently
shows well if they were not expect you
to do better than this then I am
surprised by our the contesting
elections at all they should be
expecting more seats but the problem
with Gujarat is that when they were sure
that they are electing someone other
than that in the Modi as chief minister
it became a close fight now when the
Gujaratis know that they'll be working
to elect prime minister also more the
again is Prime Minister it's but I still
think in Maharashtra and Gujarat the
Congress may do better than what this
poll suggests okay all right not right
not much better
what is what he's saying what's indeed
we say can be borne out probably by the
Voyager the watch said the word share
picture actually shows you the deadline
the word trade already cranked from 59%
to 52% for the BJP and from 32% to 39
percent for the Congress do you think
they could be what sandy Shrivastav is
saying here a bit of a further
improvement for the Congress and a bit
of a dip for the baby I'll go state by
state you're okay if the Congress adds
two to three percentage points it can
take two more seats that is possible in
Maharashtra even a municipal and his
Villa Parishad poll has shown the BJP
streets ahead and they've gone streets
ahead of the ships in itself so the
aligns together
still I believe it's the it's a new era
in Maharashtra it's no longer going to
be a Congress strong all right so I love
watching numbers in Maharashtra as well
why bodies and gentlemen Maharashtra is
the change any
Boatshed in Maharashtra but in Gujarat
dipping a bit in Boatshed however it's
only a loss of two seats that we are
seeing for the BJP in Gujarat as of now
look at the numbers at the bottom of
your screen that's the sovereign surge
154 for the NDA 106 for the UPA 87 for
the others is the story with Narendra
Modi or is it the cocktail of the others
that's going to come together we take a
short break when we come back we'll also
look at Goa and some of the union
territories in that region
[Music]
welcome back ladies and gentlemen we're
looking at the numbers from the east and
the west and the Northeast and look at
those numbers at the bottom of your
screen the NDA now at 150 for UPA at
hundred and six others at 87
that's the tally that we are getting and
let me get in mr. Abdul Razak on into
this debate mr. Abdul Razak on the NDA
making some losses but huge gains in
areas where they've never been before
like Odisha like West Bengal what what
do you think mr. Abdul Razak kana
before before I come to you let's look
at God let's look at the numbers and go
on the Union Territories those numbers
right there on your screen two seats in
Goa
one goes to the UPA one to the NDA
evenly split between the two and let's
look at the let's look at the other
demand view those are the seats that are
coming up from those union territories
that's also going to the UPA it's not
going to the nd8 so so this is the this
is going to the NDA so that's that's the
number that's coming up for you mr.
Abdul Razak Khan Rahul Gandhi is not
able to really establish foothold in the
areas where the Congress was the option
of the regional party now in West Bengal
in Odisha it's actually the BJP that's
becoming the alternative to the ruling
regional party where does that lead mr.
Rahul Gandhi mr. Abdul Razak Khan now
weaker at this point all that I would
like to say is this is just a projection
which will not yield any fruit just by
giving an award to the former president
you cannot expect West Bengal votes you
have not done anything in the favor of
West Bengal that the people of West
Bengal will vote for you when it comes
to BJP it has failed on its promises and
the people of this country will not vote
BJP again now for that reason the BJP is
trying to go to new new states you know
take alliance
from new new parties and it is
entrusting its allies to go ahead and
talk to Maya OTG like Ram Dass Athaliah
requesting Maya RT I would say in the
fact begging Maya OTG to please come
back to BJP types now one more thing I
would like to bring to your notice the
Prime Minister himself said in the
strategy meet that the Modi magic will
not work this time it is up to you to
not depend on so please go ahead
depend on me
he said that okay all right I love more
about you to respond
Novica in your survey one thing is clear
that when we are retaining the important
states like Gujarat Maharashtra and
others we are also making a very strong
inroads into states like West Bengal
Odisha and even in northeast we are
doing very well it clearly shows that
Narendra Modi ji has done a lot of
development work and it is now paying
dividends to the BJP and the NDA and I
you know sometimes pity my opposition
panelists when all that they have to say
is that investing goal also they want to
blame the BJP whereas in West Bengal we
all know how communal politics has been
added speak and RC implementation which
was taking place by the BJP government
which Supreme Court was monitoring month
apology came out to say there will be a
civil war there will be blood buck and
the citizenship bill that has been
introduced it is clear from the numbers
from Assam that it is helping the BJP
because people in our country do not
want illegal immigrants entering our
country and eating into
resources and therefore investing goal
in the northeast it will pay rich
dividends to the BJP as it is care from
your survey as well well mr. Pawan Verma
mr. Pawan Verma I want to ask you what
are the takeaways that you see from this
West and East story that we are putting
out here on a poll tracker mr. Pawan
Varma Maharashtra Gujarat virtually
intact and huge gains in West Bengal as
well as in Odisha a slight setback in
bihar and jharkhand how do you see the
overall picture for the NDA at the
moment I think there India is in a lead
position but I think it is Janak in
politics never to underestimate the
opposition it's only fair to assume that
after four and a half years of being in
power they will not
[Music]

again when everyone and I mean everyone
is in anticipation demanding hoping
praying that the budget has a little
something for them it has been my
limited experience of covering budgets
my first full-blood full-fledged budget
was in 2009 I have found that the common
man / woman the proverbial arm aadmi
almost always gets the rough end of the
stick but this show is not about
expectations from the last budget of the
movie Sarkar
it is rather about what the movie Sarkar
has achieved all the lack of it in the
past four point five years has multi
naam extrude to be a bane or a boon for
the common man does the report card of
the Moody Sarkar reflect the BIGBANG
reforms that candidate moody had
promised his India's economy better off
or worse after 4.5 years of a simple
majority government and to help me in
this near impossible task of producing a
22-minute show on the state of India's
economy there are four eminent panelists
tonight joining me will besides afar
Aslam national spokesperson of the VAR
Teacher of the party also with us is
good sir and das economist Sunil alagesh
chairman of sky Advisers also an
economist in his own right and P and
Vijay will be joining me in just a bit
he is also an economist thank you all
for being with us let me start with good
charandas if I could mr. das the
big-ticket reforms of the Modi sir car
promise when Prime Minister Modi was
candidate moody how much of that do you
think the government has achieved also
if we count the monetization as a big
bang reform did it actually achieve what
the government set out to do well that's
a good way to start
I think mr. Modi made three promises and
we had one hope the first promise was
the whole the word because was a code
word for jobs and I would rate him as C
or C - even in creating jobs the second
promise was to bring down inflation and
I would rate that him as a he has done a
he or his good luck has resulted
in an inflation which had been
double-digit coming down to 3% and the
third promise was corruption and I would
rate him as B+ because he made an made a
significant effort also and also there
at the top levels corruption we've not
had any major corruption scandals so
interesting a lower level most of them
if you look at the ease of doing
business that has jumped 30 point I want
to come to you on this because that is
on God online and the lack of corruption
yes mr. das allow me now held one second
allow me to come in here for one second
I I just want to go across to us an
oenologue on this it's a very
interesting way of starting a
conversation mr. a lager and let me just
give you a couple of details that of
course are in the public domain it's a
fact that gross financial savings for
the household sector as a proportion of
disposable income grew significantly
nobody can deny that from FY 17 18 to
from nine point one percent to 11 point
one percent that's nobody's really
doubting that but it's also a fact mr.
Alec that household debt increased to
thirteen point five percent of the GDP
in 2018 that was last year
as opposed to eight point five percent
in 2012 having said that while gross
savings may have gone up the question is
are Indians really saving enough the the
Indians that Narendra Modi ji promised
to pull out a poverty give a better day
achieved in to has that really happened
mr. Alec you know it's it's two ways of
looking at it
when you say debt a lot of people have
started using credit cards so they start
paying about 45 days after they finished
spending so do you call that as debt or
don't you call it as debt is another
question
all of America all developed countries
work out their situation on personal
debt in the farmers is a separate issue
and if you are talking about an overall
India debt
I don't think households have gone into
major amounts of debt and I only come
from the FMCG industry which has seen an
11 percent growth in volume 14 percent
growth in profits so people are spending
today what happen
is that every the younger generation
there are a hundred million of them
that's the critical part 18 crossing the
age of 18 and voting for the first time
are 100 million and they are not
interested in saving so the saving is
coming from the older generation the
spending is coming from the younger
generation and you got to fully
understand the situation before one
makes a sweeping statement that look has
he achieved or has he not achieved but I
will agree with good Sharan employment
is the main area where he has not
succeeded and that is where I think the
focus has to be taken but how much did
we expect in four four and a half years
that's another question
well mr. Alec we all agree we'll both
agree I think everyone on the panel will
agree when Prime Minister Modi became
the Prime Minister expectations were
perhaps you know unexpectedly high and
who could blame the ama me i want to go
across to pn Vijay also see their
economics on the panel I believe Zafar
Islam is also joining us right now mr.
Vijay the middle class is middle India
hurting as a result you make it you can
you can say as a result as a result of
whatever mo dynamics might be I'm not in
favor of putting terms like more dynamic
sets etcetera but I've been told that so
far Islam is with us not me and Vijay
mr. Vijay will wait for you suffer Islam
is middle India hurting and I I want to
point out the monetization to you
something the government says or said at
the point at that time was a big bang
reform then it changed goalposts saying
this is all about digitization to this
day sir we are getting reports from cm
ie and other outfits which suggests that
the lingering effects of D monetization
might be shrugging off as of now but it
hit the economy in a way that it's been
difficult to recover from how would you
answer that question mr. Islam C D
monetization you cannot see in isolation
you have to see all the structural
reforms have been undertaken by the
Honorable Prime Minister and how the
economy which was a one of the five
fragile economy in 2013 it's a very
strong economy today of course that is
PR primarily because the dissent which
has been taken by the government
government was important it was
something which necessary
bring back the economy in order and also
to push the economy to grow as it is
growing now secondly what is important
if you just see the day monetization
alone it the Honorable Prime Minister
has achieved many objective by his
motivation in the interim did you only
ever see me sexy unorganized sector and
and many people still believe that it
hasn't fully recovered
MSM E's Duke perhaps the worst hit after
an unorganized die I say you have to see
their statistics you have to see their
statistics the GDP growth is the right
of a set of statistic one has to see and
how of course we had we had admitted
even at that time and even today I will
say on your channel that it was very
well known to the government that once
you take these kind of a structural
reform feed GST b8d monetization it is a
migration of from once set pattern to
another like for instance GST from one
set a set pattern of taxation to we have
magnitude in another okay I want to ask
I want to ask one last away yeah but
because not as the monetization which
Islam that will push the economy to go
down the monetization was followed and
rather quickly by the implementation of
the GST while both in theory are great
ideas and are one of our graphics mr.
Gutierrez says the good bad and ugly of
Medina anomic sand the other graphic of
course also says how did these steps
particularly hit the aam aadmi middle
India common man whatever you want to
call it the fact stream is that GST is a
great idea every government before Modi
government had advocated it but was the
implementation so quickly after the
shock of D monetization perhaps didn't
really gel well with the economy is that
a fair statement to make Kutcher and us
yeah yeah I think so I think that really
the D monetization I think was a mistake
but the GST is a very good idea but
again it's it had it had a poor start
but I think now it's been fixed and GST
will go down as one of the great
achievements of this government the real
problem
is that from the beginning there was not
the kind of single-minded focus on jobs
that they should have been if I had been
promising jobs in my campaign and for
example just just look that the GST on
bill that largest creator of jobs in
India is housing and they put housing
materials like cement and paint etc in
the 28 percent bracket of GST I mean the
left hand didn't know what the right
hand was doing then
moreover the the problem of jobs in
India is not the problem of unemployment
it's the problem of underemployment
Indians are looking for better quality
jobs highly productive distinct those
are mister from the US between
unemployability or underemployment so if
there is I would like you to elaborate
it yeah sorry did you ask me
yes mr. das I wanted to know and I'm
sure my viewers do unemployability and
underemployment are not the same thing
there is a difference and what is the
distinction here yes yes the the
distinction here is that everybody in
India has some kind of job but the you
what what people were looking for is
better quality highly productive better
paying jobs and therefore our
unemployment statistics are terrible but
that see the best data we have is the
CMI data correct and the CMI date it's
interesting that you mentioned
unemployability
today sir not today as we speak mr. das
there is a huge controversy about two
people who were resigned from the NSSO
citing the government's inability or
reluctance to table your jobs data now
which I go well the Parliamentary
Affairs Minister says new job he'll make
sure that that there is released by by
this evening but I want to go back to
Sunil alig and I want to talk about NPA
sir and again I keep talking about
middle India and the reason I keep
talking about middle India mr. Allen is
because there is this perception if not
- true there is a large perception out
there that it's also a source of
frustration mr. Allen you'll agree with
me on this there were accusations of
indiscriminate lending by banks between
the years 2008 and 2014 which is au
Pierre
understood and absolutely right perhaps
in some points this was when the UPA was
in power mr. Alec but what about the
rising NPS under the NDA as per our bi
data gross NP r--'s of public sector
banks have increased from 2.7 lakh crore
on March 31st 2015 to 8.9 lakh crores in
2018 that's more than a 300% increase
sir now the question that it throws up
is after the monetization which did
cause hardship for the common man
queuing up and whatnot and restrictions
on their own money you are now using
taxpayer money to actually recreate
capitalize banks and that that can be
construed by some people as as hurting
the middle class hurting the aam aadmi
well bank accounts in the banks why
would why would any government do that
you know I I look when the amount of NPS
have gone up you have to evaluate
whether new lending took place after
2015 or more and more is being
discovered of lending before 2014 most
of the NPS that took place was before
2014 as they are being discovered the
amount is increasing so don't blame the
Modi government for it Modi government
is fact is unearthing a lot now the
middle-income group as far as you are
concerned the perception is that nothing
has happened
the and to some extent they are right
but the reality is a lot of work has
been done so the question is can the
government now bring about the reality
in their communication to change this
perception because the middle income
group is not really interested in the
NPA's in the real sense of the term I
mean it's great news channel reading
whether X is coming back or so and so
it's caught but most of them want to
know how does it affect them personally
is the cost of travel coming down yes
everybody is traveling by air is the
cost of would come down by a large
mistake yes they are they're spending
more money yes with you now one second I
just finished tax how many people in the
middle income group are paying tax one
second so today if you talk about taxes
look at the large amount of
middle-income group are really paying
hardly anything in taxes if you look at
the amount it's always way but the power
was later that night is wider in taxes
that's what finance minister general
past nine months and I won't ask us a
further slum before I go back to good
sir and that's on this the perception is
a mr. Alec of course spoke about people
having different perceptions that can be
factored in I don't agree I don't
quarrel with that at all but mister for
Islam the perception which is half the
game in Indian politics is that you are
rewarding banks for their own profollica
see after having been part active
participants in the worsening NPA crisis
during the UPA era number one number two
mister Islam the perception again is
that you are punishing the common man
whose money you are using to infuse
capital into some of the bags there are
worse than the NPA classes in itself how
do you counter that perception if I will
I will require one and a half minute do
not interrupt me I will give you I will
answer both first of all let me tell you
about the bank during UPA time since
1947 till 2007 only at the bank total
lending or standing till 2008 or 2007 it
was 18 lakh Road and between 2008 I
myself was a banker and I know the whole
discriminately the bank was lending at
that point time purely because of the
intervention for the political party
dead jet birth at the Foresters office
the eight eight years or seven years
they have lent three times more than
what they had what had been lent since
independence till 2008 so 55 lakh was
the outstanding loan till since our
government has come and if you just do
it simple analysis since all the people
your people who are watching must
understand the corner must be
understanding the Congress and the
panelists that if you just do a simple
analysis a discount with the discounting
rate and of the loan which has been
dispersed
during this eight years it that is used
that discounting rate and see the a bit
are negative in fact not both of the
loan
sixty percent loan now
just like it I said don't interrupt
place 60% lawn was not in a position to
even pay interest forgets about the
amortization so that convert it
discriminant lending was then what
expect you from these bankers bankers
have given the loan and you Europe
you're blaming Bhushan like a banker sir
I don't dispute making out to visa with
no respect to the gaya in speak on one
second sir
no I just spoke with like a - banker sir
I appreciate that but let me let me let
me tell you how many jobs were lost by
CMI data' sir post d monetization i want
to go back to decision because allow me
sir please allow me culture and das
wants to come in good sir and thus more
than 1.5 trillion jobs stood one point
five million jobs were lost between
january 17 and 17 a likely result of d
monetization the government may claim
the demurrer decision will be a
long-term success nobody can grudge them
that the fact is short-term effects were
harsh on the indian public in 1998 of
the money was returned to the banks can
good sir and thus the government blow
its trumpet or continue to blow its
trumpet on d monetization and say that
look long-term goals will be achieved no
matter what yes well I think as I said
already I think the monetization was a
mistake no government should give the
sort of pain that this government gave
to the ordinary person but I think I
want to come back to say that the best
achievement of this government is the
insolvency and bankruptcy so absolutely
now it took a long time
this NPA problem you were just talking
about with Sunil alog and so on that
problem should took three and a half
years to come to grips with it that was
too long and also this was a golden
opportunity of this government to
privatize some of the worst public
sector banks you know there are no
country no democratic country as
70% of his assets controlled by the
public sector and therefore this was a
chance because there are some good
public sector banks but they're rotten
ones too and this was an opportunity
like Air India of course earlier they
fail to privatize but they should have
at least tried here to bring down the
government equity so I would say that
there is a it's a mixed story ok
insolvency law is now finally coming to
grips with this twins balance sheet
problem and a lot of the promoters are
very worried and it's very good what
what is happening there but at the same
time you know you have to you can't have
a banking sector that is bleeding the
way this ok so let's get back to macro
renting out a taxpayer let's get back to
macro that has to does if you allow me
if you allow me I want to go back to
Sunil I like on this one
Sunil ugh if I could ask you a simple
question no jargon here have the
so-called big-ticket reforms of the Modi
government touted or otherwise for
example the IBC I believe forever for
the Fuhrer matter of fact the IBC is a
great success I think the government
should toot its own horn and IBC because
the very substantial achievement but
overall have big-ticket reforms of the
NDA government under Narendra Modi had
the desired effect on the ground yes or
no sir look I mean if the answer will be
yes and no because the big-ticket
reforms have been taking place in the
last 12 months or so except the
monetization I agree with good Sharon it
shouldn't have taken place we are still
struggling with Kovach on that but all
the others if you expect big-ticket
reforms to give you immediate results
that in itself will be ridiculous it's
going to come in the next one to two
years so to that extent the evaluation
of big-ticket reforms takes its time
enough but the point of actually making
all public sector units you know the if
your talk on macroeconomics I think the
government's obsession with fiscal
deficit keeping it at three point three
percent and RBI is absolute obsession of
keeping inflation below 4 percent
fair enough ridiculous in a growing in
mr. Allen
another guess or joined by another guest
mr. Allen it's slightly late in the
program but I do want to I explore the
opportunity of getting P and Vijay to
speak to us p.m. adjacent if you're
welcome to the program I have about two
minutes left and I'm going to ask you a
modified question sir we are talking
about Moe Dynamics 4.5 years hits and
misses do you believe that in the past
4.5 years
ma genomics and I'm not okay with the
term but I've been asked to you use it
has Modi na mix hurt middle India or has
it helped middle India by middle India
of course I mean the proverbial almost
fabled a madman
well it surely has not helped middle
India because middle India is just where
it is on a bigger picture on the more
dynamics itself I mean I feel he has
done something in terms of connectivity
better roads and better infrastructure
and so forth but it was such a great
opportunity which I think Modi lost here
a massive majority after Rajiv Gandhi he
didn't have nobody else had that type of
majority and the might the original
Dharma BJP was a free economy but I did
not see anything big-ticket GST was a
good thing but it was a continuation
after about 10 years efforts I didn't
see the PSU banks being privatized I saw
some shares hardly any disinvestment
yeah hardly an industry investment and
most importantly you know the much
touted IBC I don't think Ivy sees the
success I mean people who don't know
much about IBC say IBC is a success but
I can tell you I can give you pages
about it
they Psel and PS have not come down and
a few two or three companies have been
sold
none of the real estate companies have
been sold there are about 8,000 cases
pending nothing is working out in in in
the in the area of bank loans the banks
are a mess here okay and and so I would
say connectivity good digital India
disaster smart India deserves okay Ganga
disaster I'm very short in time I have
to start rounding up more because I'm
very short on time unfortunately I could
debate this all day but that for that of
course is not possible I do thank PN
Vijay for joining us up for Islam as
well
and thus and Sunil alig and before I
before I closed the program I would like
our four guests to do a thumbs-up or a
thumbs-down
on four point five years of Modi
government and more dynamics PN which a
thumbs-up or thumbs-down
well I will say no that's a thumbs up or
thumbs down sir okay thumbs up alright
thumbs up for woody and not makes the
SUNY lilac thumbs up or thumbs down
thumbs up thumbs up from mr. alagesh
well goocher and thus I think might just
give us a middle sort of ground there
thumbs up or thumbs down middle
all right middle brown and I will give
us a thumbs up so I believe it again by
I believe it three and a half I guess
you can't just all right simplify it for
a television audience who doesn't
necessarily understand economic jargon I
must thank all of you for joining us

nLabaE-Lrog,"BJP MP Subramanian Swamy says, &#39;Very happy with the governments move on Ram Temple&#39;","'I think this is a major beginning and I am very happy that the government has taken this step', says BJP MP Subramanian Swamy ...",2019-01-29T13:17:12Z,TIMES NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nLabaE-Lrog/hqdefault.jpg,"dr. Subramanian Swamy now joins our
broadcast so thank you for speaking two
times now once again on the big story
that we broke at 8:57 this morning I
want to begin by asking you dr. Swamy
what do you make of the government's
move well I it is broadly in keeping
with what I had said from the beginning
that we don't have to worry about this
titled suit at all let them take 20
years 200 years it doesn't matter
there's enough undisputed land on which
the government can start construction
the only difference is that government
has now sought the permission of the
Supreme Court to go ahead with the
distribution of the non disputed land
for which is largely owned by Ram
Janmabhoomi in Yosemite which is largely
Vishu in the body shed and I'm hoping
that the Supreme Court will immediately
granted because the original stay order
was put in at the time when watch pie
was the prime minister on the promise
that the Alaba the High Court judgment
is very is imminent and the supriya the
earliest judgment of 1994 Farouk ease
judgement constitutional ban judgment
they also said that this land
nothing will happen till the suit is
disposed of in al-abaad so basically
there is nothing now for the Ram
Janmabhoomi Niassa Metis land to be used
for building all other parts of the
temple the sanctum sanctorum has to be
built worthy where the Masjid once stood
and that there is already a temple and
puja is going on and to build a new
modern temple on that spot will await
the court judgment on the title suit and
anyway we have nationalized it so all
that they will get the title people will
get whoever gets the title will get
compensation and nothing else so I think
this is
a major beginning and I am very happy
with the government has taken this step
you call it a major beginning sir but
the Muslim side is saying their
contention is that you can't look at the
undisputed land in isolation well they
haven't read the judgment that means of
Farooqi as well as the subsequent
bourree
asalaam bore a judgment and a swamp or a
judgement in fact I mean petition in
fact I had later on asked for relaxation
for building parking lots and restrooms
and toilets and water for water water
coolers and so on and then of course a
lava that I caught had agreed to that so
I don't know how what they are talking
about they have no right to the
undisputed land from the day one it was
unuseful and the only question was that
the title suit of Alaba should be over
and that is over now sir do you think
it's a it's a stunt being played by
political parties on Hindu sentiments
because many believe that the UPA should
have done this right after the 2010
allama the High Court judgement and the
NDA shouldn't have waited waited for
four years they could have done it in
2014 by only a hundred percent agree and
even this has been done on the pressure
of all US of A Bug's you see and we are
I in the only positive and constructive
suggestion was given by me instead of
waiting for court I knew that the
ordinance route would have been stuck up
in Rajya Sabha so therefore I thought
the only ways the correct ways is the
way of studying the construction in the
undisputed land and that is what
ultimately the government is agreed to
do sir is this petition do you believe
is centres last-ditch attempt or
desperate attempt to make up for its
inability to resolve the Rahman the
dispute
well IIIi would say that the courts
should also look at it in the larger
perspective because if the court delays
this and all gives a negative order I
would be very difficult for any
government to control the mobs of
shadows and bugs invading that land and
starting to build a will the temple
themselves I mean I don't want the
Anarchy to take place and the courts
also realize that there are some
judgments which are manageable and with
some judgments which are not manageable
and we have a small peep on what
happened in in the Sabri Malay also so
the court must know their large
sentiment of the people the justices on
the side of the Hindus there's no
question about it after all there was a
temple and the similar house said if
there was a temple we'll give the land
to the Hindus at that time the Supreme
Court did not object to it well Rutter
Swamy boys as it is in the judgement so
I yeah yes point well made sir I
understand that one last question before
we let you go by opposing this petition
by the centre is the Muslim soundness
side now claiming ownership of the rest
of the land also Muslims cannot claim
the rest they who do they represent
they represent the defeated party in the
six hundred years of struggle between
Islamic rule and the Hindus how can they
claim and they have those of them who
didn't like here as Hindus they got
pockets lon so today they can't turn
around and say that land which belongs
to the Lord Rama is something that we
can contest they should they get they
should get real they must know that this
country is a continuing civilization
right dr. Swamy thank you for joining
your joining us here on times now and we
leave it at that for now the channel

you the biggest voices the biggest news

also a poll ladies and gentlemen Paul on
this big question

poll is stacked now it's 81% who think
it's a genomic Joomla and 19% who think
it's a game-changer the debate coming up
you're watching the news hour at 9:00 in
debate number two all times now a super
prime time
so our panelists continue to be with us
and I want to ask you mr. Vivek srivasa
yeah do you actually believe that this
minimum income guarantee is something
that can be implemented India's GDP is
forty four point three three lakh crore
rupees the minimum income guarantee at
seven thousand six hundred and twenty
rupees per year as per the economic
survey calculations of the 276 million
up BPL families below the poverty line
families this will mean another
additional bill of two point one lakh
crore rupees that's five percent of the
GDP right is it implementable yes it is
implementable and right now I don't
think Rahul Gandhi is in power he has
just made a statement that needs to be
consolidated they must have done some
planning before he released these
figures I am sure and I feel it is
necessary that what Rahul has said is
implemented the Left Front the
Communists we have already always stood
for the empowerment of the poor with the
BJP doesn't know they know only the
embodies then only the adonys the Tatas
the villas the Motta's so now there's a
huge population in this nation you know
they were very arrogant when we used to
talk of farmers we went to Mumbai we
went to Ramallah Madan they were tell
that farmers you made them march Assam
tomorrow and John organised it we
invited Rahul Gandhi we invited Farooq
Abdullah and three states is what they
lost so now that arrogance is slowly
going to come down now they are still
very arrogant you know they feel that by

free meal to a healthy person well for
one minute is weak one minute can I
complete plea meal to a healthy person
who has not worked for it in some honest
way and if I have the power I should
stop every sad watt aware free meals are
given he said how nice and wise would it
be if the donor were to open
institutions where they would give field
three meals under healthy clean
surroundings to men and women who work
for them the only rule should be no
neighbor no meal so givi are not Samarra
GB and narsimha Rao is Rahul Gandhi
going against the teachings of Mahatma
Gandhi doughnut man Rahul Gandhi

black-and-white proof of I Kashmir is
burning out well times now has managed
to access the diary of Alaska terrorists
in his own handwriting which exposes
Pakistan's nefarious plot to brainwash
in this diary that you can see on your
screens the terrorists has written that
his ambition is to become Mamata and his
favorite tunes were that of Azadi even
added how his role model is none other
than terrorists and mastermind of 26/11
half is saved but let's go across to
Pradeep who's joining us with more
details on this he managed to access
this taro diary for us why is this such
a huge wake-up call for the problem of
exfiltration brother tell us what the
contents are make the in fact by
flipping through the pages of this
channel diary one will be able to peep
into the minds of a young lad from
Kashmir Valley how his journey starts
from the campus and that ends in Alaska
travel training camp and finally he gets
killed in an encounter with the security
forces in Baramulla on January 23rd in
search for him Malik he was you got in
touch with Hamza Laden on and Melissa
are two of the logical channels were
considered to be close end of half you
see online they were motivated and made
to travel to Pakistan on valid visa that
clearly indicate that somewhere the
Pakistan High Commission officials are
also aware of this fact and in
connivance of these officials they are
getting the visa he went to Pakistan
where he met have two same hobbies he's
brainwashed him to an extent that he
joined Kenneth's training camp for 28
years he was provided general training
in Burma town which is one and a half
kilometer drive from Pakistan's capital
Islamabad and after completing his arm
training he came over to bar Amala area
where he joined logical camp and now you
look at his tiny what he has written he
wants Azadi in like any other young boy
he also wanted to initially right David
Harley bite but how after indoctrination
all he wanted to was to attain March it
of this clearly indicates how the 26/11
plotter happy Lane is playing with the
lives of youngsters in Kashmir Valley
and this is because of this reason that
many youngsters that there right now
choosing paths between
and health and here in other way we can
see they are making their life of their
family member
health this man came over to this place
he joined and what is really shocking is
that and now they are not to cross the
treacherous route of my line of control
they are going on valid visa and look at
their other things also his favorite in
fact the country in Syria which is again
they traveled on any of your the jihadi
czar are singing unleashing the
propaganda Isis is having a strong
foothold so this clearly shows that they
are indoctrinating brainwashing young
minds sending over to this place getting
them killed and I think this is the
biggest ever tragedy on one hand
Pakistan claims that have to say there's
a social worker I see Pakistan is the
biggest jihad bluffmaster
under the garb of social work yeah
allowing channels like have to say to
mouskouri and brainwash young minds and
instead of absolutely they are making
them have guns in their hands and wage
war against the country and that was
really very serious thing I think this
diary is that I offer for all those
people who had also been interesting
that there should be dialogue with
Pakistan because don't go by what
actually is coming I can discuss more on
this how this is an eye-opener for the
lobby as well will they continue to back
those who've been indoctrinating our
youth are they going to continue pushing
for talks with those who have lifted the
gun in fact do stay on with us Pradeep
also joining us now is our colleague
Dena Dena Pradeep has managed to access
the terror diary for us if we can just
get us some of the crucial excerpts from
it so that we can understand how a young
educated man went from his love for
Harley Davidsons
to huff aside well absolutely this is
the diary in fact that has been accessed
by Pradeep data and it tells us the real
story of what is happening in Kashmir
remember politicians like / Abdullah
Mehbooba Mufti and many others and of
course those who are for a bureau of
focusing on the separatists there have
been continuously saying that the youth
of Kashmir is alienated but this diary
that has been accessed by Pradeep gives
us the details that it is not alienation
it is radicalization that is happening
from Pakistan side which is impacting
the minds of these youth in Jammu and
Kashmir they are being brain boy
and that is precisely what this diary
also released reveals now here we are
talking about so here Faruk the militant
who was killed in the month of January
23rd of January 2019 and you you have to
see what he has mentioned in his diary
happiest moment in life when I was
released from jail
this was his happiest moment who
influences him the most is actually
Hafiz Sayed so how did that happen we
still don't know most vibrant wish I
want to kill informers that is something
that he wishes to do a tap feet to
rhythm of Azadi slogans so you know
these kind of details that he has put in
this diary that has been accessed by
Pradeep the tough times now clearly
reveal that you know these youth are
being brainwashed with certain agenda in
mind most influenced by Hafiz Muhammad
say it so this is what is spilling the
beans and something that people like
humour Abdullah Mehbooba Mufti and all
those who have been advocating for talks
with Pakistan should see and what is his
ambition that he's talking about he
wants to become a martyr all this is
coming from Pakistan it isn't it's a
propaganda it's an agenda that is
driving the youth of Kashmir to become
terrorists in the valley and what are
they called us by people like paper bomb
of humour Abdullah and maybe other
politicians said these are alienated
youth you know amnesty schemes are given
for the stone Pelt us and our Jevons are
repeatedly targeted for just attacking
those who are targeting our own Braves
and this is this exposes the hypocrisy
as well and it should actually serve as
is acceptable to them the fact that our
youth are being poisoned that they are
being indoctrinated remember earlier

support any operation which targets the

these uniqueness is possible because the
Constitution which we adopted which was
operationalized we adopted econ 26 to
November operationalize it after two
months from 26 January

all these different groups of people
together and today we can take the

consulting editor of time sign also we
have with us this morning
leffen in general Shankar Prasad defense
analysts a very good morning to all a
few gentlemen but first to you should
enjoy because you have been talking to
all these veterans who will be part of
that iconic parade today and it also
when you talk to them they also come
across as absolutely humble for the fact
that finally their efforts their entire
effort for the country has been
recognized by some government and after
seven decades yes absolutely there are
just four of them and they are between
95 and 99 years old and I spoke with one
of them who's 99 and he's still a fairly
fit man for his age and he said that
Netaji had told him that one day we will
be at the lull Killa and you will be
singing and we will be sitting and
talking about life this is something he
still remembers even the other guy here
asynch Sepoy hero Singh he said that you
know Netaji had told us very clearly
that one day we will be in Delhi and he
was this great man
in fact SWA permanent said that if
Netaji were alive after independence and
if he were in power in India the India
would be so neat Acharya so this is the
kind of idealism they had and they still
have it's important that the country has
decided that at least four of these
surviving iron a mint would be part of
the parade today they are 95 97 98 and
99 years old respectively and they are
taking part in the parade and they are
looking forward to taking part in the
parade in fact the logistics for them
has been in short they would be strapped
in their jeeps and which will of course
go down rajput so it's a big moment for
them it's a big moment for the
three and it's a big moment for
everybody here are people who fought all
the way from Singapore they were
captured
there were ex Indian Army soldiers they
were captured in Singapore and they
joined the I&A they fought all the way
from Thailand to Burma to right up to
the Indian border to keep Kojima and
infall and this is something them not
forgotten and this is something the
Indian government the Indian people
should also remember after all these
years absolute did mr. Chandra Bose your
first reactions because this also comes
in the backdrop of when the Prime
Minister also renamed almost three
islands honors Nagi Subhash Chandra Bose
so this also is a great moment for the
government as well where the message
that they want to send across is that
the bravery the valour of the veterans
of the Indian National Army clearly will
not be forgotten by our country joy hint
to our countrymen on the 70th Republic
Day you see it took 70 long years to
recognize the contribution of the
veterans of the Assads in forge they
fought the final battle for India's
freedom you see they didn't want
anything else they didn't want a job
they didn't want money they didn't want
anything they only wanted recognition
and honor today is a historic day that
after 70 long long years we are able the
country and the government of India we
are able to give them the recognition
that they only wanted the honor that
they only wanted because they sacrificed
they were willing to sacrifice their
everything their lives for the freedom
of our motherland
you see India today is proud that the
I&A veterans who fought for India's
freedom are at least given the simple
recognition that they are able to join
the Republic paper
it also took us 72 long years to
recognize that they should be honored at
the Red Fort we have the government of
India the NDA government under the
leadership of Narendra Modi ji
recognized it and the Prime Minister the
14th Prime Minister of India hoisted the
tricolour at the Red Fort on the 75th
anniversary of the provisional
government of Azad him that was the
first government of free India the first
government of undivided India and the
first Prime Minister of undivided India
was Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose so we
have we had long we have waited for a
very long period but finally Subash
Chandra Bose and this Azad in forge gets
new recognition
absolutely so it's been a long wait but
maru's another question that arises here
is irrespective of which government has
been in power or which government is in
power what took India 70 long years to
actually recognize our War veterans
well it's not really the recognition of
these War veterans it goes back to a
long way in history you know in the
1930s
Sarat Chandra Bose had visited Germany
and then subsequently had developed
friendships with people in Hitler's
elite as well as then later went to work
with the Japanese now he was rising very
clearly as a serious political counter
to Pandit Nehru
and historical evidence that has now
been unearthed it has been indicated of
the fact that Nehru clearly saw him as a
rival and therefore there were efforts
made to marginalize his contribution he
was clearly a nationalist
and his agenda was as has been brought
out by the distinguished speaker just
now and even she enjoys interview was
clearly to give India the first force
put together to fight for India's
freedom there is an ironical
to it all while we are respecting
finally after 75 years the contributions
of these soldiers in world war ii the
bulk of the indian army that will be
marching down the rocks but today has
regiments and units that take a lot of
pride for their contribution in world
war ii fighting under the british flag
you can't help it that is the history of
our armed forces
the point to note whether our soldiers
fought under the british flag or
Netaji's flag they all fought valiantly
they all fought with a great deal of
dedication and courage and that is the
spirit of India that we should rejoice
not under not on the fact that whose
side were they on at that point of time
in history people had all sorts of
options nobody knew for sure which
option will work out in India's favor
but quite clearly the reason going back
to a question that they have not been
given their due and people don't talk
about it is because the the Congress
elite did not want
Subash Chandra G then and his legacy
thereafter to counter the contributions
of Nehru and his followers to the
independence of India which is enormous
and pandeyji's contribution cannot be
belittled absolutely unfortunately there
was this political rivalry within the
elites which led to the marginalization
of the IMA in indian history and less in
general prasad a very very important
point that was made by mauro fir that
let's not forget that who they fought
for what they really did but the fact
that they were part of the Indian
National Army the first national army
that India ever saw and irrespective of
the political differences finally
there's a government in power which has
recognised their tributes to the country
which has recognized their efforts are
for the country and finally when an -
Indra was also talking - these are
veterans they come out and said that it
was their dream to go to Red Fort and be
recognized
and finally that day has arrived and
what better than these 90 plus veterans
to be honored in such a grand manner
today isn't it
yes of course first of all let me wish
you the all the viewers in India and
particularly these soldiers from the I
na a very happy Republic Day secondly I
would also like to mention besides what
Maru Fez mentioned his son joy is
mentioned you remember the famous in8
trials in in the in the Red Fort and
finally this year the Prime Minister of
India mr. Narendra Modi honored
sebastian rebo's in red fort and a
museum is being created there the Indian
National Army also mentioned one very
big slogan Pune Swaraj poorness Raj
meant that they wanted to have
independent India without the British
here in one go and not in phases and
perhaps not a bifurcation the country
into Tula India and Pakistan it's a sad
story that unfortunately Sebastian's
rebirth could not be the leader of India
at that point in time for reasons that
have been explained by ma roof it was
more political than anything and the
other thing that intrigues every single
Indian today is the controversy about
the manner in which Sebastian rivers
passed away in so called a accident well
we do not know what's the truth because
hundreds of inquiries and investigations
are taking place but nothing so
conclusively one way or the other has
come out people still think that maybe
he was the life - at some point in time
maybe he was killed in an air crash etc
etc but the most important thing that
strikes me is this that while the
government of India today has honored
Sebastian's rebirth in the Indian
National Army and the role it's played
in the independence of India let me tell
you that as early as 1948 50 when I used
to be at school there was a house called
Sahaj House there was a house called
Ranjith house so many people in India
respected sebastian rebo's as earlier
than i was in school in 1948 in my
school there was a house called Sahaj
house therefore every child in India did
respect Netaji Subash Chandra Bose in
some manner or the other but the
unfortunate part of this that had taken
so long for an official recognition
there was there was recognition at
various levels in schools in an
institution that cetera et cetera but
the government to now say that we will
name two or three islands in Andaman on
the name of Sebastian rivers he will
have a proper activity in the inn in Red
Fort and the last thing I want to say is
this I think I am not too sure but I
think the government of India must
consider giving a Bharat Ratna to
Sebastian repose I don't think he's got
it as yet when so many other great
people in India have got Bharat Ratna
why not Sebastian through Bose and the
last point I want to make in this one of
the common things between him and
Johanna naruse perspective about India
was industrialization and that is where
NATO agreed with him in some forms and
Sebastian's repose always believed that
industrialization in India is primed to
make it a big country and which is what
the present government is trying to do
so on the whole I think is one of the
greatest leaders and perhaps can be
christened as the first Prime Minister
of India as mod of mentioned but yes we
are all very happy that finally a day
has come in Indian history that he's
being recognized and I wish he
recognized even better still absolutely
and it's a day to rejoice that effort
also that is being put in for now I'm
requesting Marouf mr. Chandra Bose and
left in general Prasad and also to enjoy

the Rahul Gandhi in a way that he is now
planning to contest from three different
seats well you know just basic
speculations that are doing the rounds
it might be true it might not be true as

circulation thing then the media reports
and by a section of all you know party

see this I do convey to the party
workers so that they did you know
importantly it is can what is saying
there are speculations our support

is Prashant is a meaty not a safe seat

the president of the party and the

that the Congress will lose that seat in

we did not have a single Emily we did
not have a single local body

2014 the Congress has lost every with an

on the questions that our viewers might
want to us but before we get in our
first caller's miss Nirmala Sitharaman I
want to ask you straight off the bat do
you think the debate is settled after
your very very combative speech in
Parliament the fact is that the
opposition hasn't given way to any any
of the facts that you've put on the
table they're questioning all the facts
even now and more so they are linking
many developments since then which have
happened in the courts in the CBI to
what they call is the raffle scam you're
right
I've tried answering all the questions
point by point not just in the
parliament but even afterwards but
largely exhaustively in the Parliament
now I've put the facts with the
documents in my hand after that if
people are raising questions
I wish their questions which relate to
in the AgustaWestland which you have
covered extensively in your days in five
to 14 I remember and as a result today a
major investigation is on and media's
coverage then has resulted that India is
able to get the truth behind what had
happened
Agusta but much to all our surprise
hasn't the same middleman who's now
under scrutiny being questioned by
investigating investigative agencies
also saying there was an attempt on
default oh so post my answering with the
facts and documents the questions should
actually now be mounting before the
Congress not just those questions which
I have asked of them whether it relates
to H al or anything else now the
question should also be what is this man
telling during the investigation related
to Agusta after all he's mentioned the
word referral
after all that period relates to the UPA
government shouldn't they now be
answering that question also mrs.
Nirmala Sitharaman are you making a
charge because there is a charge from
the Congress party because many would
say just because there is a controversy
over Rafael and the contract that's been
signed by the NDA government by your
government
you are now raking up the UPA era do you
have any facts obviously you are
referring to middleman Christian Michele
yeah and what he's talked about him
being a middleman even for another
company which was a rival company to
Rafael which was the Eurofighter you're
in government and you've been in
government for four-and-a-half years if
you had any inkling of this why not put
the facts on the table and why not why
not file fi RS if you do think they were
middlemen who were trying to sabotage
the earlier Rafael deal as you say in
the UPA era whether it was a sabotage or
not is something which the Congress will
have to be answering because it's very
well for you to say you are in garment
what are you doing about it we are in
the garment and we understand the
urgency with which we have to empower
Indian Air Force and therefore with a
clean transparent garment garment
agreement Prime Minister took the
initiative with all due process followed
to get the aircrafts for Indian Air
Force so
in government with national interest in
mind we've gone ahead with it
now if you're telling me we should also
first of all clear up the backlog of
indecision because there was some kind
of a conspiracy I don't know but clearly
if I had spend time on that I'm wasting
more time from getting the Indian Air
Force a timely lot of fighter aircrafts
so the constructive approach is that we
went ahead with getting the aircrafts
for Indian Air Force now if as a fall
out of what is coming out now there is
some reason to believe that there was
some other reason for which the deal did
not happen the Laurita so you think it's
the Eurofighter reason you think it's
the christian mission now it doesn't
address these questions you're rightly
racing them miss Nirmala Sitharaman this
is the country of 135 crore people they
don't want questions from the two
national political parties they want
answer the answer is given in the
procurement of 36 raphaël aircrafts two
squadrons so that the urgency is met and
the answer is given for the rest of it
in that way we should an RFI so we are
going about the business of getting
Indian Air Force what they should be
given legitimately
what should what they should have been
given long time ago UPA spent time
without the deal we are going ahead with
constructive work so mr. melih Sitaram
on rahul gandhi's raised questions and
these questions have been directed at
the prime minister the charge of the
Congress party is that the Prime
Minister is not answering any of these
questions and therefore deduce that the
Prime Minister has something to hide
what do you say to that argument it's
become now I do not want to use the word
fashionable but I don't want to waste
time searching for a different word but
it's become now fashionable and also
probably it gives quite a few eyeballs
for your claims to tag everything onto
the Prime Minister yes ultimately Prime
Minister is responsible but
doesn't seem to me reasonable for the
opposition to have every question posed
to the Prime Minister and as a result
even much before you saw it the other
day I'm not saying I am
oh I'm standing up how is it that you
don't respect me I'm not saying that but
as per procedure after a discussion the
concerned Minister gets up to answer you
wanted the debate the Congress wanted
the debate I stood up to answer as the
concerned minister
oh no we want the Prime Minister they
said this for every such a thing have
which happened since 14 if you take it
up when the church' attack happened the
Prime Minister should come when there is
a attack unfortunate attack on a DLitt
in some state which may be ruled by the
BJP or any other party the Prime
Minister should come fishermen
unfortunately caught by let's say Sri
Lanka and they are not being sent back
in time Prime Minister is taking action
on it but even then Prime Minister to
come an answer sorry some member of
parliament speaks out of turn
say something Prime Minister should come
an answer I'm so glad that there's so
much expectation and hope on the Prime
Minister that they want him to give a
comment but it's that the way to operate
is that the way to operate we are
getting our first caller on the show and
a majority of the calls that we are
getting are asking the question and
these these are some of the comments
that we've got on Twitter as well
questions that have come in on why is
the government so defensive about
setting up a jpc a Joint Parliamentary
Committee if you have nothing to hide if
you have nothing to hide why not a JP
see a JP says history in the Parliament
for any issue has been when you had
institutions like the CAG coming up with
some kind of in
observation of the CAG itself which
merits but further investigation and
therefore if you tell me that there is a
need for a GPC based on something which
has come out yes earlier the parliaments
history shows precedence of setting up a
jpc in this case there's none one second
once earlier in the case of befores
which is what constantly Congress's
having in at the back of their mind
because they want to equate bring in a
false equivalence to befores and refer
the false equivalence drives them
through the same process so if J PC was
formed for Bofors investigation there
should be one for a film jpc of ruff a
bow falls you know and Finance Minister
clearly said what was the fate of that
when by that time it was very clear the
kickbacks were given accounts very
identified money trail was spoken about
the jpc ended up saying the kickback
which was given was not a kickback it
was a winding of charge now do you want
a fast like that and therefore one and
second in this case clearly much before
whether the Congress party desired it
that way or not Supreme Court has gone
through the case and looked at the three
contentious issues on which the Congress
wants to keep the issue alive what were
the three on price on process and on the
Indian offset partner on all the three
the supreme court has come up with clear
narration of what they found and
therefore clearly saying it's all okay
now for the Congress party then to say
but it doesn't stop us from forming a
jpc Supreme Court will never sit on
whether a JP shoes assay should be
followed or not that is true arguments
not really political absolutely
political alright so we have a first two
callers calling in a rather calling in
from Bengaluru Pratham calling in from
Indore and Radha and Pratham thank you
very much for calling us here on frankly
speaking we have the Raksha mantri
rather would you like to take your first
question with the duck shaman three what
do you want to
yes ma'am I madam I am yen rather from
Bengaluru good evening man good evening
madam Defense Minister this is the first
time in Jai's having a female defense
minister how challenging is it to you to
deal with external threats to our
countries from nations around us it is
challenging but I have the support of
the entire Council of Ministers good
advisers and then I NSA national
security adviser to the Prime Minister
and the three Armed Forces Chiefs the
Coast Guard all of them are absolutely
professional about dealing with the
matters related to defense of the
country so I'm not at all and in fact
I'm in very good company
no we will be that is why instead of one
squadron we did get two squadrons and
there's a good lot of fleet of aircrafts
which are being bought over the decades
which are in very good condition our all
that was proven not just because I'm
saying it but the air chief held last
year something called goggle Shakti a
wonderful exercise which even our
enemies and some of our neighbours
commented very favorably because he
proved that from any part of this
country any corner of this country
within 24 hours he will be able to shift
all that sets that is required if the
exigency arises so arises to any other
part which requires that kind of an
assistance in other words proving that
we have a very nimble Air Force the Air
Force is fully geared up to meet any
situation and the air chief demonstrated
it last year during the operation
Kentucky which were sent all over the
country so the Air Force today has
proven its ability with Rafael it is
only going to increase manifold protoman
rava no questions on ruffle want to ask
one more question about the Navy because
you know actually in many many
improvements in naval power what I
reviews about that well I think quite a
few of naval assets have also been added
the new ones are being added in our
bases are being strengthened in fact
quite a lot of activity is happening
along the coast in order to strengthen
our naval bases the Navy chief also has
spoken about it recently you or you're
quite aware that we have now quite a lot
of what do you call logistics support
agreements have agreed with several
countries we have partnership countries
from whom we share information about
vessels which are moving vessels of
interest and maritime information also
so Navy has quite a lot for their
presence of course there's a need now
that we have a greater emphasis given
for Indo Pacific now we are just not
dealing with them in the Indian Ocean we
are talking about in the Pacific area
but over and above this what I would
want to play and emphasize on here is we
are seen as the first respondents in
this area anyway you are aware that
recently when there was a tsunami and
earthquake which hit the coast of a part
of Indonesia ours was the first set of
ships which reached them with medical
relief well Pratap all questions
answered this is Russia country who has
her feet on the ground and her eyes on
the ball thank you very much raga and
problem for joining us dr. Sunita joins
us next from Panjim in Goa doctor Sunita
you know you heard the first two callers
nobody had a question to ask on rough
air
what is your question doctor Sunita is
it on Rafael is it on the defense
preparedness of a country what would you
like to a structure monthly first of all
I would say namaste
defense minister g18 namaste
yes Mike yes my question is about the
other file procurement will we have been
deeply pained by the way mr. Rahul
Gandhi is conceived continuously using
foul abusive language against our
elected prime minister and this is
Anthony is leading us to sometimes
sleepless and earthly business movement
my question is to you madam defence
minister is that why is there and not a
defamation suit in filed against me but
if me in the name of and Prime Minister
correct very good question doctor Sunita
wants to know why haven't you filed a
defamation suit against Rahul Gandhi
that's exactly the kind of pain and
disappointment I suffer I feel bad not
just me many of my colleagues all of us
feel for the country's Prime Minister to
be abused like this and I suppose that
was one of the reasons where I took the
chance to explain that after my speech
on ruffle ruffle where I explained
everything in the Panama and I did take
it up but on the specific question I'd
like to respond to the opposition leader
in his capacity as an opposition leader
and I focus myself on answering the
questions rather than look at why can't
I rush to the court to have a
deformation find I purely deal with it
as an opposition leader for whom I give
facts I give the truth and I explain
things my rest is left
that's a graceful rupture monthly and I
want to ask you you know you are a woman
in the job and sometimes that gets
emphasized more by people who are
looking at your position you know if
they're happy in Raksha Montrese before
and there is another action 3 that this
country has why is your being a woman
number one being made such a big deal
and why and what do you personally feel
what did you feel when Rahul Gandhi made
this statement many you know starting
from the Prime Minister your party
president and other colleagues in your
cabinet have responded but I want to ask
you not just as Raksha Man 3 but as a
woman as a woman who's competent enough
to be a rock shaman 3 of this country
what did you feel when Rahul Gandhi made
this statement at a rally in Rajasthan
saying hey pradhan mantri ik Mahela KP j
chopra I have to be frank with you a
very mixed feeling about it because that
literally shows a certain mindset which
prevails all over the country and I was
surprised that Rahul Gandhi as the
president of a big party spoke that
language in fact not just in my context
after becoming Rock shaman 3 but even
earlier I have said this very very many
times the way in which we speak man or
woman sometimes perpetrates
without us knowing sometimes a certain
stereotype of woman and man and the
language is what I normally address
saying you know like frequently in the
north we here are you wearing bangles as
an expression in the South you have some
equivalence like that so the language
has become so infused with these kind of
things which are gender insensitive and
I normally do tell people that one has
got to be very conscious that you don't
promote such language but here my worry
is and therefore it took objection to it
is if I were to be a male would Rahul
Gandhi have had a reason to say the
Prime Minister's hiding behind the rocks
Amin three he said it only because I'm a
woman would he have had this temptation
to say if there was a male saying huh
you're hiding behind a woman that's an
attitude problem and if I were to say
that in many parts of India particularly
in the rural areas that's not to absolve
the urban and languages become so
infused we say this without even
realizing you do you wanna make it back
no one minute I'll just finish this so
you you would probably speak like this
without annoying or being insensitive
that you're talking without sensitivity
to gender but here is somebody who was
brought up in a family which was highly
exposed to the world the you know
society India suffering India's whatever
what great letters from the nanny prison
Juvenal Nehru had written to in Indra
the daughter and in that family there's
somebody who speaks like some village
sitting under a tree old man who I
should not blame who speaks like that
because that's always been brought up
but you've not been brought up like that
I'm told how could that kind of a
mindset come in your mind leaving on you
aspiring to be the Prime Minister but I
thought you had a very different
upbringing shocking shocking says
neurology theremin okay we had to
modular collars were calling in Sahil
calling in from Srinagar and submit
calling in from gurugram style coming
across to you first you have a question
for that someone trillion velocity'
Raman what's your question yes good good
after a good evening man good evening
yes thank you very much sorry
during me times to ask some questions I
have to suppose the two three questions
can I ask man yes please yes thank you
mama why did he choose it Alliance
that's the best question I need to ask
this time because I have been following
this story I have been following this
Rafael deep very closely since I am a
civil service as well one thing that
confuses me the most why did you choose
the lines of defense and the fact is
there was one more company 8al question
salon so now yeah yeah I don't know
who's chosen Reliance it's not
government of India the Government of
India has not chosen anybody because
what we are doing now is in the place of
18 flyaway aircrafts fighter aircrafts
which the UPA wanted to buy but didn't
end up buying we have now decided not
just 18 but two times 18 which is 36
fitting enough for two squadrons fighter
aircrafts to be brought in and therefore
our concern was through an
interdimensional emmitt to get two
squadrons worth 36 fighter aircrafts and
that's what we have done the story
begins and ends there that's where it's
all over now for the rest we have just
issued an RFI for which through the
strategic partnership route we want to
find people who will want to come find a
joint venture or decide on a partnership
and then the process will commence to
produce the rest of them now in this
purchase of 36 for everything every
hundred rupees that you give from gummit
of India to buy these aircrafts we as
per the offset guidelines expect this
OAM that is the original equipment
manufacturer in this case for instance
the so and one other company they have
to bring in 50 rupees to India to buy
things or buy services or invest in some
group about which we will get to know
and once we get to know then I'll be
able to say
with whom that 50 rupees for each
hundred rupees that we have spent on
them is being either used for buying
something or buying a thing or buying a
service or investing so based on
newspaper reports I can't comment with
whom they are going for the offset
expenditure that they have to do it's
not production of an aircraft it's not
at all a production because everything
that we are buying in this thirty-six he
is coming from there nothing is being
produced off the thirty-six in this
country just as nothing was to be
produced off that 18 under the UPA it is
for the rest of it and that is a totally
separate thing on which nothing has
happened as yet except for us
having issued an hour of file I hope
that's clear
well you answer the question head on
submit also jaw on the show with us on
Frankie speaking from gurugram submit
what's your question
Namaskar man so much got me a question
hey ki am i there or Ellicott those
quadrants are there so a be a house
requirement airport well squadron you
Tom re a postpaid could revive
kinetically give you three hundred
fighters make serious case of
third-generation gangsters to catch up
with this connect up and cuz there that
is why I said we are getting 36
aircrafts now but we will be we've
already showed the RFI for the
manufacturer of the rest of them what
rest will be we don't know it depends on
who the original equipment manufacturer
is going to be after the f RF I may
chose to become a contract and that is
through the strategic strategic
partnership so they will have to come
and produce it in India other than that
of course the HL is also continuously
producing pages which is also a combat
aircraft it's it's also a training were
the aircraft even that will continue
sukhoi czar being produced in India the
Sukhoi mk1 and that is also going to
continue production so our fleet will
get refurbished with all these
muchacha really apart shall make all
your major purchases hey just pay Rajan
et artsy sugar water they are afraid to
issue Ho Gaya hey Bousquet process Algy
birthday chant they shall take away
we'll buy new aircrafts but that process
will have to be open transparent
strategy so you're not backing off up
done area Rafael controversy say we'll
call it 36 my paranoia craft September
is celaya well ladies and gentlemen
viewers that's Raksha mantra live on
frankly speaking it's a very special
edition of frankly speaking and our news
room is flooded with phone calls from

calls after this very short break so
keep calling in keep asking your
questions because ladies and gentlemen
the government has explained and here
you have the opportunity to ask your

questions taking a short break back very
soon with luck shaman three nimbala
Sitaram
welcome back to this special edition of
frankly speaking and we have ruk shaman
three live near bella Sitaram on who's
on the show and taking questions from
our viewers tonight and before i go
across to my next caller numerology I
want to ask you this question you said
that Rahul Gandhi statement was almost
as if it was coming in from somebody not
really from the background we've known
Rahul Gandhi to come from but from you
know appearing to be somebody in a
village sitting under a tree who doesn't
have access to that kind of education or
exposure I still want to persist with my
question would you want to say something
to Rahul Gandhi directly for having
questioned a woman's capability well uh
it's below
dignity to comment there is no honestly
below dignity for me to comment on it
you let it pass nor where I've said this
I've said this it's i lo once dignity to
even respond to this kind of comment
that's that's very different to hear
from a politician at a time when
politics has really hit a new law in
terms of name-calling but neurology
there have been attacks that have been
made by his party people
in fact divya spandana who is the head
of the social media sell at one level or
the other for the congress party has
said that even you have connections with
political family you are married into a
political family and and and you're no
ordinary person so you know not to make
such a big deal about the fact that i'm
from an ordinary background the
statement that you made in parliament
what would you say to that if I've said
it's below my dignity even to respond to
her boss okay
below her dignity to respond to the boss
least of all divya spandana Amin joining
me from Hyderabad Alan what's your
question Thank You Monica
good evening madam defence minister
today I really appreciate this outreach
or during an opportunity for any any
citizen to interact with you coming to
my question
I'm confused with all the various
stakeholders from within H al while the
employee union leaders say something
else all of which is merging the
understanding of the future of a KL
statement from again I don't know which
statement you are referring to the
specific statement that Rahul Gandhi
also spoke about the fact that you said
there are 1 lakh crore worth of orders
in the pipeline now it's not orders that
are on paper with HL these are not
monies that have gone to HL so wrong on
this
says that you've misled the country and
and I've seen a cartoon in a newspaper
which says if the orders are in a
pipeline then what's from the people of
this country are also in a pipeline for
the BJP well I don't think that's the
right way of interpreting I am NOT
against cartoons please
any number welcome but let's understand
the government is not like an individual
you or me which can take from its pocket
or from the purse and then give it like
that when I said what I've said and next
day I've even given a statement to say
what I've said about a child as regards
the orders is absolutely true and I've
stated it again in the house with a
written statement though I don't want to
go into explaining the process but
everything that which is taken as a
decision and announced like this in the
house is definitely going through the
process and for them to get by the
discordant voices from Haan coming in I
don't know which are the discordant
voices retired employees who think that
things are not moving
I don't disrespect their views retired
employees are important they bring in a
lot of expertise with which they worked
and then after that do retire and
understand the institution so when they
speak it's important I respect that but
the matter of fact is when we say
processes like if I clear the file today
even then in dusting its own due time
and everyone in the government in a
chair knows about it after my clearing I
am well within my right to say I've
cleared it because it will look once the
due processes are formed followed the
money will fall into the account of a
chair for them to do one thing and
second because the caller has asked us
to what is the matter about HL HL does
get orders they have a very captive
consumer in the form of Indian Air Force
Army and Navy also give them orders they
are producing some of the regularly used
helicopters they are servicing all the
Air Force's requirements they are also
producing in different units like in
Nasik they produce sukhoi all of us want
to do things with
chicken butt Oh I've also raised quite a
few questions which I'm trying to sort
out I'm trying to do my best to get that
sorted out it is a fact and this is not
to decry that is why I also quoted Shri
Mallikarjun Kyrgyz PSA report very
clearly saying as to why the production
of pages is getting delayed simply just
a child may not be at fault but a child
together with let us say Allah a child
together with a force all of them will
have to expedite the process but it's a
fact that even when orders were given
between 2006 and 2010 four additional
pages to be produced their production
annually is only eight you imagine even
if you gave orders for 40 how long will
it take for them to scale up and produce
and give us so we have to attend to a
child's requirement in terms of better
infrastructure giving them more
capacities more scaling up prospects and
so on so well the questions being asked
about a child's finances may not be
wrong I'm answering I've given the right
figures there are many more issues about
a child which I want everybody to
understand the complexity with which we
have to deal with an institution like a
chair which has skills to do a lot of
good work but yet the fact is it costs
more to produce the same thing in a
child than anywhere else I've given you
two examples in the case of Rafael a
child's demand was that they needed 2.5
times more man-hours to produce which
Dassault didn't think it would work for
them similarly I have given you the
example of importing Sukhoi from Russia
and making Sukhoi in India Indian made
Sukhoi ZAR at least 45% more than the
important Russian version now after all
as rock shaman 3 and as government of
india all of us will have to be
concerned about giving business to a
child but if i watch sukhoi i'm paying
indian taxpayers money won't i be
questioned by CAG saying why do you have
to
by it from here which is Indian company
all right
but you paying 45% more of public money
would you pay to some other person and
does that answer your question
so there are complex issues which we
have to address we are trying to address
so no would just shade it peeking and
saying today the business is like that
it's all due to Modi I'm sorry
Modi is also giving solutions can we
talk about that also well well yes mr.
Rahul Gandhi should engage in a
comprehensive plan that's what the
entire defence sector rather than just
talking about a few questions one moring
about a chain of iike this year they had
the highest turnover
how does turnover happen highest
turnover happen without businesses being
given to them they are getting business
yes but we need to give them more I am
not denying that
all right all right after joining us
from noida also joining us is Suraj from
mysuru
but first let me go across to a tune yes
mr. Dillo what's your everything good
evening doctor
good evening good evening different
minister good evening ma'am my question
is that initially when Rahul Gandhi
started this particular allegation on
the government regarding Rafael the
counter-attack from the government was
very linearizing the counter-attack
right now is appropriate don't you think
it was a delayed response from the
government has it God meant they replied
initially with the same because in fact
I think Rahul Gandhi could have to stop
all these things currently in the
initial time in the in the Parliament
also do you think do you think you
delayed the kind of combative response
that you are giving now have you delayed
it did you ignore the questions on
Rafael in the beginning you don't go
into a combat to posture right until
they won do you in everything you tried
reasoning you try telling things you
tried explaining but have you allowed
the narrative to set up against you in
rough end that's the question I think
well we are now putting the facts out I
can't say which one of us can have our
own perspective and I can't question
that but certainly I am giving the facts
now all right
Suraj from my
on the line now yes Suraj what's your
question
I don't know weakened immunity
pheromones II another you guys hello I'm
really proud of you I'm even as my
current government be more DG there you
all have made in depth out and to its
reach India to the site thank you you
don't think that olive oil controversy
has taken anything away from the Modi
government no not at all but my question
is like you are anomalous energy or even
the total government has failed to
connect with the people because I think
Melissa Peterman ji speaks in English so
but I think most of the country people
do not understand the language so I
think it's a miscommunication but I
truly believe our government so I think
it's a miscommunication and even
Congress it try to speak completely I
think they are possibly able to
communicate but in we are saying utter
lies but when I see that I'm Angie the
Raksha mantra can speak very good the
Hindi she can speak many languages up
you know you don't have to really worry
about communication skills numerology
observe spokesperson worker TT humma
Boxey pasha ami bacha today Hindi my
basket is a upset absolutely and I
understand it's this corner from my soul
yes I can understand because and I quite
take your point the communication now
will have to be in various Indian
languages and BJP scary kurta all over
the country are geared to do that I'm I
may be the one who speaks only in
English or probably in Telugu and Tamil
I love to speak in Kannada to my Hindi
is tutti pootie but still all of us will
be talking in the respective languages I
take your point I say something in Tamil
to our viewer noise from Karnataka so
speak to him in naka Canada my Kannada
is not really all that strong you tell
him that you know as far as Rafael is
concerned there is there is no hanky
panky
Rafael has not
thing hanky-panky I can say that in
English but hanky-panky I don't know how
to say that in Kannada go Tata Suraj you
have ray I think he's not in line soon
as you got that hi thank you actually
for you in Kannada hope it answers your
questions and and coming back coming
back to this entire issue many are
saying that the bill that has been
brought in for 10 percent quotas for
reservation for economically backward
upper caste is a diversionary tactics
because the government was in hot water
over a fen so you've tried to distract
attention away from it come it wasn't
hot water Andhra food we have all the
facts and truth on our side why will we
be in hot water now I would think the
Congress party is in hot water with
Christian my Michele saying things and
also with us putting all the facts on
Rafael out openly and saying ask me any
number of questions I'm willing to
answer but no it's not a diversionary
tactic but the importance of a historic
decision like that and the silent way in
which the Prime Minister has worked
together with the concerned ministries
work the details out and then go for a
Cabinet decision after inter-ministerial
consultation and then bring it and mind
you it's a constitutional amendment and
and then bring it to both the houses
just shows how clear determined
leadership this country has in him
that's the kind of thing which every
party wanted Congress party's manifesto
2014 Allen and earlier they knew about
it but didn't do anything in their solid
10 years between 2004 and 14 within five
years here's this government doing
something which will benefit all the
poor people and this is just not dealing
with one community any poor who needs
this kind of a support is going to get
it
irrespective of caste irrespective of
religion because over and above
that which is reserved for the SCS and
STS and OBCs without cutting that down
without affecting it and as it is you
know a season s T's can also appear and
that's a good move which exists even now
can also appear under the general
category so even that has not been
touched with they can still appear in
the general category - over and above
the reservation which they have so
giving 10% for the others who are
economically backward which may result
eventually also to certain kind of
social backwardness that's what we want
address and it's a daring reform very
good measure long-awaited all right we
have two more callers calling in sumit
from noida and shri ganesh from
Coimbatore submit what's your question
yeah hi good evening ma'am good evening
yeah so he my question is regarding the
report basis so the because the whole
controversy started around that so I
heard you and avenjet lessor in the
Parliament for this aim and my all the
fat got clear so so I what I understood
there are two prices one is for basic
aircraft and one is for fully loaded
aircraft what section sorry yeah yeah my
question is that for basic as
immediately sir describe that for basic
aircraft we can declare the prices but
for fully loaded aircraft we can not
declare the prices right so my question
is since route and is asking all the
prices and they are saying if cheaper it
from their deal it was cheaper so why is
not government asking not the government
I mean the week we are not asking route
Ghani why what are the price of fully
loaded aircraft in their time because he
is quoting only the basic aircraft
prices not the fully loaded a surprise
all right come on right yeah you're the
response from Raksha man 3 that's right
you're right and saying that he's
constantly quoting his time UPA
government's times basic aircraft price
but even that is wrong because what is
in the paper is different from after all
the escalation cost is added to it and
the
exchange rate variations are taken on
board and if that first aircraft of this
way to arrive at a particular time the
price would have been that so-called 526
that he's talking about it would have
been far higher and that is what we are
calculating and telling that UPA's
contract would have led to 736 or
whatever I've quoted 700 plus price
which is the price after escalation and
exchange rate variations so if he has to
compare the basic aircraft price 700
plus is the price that we have to
compare with the 670 that we are talking
about they are not disclosing with the
weapon systems obviously because they
didn't even have a deal in the first
place
now all of us are forgetting the
constant comparison is with an on deal
and when it is with the non deal isn't
the whole thing itself unfair if you
bought even one aeroplane one fighter
aircraft then compare that one fighter
aircrafts price which you bought its
reach to India and then their force is
using you compare that with what I'm
buying
there was making the question so well
thank you just understand this all too
well
information before it goes to another
customer customer up there at a little
bit but not do the other customer
to us we'd be on a path to mr. Rodney I
don't that have been coming along with
the sister from each other for hydration
just for me to understand your question
you're saying why don't we disclose the
price of the I got your question shriek
energy the agreement intergovernmental
agreement does not enough neither India
no the manufacturer to reveal the prices
of the weaponry because it means it has
an implication on national security so
if I don't say it doesn't mean my seller
can say it it's a nagging invasion it's
been the same procedure in my US
government as well and by your
government
yes we have several deals of for mr. aka
Anthony was the den event defense
minister where he is replied to
Parliament saying that he cannot
disclose absolutely it just our national
interests so I don't say it it doesn't
mean the seller can sell it
it's my national interest anyway alright
alright we have two questions we have
the news room is flooded you know I I
beg your indulgence sir please stay on
with me but I had two questions from my
Twitter friends are who Suniti tecora
who says is the government and BJP
dealing with Raul's falsehoods
effectively that's for the people to
judge I think I will relentlessly deal
with it I will continue to deal with it
I will sit wherever people want me to
sit to answer every question and that if
like the Prime Minister today said in a
speech you can wake up somebody who's
sleeping
but somebody who wants or who's
pretending to sleep any attempt to wake
up or anything about that
Ramesh para Carta also has a question
and he says why aren't BJP MPs moving a
privileged notice against Rahul Gandhi
for spreading falsehoods you answer that
question before but that's a question
from Ramesh para Carta or on Twitter so
hum our last caller joining in on this
broadcast yes sir what's your question -
the Rajamundry hello live America ji and
also I didn't graduate and great linear
velocity Ramon G or pillows fractional -
thank you ma'am I am really proud of you
and I hardly graduate you for the awful
Puri speech in the Lok Sabha throwing
out and slamming with Rahul Gandhi
dealing with the point by point details
of the rough-in deal thank you
ma'am I am damn sure that India is truly
felishj hated by the intra field alert
this would help Modi come back to power
my question is how will the failed deal
help you politically well of you
personally Nirmala Sitharaman well
Nirmala Sitharaman ji politically gain
something power within the because I
thought your question so on gee now let
her answer well politically I think it
will certainly help the BJP it'll help
Prime Minister Modi because a false
campaign was used to defame the prime
minister to call him names to falsely
accuse him of having ripped the
government money and given it to some
private party all of which have been
proved wrong even by the supreme court I
think now we will be on a better wicket
to stand up and say I'm sorry not just
your campaign was full full of falsehood
but it looked as if you purposely ripped
this controversy out because you thought
this government has run without any
corruption and negation for five years
you cannot automated charges by Rahul
Gandhi well Raksha mantri our newsroom
is still buzzing so can can I have a
promise from you that in the
times to come if the questions mount and
