about Indian foreign policy India's
international relations and India's
involvement in solving major Global
problems viewers in this episode we are
taking up the phenomenon of India's
International rescue missions and
evacuations of its citizens who are
stranded in dire conditions in crisis
zones around the world
and to discuss this I have a special
guest with me in the studio let me
introduce you to him ah captain alok
bansal
Captain bansal is director at the
nationalistic think tank India
foundation and a former naval officer
was commanded warships and served in the
Indian Navy for more than three decades
uh Captain it's an honor to have you in
the studio welcome to Indian diplomacy
thank you
Captain bunsel rescue missions India has
earned a name for itself as a global
leader in this in this you know area and
in this field and over the years we have
honed the skills our armed forces have
done this for decades now with great
success and
we have a huge diaspora around the world
32 million and Counting nris as well as
people of Indian origin and inevitably
you know wherever there is a crisis
there are Indians there and so we've
seen this now recently with the crisis
in Sudan in Africa with operation kaveri
and we have been trying to extricate all
our citizens as well as help citizens of
other countries and this you know has a
tradition so I'd like you to start by
telling the audience ah why we are so
good at this you know and what is it
that our Armed Forces bring to the table
that is so unique what is our USP when
we do these complex emergency
evacuations see firstly we need to
understand that these evacuations
require a very very good
collaboration between diplomacy and
defense I think there are only two
Dimensions to these rescue missions that
is defense and diplomacy and I think our
Defense Forces have actually become
experts in dealing in adversities
actually and today we have acquired a
name for ourselves if you remember when
we evacuated citizens from Yemen U.S
state Department issued an advisory to
All American citizens saying that we
have no representation in Yemen American
citizens should contact Indian
Indian Mission and they have assured
that they will pull out everyone who
contacts them that was an assurance
earlier also wherever we have pulled out
people we have actually managed to pull
out citizens of other friendly foreign
countries and in this particular Mission
ah which is Sudan is of course a very
very complex issue because here you have
two militias fighting and while both
militias have given assurances that will
adhere to ceasefire and they will
maintain ceasefire for three days then
now again seven days but these
ceasefires we have seen have been
violated more as a rule than as an
exception because you have people who
are not really well disciplined well
trained and they are actually so it is
the capabilities of the Indian Armed
Forces to deal in such operations like
in Sudan you saw Indian Air Force planes
landing in pitch dark airfields using
nightwear night vision devices I think
that shows this skill levels of Indian
armed forces and also the collaboration
between the three services you have Navy
ships at Port Sudan you have aircraft
Landing in Khartoum and other places so
that shows how Indian armed forces are
able to move around and extricate people
in such complex and troubled spots of
the world and along presumably our
forces they train for these emergencies
right I mean the humanitarian Essence
and disaster relief the hadr missions of
course we know ah they train we have
actually done an episode on that in
Indian diplomacy but ah for these kind
of ah Mass evacuations in emergencies
where there is fighting going on all
around and where there is high risk to
lives of our citizens I mean the record
shows I mean touchwood we have lost very
few of our citizens in these you know
crises because we have been able to go
in Fast and get them out ah you know
securely and this for this in the armed
forces I am sure all three ah wings of
the Armed Forces we train regularly and
prepare for these contingencies isn't it
see firstly we need to understand that
Innovation is the characteristics of
Indian psych so Innovation is actually a
very very phenomenal phenomena in Indian
Armed Forces as well if you remember
when operation Cactus took place Indian
Air Force planes landed in Malay air for
international airport with a tourist map
they had nothing else but a tourist map
with which they landed at that Airfield
so we have innovated and one of the
major operations which all three
services take a lot of interest is in
amphibious operations and amphibious
operations have amphibious assaults as
well as amphibious withdrawals like
Dunkirk and that where all three
services have to collaborate and pull
out citizens using a amphibious
operations ah but in most of many of
these cases which have been landlocked
countries where you have to quickly
evacuate your citizens you have to send
aircraft and pull them out ah very often
people don't realize that it is not very
easy to pull out people who are living
in a foreign country you need to
understand that you can be an Indian who
is living for two years in a say foreign
country now you tell them just pack up
pack up in a suitcase and move yeah it's
not a very easy decision for that person
to take because he's living there he's
got a full-fledged household running he
doesn't know when he'll come back yeah
and if at all he'll come back high level
of risk and uncertainty so what to leave
behind what to carry you one needs to
understand that emotion and that's why
when people say just pull out people
with one suitcases it may not always be
feasible if there is time people would
want to take at least a certain level of
belongings and move and that's where you
heavy lift capabilities actually come
into play but when you have to quickly
evacuate you have to use air force and
air resources and of course Army and the
ground troops are essential to ensure a
certain level of security at that
particular point because many of these
areas are so complex that you one really
doesn't know who is fighting whom yeah
like it's happening in Sudan you only
hear gunshots are being fired no clear
picture is emerging as to who is
occupying a particular area who's firing
and who is not firing absolutely so
viewers complex emergencies are such
that it's very difficult terrain to
operate but Indian armed forces have
really shown their metal and capability
time and again in these dire conditions
and have been able to ah whisk not only
Indian citizens but also citizens of
other countries who are facing risk to
their lives so on this um the operation
kaveri in Sudan ah I have a very
interesting video of the Indian Air
Force mission that Captain alak bansal
was already mentioning in the pitch of
the dark with very little ah you know
logistical ah backup Indian Air Force
did daring rescue operation of more than
120 stranded Indian citizens in Sudan
let us watch this video and continue the
discussion
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
audacity and Flawless execution Ah
that's what the Indian Air Force is
known for and that's what they have done
once again in Sudan Captain bansal
Flawless execution this is something
we've already spoken about and the
professionalism and the skill of our
Armed Forces but clearly in all these
complex emergencies we also like you've
said before the also the Diplomatic
element and we try to engage with local
actors to make sure there is safe
passage for our citizens and sometimes
they give guarantees but as you said in
these ah you know Lawless zones War
zones no guarantee is actually foolproof
and anything any in any time can happen
so in that kind of circumstance we just
saw this daring you know hair raising uh
you know
operation by the Indian Air Force now
this kind of situation
um what would the soldier go in in with
instructions you know I mean as
civilians in the audience you know you
are a former naval officer what would
the soldier be told that what do we need
to accomplish what's the mission and how
do we do this see this is where if you
saw the clip they talked about the
audacity
it is the audaciousness because these
sort of operations are not copy book
operations you have to go beyond the
Call of Duty to perform them and you
have to do things which have not been
done now Landing a big transport
aircraft in pitch dark knight on an
unlit Airfield with no navigational AIDS
is not recommended anywhere yeah the
aircraft's manufacturers don't recommend
it so you have to do it you have to test
your skills that audaciousness is
required and that requires a certain
level of confidence as far as the pilots
are concerned that they will be able to
land they need a certain amount of
confidence that yes there may be firing
from that Airfield you have no idea and
this is where I said the diplomacy and
defense interface is very very important
and that's why you saw in this
particular operation defense attache was
leading the operation correct that is
where very important is that this
amalgamation of defense and diplomacy is
very very essential and that's why I
think it's very very important that more
and more Indian Missions have different
defense wings so that you have defense
and diplomatic interface because that
defense attache can assess the situation
better he was posted in our Embassy in
cartoon that's right yeah and otherwise
what happens is for a diplomat is very
difficult to assess the Tactical
situation as is prevailing whether an
aircraft can there may be a sniper
sitting somewhere far off he may not not
be visible to him but once the aircraft
lands he can start firing as you saw in
this particular case same Airfield the
Turkish plane was fired so that's what I
am trying to say that that is where you
have to be and as far as the soldiers
are concerned it has to be a soldier who
is willing to take risk and fortunately
for us Indian armed forces have those
ethos where soldiers go beyond the Call
of Duty to perform then you will find
invariably there are numerous examples
in Indian Armed Forces where people have
gone well beyond the Call of Duty to
take risks go into and perform audacious
operations to serve the cause of the
nation so this selfless service motto
which is always and then the other Moto
which has guided us always in these
evacuations and
complex emergencies is the notion that
leave no one behind and our leadership
both civilian and military have been
very clear that we will try and do our
utmost you know and try and you know
bring everyone back because every single
Indian overseas life is of value you
know and we would never abandon them and
that's a you know principle point isn't
it undoubtedly in fact anybody who has
reached the airfold has been evacuated
but not only Indian citizens we have
actually provided an helping hand to all
our friendly countries anybody who has
approached India that yes our citizens
are stranded and they may not have the
facilities many of our smaller neighbors
don't have the wherewithal to pull out
their citizens from these troubled spots
and we have always provided them a
helping and as I said earlier that not
only to smaller Neighbors one of the
biggest and most powerful country the
United States dependent on Indian
evacuation when it came to Yemen you
remember that and we have done
evacuations in certain cases where there
was a active conflict going on you
remember the Lebanese conflict but also
here we have to say that our diplomacy
has also been extremely deaf we have
managed to talk to the two sides and
there have been uh
temporary ceasefires it happened it also
happened in Lebanon for a time so that
is where I said both defense and
diplomacy are integral for Relief
operations like this and I think these
relief operations give us a huge
diplomatic payoff please remember the
citizens of other countries when you
evacuate the amount of Goodwill that you
earn is far more than any other
diplomatic guest gesture that you might
make as far as those countries are
concerned yeah the Goodwill is forever
and they do remember that a friend in
need you know came to the rescue at the
right time and so India in fact Prime
Minister Modi has said that the reason
we are able to do this is also shows the
growing influence of India you know
around the world and this is just one
manifestation of that the fact that so
many countries now rely on India to be
able to pull out their citizens in
crisis even the most recent one in Sudan
we have been ah we have evacuated
citizens of neighboring countries as
well apart from Indians so this just
shows I think a broader conception of
humanity isn't it I mean in our approach
to the world of course our citizens are
always first and foremost our priority
but along with them to the extent
possible we will serve the broader
humanity and that is a you know part of
our civilization lithos isn't it
undoubtedly vasudeva become we have said
in G20 Moto also you can see so we are
talking of humanity we actually don't
try and discriminate that if somebody is
not our citizen will not provide a
helping hand but more significantly what
Prime Minister Modi has done is that he
has told our Sark Neighbors in fact that
some of them may not have facilities so
we will provide them like earlier he
said Sark satellite will provide them
satellite now if they have to evacuate
their citizens and they don't have the
facility India is always willing to do
that and this is not only in this in
fact there are so many fields where you
can see India has gone and helped its
neighbors be it vaccine be it satellite
and now you are seeing ah rescue
missions h a Dr of course has always
been our specialty in fact in this
particular not only in our neighborhood
but in the wider Indian Ocean region
Whenever there has been a crisis
people have dependent on it and now
Indian armed forces have shown that they
have the capacity we withdrew our
citizens from Lebanon we withdrew from
Libya Yemen Libya Ukraine we pulled out
Afghanistan so all over the world now we
have seen that we have the capacity and
this is very important because please
understand Indian diaspora is a very
very valuable tool of Indian diplomacy
India's teacher in the global Committee
of nation Rises with the rise in the
diaspora standing as Indian diaspora
rises in U.S the India U.S relations
have improved the secondly the diaspora
is also a very powerful source of
remittances that come to you which is
actually building up your foreign
exchange reserves now for this diaspora
to function overseas they should be
confident that there is a government
which will pull them out in case they
face any crisis and that is a very very
important thing that now Indian armed
forces have shown that they have a
global reach they can pull out their
citizens from any adversity anywhere in
the globe and that's a very important
absolutely India has the back of its
diaspora and they should feel confident
that wherever they are in trouble ah
India is there to look out for their
well-being says Captain alak bansal
viewers we've already spoken about the
importance of diplomacy in these rescue
missions and on this I would like you to
hear India's external affairs minister
Dr subramaniam Jai Shankar talking about
operation ganga which was a very big ah
mission that India did in 2022 ah when
the Ukraine War began and the kind of
coordination it involved with so many
countries and also the whole of
government approach of India to make
sure that all our standard citizens were
safe and evacuated let's here from Dr J
Shankar and continue
the strategy for evacuation was to take
out Indian Nationals from western
western neighboring countries of
Australia that were Poland Slovak
Republic Hungary Romania and Moldova
this was necessitated due to the closure
of Ukrainian airspace on 24 February
to carry this out we were required to
strengthen our missions in these
countries so that they could deploy
teams at the border points set up
Transit camps operate effective control
rooms and facilitate the large number of
air flights along with that they also
handled incoming humanitarian assistance
47 additional mea officials were
dispatched to ensure these objectives
supplementing a pre-existing Embassy
strength of 58.
honorable members should appreciate that
along with our Embassy Personnel these
officials have gone to extraordinary
lands in difficult circumstances to
ensure that operation ganga was
successful
that their constant intervention at
border checkpoints help to address
severe challenges posed by over
congestion
the license with local governments and
Community organizations was responsible
for the boring lodging and medical
attention of evacuees and of course the
handle the complexity of flight
operations on the ground so that the
return home was a smoother process
under operation ganga 90 flights have
been operated out of which 76 were
civilian flights and 14 by Indian Air
Force flights the evacuation flights
were from Romania Poland Hungary and
Slovakia while Indian Air Force Rose to
the occasion most of the private
Airlines and that includes Air India Air
India Express Indigo SpiceJet vistara go
ahead and Air Asia also participated
enthusiastically
so viewers you got a glimpse of the kind
of complex mission that India undertook
to Rescue 22 000 Indians who were stuck
in Ukraine at the beginning of the
Russia Ukraine war Captain alok bansal
we had just heard the Indian external
affairs minister talking about the
liaison with many many neighboring
countries for passage safe passage and
here was a classic example operation
ganga where Air Force was involved and
also by land as well as you know local
diplomatic commissions of all the
neighboring countries Indian Missions
there and no less than the Prime
Minister himself or Dr Jay Shankar has
mentioned that he personally called
President Vladimir Putin of Russia
president zelinsky of Ukraine and
likewise in all the missions that we've
been talking about in this episode
highest level attention has happened and
that's one way operation Rahat in Yemen
for example Prime Minister Modi directly
spoke to the Saudi king Salman and
requested you know ceasefire so that our
citizens could be evacuated through
Yemen ah and most recently with
operation kaveri also in Sudan Dr Jay
Shankar said he had spoken to
counterparts in Saudi Arabia in the UAE
and that's how it's been made possible
so in a way the crises are not isolated
happening in one country right they are
part of a region where there are other
stakeholders who have influence in those
countries and we've always tried to
leverage that influence to be able to
make this happen and that is the essence
of this diplomacy isn't it undoubtedly
in fact if you look at Ukrainian crisis
ah the amount of good relations we
managed with Ukraine's Neighbors from
where citizens were evacuated the good
relations we had with Russia and that's
how we found that Indian citizens were
allowed a free passage and were allowed
to move out of the conflict Zone without
any hampering by any other country in
fact it was a huge number which actually
moved to these neighboring countries and
where Indian Missions and Indian
diplomats were positioned in fact Indian
governments sent Union ministers and
other officials to all these countries
so that Indian citizens could be
evacuated from there that requires a
very very high level of coordination and
of course this can only come when the
person at the helm of Affairs that's our
honorable prime minister took charge of
this situation and in fact guided them
because we saw cabinet ministers
different cabinet ministers being
positioned in different countries
neighboring Ukraine from where the
people were being pulled out it again as
I said it again requires a very very
high level of diplomacy at the same time
you also need coordination with Defense
Forces because you saw the Air Force
also carrying out evacuation the naval
ships also indulge in pulling out people
and similar thing happened in Yemen
Yemen of course it was easier because
both the sides that the conflicting
sides had good relations with India
India was one of the fortunate countries
which had very good relations with Iran
as well as Saudi Arabia's whose proxies
were in fact fighting in Yemen and we
could request them to stop using our
channels uh Captain bansal we are almost
running out of time but last point on
prime minister's personal chemistry with
world leaders I mean Dr Jay Shankar has
said that when he is on the call saying
our citizens are stuck in this area
please help he says Ah the counterpart
the president or the prime minister or
the King on the other side knows him
personally and he says meaning they
cannot say no to him because he is
already built a repo without a very
personal level so people sometimes ask
what is the value of personal chemistry
at the you know Summit level diplomacy
but in this crisis in these evacuations
we see that in a real way happening
isn't it undoubtedly the prime minister
of India has a global Persona he has
built up such personal chemistries that
he can speak to virtually any Global
leader and get what we want and that is
what we have seen in this crisis
situation the other countries have gone
out of their way to to facilitate India
here I must also say that in Dr
jayashankar we also have a very great
Diplomat who understands the
coordination between diplomacy and
defenses one of those few diplomats who
understand how defense can also be used
for as a powerful diplomatic tool and
this actually he is inherited because
his father was one of the architects who
talks of defense and diplomacy who felt
the defense has a very important role to
play both in geopolitics and
international relations and I think he
has always understood in fact if you go
back and see wherever he has been the
envoy of India when he was a diplomat he
has always used diploma defense also as
a very very powerful absolutely so
viewers the point is India is in good
hands India's Got A Visionary leadership
that understands the link between
defense and diplomacy says Captain alloc
bansal I want to thank him for valuable
insights for sharing with the audience
so thank you so much for being on the
show thank you so much so viewers the
point is India is rising to the okay
it's an inspirational story it's a
heroic story what India's Armed Forces
India's diplomats and India's civilian
leadership has done Time After Time
Crisis after crisis wherever ah there is
a violence and bloodshed around the
world and where our citizens as well as
citizens of other countries are at risk
India has risen to the occasion so this
is something to feel proud about as an
Indian but also something to study and
understand because not every country
which may want to do this has a
capabilities to do this so it's a
combination of intent and capabilities
that's what India is showing let's keep
our eyes on India's rescue diplomacy
because the world is full of Crisis is
there are more conflicts emerging in the
Contemporary Global Arena and I am sure
that Indian forces and Indian leadership
will again be called upon to the rescue
sooner or later so this is a great
National Asset to be celebrated but also
to be studied keep an eye on this and
I'll see you again next time until then
take care

diamonds which is our salute to over 32
million strong Indian diets were
represent in over 200 countries
worldwide I'm Gotham Roy
the show launched the same day same time
earlier this year around the time the
17th pravasi bharta deva's convention
was held in madhya pradesh's indoor City
PVD provides a platform for the overseas
Indian Community to engage with the
government and the people of India and
share their experiences and insights it
also helps strengthen ties between India
and Global Indian diaspora and to
recognize the achievements and
contributions of Indians living abroad
the pravasi bharti samman awards are an
integral part of the binal event of PVD
and are conferred by the president of
India upon members of the Indian
diaspora who've made exceptional
contribution in their chosen fields and
have acted as India's ambassadors in
foreign lands Our Guest this week is one
such a body this year Professor ramji
Prasad recipient
award and founder president cgc Denmark
welcome to transfer diamonds Professor
Prasad and thank you for joining us from
Wisconsin in the U.S where you are at
the present now first of all
congratulations for the award what were
your first thoughts when you heard that
you're getting the highest honor that
the Indian government can give to an
Indian living abroad which your in your
case is Denmark
yeah it has been a great pleasure but I
heard it actually the Indian ambassador
to Denmark she called me she informed me
about it
and
naturally it's a matter of excitement my
wife was with me I talked to her that
this is the word government of India is
going to give me and uh Ambassador
herself again for me because the
question came who is talking to you and
how far it may be correct but I said
Ambassador herself is talking to me so
it is 100 correct and we have to plan
time was very short because it was
perhaps if I remember correctly and
second of January I was informed and
then I was supposed to fly fifth of
January and uh of course we decided to
fly together so I had to arrange a
flight ticket of my wife also so it was
arrived that both were excited very
happy informed to our family members
wonderful now what can you tell us about
your journey from India to Denmark from
your origins in the Indian state of
Bihar to how did you get to settle in
Denmark
let me tell you this is very interesting
you know my uh that time it was bihad
not jharkhand so my high school of
course
then I was admitted in beatitrary but at
that time it was called the Bihar
Institute of Technology now it is called
bit science flow technology
after the two states divided Bihar and
jharkhand
naturally I got my degree from there
besides of Technology a bachelor of
degree if I remember correctly in 68 and
then I joined buildings of technology
for my master program and then I was a
project assistant professor after
Masters I did my PhD and that is the way
Journey started in India and they even
surprised all my education in India in
Bihar in Ranchi and when people hear
they don't believe it they don't believe
Indian education can be also high
standard and that too education given in
behalf that was that is the question
many people asked me whenever I cross
meet people
and sometime in the lift they say where
did you get your education in the U.S I
said no you know Europe know where I
said from Bihar they don't believe that
is it possible that somebody has got a
degree from Bihar and top of this kind
of wireless communication but that is
their 100 true story
and then after finishing my education in
fbit Mishra I was student Professor I
became a student professor and then
I was invited by Dutch government
to join and to lead satellite
Communications for rural development of
Africa okay I accepted the offer first
it was discussed in the house but the
Dutch government posted me in Tanzania
for five years 63 let me remember my I
think
I went to Africa in 83 yeah 83 I went to
Africa and Tanzania to lead the research
for satellite communication for rural
development of Africa it issue 288 I was
in Tanzania then Dutch government asked
me what is your plan
and uh naturally I thought I will be
back to India now besides your
technology you know business technology
because at that time Dr ishi Pandey he
was the director later he became first
my Chancellor also okay so he has told
me ramji don't resign take holiday and
leave otherwise suppose you are back to
India may be difficult to get a job so
my job was there at a bit Mishra but the
Dutch government asked me to continue
with the government and I was offered or
rather I went back to delft University
of Technology one of the best university
in Europe and of course one of the top
university Europe there I was appointed
and I was asked to take the lead of the
research still I remember when first
time I had a meeting with the director
by Chancellor of this music technology
and their Deans they asked my plan and I
told them first I will learn the
language so that I understand the people
they said there are many deaf people who
know the Dutch don't waste your time and
run it that teach the research because
that people think that it is difficult
to do research in Wireless
telecommunication and publish the paper
of high quality so I stopped learning
the Dutch language and you will surprise
them I was in Holland almost 12 13 years
then now I'm in Denmark and I know only
two language Hindi my mother tongue and
English English I learned also because
of my sister my bhabi right she told me
if you want to become top scientists we
have to learn one foreign language don't
stress on only Hindi why this question
came my father was Freedom Fighter the
day I was born and I was almost to be
born my father got arrested by British
people and he was in jail so house was
empty my mother was alone but okay
neighbors helped us Indian culture is
there and I took the birth so I was
really biased with language only Hindi
because of my Bhabhi I learned English
she said that something you want to
become on the global level you have to
learn some language other than
Hindi so I learned English it will
surprise at the age of 14 I learned
English
ABCD and those alphabets and so on okay
so I moved to Netherlands I was there
and then my children grew I have three
children one daughter and two sons they
grew and has happened every family that
they got a very good job and then moved
around the globe my daughter is in
California my son is in this place
Wisconsin youngest son and the Elder son
is in Japan and all three are leading
Global people except youngest son he did
business yesterday they have Financial
economies he would be surprised my
daughter and son both are in Wireless
communication my youngest son
yeah my youngest son said is supposed
Wireless collapsed then we will not have
the money to eat so one should go
outside Wireless and he went to the
business and at the moment I am here and
of course I have a lot of meetings and
discussion with different universities
for collaboration okay this is the short
story of my journey from Netherlands to
Denmark so children left and then my
wife decided to move somewhere where
else I got in medicine from various
places in the world including the us but
we decided to settle down in Denmark
okay wonderful that's that's quite a
story now you've been given the pravasi
bharti saman award for your
contributions in the field of
Information Technology you're the
founder president of CTI of global
capsule which is also called cgc and the
founder chairperson of global ICT
standardization Forum of India as well
could you tell us a little bit more
about your work in IIT and Telecom
this is also surprising the story My
academy career my PhD is in plasma
physics I did PhD and at which science
uh sorry business for technology in the
area of Plaza physics then I moved
and then I decided that okay plasma is a
good subject it has very good future and
I should do something else and then I
decided to move ahead in the field of
telecommunication and the the huge
shortage of top experts in the field of
wireless communication but I told you I
had a first meeting with the white
counselor director what we call in
Europe of desert technology and it's a
zombie make a plan in some different
direction to move ahead in Netherlands
so after giving lots of thought and
discussions with my family and
colleagues I decided to go into field of
wireless communication
and as I told you this was not my
subject my subject was plasma so
suddenly I moved and I moved let me
recollect my mind it was 88 89 when I
moved and in the short time I became the
world leader in the field of
telecommunication IIT what you call
information communication technology
and many Dutch people learn from me did
PhD with me and if you look my list of
publication the number of highest
saturation I have the first book I wrote
on ofdm but the first book in the world
map with one of my phds20 was just a
student and he did feel the in the field
of Applied communication so I called him
at my home his name is Richard funny as
Richard I want to write a book together
with you in the field of omdm and OMD
was not known as the subject full
forming orthogonal frequency division
multiple access so Richard said sir I
have not done the work in this field I
said look I know your capability we can
write together a book and the first book
we wrote on ofdm in the world map is
many countries like in Germany even
these people they call it Bible of
telecommunication
so that book has citation more than
seven thousand many professors in the
world don't have overall Services seven
thousand but that only one publication
is citizen more than seven thousand and
there are other publication I did in
many areas so this is a short story
about ICT if I keep on talking being a
professor I think I can talk about
flowers and I was about this topic it's
a very fascinating topic but you've also
authored over five books related to over
six in five books are related to various
uh future Technologies and supervised
over uh in fact 50 books rather and 150
phds as well you supervise uh you're a
world a renowned Telecom expert as well
now where you see both wire and wireless
communication taking the world in the
coming years
wireless communication uh as you might
have heard from our prime minister
Modi that he wants that India to take
lead in the field of siddhi India should
become number one country in the field
of Sergio and I am committed for that
and 6G if you look my publication list
will find already I have published four
books on 3D two books are underway so by
end of this year I will have six books
on Sunday I don't think any other
Professor or scientists have written so
many books on one topic 6G itself of
course I have written book on 3G 4G 5G
shivji and one of my PhD student is from
Finland his name is KERO go and Pera and
he was that time the city of Nokia when
Nokia was dropped in the sky and it was
a surprise day he was being interviewed
just like today you are taking my
interview he was interviewed by the
principal house I think it was Finland
or somewhere else I don't remember
exactly and then one question is they
asked that Taro you are talking 3G 4G
maybe 5G that time it was three time
five University what will happen after
that he said after 60 there will be
grounding there is what is the meaning
of ramji still alive
is my professor and his name will fly
into Sky after deal so when you what
will happen at the end so there'll be no
new generations it is the generation of
rams they will continue in the world map
that was the statement Nokia situated
time right now you mentioned your uh six
books on 60 uh the Indian government
recently came out with the 6G Vision
document as well and uh of course we've
also announced investment plans for a 60
test bed too now do you think India can
take a leading position in the world
with these initiatives in 60
Technologies and uh in this network
yeah let me come to this point there are
two important platform which I have
created one is the CTI of global capsule
stands for core daily infrastructure
Global capsule I tell you when I was a
young child maybe five years old my
sister got very sick that time it was
typhoid as for my memory concerned and
doctor said she will not survive a
medicine was required to get from that
time that medicine was not available in
India from England or somewhere I don't
remember exactly but uh
when it came everybody was talking
capsule she will be all right and really
she became all right and uh so capsule
world in the mind that capsule can save
anything so I decided to call the new
platform interval capsule that it can
save the world it can make that
telecommunition grow in the world so I
called cityif Global capsule people ask
me why do you call capsule this is the
history behind calling it capsule the
city I have Global Capital which I
launched if I remember in 2004 and then
slowly that time I was in album let me
tell you at the moment I am with the old
University but when I came to Denmark I
was at Alba University and then after
album I moved to OSH University
at this point I want to tell you one
interesting point that whether it is an
album or a horse or else I never applied
for the position I always have been
invited although I came off one
invitation also I came on invitation so
that is my brief career about ICT about
this this way that also interesting
story I can tell you I was in China
there was a meeting about still rice and
long before I'm talking
and I saw the crowd there was no Indian
in the Gathering and it was the mythical
standardization I was surprised why
there is no Indian so as the chairman
that why there is no Indian he says sir
you are here I said yes here I am here
but you have invited me as a European
and then I was told that India is not
having any standardization body and
therefore Indians are not here and that
is the moment I took about that I will
launch historical body in India and I
returned back India I went to Kolkata I
invited people from industry government
of India a commission and so on and
launched Global ICT is to license forum
for India
and street is continuing I go to India
every year at least three times have the
workshop have an event just this time
also I was in India
and it was kolhapur
and Mumbai
had a program for history and that was
the 48th event of this week event in
India so I go to India not quite after
at least two times three times every
year and now I am coming again in
November great how critical do you think
is this rapid progression in
communication technology especially from
4G to 5G and now 60 to India's overall
economic growth progress and development
India is already on the path to become
the world's third largest economy within
this decade but isn't the potential to
change the lives of every Indian for the
better the real game changer
yes let me tell you wireless
communication is now everywhere in every
Walk of Life whether you go to
agriculture whether you go normal life
whether in medical science anywhere
Wireless is very very important and
definitely it will help to grow the
economy of India to any extent what Modi
wants what we want what everybody wants
so definitely it will grow economy and
as you mentioned that it may be third
economy in the world I'm quite sure
maybe one day it may become number one
in the world also and not I cannot
forecast it but definitely India will
grow very much and the brainly India has
is whether you go to U.S whether you go
to Europe if you look in the U.S also if
if you look the top Publications out of
10 publication at least five
Publications will be written by Indian
origin they may have become American
they may have become Danish or that like
me and so on but they are all from
Indian origin so India has the
capability to become number one in the
world all right now you've been living
in Denmark for several years it must
have given you a lot of insight into
Denmark socio-economic milieu there is
definitely religious and cultural
connection with the India but how do you
assess the other efforts which are being
made to build upon this base and to make
the the partnership between India and
Denmark one of the 21st Century
here that is a good point see India is
there are two points that I will try to
tell you I mentioned to delish people I
mentioned to my Indian colleagues that
if you look at the number of you know
why Nobel Prize winner density in the
world
then Mark is number one
I'm not talking about number of no Prize
winners it did Mark is a small country
number of winners divided by population
of the country Denmark is number one in
the world
India has
now it has become to my knowledge the
largest population in the world we have
overpassed China now yes by this year
you might be knowing better than me so
such a large population in India we have
the brain we have that capability
Denmark has another capability if we
join the hand together I think really in
the knowledge in the wisdom in the
academic side lower price winners and so
on economy of course so really will grow
to any extent government desires so long
government support the activities yes
certainly we have a green strategic
partnership in place but overall how is
India viewed by the Danes themselves is
it seen as a rising Global power which
is also the voice of the global South as
it is attempting to be while hosting the
G20 Summit this year
about the view of people about India you
are talking yes
you have Danish people
Dennis people yes view is very positive
if I remember correctly year before last
year Dennis prime minister she was there
in India last year uh Indian Prime
Minister Modi was here Indian North
Korea in the U.S in Denmark
and then Dennis Brown prince prince is
also visited India so view is very good
view is very positive and dense people
look India in a growing country they
want to work together with Denmark and
India and even host University where I
am employed at the moment actually
looking very high point of view and uh
Richter and Dean and hate they want to
visit discuss and create a collaboration
with Indian universities Industries and
so on so view is very positive to my
understanding of course I am with the
academic field I am either talking with
the accommissions or Industries and so
on Common People I'm sure they might be
having positive View
thirdly now Indians are kind of
long-standing yes Indians have also had
a long-standing presence in Denmark the
numbers around 18 500 now who live and
work uh there but they range from it
professionals to students now how have
they been contributing to the
advancement and progress of Denmark
in general the connection which I have
with Indians in Denmark they are highly
qualified people I have made doctors
from India and they are doing good
service they have a good position in
Denmark so I have met a medical doctors
mostly medical doctors I am making their
family and of course there are also in
the industry also so I think overall
they have felt good I don't think they
have got any bad opinion in any way at
least they have not talked to me
and how's this contribution viewed by
their adopted country
how about contributions from Denmark the
Indian Community in Denmark their
contribution how they viewed by the
people there by Denmark itself because
even your contribution I believe has
been recognized in the highest level in
Denmark as well
you were right as I told you that I have
a lot of connection with the medical
doctors
they people tell us people believe that
these doctors are quite good they can do
good service for any society and so on
that not only it is my feeling but like
my fellow Dennis colleagues when they
come across the Delhi Indian doctors
they come and tell me that treatment was
very good and they are very positive
right and your your own contribution has
been recognized by the Dutch authorities
as well right
yeah
okay now before we have to go tell us
about the experience of attending the
prabhasi bharti there was convention in
Indore I'm sure you must have uh or you
do may you mentioned that you keep
coming to India every now and then now
what was the impression that you took
back when you visited indoor uh you know
about India's progress and development
a very good question you are asking me
indoor is it a nice place
very clean City and uh Indian Prime
Minister mentioned also in his stock the
cleanest city in the country
and he advised us to visit some
important places
we didn't have much time but definitely
I realized the country is good people
are good and many people came to attend
the event I think
of course our bodies were there but the
hall was crowded
I think
overall I felt very good about my fellow
Indians that this was the question I was
asked by Indian press reporter also
after the award and I gave the same
answer
wonderful and finally why do you think
this honor that you and a select few
others have got this yeah the highest
that the Indian government can give to
Indians Living World what do you think
it would mean to the larger Indian
diaspora worldwide
very good question let me tell you uh
let me recollect the ear
2010 I got the similar award from the
queen of Derma
and
that award if I remember correctly they
called what in England they called
Knighthood
in Danish they call let me see I have
written also today I don't know the
language the reader of the order of
deliver that is what they call in
Denmark that was the award I got in 2010
and now when then many times I have been
asked even in writing what's similar
award you have got from India
naturally I had never got such similar
award except a small award here and
there so when I got this I won I said
now I have the answer if any Danish
people ask me any similar award then I
have the award that perhaps more
powerful than this award and I don't
want to say but definitely
similar award I got from India I am very
proud of it proudly I talk about it it's
a it was announced in Danish newspaper
everywhere about this award so I'm so
happy and excited that finally I got
award from my motherland
yes and and uh how do you think uh this
uh award what sort of message do you
think it conveys to the larger Indian
diaspora
larger yeah
my message is that India is a great
country India has a big Talent we have
to commit ourselves
if we commit we can achieve what our
prime minister is talking what we are
thinking ourselves and we have to decide
to bring India at the Forefront the
world not only until you communication
every technology every area of science
economics and so on countries should
grow this should be our commitment this
is my message as in of course ordinary I
am an Indian
hundred percent Indian but at the same
time legally I am having that passport
then I am working full time in Denmark
so you know I have so I always say I'm a
global citizen by birth I am an Indian
by passport I am Dutch by job I am
Danish but I work for the global
development and India is at the
Forefront in my head as I told you I
travel every year at least two three
times to India so my message is let us
work together whether we are working
outside or inside India work together
make India number one in the world this
is the message what I want to give you
give to my fellow Indians create and I'm
sure every is working towards that goal
as well to the best of their ability and
thank you so much for joining us and
talking about your experiences your
insights as far as being a pravasi is

impact that it has created we are joined
by Mr proful ketka who is the editor
organizer uh welcome Mr ketka welcome to
DD India appreciate you giving us your
precious time first of all I mean uh we
saw the reactions also I mean hundred
episode of monkey but it's a big thing I
mean like I said 100 episode of monkey
bath and big celebration also took place
not only in India but across the globe
big achievement and pm2 said that monkey
but is a reflection of monkey bath of
crores of Indians and it is an
expression of their feelings your
thoughts
Abhishek certainly it's a it's a unique
moment for for many reasons uh you know
100 episodes of any consecutive thing is
uh is important but here uh for three
reasons I believe monkey path is
different one
nowhere in the world head of the
government
have a conversation with the people on a
regular basis
on the issues concerning Nation
individuals success stories and
celebrating or creating new campaigns
with people's participation
two
the mode of communication the way we the
the way uh all India radio has been
revived earlier I was also I come from
media background and I was also uh quite
uh concerned how radio can be a means of
communication but perhaps I believe uh
globally this is first of this kind of
podcast uh form that that has survives
for such a long period That's Right
third and most important period point is
I think this is the first uh kind of
communicative program a two-way
communicative program in a way where
non-political issues have got the center
stage
of discussion and that's why it is more
a kind of hard to hard talk yeah other
than you know a one-sided monkey bath of
uh Prime of the Prime Minister of
country it has become a the way you know
another point that I would like to add
is the way Technologies being used in
this entire process you know people are
allowed to use and share their ideas
either through my Go app or through a
website or through Twitter handles and
the way there
stories you know many icons who have not
recognized even at their local level got
the recognition through monkey path they
become National icon and only then the
locally people could understand that
these are these things are important
in fact if you see in last nine years
most of the participatory campaigns that
have got a new traction whether you take
such you take vocal for local or yoga or
fit India movement you take any campaign
and you see monkey path has given a new
kind of participatory approach and that
is uh I think is the reason the way uh
inclusivity technology uh
multi-dimensional communication but
non-political right
that is that is that is I think key to
the success of monkey man and also uh I
mean how do you look at the entire
journey I mean when the first episode
was aired in October 2014 it's been nine
years almost the transformation when you
listen to somebody and get hooked on to
it listen to it month after month and
that's because of the trust like you
also mentioned people really waiting for
the next episode to come on the last
Sunday of the month how do you want to
explain the journey from October 2014 to
now April 2023
see uh 3rd October 2014 when it started
initially it looked like more a
one-sided Communication in fact I
remember uh many of the opposition
leaders uh mocking it or criticizing it
as only one-sided communication uh today
also we see many people uh talking about
why no press conference you know it has
become a new category of people
but I think people are absolutely fine
because people's voices are air uh
directly in communication with the Prime
Minister prime minister is sharing his
thoughts on the issues raised by people
so he is directly communicating with the
masses
and over the period of time the
transformation as I have mentioned
earlier the way this program is uh you
know from
um technologically the way it has
integrated with various issues the way
community involvement is there the way
individual success stories are there so
people feel connected uh to the issues
and that's why
it doesn't look monotonous it doesn't
look uh it is it is Evergreen because
you look forward what are we going to
listen what are we see in media nowadays
people are sped up of uh political
stories political scams uh binaries of
you know dividing Society on various
fault lines
people want to listen positive things
people want to listen to success stories
profile stories and that is what uh you
know
I don't know what is the mechanism for
this uh and perhaps in one of the monkey
baths uh prime minister himself can
explain this but this is a unique way
whether uh you uh look at our Padma
awardees or the people who are lacked
off in Monkey but there they are the
unique success stories of India of
Indians who are uh contributing
selflessly because I remember prime
minister mentioning about uh one
self-help group that you are uh you know
showing on your screen uh where women
actually have taken up you know
activities related to toys and the way
it has become a success story or the way
prime minister has coined a new word for
different table people called Divya and
it immediately became popular so the the
Harga kiranga campaign the way it became
people's campaign all these things
clearly show that the way Innovation the
technology the scale that prime minister
speaks about the way he has successfully
implemented himself through monkey bath
it was always a kind of new kind of
perfection though only voice and voice
modulation is there the way he has
integrated certain things in this
program right it has made always new you
know something new is always being
presented though the intent and the
spirit behind the program is the same
also Mr ketka stronger and more
meaningful the dialogue between the
public and the leader the stronger and
more successful the Democracy becomes
and the head of the government talking
to people talking to the audience the
listeners do you feel the key to success
is that the program lies in
non-political a political character of
communication which is work wonders
oh yes means every time when there was
some political drama going on around
whether 2019 election or before and
after that or avoid whopsy kind of drama
always I had a hunch oh this time
perhaps he will pick up some political
issue or pass some political remark
which he generally does but I I have
seen you know uh three kinds of uh Modis
uh one who speaks in the parliament as a
statement who generally speaks about the
agenda of the government to uh
as a political leader who speaks in
political rallies and three uh Modi as
people's leader who talks about their
issues their concerns in a national
perspective and give them some policy
for a positive perspective see when he
speaks in monkey bath you don't feel
like prime minister is speaking you feel
like somebody elderly from your home is
discussing family issues and trying to
find some common solutions to the
problems and that is the feeling that
monkey bath has created yeah and that
that is the you know success the the
success of democracy the essence of
democracy lies in participation and
communication in fact there are there
are multiple theories about uh political
participation from Apache
to actual position holding in the in the
uh political party or political process
but here what prime minister has done is
uh without directly connecting it to
either political participation in party
terms or voting terms or political
position
he has made every citizen a stakeholder
with 96 percent of people have heard of
uh of monkey bath or at least once they
have hooked to it that clearly shows
that India's democracy is much much
vibrant much much participatory and
inclusive than most of the western
democracy and Western Democratic critics
would like to believe and project
through their narratives right Mr gitkar
also I mean like you were also saying
the medium of communication mode of
communication in digital world when in
fact TV also has taken a back seat radio
in this age of podcast Twitter insta
radio as you think got a new lease of
life in this generation with PM's monkey
bath because radio programs reach is so
heartening to know like you are also
saying 96 percent of the people know
about monkey bath
see I think uh prime minister uh knows
uh pulse of the nation than anybody else
please try and understand still to every
nook and corner of this country radio is
the only medium that reaches second
perhaps is uh you know your platform
Abdul darshan and he realized this very
well whether rich or poor whether uh you
know in the northeast corner or extreme
uh Eastern Corner whether a latak or
lakshadweep
volunteer radio is always there and
that's why perhaps he had chosen this
platform though it is being aired
through multiple Platforms in in
multiple languages the primary medium is
all India radio and that's why it is
available accessible to each and every
person of this country and the person
has a choice to listen in his or her own
language the person has a choice to
choose
his or her own medium and that is the
beauty of and as as I said PM talks
about Innovation uh technology uh scale
and he has perfectly executed this
through uh the the concept called monkey
bar right Mr Keta we need to talk about
the impact also I mean through this
initiative you think uh the Prime
Minister has been able to build the
trust and connect with people on an
emotional level also and Inspire them to
work towards a better future for the
country because he talks about basic
issues like poverty if we talk about
exams Sports women empowerment
digitalization also you think he has
been able to connect with people
emotionally and that can do attitude has
also come when he talks to people
through monkey bath
to understand this we need to understand
the background on which prime minister
assumed the office
firstly he was
in a way Outsider for entire Delhi
politics and people where uh you know uh
quite uh you know not sure about his
take mainly on a way of functioning
foreign policy issues economic policies
but more than that the background was
you know anti-corruption movement the
the the
States in in the democratic system and
the political class in general was
eroding corruption was a norm and in
this background when prime minister
assumed office and in on on 3rd of
October 2014 when he started this what
he had done actually is he analyze the
mindset in a positive direction through
mankipath he uh created a new kind of
bonding with the common Masters he
created a trust about government
policies and their implementation on the
ground and that's why I don't remember
anywhere in the world prime minister
giving a call to people to give up their
subsidies and crops of people come out
and actually do that
so that clearly shows the the way as I
said the way democracy has got a new
meaning the new kind of communication he
has created his own channels he has
created his own media of communication
and that's why perhaps he doesn't have
to give any press conference because he
is always in a communicative mood with
the people uh people are there to ask
him
questions to raise issues to share their
ideas their odds and he is there to
respect to respond and that is the
beauty of monkey but that absolutely Mr
ketkar I mean mindset uh I mean program
created a positive and important mindset
also among people I mean success stories
created a can-do attitude that they can
also do change of mindset also we have
seen people think that if others can do
I should also be part of something and
it does actually make a lot of
difference
oh yes see one of the reasons why people
like to read about the icons about the
success stories is uh to get inspiration
they they the confidence that uh you
know these kind of stories give that if
a person can do such wonders I can also
do if his stories can be his story can
be picked up and shared at the national
level my story also can be so uh it had
you know given a new kind of confidence
about to the artists to The Artisans uh
to the uh innovators uh first generation
entrepreneurs that bear
steps towards success their contribution
to the nation will be recognized
appreciated and create inspiration from
for others and this this mindset of of
uh doing something constructive for the
country doing something uh positive for
the country uh that has got a new Philip
uh through monkey bar right and also uh
PM spoke about many initiatives and
talking about kadhi it can be swachh
bharata Beyond also we talk about ah
vocal for local also and chair for India
it happened during the Olympic Journey
also I mean it does make a lot of
difference I mean he ah I mean he talks
to people and then people also feel
connected and basically he talks about
the
grassroot level things he talks about
things which are connected with people
so that's I think that has made a monkey
bad a very connected to the people and
that's the difference in monkey bath and
other programs
see I have already spoken about all
these kind of schemes uh whether uh
ujjwala whether vocal for local or
swachh Bharat abhiyan this definitely
where you know success stories and that
that have uh got a new shape through
monkey path but I feel monkey path
became most important vehicle of
communication uh during the kovil crisis
the way his call for participation in
government initiatives adhering to
government guidelines
ensuring effective implementation of
vaccination process all these things and
it was a testing time for entire world
and nowhere we have seen the way Prime
Minister Modi did the way he
communicated the way he announced you
know can you imagine you know prime
minister coming out and giving a call
all for something and people just
lockdown themselves either the
guidelines hundred percent uh in in any
other country of India's you know the
kind of population density we have the
kind of uh diversities and the uh even
the economic disparities we have any
other country would have faced a very
difficult and challenging situation
almost leading to chaos Anarchy and
Revolution but India and Indian
democracy has successfully passed
through that stage Society positively
respond to the initiatives came out to
help each other use various
technological means to find solutions
that happen and Monkey Bar definitely
played a positive role and also Mr
ketkar before we wind up I mean PN pm
has been talking to the sports person
youth also which I think the Highlight
too and likening it to the Prasad
offering to gore and said that it has
become a spiritual journey for him and
this shows how Prime Ministers himself
so attached to the program monkey bath
oh uh see from local level the grassroot
level the the Interiors of India to
today United Nations uh we have seen
monkey path creating a different kind of
uh the way yoga movement was built up
and it is but natural and it clearly
looks like his own concept getting a new
kind of shape uh new kind of Innovations
new kind of implementation and it is but
natural for uh for a leader like Modi
who always like to be connected with the
people communicate with the people uh a
communicator for excellence who has
Mac to uh touched the pulse of Common
People it is but natural that he is
emotionally attached to this program and
it was clearly uh visible in his uh 100
program of monkey bath where his
uh you know I believe while talking
about the success stories of Bharat he
has created a new success story for
himself which is which is non-political
in nature yeah and also Mr monkey bath
Going Global in the 100th episode across
many places how does you think that help
when India looks to leave an impression
with the world and looks to connect
globally prime minister's message
transcending Borrowers
oh yes United Nations and more than 100
places all over the country all over the
world uh today witnessed
uh and it clearly uh uh you know a
positive message about Indian democracy
there have been uh uh you know attempts
to either demean or uh somehow uh create
a negative perceptions about India's
democracy but monkey path is perhaps uh
the biggest positive uh indicator where
a prime minister or head of the
government and common people talk to
each other in such a positive manner in
non-political issues development issues
health issues
individual success stories and perhaps
this is now a model for many of the
Western countries who who claim to have
Monopoly over democracy and the
Democratic idea this is India's gift to
them that the real vibrant democracy
function in this way where a leader and
people talk heart to heart
absolutely
turns 100 and going global also but does
monkey bath acknowledge the strength and
power of over 125 crore Indians and
motivate them to do their best in nation
building
oh yes we we have seen many such stories
uh where uh whether startups or
stand-ups or or the way uh Financial
inclusion and it is a different kind of
inspiration for people uh uh inspiration
uh for people by people
Prime Minister Modi and mantri but it's
just a medium to it so people inspiring
people and prime minister is just
facilitating facilitating that through
monkey path and that is the key where
these positive wives are shared with
each other in in Indian democracy last
question PM Modi has always led by
example we all know and looking at the
reach of this program
ah other countries leaders might take a
leaf and start doing something of the
same sort
I I I'm surprised that nobody has tried
this but I think it's very difficult to
imitate it's very difficult to imitate
for uh two three reasons the way Prime
Minister Modi has an act to communicate
uh not many leaders would would be able
to do that secondly uh the the Indian
context the cultural context and the the
way Prime Minister Modi is uh connected
with his diversity so he can talk about
the temples and he can talk about
technology in the same Prince and which
same conviction so he he will talk about
some small festival or Mela as if he has
been participating it since his
childhood and he will talk about the new
technology technological challenge that
is coming and still inspire people to
take a picture take it up as a challenge
so I think uh I'm really surprised that
no no head of the government has ever
tried this world over
but perhaps they know that it's
difficult to uh you know emulate this
kind of model is the passion and the
desire of prime minister Narendra Modi
is commendable and monkey bath in fact
has been instrumental in enabling the PM
to inform educate and remind people on
ways to contribute to nation building

welcome to Indian diplomacy window into
India's international relations India's
foreign policy India's major strategic
Partnerships and also Global and
Regional developments that have an
impact on India's rise in the world ah
viewers in this episode we are taking up
a interesting trend of a rising military
expenditure by Major countries around
the world growing military spending and
what that does to India's options and
choices this is the topic for this
episode and to discuss this I have a
very distinguished expert joining me in
the studio let me introduce you to him
Air Marshal Anil Chopra
air multi Chopra is a distinguished
retired officer of the Indian Air Force
he is currently director general of the
center for air power studies and a very
prominent thinker and writer on
strategic Affairs Air Marshal welcome to
Indian diplomacy thank you so much
sriram always a pleasure I've been
watching your show for many months now
and I must say that you're doing a great
job not only putting the things in
correct perspective but also educating
the masses in the country yes thank you
thank you so much hey Marshall the
Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute sipri has come up with the
latest data about global Military
expenditure and there is a consistent
secular increase in global military
spending over since 2015 and there is if
you will see a decade wise there is more
almost a 19 percent increase in global
Military expenditure all the trends are
looking upwards defense manufacturers
are having a great time because you know
their products are in high demand but
but the first and foremost question is
why are so many countries feeling so
insecure and why are they you know
stockpiling weapons and acquiring more
and more advanced weapons why they're
spending so much on Military and what
happened to that you know the Halcyon
Days of the post Cold War period when we
you know almost all the major Powers
were reducing defense budgets but now
the defense budgets are just rising and
zooming up so we're in a much more
insecure and dangerous World your
thoughts on why this is happening yeah
you know see Ram 2.2 trillion dollars is
the global spent which has come out with
slippery report
and we know that that's 3.7 percent
increase from last year
yes where has the increase been and the
Americans of course the largest defense
Spenders they have increased by four
percent China by seven percent India by
13 percent Russia by 40 percent because
of the war and Ukraine by 640 percent
that's the kind of increase there has
been award in the last few years whether
it was in Afghanistan
in Iraq before that so the a fresh cold
war is developing uh you know in Europe
now I'll give you some more Figures ah
America spends
more than the next 14 countries put
together yeah China spends eight times
the remaining uh you know a double the
amount that's spent by the next eight
countries so there is a large amount of
Defense expenditure there's war in
Europe there's indo-pacific competition
building up so these increases are
taking place but if you see that
inflation and other reasons 3.7 is not
too large uh you know increase yes and
ah you mentioned the theaters ah if you
look at the data the bulk of the you
know defense spending ah is coming
obviously from Europe because of the
ongoing war ah Russia Ukraine but also
um from Oceania and Asia and the Middle
East where Saudi Arabia is a big for
example spender after India Saudi Arabia
is next in terms of the overall spending
so it is quite clear that conflict
theaters and
ah preparation for conflict or even
active combat these seem to be driving
up these Trends and ah in that sense
it's looking more dangerous right the
long piece has ended so to say after
1991 and now more and more theaters are
ah you know sucking up the oxygen in
terms of resources of governments and
countries so either you are already in a
war or you are preparing for war that
seems to be the logic behind this so it
looks like a very gloomy scenario in
terms of Global Security see first 15
countries in the world are spending 82
percent of the defense expenditure in
the world and first five are spending 63
percent so first Europe Europe has had
the largest increase in defense budget
since last year 13 percent relatively
the best Asia Asia Oceania these are
relative less of course Africa the Total
Defense budget is on the decline minus
five percent so
now there's a saying one American
president has said long time back that
the American democracy is run by the
military industrial complex of America
yeah Eisenhower Eisenhower in 61. we we
all remember this famous and of course
by the gun lobby so America cries all
the time their defense military
complexes all the time looking for some
War somewhere now because of what has
happened in Ukraine uh last year Europe
natto has given instructions that each
country natto must go up to two percent
of the defense budget by 2020 2030 or
2033 what is the figure the country like
Poland which said that they will go up
four percent of GDP next year so that is
the kind of increases that are taking
place uh the uh the number of NATO
countries have increased Now by another
three new entrants and there is going to
be increased defense budgets in Europe
and also in indo-pacific because there
are the two theaters of future action
and and Marshall the contingency
planning I mean one is that these are
responses to immediate exigencies of
ongoing conflict right but if you look
at the longer term over the decade or
something then it looks like nobody is
really ah assured that it's going to be
a peaceful environment I mean there
seems to be ah definitely the return of
great power politics and contention and
we are in a different era right and that
ah you know quieter ah phase is over and
in that sense the militaries are you
know playing a bigger role the defense
industrial complexes as you say are
playing a bigger role and perhaps the
diplomacy and the you know civilian side
of international relations is taking a
back seat because it looks like ah the
men in Boots are needed and are back in
demand
you know when Americans moved out of
Afghanistan we were hoping that they
will continue to concentrate only in the
competition in indo-pacific nobody
thought that they will drive Russia to a
position that a conflict will begin in
Ukraine of course the the West Fields
differently they feel that the Russians
have invaded but we all know that
situation has been created where NATO
has physically moved in the borders of
Russia and since there is no buffer
Russia had no choice because Ukraine had
said that they will also want to join
NATO and this was unacceptable to Russia
and this war could have been highly
avoided if this not let us look at the
areas of conflict now Europe which had
had a peaceful time since the end of
Cold War is now becoming an area of
action uh the Russians are spending more
they have spent 87 billion dollars last
year more than one year that that's uh
more than India uh nearly uh you know 40
percent increase and they're going to
spend much more the action in
indo-pacific there is something called
the Pacific Defense Initiative this is a
huge chunk of money which America gives
to this to build up and support the
countries around that U.S Pacific
command is the largest command so these
are the two earlier we have had West
Asia of course there are dynamics
Happening Here Israel is you know
stabilizing its defense expenditures
Saudis Iranians have started talking
there is some churn taking place Central
Asia also the influence of China Russia
there is action here and of course for
India uh our two models remain live
China border has become you know very
active in the last three years and with
Pakistan things are not improving so
there are specific Pockets yeah where
there is action and therefore there will
be greater military spending yes
absolutely zones of action are in a way
growing in number and in geographical
spread says Air Marshal and Chopra and
viewers uh talking of India and our
security imperatives our military
spending obviously China is the number
one adversary that India is facing and
we have had a very difficult ah last few
years of relationship with them
including ah active ah fighting on the
borders which has led to loss of lives
on both sides and in that context I'd
like you to hear India's chief of Army
staff General Manoj Pandey talked about
China its intentions and its
capabilities and how we need to respond
to that let us hear ah General Pandey
and resume the discussion
China's economic transition and
technological progression
has given it the capability to emerge as
a major military power
concurrent to its military rise
its strategic doctrines to have seen
various traits
from a war zone concept of fighting a
limited War
under high tech conditions
to the three warfares approach
entailing public opinion psychological
warfare and legal Warfare
and of late to that of an unrestricted
Warfare
with conventional capable capacities
being available to effect massive
destruction of an adversary it is
increasingly displaying a willingness to
project its military power
as seen from its aggressive attempts to
establishment military bases in the
indo-pacific Africa and more importantly
in our immediate neighborhood as well
the rapid expansion of PL and Navy
is reflective of its extra Regional
power projection intentions
the proliferation of its military
weapons equipment and technology is
enhancing
military capabilities of a number of
states
some in South Asia too which is of
concern
its forays in the South China Sea
rejection of international tribunal
Awards on Maritime claims
activities in the Taiwan Straits and
actions along the Lac
bordering on bellicosity make it
increasingly apparent
that China's interpretation of an
international
rules-based order
rest on might is right so viewers you
just heard Snippets of important speech
given by India's chief of Army staff
Air Marshal Chopra ah
COA is talking about you know the
Chinese intent and also the military
doctrines and the amount of resources
they are pouring into their ah you know
long term objective of achieving
hegemony in the indo-pacific and it's in
that context really that we need to put
this cpri data and the military spending
in context because ah we already spoke
about what is happening in Europe and
Which is less of a direct strategic
concern for us but here you have next
door a billy course neighbor as chief of
Army staff is saying and which is
officially spending 290 1 million or 292
billion dollars but then ah many dispute
the official data and say that probably
the Chinese is spending double or more
than double of what is officially stated
so we are talking about a country that
is bulking up very fast and these are
the fastest growing Navy and you know
the kind of Investments they are making
it shows that you know they are aiming
to dominate our entire you know Maritime
and even land land borders so is in that
kind of context there where we need to
talk about military spending what the
Chinese are doing and in response we are
seeing not only India which is rising ah
you know increasing its outlays but also
Japan Australia all of them have
announced large scale buildups to try
and counter balance because there is an
imbalance that's developing isn't it and
that's the fundamental problem that we
in Asia are staring at when we look at
the massive Chinese defense budgets
you don't see it up I must tell you that
nearly for 20 years Chinese have had
yearly defense budget increase of 10
percent only in the last three four
years the figures come below 10 percent
significant because the economy is large
they are 10 percent is a huge physical
sum so that is what China has been China
is very clear the Communist party has
given clear Direction they want to be a
superpower they will be a Technology
power by 2025 by 2049 with 100 Years of
communist parties uh Centenary being in
power they are going to be a global
power so their focus is very clear and
therefore one needs to study and
understand because they are competing
not with India they're competing with
USA the greatest power your rightly said
that they have got today more Naval
vessels than USA in numbers of course in
college the Americans are still ahead
you have rightly said in space you know
space is where the next Frontier is the
number of annual launches for last three
years is more than U.S states in fact
it's more than USA India and many
European countries put together wow
that's the kind of advances that they
are making these figures must bother us
there is a gap we have a modernization
backlog within the country you know that
Indian Air Force is down to 30 scotlands
instead of 42 they're already having 150
fifth generation aircraft they have got
Hypersonic you know Glide Vehicles which
have been tested and actually
operationalized so in many fields in AI
in Quantum in cyber in electronic
warfare the Chinese have pumped in huge
amount of monies and you rightly said
Japan has last year announced their
National Security strategy in which they
have said that they will go to two
percent of the GDP as their defense
budget by uh in next five years that is
by 2027
everybody is spending of course the
August has been done to make the
Australians spend more money because the
Continental size country was spending
less than South Korea so that is the aim
of the exercise so action is going to be
an indo-pacific and for us Chinese are
already uh making friends in Indo Indian
Ocean they their physical presence has
increased they are sitting in Jeopardy
guadar is fully operational it's a great
Port they are in hanban Tota they are
sitting all over and fears about them
being in Myanmar also and of course they
are close to Myanmar they have invested
in Bangladesh investment because that
so-called Singapore I must tell you that
Indian government in the last five years
has to some extent neutralized by making
friends in the neighborhood and we are
doing a great job our lookiest active
still working well with many countries
right up to Vietnam Philippines are good
friends of ours now we are working with
Indonesia we are working in Singapore we
are doing exercises military exercises
with all of them so there is the
government is working on that but the
fact is that the gravity in India and
China continues to build and we must do
something
to bridge that Gap
let me also say on the positive side you
know
On the Border the Border roads the
infrastructure India are doing a great
job though China is much ahead of us the
total strength of the Indian army
sitting on in the Himalayas is
significant uh we will in many sectors
we are much much better off than them
the number of airfields the Indian Air
Force has got 25 of them and planes at
lower altitudes vis-a-vis the 11 12 the
Chinese have got at much higher altitude
we are sitting uh reasonably all right
but certainly the amount of you know
training the the materials that they are
bringing in here the Cyber and the
Quantum of missiles that they have got
whether they cruise missiles or their
ground based missiles is much larger and
therefore we must you know increase and
I will mention to you as we go along
where are the areas that we need to
increase yes absolutely so we need to
increase there is no question that uh
air Martini Chopra is talking about the
Strategic gap between India and China
has been growing and you know we would
ideally hope for at least three percent
of India's GDP should be spent on
defense to try and catch up and of
course Air Marshal in a broader sense
the competition ah is also about
economic growth between India and China
and hopefully we are poised for
substantially faster growth than them in
the next 10 years so then you know as we
go forward the Gap will hopefully ah
start reducing ah so that we are
comfortably placed but like you said
there are ah you know terrain advantages
we may have in some parts where we are
contesting with the Chinese and the
Partnerships the Strategic partnership
because India is a democracy we are more
trusted by a lot of Western countries ah
we have defense diplomacy you know a lot
of them are willing to share technology
and co-produce with us Western countries
are quite wary of transferring anything
of dual use or military to to China so
in that sense hopefully I think the
conditions are good for us to close the
gap isn't it going forward yeah you know
undoubtedly first we have to have a
great economy for us to be able to spend
more on defense a 3.7 trillion this year
5 trillion 2025 Target highly achievable
so I think we are all right defense
production we have sold 13
000 crores of exports of Defense
production this first time we arriving
for two to three billion dollars we are
on a good track in many areas
initiatives the last budget make in
India initiative it's I think happening
in in a great way
Partnerships is what you mentioned and I
must say a quad
started slowly in between slowed down
but now in the last three four years
quad has come up
we have got in court with all the three
countries we are the fourth we have got
two plus two dialogue with all we have
interoperability uh arrangements with
all we are exercising all the three
services exercising with all the
countries and look at the partners that
the West has got you know Japan South
Korea Philippines
in the Vietnam all are relatively better
economies who's got Chinese friends
Myanmar North Korea Cambodia North Korea
all four of them are dithering as well
so if you actually do a matchup of the
coalitions uh so to say then an analysis
on the physical strengths the number of
ships aircraft aircraft carriers tanks
of course tanks not as relevant as much
as the you know ships and aircraft I
have done the analysis and you find that
this Collision is much much stronger and
if we as India has to make sure that in
Indian Ocean we continue to dominate and
we have the potential we need to well be
Andaman and nicobars and some other you
know actions we have to do and I agree
with you we have to go up in defense
budget maybe three percent
ambitious let's at least reach 2.5 from
2.03 that we are currently absolutely so
viewers the thing is so we are trying to
catch up and reduce the Strategic Gap in
China ah and now I'd like us to hear
from one of our best National Security
Experts he teaches a ropage in the
global University professor pankaja and
talking about what are the specific
weapons ah you know and platforms and
systems that Indian military all the
three Wings need going forward
especially to face the Chinese
competition let's hear human continue
the discussion
one of the important issues which comes
up that what will be the future warfare
be like because India is facing two
basic adversaries Pakistan and China
with China in mind I believe there is a
need for more work more research more
innovation in the field of hyper
spectral sensors in the field of
electronic warfare but if you look into
how the different wings of the Armed
Forces should prepare it accordingly I
Believe In The Air Force demand there is
a need for much more work with regard to
Precision guided long-range strikes and
missiles also we need to look into how
these electronic warfare is going to
shape up in the future and disruptive
Technologies which can really interfere
with your onboard systems particularly
avionics is a critical area which we
need to look into it in Army I believe
there is a lot of research which has
happened done in terms of Robotics and
and robotic modes you have recently got
but it needs to be seen that how you can
protect the soldier how you can enhance
the mobility of the soldiers both
physically and mentally and also look
for a smart Soldier which can be
protected through various armor and
other kind of equipment which can help
him to get a sense of the theater in
terms of Navy I believe there is a lot
which is going to happen in the next 10
odd years particularly in terms of
quantum Computing you know Quantum
sensors undersea Warfare is going to get
more intense given the fact that
countries like China are really looking
and trying with the undersea gliders and
have also identified India as Indian
Ocean as one of the areas where they
will be focusing on in this regard the
Navy requires a lot of work with regard
to Smart minds and smart frigates as
well as looking into these aspects so uh
viewers that's a big bucket list of
things that India needs ah Professor
pankaj are talking about Air Marshal ah
clearly there are specific weapon
systems more future oriented from what I
could get as a civilian and a
non-specialist in defense he is mostly
talking about electronics and you know
computerized sized and information based
you know Deeds going forward so a lot of
emphasis on digital and future
Technologies and that's something where
I think we have been lagging because in
r d for example ah as percentage of GDP
it's less than one percent in India and
we are prime minister has this you know
Mission Innovation and startups even in
defense we have the idex idex we are
trying to stimulate an environment where
more ah you know Innovation happens in
these fields so for indigenous
manufacturing but the point is the
Chinese are spending 2.4 to 2.5 percent
of GDP on R D you know so there is a gap
and hopefully more private players
should come in your thoughts on what
Professor Jah was just talking about
what we need and how how much further we
can you know ah drum up our resources
our human capital and our talent to make
this happen you know the the dream of an
indigenous you know weapons power like
like China has become you know like the
Army Chief mentioned China has moved
from being an informatized Warfare to
intelligentized Warfare
both these warfares require technology
Electronics competition Quantum all
these require these things now we are
still at the information Warfare stage
we have to take another leap forward let
me tell you what the services require
first as a common Technologies
AI robotics
quantum
we require cyber we require electronic
mind use cyber and electronic of a nutic
not new technology they have been there
for last 30 years and only thing is we
acquire the latest among them so
hypersonics directed Nazi weapons these
are the five six areas which India is
trying to con concentrate but we are
still far behind we are still at the
experimental stage in the Hypersonic you
know
disruptive disruptive technology so
there are common Technologies all the
services required because we saw after
galwar the amount of action that took
place on Cyber for the next 15 days or
1000 times the normal cyber action so
that is the kind of things not going by
service to service
you know Quest munitions
you know we have seen in Ukraine the
amount of medicine that I mean use the
Russians had to folk up their production
by three times so there is a need for
cruise missiles there is a need
ground-based or Airborne whether it's
brahmos has to be pushed look at the Air
Force
ah down to 30 skirts we need most
Cottons we require fras we require awcs
in other areas we are all right Navy
requires perhaps an aircraft carrier
it's a big decision and more submarines
submarines not only submarines we need
nuclear submarines or nuclear parts so
there are ssbn and SSN we require both
of them so there is the Armed Forces uh
have a backlog on which we need to work
we need to push in some more money in r
d the last point I want to mention is we
need to spend much more money in r d you
know that nobody is giving you engine
technology nobody is giving you a
Hypersonic nobody is giving you modern
Technologies we have to develop them
ourselves on our own so viewers um
discussion with the air model Chopra
brings out a fundamental truth is that
we are in a much more dangerous and
insecure era of world politics India is
in a much more uh you know volatile
neighborhood ah especially because of
the China Challenge ah we haven't even
talked about Pakistan but they have a
you know more of a
non-conventional pose of a more non
conventional threat but the fundamental
conventional adversary is China and we
need to brace for a long struggle on
competition with them and in the
military sphere it's unavoidable we
share the same strategic sphere and
there's very less trust between the two
countries and they are actually amping
up massively in terms of their military
spending and we cannot afford to be
behind them and I want to thank
hermantle Chopra for sharing so many
valuable technical ah you know and
strategic insights with the audience
thank you sir thank you for being on the
show thank you for inviting me I'm
always a pleasure yes so viewers let's
focus on India's military needs how it
is linked to our diplomacy how it ah can
enhance our strategic options or even
constrict our strategic options going
forward ah its unavoidable we need to
invest more in the military and we need
to catch up with those who are ahead of
us or else ah it can create a very Bleak
strategic stability and security for the
country so let's focus on military
spending it's a very important
ingredient that determines India's rise
in the world I will see you again next
time until then take care

natto has given instructions that each
country natto must go up to two percent
of the defense budget by 2020 2030 or
2033 what is the figure their country
like Poland which said that they will go
up four percent of GDP next year so that
is the kind of increases that are taking
place uh the uh the number of NATO
countries have increased Now by another
three new entrants and there is going to
be increased defense budgets in Europe
and also in indo-pacific because there
are the two thetas of future action and
and Marshall the contingency planning I
mean one is that these are responses to
immediate exigencies of ongoing conflict
right but if you look at the longer term
over the decade or something then it
looks like nobody is really ah assured
that it's going to be a peaceful
environment I mean there seems to be ah
definitely the return of great power
politics and contention and we are in a
different era right and that ah you know
quieter ah phase is over and in that
sense the militaries are you know
playing a bigger role the defense
industrial complexes as you say are
playing a bigger role and perhaps the
diplomacy and the you know civilian side
of international relations is taking a
back seat because it looks like ah the
men in Boots are needed and are back in
demand
you know when Americans moved out of
Afghanistan we were hoping that they
will continue to concentrate only in the
competition in indo-pacific nobody
thought that they will drive Russia to a
position that a conflict will begin in
Ukraine of course the the West Fields
differently they feel that the Russians
have invaded but we all know that the
situation has been created where natto
has physically moved in the borders of
Russia and since there is no buffer
Russia had no choice because Ukraine had
said that they will also want to join
NATO and this was unacceptable to Russia
and this war could have been highly
avoided if this not let us look at the
areas of conflict now Europe which had
had a peaceful time since the end of
Cold War is now becoming an area of
action uh the Russians are spending more
they have spent 87 billion dollars last
year more than one year that that's uh
more than India uh nearly uh you know 40
percent increase and they could spend
much more the action in indo-pacific
there is something called the Pacific
Defense Initiative this is a huge chunk
of money which America gives to this to
build up and support the countries
around that U.S Pacific command is the
largest command so these are the two
earlier we have had West Asia of course
there are dynamics Happening Here Israel
is you know stabilizing its defense
expenditures Saudis Iranians have
started talking there is some churn
taking place Central Asia also the
influence of China Russia there is
action here and of course for India uh
our two models remain live China border
has become uh you know very active in
the last three years uh and with
Pakistan things are not improving so
there are specific Pockets yeah where
there is action and therefore there will
be greater military spending yes
absolutely zones of action are in a way
growing in number and in geographical
spread says Air Marshal and Chopra and
viewers uh talking of India and our
security imperatives our military
spending obviously China is the number
one adversary that India is facing and
we have had a very difficult last few
years of relationship with them
including uh active fighting on the
borders which has led to loss of lives
on both sides and in that context I'd
like you to hear India's chief of Army
staff General Manoj Pandey talking about
China its intentions and its
capabilities and how we need to respond
to the let us hear ah General Pandey and
resume the discussion
China's economic transition and
technological progression
has given it the capability to emerge as
a major military power
concurrent to its military rise
its strategic doctrines to have seen
various shades
from a war zone concept of fighting a
limited War
under high tech conditions
to the three warfares approach
entailing public opinion psychological
warfare and legal Warfare
and of late to that of an unrestricted
Warfare
with conventional capable capacities
being available to effect massive
destruction of an adversary it is
increasingly displaying a willingness to
project its military power
as seen from its aggressive attempts to
establishment military bases in the
indo-pacific Africa and more importantly
in our immediate neighborhood as well
the rapid expansion of pla Navy
is reflective of its extraordinary power
projection intentions
the proliferation of its military
weapons equipment and technology is
enhancing
military capabilities of a number of
states
some in South Asia too which is of
concern
its forays in the South China Sea
rejection of international tribunal
Awards on Maritime claims
activities in the Taiwan Straits and
actions along the Lac
bordering on bellicosity make it
increasingly apparent
that China's interpretation of an
international
rules-based order
rest on might is right so viewers you
just heard Snippets of important speech
given by India's chief of Army staff
Air Marshal Chopra
COA is talking about you know the
Chinese intent and also the military
doctrines and the amount of resources
they are pouring into their you know
long term objective of achieving
hegemony in the indo-pacific and it's in
that context really that we need to put
this cpri data and the military spending
in context because ah we already spoke
about what is happening in Europe and
Which is less of a direct strategic
concern for us but here you have next
door a billy cross neighbor as chief of
Army staff is saying and which is
officially spending 290 1 million or 292
billion dollars but then ah many dispute
the official data and say that probably
the Chinese is spending double or more
than double of what is officially stated
so we are talking about a country that
is bulking up very fast and these are
the fastest growing Navy and you know
the kind of Investments they are making
it shows that you know they are aiming
to dominate our entire you know Maritime
and even land land borders so is in that
kind of context there where we need to
talk about military spending what the
Chinese are doing and in response we are
seeing not only India which is rising ah
you know increasing its outlays but also
Japan Australia all of them have
announced large-scale buildups to try
and counter balance because there is an
imbalance that's developing isn't it and
that's the fundamental problem that we
in Asia are staring at when we look at
the massive Chinese uh defense budgets
you don't see it up I must tell you that
nearly for 20 years Chinese have had
yearly defense budget increase of 10
percent only in the last three four
years the figures come below 10 percent
significant because the economy is large
they are 10 percent is a huge physical
sum so that is what China has been China
is very clear the Communist party has
given clear Direction they want to be a
superpower they will be a Technology
power by 2025 by 2049 with 100 Years of
communist parties uh Centenary being in
power they are going to be a global
power so their focus is very clear and
therefore one needs to study and
understand because they are competing
not with India they're competing with
USA the greatest power your rightly said
that they have got today more Naval
vessels than USA in numbers of course
internet the Americans are still ahead
you have rightly said in space you know
space is where the next Frontier is the
number of annual launches for the last
three years is more than us says in fact
it's more than USA India and many
European countries put together wow
that's the kind of advances that they
are making these figures must bother us
there is a gap we have a modernization
backlog within the country you know that
Indian Air Force is down to 30 scotlands
instead of 42 they're already having 150
fifth generation aircraft they have got
Hypersonic you know Glide Vehicles which
have been tested and actually
operationalized so in many fields in AI
in Quantum in cyber in electronic
warfare the Chinese have pumped in huge
amount of monies and you rightly said
Japan has last year announced their
National Security strategy in which they
have said that they will go to two
percent of the GDP as their defense
budget by uh in next five years that is
by 2027
everybody is spending of course the
August has been done to make the
Australians spend more money because the
Continental size country was spending
less than South Korea yeah so that is
the aim of the exercise so action is
going to be an indoor Pacific and for us
Chinese are already making friends in
Indo Indian Ocean they're they're
physical presence has increased they are
sitting in Jeopardy guadar is fully
operational it's a great Port they are
in hanban total they are sitting all
over and fears about them being in
Myanmar also and of course they are
close to Myanmar they have invested in
Bangladesh investment because that
so-called Singapore I must tell you that
Indian government in the last five years
has to some extent neutralized by making
friends in the neighborhood and we are
doing a great job our lookiest active is
still working well with many countries
right up to Vietnam Philippines are good
friends of ours now we are working with
Indonesia we are born in Singapore we're
doing exercises military exercises with
all of them so there is the government
is working on that but the fact is that
the gravity in India and China continues
to build and we must do something
to bridge that Gap
let me also say on the positive side you
know
On the Border the Border roads the
infrastructure India is doing a great
job though China is much ahead of us the
total strength of the Indian army
sitting on in the Himalayas is
significant
we will in many sectors we are much much
better off than them the number of
airfields the Indian Air Force has got
25 of them and planes at lower altitudes
vis-a-vis the 11 12 the Chinese have got
at much higher altitude we are sitting
uh reasonably all right but certainly
the amount of you know training the the
materials that they are bringing in here
the Cyber and the Quantum of missiles
that they have got their cruise missiles
or their ground based missiles is much
larger and therefore we must you know
increase and I will mention to you as we
go along where are the areas that we
need to increase yes absolutely so we
need to increase there's no question
that uh air Martini Chopra is talking
about the Strategic gap between India
and China has been growing and you know
we would ideally hope for at least three
percent of India's GDP should be spent
on defense to try and catch up and of
course in Marshall in a broader sense
the competition ah is also about
economic growth between India and China
and hopefully we are poised for
substantially faster growth than them in
the next 10 years so then you know as we
go forward the Gap will hopefully ah
start reducing ah so that we are
comfortably placed but like you said
there are ah you know terrain advantages
we may have in some parts where we are
contesting with the Chinese and the
Partnerships the Strategic partnership
because India is a democracy we are more
trusted by a lot of Western countries ah
we have defense diplomacy you know a lot
of them are willing to share technology
and co-produce with us Western countries
are quite wary of transferring anything
of dual use or military to to China so
in that sense hopefully I think the
conditions are good for us to close the
gap isn't it going forward yeah you know
undoubtedly first we have to have a
great economy for us to be able to spend
more on defense a 3.7 trillion this year
5 trillion 2025 Target highly achievable
so I think we are all right defense
production we have sold 13
000 crores of exports of Defense
production this first time yeah we are
aiming for two to three billion dollars
of exports we are on a good track in
many areas initiatives the last budget
make in India initiative it's I think
happening in in a great way
Partnerships is what you mentioned and I
must say
a quad
started slowly in between slowed down
but now in the last three four years
quad has come up
we have got in court with all the three
countries we are the fourth we have got
two plus two dialogue with all we have
interoperability uh arrangements with
all we are exercising all the three
services exercising with all the
countries and look at the partners that
the West has got you know Japan South
Korea Philippines pretty allies in the
Vietnam all are relatively better
economies who's got Chinese friends
Myanmar North Korea Cambodia North Korea
four all four of them are dithering as
well so if you actually do a matchup of
the coalitions uh so to say then we have
been an analysis on the physical
strengths number of ships aircraft
aircraft carriers tanks of course tanks
not as relevant as much as the you know
ships and aircraft I have done the
analysis and you find that this
Collision is much much stronger and if
we as India has to make sure that in
Indian Ocean we continue to dominate and
we have the potential we need to well be
Andaman and nicobars and some other you
know actions we have to do and I agree
with you we have to go up in defense
budget maybe three percent
ambitious let's at least reach 2.5 from
2.03 that we are currently absolute so
viewers the thing is so we are trying to
catch up and reduce the Strategic Gap in
China and now I'd like us to hear from
one of our best National Security
Experts he teaches a ropage in the
global University professor pankaja and
talking about what are the specific
weapons ah you know and platforms and
systems that Indian military all the
three Wings need going forward
especially to face the Chinese
competition let's hear human continue
the discussion
one of the important issues which comes
up that what will be the future warfare
be like because India is facing two
basic adversaries Pakistan and China
with China in mind I believe there is a
need for more work more research more
innovation in the field of hyperspectral
sensors in the field of electronic
warfare but if you look into how the
different wings of the Armed Forces
should prepare it accordingly I Believe
In The Air Force demand there is a need
for much more work with regard to
Precision guided long-range strikes and
missiles also we need to look into how
these electronic warfare is going to
shape up in the future and disruptive
Technologies which can really interfere
with your onboard systems particularly
avionics is a critical area which we
need to look into it in Army I believe
there is a lot of research which is have
been done in terms of Robotics and and
robotic modes you have recently got but
it needs to be seen that how you can
protect the soldier how you can enhance
the mobility of the soldiers both
physically and mentally and also look
for a smart Soldier which can be
protected through various armor and
other kind of equipment which can help
him to get a sense of the theater in
terms of Navy I believe there is a lot
which is going to happen in the next 10
odd years particularly in terms of
quantum Computing you know Quantum
sensors undersea Warfare is going to get
more intense given the fact that
countries like China are really looking
and trying with the undersea gliders and
have also identified India as Indian
Ocean as one of the areas where they
will be focusing on in this regard the
Navy requires a lot of work with regard
to Smart minds and and smart forgets as
well as looking into these aspects so uh
viewers that's a big bucket list of
things that India needs ah Professor
pankaj are talking about it air marshal
ah clearly there are specific weapon
systems more future oriented from what I
could get as a civilian and a
non-specialist in defense he is mostly
talking about electronics and you know
computerized raised and information
based you know Deeds going forward so a
lot of emphasis on digital and future
Technologies and that's something where
I think we have been lagging because in
r d for example ah as percentage of GDP
it's less than one percent in India and
we are prime minister has this you know
Mission Innovation and startups even in
defense we have the idex idex we are
trying to stimulate an environment where
more ah you know Innovation happens in
these fields so for indigenous
manufacturing but the point is the
Chinese are spending 2.4 to 2.5 percent
of GDP on R D you know so there is a gap
and hopefully more private players
should come in your thoughts on what
Professor Jah was just talking about
what we need and how how much further we
can you know ah drum up our resources
our human capital and our talent to make
this happen you know the the dream of an
indigenous you know weapons power like
like China has become you know like the
Army Chief mentioned China has moved
from being an informatized Warfare to
intelligentized Warfare
both these warfares require technology
Electronics competition Quantum all
these require these things now we are
still at the information Warfare stage
we have to take another leap forward let
me tell you what the services require
first as a common Technologies
AI robotics
quantum
we require cyber we require electronic
mind is cyber and electronic of a nutic
not new technology they have been there
for last 30 years and only thing is we
require the latest among them so
hypersonics directed Nazi weapons those
are the five six areas which India is
trying to con concentrate but we are
still far behind now we are still at the
experimental stage in the Hypersonic you
know
disruptive disruptive technology so
there are common Technologies all the
services required because we saw after
Galvan the amount of action that took
place on Cyber for the next 15 days or
1000 times the normal cyber action so
that is the kind of things not going by
service to service
you know Quest munitions
you know we have seen in Ukraine the
amount of medicine that have been used
the Russians had to folk up their
production by three times so there is a
need for cruise missiles there doesn't
need ground-based or Airborne with the
brahmos has to be pushed look at efforts
ah down to 30 skirts we need most
Cottons we require fras we require awcs
in other areas we are all right Navy
requires perhaps an aircraft carrier
it's a big decision and more submarines
submarines not only submarines we need
nuclear summaries or nuclear parts so
there are SSB and SSN we require both of
them so there is the Armed Forces uh
have a backlog on which we need to work
we need to push in some more money and r
d the last point I want to mention is we
need to spend much more money in r d you
know that nobody is giving you engine
technology nobody is giving you a
Hypersonic nobody is giving you modern
Technologies we have to develop them
ourselves on our own so viewers um
discussion with the air model Chopra
brings out a fundamental truth is that
we are in a much more dangerous and
insecure era of world politics India is
in a much more uh you know volatile
neighborhood ah especially because of
the China Challenge uh we haven't even
talked about Pakistan but they have a
you know more of a
non-conventional pose of a more
non-conventional threat but the
fundamental conventional adversary is
China and we need to brace for a long
struggle and competition with them and
in the military sphere and it's
unavoidable we share the same strategic
sphere and there's very less trust
between the two countries and they are
actually amping up massively in terms of
their military spending and we cannot
afford to be behind them and I want to
thank hermantle Chopra for sharing so
many valuable technical ah you know and
strategic insights with the audience
thank you sir thank you for being on the
show thank you for inviting me SRI Ram
always a pleasure yes so viewers let's
focus on India's military needs how it
is linked to our diplomacy how it ah can
enhance our strategic options or even
constrict our strategic options going
forward ah its unavoidable we need to
invest more in the military and we need
to catch up with those who are ahead of
us or else ah it can create a very Bleak
strategic stability and security for the
country so let's focus on military
spending it's a very important
ingredient that determines India's rise
in the world I will see you again next
time until then take care
thank you

diamonds which is our salute to over 32
million strong Indian diaspora present
in over 200 countries worldwide I'm
Gotham Roy
but the show launched the same day same
time earlier this year around the time
the 17th convention was held in madhya
Pradesh Indore City pbd provides a
platform for the overseas Indian
Community to engage with the government
and people of India and share their
experiences and insights it also helps
strengthen the ties between Indian and
Global Indian diaspora and to recognize
the achievements and contributions of
Indians living abroad the pravasi bharti
saman awards are an integral part of the
biennial event and are conferred by the
president of India upon members of the
Indian diaspora who made exceptional
contribution in their chosen fields and
have acted as India's ambassadors in
foreign lands Our Guest this week is one
such a body this year Professor Sanjeev
Mehta recipient award and head social
sciences Royal timpu College Bhutan
welcome to dance for our diamonds
Professor Mata and thank you for joining
us
first of all congratulations for the
award what were your first thoughts when
you heard that you're getting the
highest honor that the Indian government
can give to an Indian living abroad
which is in your case is Bhutan
uh I'm working in a Land of happiness
and my happiness level reached
the perfect epitome of it when I heard I
got a call for Indian Ambassador in
Bhutan
ji I called me and told me that you have
received this prize award I was really
elected I have no words for it
right now what can you tell us about
your journey from India to Bhutan one of
our closest neighbors how did you get to
settle down over there
it's a very long story I'll try to put
it in a very nutshell uh it wasn't way
back in 1993 when I was working just
fresh post-graduate I was working in the
Government College
I received the news actually that I've
been selected I gave an interview and I
got selected to work in Bhutan
and my plan was there to stay for about
a year or two
but the destiny had its own views and I
stayed longer than I intended I got her
opportunity to work with the Mumbai
University but I decided not to do that
my Association for Bhutan was beyond
before that I joined Bhutan
my mother is from kalimpanza I used to
come to Bhutan when I was a child I was
always first
great sounds great it's a it's a dream
come true then staying there for so many
years now now you've been giveness a Man
Award for your contributions in the
field of Education you're currently the
head of social sciences at the Royal
Temple College but you had other
positions in different universities
abroad as well and in other Global
institutions tell us about your academic
activities
um right now I'm basically head of
social sciences uh as well as the
program leader for development economic
courses in uh at roethlis college and uh
I've been the person who developed
economics curriculum
University
uh almost I would say single-handedly
and this is one major contribution in
terms of curriculum development my usual
work is teaching
consultancy and research so these are
the focus area I do mostly the work I am
engaged I was engaged by the undp I
developed Economic Development policy of
Bhutan that was the first Economic
Development position that Bhutan had and
I worked with the government agencies I
keep on working with the international
agencies
and made research focuses uh development
issues uh as well as International Trade
Regional integration
I also uh actually guest lecture in
Germany and
and also spin
so these are the basically the work I do
and I also contribute to basically
evidence-based public discourse in
bhutanese media as well as through
seminars and conferences I'm a I I write
a lot of article in newspapers and media
in Bhutan I participate in discussions
in their media beside TV and uh and
other videos here wonderful you've also
authored several research papers and
books including the dragon economy and
experiment with happiness Bhutan has
known the world over for its emphasis on
ensuring gross domestic happiness and
making that a parameter for Progress
instead of GDP what is your perspective
on this approach to development
it's a very Innovative approach I would
say
for
actually the one of the criticism that
we face as the mainstream Economist is
that too much focus on materialistic
development
and we realized that uh complete focus
on materialistic development actually
can lead us to and as it has led us to
crisis including the climate change
pattern environment configuration and
also the unhappiness and certainly say
that
yeah so we have to think of an
alternative and the gross national
happiness provided that alternative
and it provided A New Perspective to
development to take a balanced
perspective between materialistic and
spiritual growth
and this whole idea of gns can developed
it was formalized by the fourth king of
Bhutan and he said that for us
GNH that is gross national happiness is
more important than GDP
and this actually led to the entire
institutional change policy change that
Bhutan had to focus its development
priorities in desired Direction it helps
the country
who actually go in a desired Direction
Over The Period of time maybe you don't
achieve the results as you want all but
you are in right direction
right but in the 2023 World happiness
report Bhutan has slipped to the 97th
rank India is lower than Pakistan and
Sri Lanka two neighboring countries
facing the worst economic and political
crises experts appointed at biases in
this world happiness report now is
measuring the happiness of Nations or
ranking them a Fool's errand
I completely agree with you I think this
is uh what you call methodological flaws
conceptual flaws with which the
happiness report suffers from
um one basic thing I I can point out
some of the major methodological issues
that are there with the happiness report
and this is the reason there are no
major buyers of this report now
one is the they actually from every
country they pick up thousand samples
they are not
decided determine and uh irrespective of
the size of the country they take 1000
and is it representative it is biased it
is not representative
second thing which is also critical is
they actually take three years average
I'm not sure they haven't written
methodology completely if they don't
take the views from the same person over
the three years you really can't apple
add apples and oranges they are doing
they are what they are doing is adding
apple and oranges
and third thing is the way because
happiness is a very psychological uh
framework it's very subjective
very subjective so so I understand
knows the idea of combining them
together is really meaningless
subjective well-being is uh actually
this is the reason why it is not picked
up significantly
it's flawed and basically if you think
that Pakistan and Sri Lanka fare better
than India and Bhutan
especially India then it's it's actually
speaks volumes about the methodological
flows it has
certainly now the pursuit of happiness
of its people has been a national
aspiration for Bhutan for several years
now you said the fourth King formalized
it now what can India and the world
learn from this particular Drive
yeah one thing as I mentioned uh one
thing we have to learn is that we have
to give equal importance to
till we
welder well-being of people along with
the materialistic happy
this would require fundamental changes
in our approach one the kind of
Institutions that we have the kind of
policies we have then we have to shift
our Focus away from competition to
collaboration away from self-interest to
common interest away
uh what you call the position and
ownership to
Community basically Community feeling
and so if you are able to inculcate
those aspects on which the Bhutan is
based
probably I think we have to go a long
way to bring about the desired elements
of development in our countries we are
not saying that we should not look for
uh the GDP growth rate because without
which we cannot achieve certain
objectives like poverty alleviation
employment generation but life is much
more beyond that
and uh we have paid heavy price in terms
of pollution in terms of uh the mental
distress the people have the crime rates
that are increasing well I indicative
that we are not going in right direction
and this is the reason why we have to
take a lease from Bhutan is that we have
to shift our Focus
um what is the desired thing I think
each continues to decide its own pathway
that's not necessarily that we uh mirror
is what the Bhutan has done but based on
our own priorities based on our own
cultural perspective based on our own
history I think we have to determine the
right path for ourselves we have to take
a call with our models should not be our
models are eurocentric I think we have
to come out of those eurocentric mode
okay
now you've been living in Bhutan for
several years now it must have given you
a lot of insight into the bhutanese
social economic there is definitely a
religious and cultural connection with
India but how do you assess the other
efforts which are made which are being
made to build on it to make the two
countries 21st century partners
India Bhutan the relationship is
long-lasting relationship but it has to
evolve like any other thing I see
different Pathways for indomatan
relationship to strengthen one is uh is
the new ways uh new paradigms of
cooperation so far it is
hydroelectricity and trade but I think
we have to look for how India and Bhutan
can work together on the issue like
climate change Bhutan both Bhutan and
India are likely to suffer from these
particular processes and this is the
area where Bhutan and India can work
together and bring benefit not to these
two countries but entire South Asia the
second thing that we have to work India
and Bhutan can work together and India
can contribute to that is the skill
development process I think it's skill
formation skill development is something
we are talking about to create knowledge
economies and the two countries can work
together India can actually help Bhutan
and and we can benefit together from
this particular progress process so this
is one area and then people to people
relationship that needs to be
strengthened any relationship between
the two countries cannot be laid
formally on the ground of Economics but
it has to be read on the basis of the
cultural and personal ties between the
people
and since our religions our values are
similar I think we have to focus on
people-to-people relationship
okay and India and Bhutan also have a
common external security challenge as
well in the form of uh formidable
neighbor
yeah yeah definitely uh this issue keeps
on coming because China has its own uh
ways the belt and Road initiative always
is a thing that the countries are aware
of and from the recent experience of Sri
Lanka and what is going on in with CPAC
in Pakistan Bhutan has really has has
learned the lesson and I think it's a
it's a very difficult issue to make a
comment on it but I think the country
understand now China
the opportunism Chinese debt trip
policies are known to everyone and the
countries are kept with devices
certainly it's good to be skeptical
and they are the two the leadership of
the two countries have ended it very
maturely I think
since I think we have come out very
closely that the friendship between the
two countries and the leader is very
strong
oh and another challenge on the health
front which a lot of people believe in
western China is also served to bring
India and Bhutan further closer
yeah it has so and it should actually
um
when you learn from how China's
experience with other countries is
probably the learning experience come
and another thing is that the
geographical realities are very strong
historical we are very close neighbor
and uh the way I think the Bhutan and
India relationship is strengthened is
because of historical and geographical
factors which cannot be denied and which
cannot be neglected
and how is India really viewed by the
bhutanese people is it seen as a rising
Global power which is also the voice of
the global South as it is seeking to be
while hosting the G20 Summit this year
and not something like you know China
has been in terms of yes Rising power
but uh Rising power that has an interest
in Behaving aggressively and uh in fact
uh sort of uh obligating other nations
because of the kind of money that it can
throw around
yeah I think that is the the way I think
about this is the how kind of mature
Indian leadership is in handling the the
emerging economic power and political
power it enjoys now and it is handling
you very maturely it's not its attitude
is not big brotherly imposing attitude
rather it is more Cooperative Federal
political uh
of basically policy framework that India
works with it gives a lot of confidence
to countries like Bhutan who work with
India which actually uh take his foreign
policy takes its Economic Policy not for
its personal gain but also for
Collective gain of the developing
countries
so I think that gives a lot of
confidence to countries like Bhutan and
they see India as their real
so how they treat as partner not the
leader I think that relationship and
that approach to things is very
important I think this is the way uh
India now you see that even countries
like Saudi Arabia and they are looking
freshly as India's approach and looking
freshly as India's uh role in global
politics yes a lot of a lot of countries
are now Indians have had a long-standing
presence in Bhutan as well the number is
around 50 000 who live and work there
but they range from professionals to
business persons to educationists such
as you now how have they been
contributing to the advancement in
progress overall progress of Bhutan
itself
I think the the Indians have contributed
significantly and from different fields
I'll start with uh early 1960s uh early
1950s when Bhutan was close to the globe
it was the Indian businessman who came
and came in situations when there was no
infrastructure but they put in their
hard labor and contributed to
development of businesses in Bhutan so
that was the first contribution I think
we should always take a pride in saying
that it was the Indian businessman who
actually did the foundation for trade in
the southern Bhutan and started the
whole development process so that was
which would not have been possible
without the role of Indian businessmen
there
uh so salute to them they worked in
1950s and 60s in adverse conditions
and that that the reason that the second
activity I see is that the
the Indian working in education sector
because of the involvement with the
under generation they leave the imprint
in the young mind and that is that
always strengthened the relationship
this is the reason why many time they
say teachers are the actual brand
ambassador in different countries
because they impress upon them impress
large group of people who are the future
citizens and policy makers of those
countries
so they have a huge impact and
fortunately they are respected also in
Bhutan for their contribution
and then we have the basically the
Indian institutions like agencies like
the Indian army Dental which makes roads
and also serves through their Hospital
facilities which bring people together
very interesting part of it and we have
the Indian basically uh people working
in the construction sector I think these
are the Indian labor whose contribution
used Bhutan in terms of buildings they
are very hard working people
um I think very disciplined there's no
generally we don't hear anything uh
something which is actually bring them
in dispute with the legal system so they
are very own uh disciplined labor force
and we are very proud to have this kind
of Labor Force working they are
contributing very significantly there
are more ways of course
yeah sorry there are certainly more ways
in India and Indians can contribute even
now in terms of the kind of aspirations
that Bhutan has that it wants to
progress without putting too much
pressure on the environment uh you know
basically uh exploiting its Human
Resources as well uh it uh India has
already a Services per house Bhutan can
also become one because it won't really
emphasize a lot on manufacturing so that
kind of investment it may not be seeking
but where you mentioned skill
development those are the areas that
India's experienced India's skill set
can be very useful to put on right
yeah and basically Bhutan education
system is undergoing a change and it is
going towards stem education science
technology engineering and Mathematics
and for which uh it's looking uh India
is can be a great partner actually in
promoting stem based education system
skill development processes that India
has already started working under the Mr
Narendra modi's leadership in India
I think these are the ways uh the
indo-butan relationship to further
strengthen uh Indian uh the experience
Indian
actually the wild pool of skill level
yes and actually through the development
process in Bhutan so there is
certainly and our National Education
policy is a new one I was very work very
well for uh Bhutan as well it seems
ok so now uh how are the contributions
that Indians have been making uh in
Bhutan viewed by their adopted country I
believe your contributions have also
been recognized at the highest level in
Bhutan
yeah in 2014 I was awarded by by the his
King the silver National order of Merit
silver so that is the second highest
basically in this context so I am really
proud to receive the highest honors both
in Bhutan as well as in India and this
is a recognition and once I received the
my Facebook page and my friends in
Bhutan flooded me with the
congratulatory remarks and saying that
you really deserved it was actually
equally important than the equally
important as award was because it was
accepted within Bhutan also
um right yes I think the contribution of
Indians is highly recognized in Bhutan
and Buddhist people are
people are basically very good by heart
and they appreciate the good work that
is done by individuals in Bhutan and
they appreciate and that's the reason my
stay in Bhutan prolonged from I actually
decided to work for only two months now
it is the third decade
sounds great that's a big indicator
that's a big indicator now before we let
you go tell us about the experience of
attending the pravasi bharti Davis
convention in Indore I'm sure you must
also be coming to India every now and
then what are the Impressions that
you've taken back from you know your
latest visit uh about the country's
progress and development
that happened in Indore firstly because
of the kind of it was oversubscribed I
never imagined this would be these many
people would actually participate in
this even
so the number of people that
participated shows that the emerging
confidence that people have in the uh
this kind of events
that was one and the kind of hospitality
shown by the madhya Pradesh government
as well as the foreign the ministry of
external Affairs of India they Together
made this whole experience really
wonderful uh experience
the French food I think uh one you talk
about indoor and you don't talk about
food you don't do justice to in the
world and we'll always remember the
hospitality and the food of Indore
I think that also shows the good
governance how it can create a very
clean City like Indore so you have so
many lessons to learn from indoor
experience and I made good friends
specially networking with the Indian
diaspora who are working in different
countries
and this networking is very important
that we can collaborate share our
experience and make our contribution
even more meaningful
superb now finally what do you think
this honor that you and a select few
others have earned this year the highest
of the Indian government can give to
Indians living abroad overseas what do
you think it would mean for the larger
Indian diaspora worldwide
one important thing that it motivates
people significantly when they see your
work or the work of the people like you
is being recognized at the highest level
in India I think this is the motivating
factor by itself and the people would
try to work give their uh give their
best to whatever they are doing and this
would bring India's name uh much higher
actually and it would keep Indian flag
flying higher and higher because of this
motivation I think this motivation is
far more important than anything else
your work
I think this is very important for the
Indian diaspora Indian War living abroad
for a long time like me and if
recognition comes from the president of
India then it's nothing like this it's
Euphoria correction
great great speaking with you about uh
you know this award that you've gotten
let's hope that you do more for uh
Bhutan so that uh indeed the Indian flag
can fly higher in our neighboring
country thank you so much for joining us
and talking thank you so much
I'm really pleased

India's national broadcaster about
India's foreign policy India's
international relations and India's
promotion of global public good
viewers in this episode we are taking up
a important initiative of the government
of India which is the global Buddhist
Summit an attempt to bring together
Buddhist Scholars and thinkers and
practitioners from around the world
under one ah unified umbrella this is a
important soft power diplomacy exercise
of the government of India and also has
ramifications for India's rise as a
civilizational superpower we're going to
be talking about this with a very
special guest let me introduce you to
him ah joining me in the studio is Dr
anirban Ganguly
Dr Ganguly is a noted intellectual he is
director of the shama Prasad Mukherjee
Research Foundation and Senior member of
the bharti janta party and the author of
ah a very intriguing book and I hope you
will talk about it Swami Vivekananda and
Buddhism and the Mystic link of this Dr
Ganguly such an honor to have you in the
studio thank you so much for inviting me
thank you Dr Ganguly India is hosting
the global Buddhist Summit we have more
than 170 participants from around the
world 30 countries uh you know the
Buddhist Community both leaders as well
as Scholars and thinkers have gathered
and this is a momentous occasion it's
the first time ever such a large ah you
know Global Gathering of Buddhist
Scholars and practitioners has happened
so the first question that comes to
anyone's mind is why is it happening in
India and why is India hosting this and
not any other country and this is you
know something ah that we should explain
to the audiences because people do not
often associate Buddhism with India in a
very deep way but there is a deep
connection and we are trying to now
bring those out so your thoughts on
India and Buddhism and and the link
between the two
I think it's most natural that India is
hosting this conference under the
leadership of prime minister Narendra
Modi
because India is the land of Buddha
India is Buddha's
land and very interestingly a very
senior monk who's himself present in
this conference
who has a large International following
he said something very interesting he
said Buddha is India's local boy who has
gone global so I think that sums up the
significance the symbolism of why India
is hosting the international Buddhist
Summit in such a large scale it has
never happened before and we should also
keep in mind when we are joining the
dots
that I think no prime minister since
Independence has done so much for
reinstating for rekindling for
disseminating Buddha's Legacy his
message not only in India in globally
that prime minister Narendra Modi has
done absolutely and he is not you know
it's not something that he's been doing
after he has become Prime Minister I
mean if you very significantly he says
that I feel always and he has said this
he's on record publicly having said this
not once a number of times
that I feel a special connection to
Buddha to Lord Buddha I feel a special
connection to his message of compassion
to his message of Harmony and he has
said this and I would like to remind
through you I would like to remind our
viewers
that as chief minister of Gujarat
prime minister Narendra Modi as chief
minister of Gujarat had hosted one of
the largest Buddhist conference
International conferences 20 countries
had come and had sent the
representatives
not only that if you if you recall he is
repeatedly focused on his birthplace
which is wadnagar yes vadnagar's deep
civilizational connect with Buddhism and
he made a very interesting point he says
that you know the impression is that
Buddha went East but wadnagar is in the
west and you had and winsang is on
record having said that it had one of
the largest Buddhist hostels there
students studying there in the sense
wadnagar that entire region was a region
of knowledge of Buddhist studies in
history
as chief minister prime minister
Narendra Modi ordered excavations there
Buddha's relics were discovered the
relics are are theres in the MS
University as chief minister he convened
this conference as chief minister he uh
in fact he he recalled in one of his
speeches he said that you know when the
new secretaryate was being built he
wrecked a huge Buddha statue there even
at the chief Minister's residency
directed Buddha statue so I think you
know ah as chief minister what he did in
terms of this Buddhist link
civilizational connect he has Amplified
that a hundred folds as prime minister I
think that is very significant when we
ask this basic question why is India
hosting it Well India is the land of the
current leadership the priority on
promoting Buddhism is evident but if you
go back in time of course it's the
birthplace of Buddhism and we are so
proud of it but there is also the you
know the spread worldwide especially
across Asia through our Emperors like
Ashoka and kanishka and all of them you
know and in a way when I look at Prime
Minister Modi today and you see the
analogy of History Buddhism was
preserved and you know flourished under
the patronage of great rulers and it
seems like in a way finally we are
Reviving that tradition that the state
ah you know with all its uh you know
resources is really committed to this
philosophy and its wisdom you know
absolutely you know I think Buddhist
teachers and Buddhism thinkers as well
as monks uh
all of them are in United in this
perception that Prime Minister Modi has
done for Buddhism globally what very few
leaders or no other leader has done in
recent times so I think that analogy is
very symbolic and important when you
draw that historical analogy and you
speak you mentioned Dr sham Prasad
Mukherjee I would like to bring in a
point here sure which I think has been
in the past you know Dr mukherjee's
Legacy has been all obviously
deliberately marginalized besides being
uh you know founder of the bharatiya
janasang beside being the first industry
Minister he was one of the most active
presidents of the mahabodhi Society of
India and he was President for a decade
so
what Prime Minister Modi is doing today
I see that Echo I see that reflection of
the past when in a very limited
circumstances in under trying
circumstances under a lot of challenging
situation Dr shama Prasad Mukherjee as
president of mahabadi society took
Buddha's message post-independence
across the world I mean he went to
Southeast Asia the relics of Maham
mughalan and sariputta Buddha's Chief
disciples a portion of those relics are
kept at the kabaya Pagoda in Myanmar and
we installed a plaque commemorating that
and it was due to Dr mukherjee's effort
that the government of India gave as
permanent loan portions of those relics
he went to Cambodia he went to Vietnam
so it is fascinating right after
Independence the manner in which he's
purrated India's civilizational message
and Prime Minister Modi says I mean if
you look at his itinerary yeah if one
studies prime minister's Buddhist
deterior Theory you will see he has gone
from what candy to Kyoto the Lotus Trail
as it's called yeah from Hanoi to
hambantota I think this prime minister
has gone absolutely and the legacy of
for Dr sham Prasad is very important in
a way the government of India Today is
doing on a larger scale what he had
initiated that's an important point in
Sanchez made by DR Ganguly viewers let's
hear from none other than Prime Minister
Modi himself when he was addressing the
global Buddhist Summit about what India
has taken from the teachings of the
Buddha and how India is concretely
applying it in its policies and in its
approach to the world let us hear ah
Prime Minister Modi and then return to
the discussion
Dunya
um
foreign
[Applause]
and light-hearted
bulky
foreign foreign
laid by the great enlightened Soul the
Buddha and also that the
quest for solutions to problems is the
essence of Buddhist philosophy and we
should apply it to contemporary
requirements of the world Dr Ganguly
Prime Ministers clearly elucidating in a
very profound way how ah Buddhist
thought and values are imbued in the way
we look at the world and there is
absolutely no contradiction between
Hinduism Buddhism in that sense because
we have all coexisted for Millennia and
grown together so ah here ah if you look
at Asia in particular all our
neighboring countries southeast Asia
central Asia even North East Asia up to
Korea China Japan the you know India
spread this great wisdom ancient wisdom
to all these places and when we are
bringing them all together here under
the global Buddhist Summit ah it seems
like finally we have you know realized
our own core identity as a nation and
that we are not confused anymore and I
think that's why that's one more reason
why you are saying all these ah Buddhist
luminaries are appreciating and praising
India as the protector of Buddhism today
and in that sense your thoughts on the
you know what the PM is doing and how it
is being seen from outside you know
within the country of course we are
quite convinced that this is the right
thing to do but from outside this is a
new India that is in many ways what
should have been you know India but had
maybe lost its path or lost its vision
for a long time but finally we seem to
be returning to that path that's a big
ah re-emergence of India as a leader of
global Buddhism isn't it absolutely you
know I think India is emerging as what I
have termed as a civilizational state
a civilizational state a civilizational
state is that entity which bases its
modern Outreach
on the core fundamentals of its
civilizational past
so the Buddhist the Buddhist dimension
the Buddha dimension in India's
civilizational March is a very
fundamental Dimension and that's why you
see very interestingly prime minister
says vikas and virasat so the you are
not forsaking one for the other
there's a balance there's a Synergy our
developmental March our March towards
greater uh civilizational sense is based
on a balance of vikas and virasat and so
we are we are re Awakening to our
Buddhist virasat
and that virasat is has always been
globally recognized that we that India
is the heir is the is the is the
claimant in that sense in a positive
sense of Buddha's message
an Indian diplomacy I mean you mentioned
about India's Outreach it's very clear
and when prime minister himself says
this he mentioned the example of turkey
if you've seen the last decade every
Outreach every crisis Outreach that we
have done whether it is Nepal earthquake
or whatever whether it is distribution
of the vaccines
prime minister Narendra Modi is the only
prime minister who when kovit was
declared called up personally called up
50 heads of state of countries which
were vulnerable and assured them that
India is standing beside you we are
there with you you need not worry this
is the compassion this is compassion in
Indian diplomacy and I think that there
are no strings attached when we give Aid
when India AIDS there are no string
attached when India stands by a country
a people in times of crisis
especially that has been evident in the
last decade so that compassion driven
diplomacy that compassion-driven uh
sucker
Solace absolutely which is the Hallmark
of prime minister's International
diplomacy is driven as he himself has
said States is driven by Buddha's very
much and Dr Ganguly in terms of concrete
initiatives and new ah efforts also I
mean from reinvigorating the Buddhist
circuit absolutely for the Pilgrims from
around especially from Asia to come to
India and to connect with the Sri Lanka
and Nepal yes and Bhutan all these
things the connectivity we have really
ah imagined ah now how to bring all of
them together and join the nodes because
Buddhism has so many variants and
Regional you know forms of manifestation
but they are all converging in a way in
India you know and which is The
Fountainhead or the origin of all this
and even our diplomatic missions our
embassies our high commissions they have
been you know more ah active lately to
draw the links to bring more Buddhists
to India from their countries respective
countries and also promoting scholarship
study of Pali language and Sanskrit and
how the two are interlinked ah and
Relics you mentioned the relics also we
have now made it a practice to send our
relics for exhibition to in other
Buddhist countries
it went around yeah in Mongolia so these
things add up right I mean now we even
have a luxury train across India
connecting all the important sites like
sarnath um you know sravasti um and and
Gaia and all these places so ah that
sense we are doing a lot of concrete
things right in terms of policies also
so it's not just at the level of
metaphysical you know discourse or
spiritual exchange that is there but
also to facilitate these you know
linkages and to make them real and
tangible we are doing a lot right now
isn't it absolutely you know I'll give
you SRI Ram you very right set this it's
happening at two levels one is one is
the visible implemented physical aspect
of connecting the Buddha Legacy and
Heritage so you have you have the
kushinagar International Airport which
was inaugurated by prime minister it has
facilitated in a big way International
connectivity
360 crore rupees has been allotted for
the Buddhist circuit to develop the
Buddha circuit all across the country
and it's being done at a war footing
then very interestingly the highways and
connectivity is being enhanced between
uh between centers of Buddhism
historically
on the other hand at the ideational
level it is prime minister who has
actually taken the message of Buddha and
you know next Generation message he has
linked it to the mission life
that if you are talking about
sustainability you are talking about
climate change mitigating climate change
if you are talking about lifestyle
crisis and challenge you have to go to
Buddha you have to take uh indications
direction signposts from his message so
he has linked and he says that today
climate change can only be addressed can
only be mitigated lifestyle challenges
can only be addressed if one is immersed
and one takes cues from Buddha's message
so mission life absolutely lifestyle for
environment I think that has been
integrally connected with compassion
towards yourself towards your
surrounding towards your fellow beings
and that it starts at Prime Minister
said yes you know in this in the IBC
conference he said
mitigation of climate change starts with
yourself with the individual which is a
very core Buddhist
idea the other if you recall in 2015 he
started samvad yes the Vivekananda
International Foundation and uh
and to Tokyo foundation between the two
foundations it was initiative of prime
minister Narendra Modi and late prime
minister Shinzo Abe yes and it was a
conflict avoidance and environmental uh
you know Philadelphia yes and from and
this samvad was held it prime minister
launched it in Delhi it went to Tokyo it
went to Mongolia I think prime minister
is the only Indian Prime Minister who
have visited gandhan Monastery in
Mongolia I think after kushak Bakula
rinpochi no one else has done this much
to re vvv5 and re-link India and
Mongolian Mongolia is so crucial not
only strategically but it's so crucial
to the Buddha narrative for us yes and
they're all there at the global position
they've all come the Mongolians have
appreciated the Japanese have
appreciated so many others are
appreciating India's lead role in
Reviving the Buddhist linkages and
circuit ah viewers uh I have a video
statement from Professor sunaina Singh
who is the vice Chancellor of nalanda
University about the Contemporary
relevance of Buddhism which we've just
been discussing with Dr Ganguly also and
in environment in peace and conflict
resolution all the these areas and let's
hear and by the way nalanda University
is one of the great ancient Indian
Buddhist universities that was destroyed
by Invaders but the fact is now we have
revived it and it's functioning it's
been
re-built in that sense so let us hear
from Professor sunaina Singh and
continue the discussion
avoid over
we have been leaning under the the
covid-19 pandemic uh the wars that have
been uh disturbing the peace of the
world where environmentary crisis is
concerned I think all these should find
some Solutions in India
I firmly believe that India has always
been a solution center for the world
given in our spiritual equals
and peace and Harmony as the
foundations of Indian knowledge systems
Indian philosophy
Buddhism has played a very significant
reward when studying peace and Harmony
across southeast Asia
we have been the torchbearers of
softball softball diplomacy all through
the world even today dealing with the
geophonitical level
the world Overlook SEC are vulnerable
prime minister to provide Solutions
looks at India
uh to come up or to stand or as a nation
that needs to be emanated I think peace
and Harmony has been part of Buddhist
philosophy the Indian Taurus Indian
knowledge tradition which believes in
elevating and today we need to elevate
ourselves in order to uh be there for
the next Generations and create a new
world it was of incentive
so viewers you heard from the vice
Chancellor of nalanda University that
India is the solution Center to the
world Dr Ganguly and that is very much
the intention of you know Reviving the
Buddhist linkages isn't it because by
harnessing this ancient wisdom and
bringing major thought leaders together
the idea is that we should be able to
come up with Solutions and prime
minister also has been talking about ah
you know the wars that are raging
climate change terrorism uh you know
migration refugees you've got lot of big
Global problems and it seems like all
the materialistic approaches to solving
them have yielded only minimal results
so far and we are failing collectively
as Humanity but that's why I think the
we have to go back to the bodhisattva
probably and many other such spiritual
ah you know leaders to come up with
something new and something different
which is you know in a way
changing the dynamic because the old
thinking has not helped and I think that
is when we say India is a vishwa guru or
a provider of solutions ah we are very
much embedded in that you know notion of
bringing back the Golden Era of the past
and using it to solve the you know The
Wretched current status of the world
absolutely you know I think in prime
minister Narendra Modi spoke of it in
the United Nations
he reiterated it at the international
Buddhist Summit
that India has given the world not yudha
but Buddha I think that encapsulates the
fundamental approach that India has
taken today and that approach is very
practical
because today as you rightly said
and prime minister himself has
reiterated that the world is facing a
Crisis crisis of War crisis of climate
and a sense of security that
countries and people have lost
all of it in a very practical manner
can be
rediscovered in the message of Buddha in
the and in the manner in which India is
disseminating it across the world
I think that therefore whether you know
whether you look at lifestyle whether
you look at nutrition whether you look
at climate whether you look at conflict
mitigation and conflict avoidance all of
it is there in India's civilizational
ethos and experience
and a very fundamental Cardinal part of
that ethos and that experience is the
Buddha experience is the buddhaetos and
I think that is what prime minister is
in a very systematic in a very pragmatic
way yeah telling the world and therefore
you know when I think we need to focus
on one part particular aspect of his of
his articulation and he's not done it
two days ago he's been doing it
consistent consistently and that is he
speaks of the Asian Century yes
and he says the Asian Century India will
obviously have an important role in
shaping the Asian century
but he gives a very interesting caveat
or interesting Rider in it he says the
Asian Century cannot be possible
without Buddha it is Buddha's message
his vision his philosophy which will
shape and which will drive the Asian
Century you know so I see a lot of
connections here when he's talking about
amritkal um
and the rise of India
this Amrit Khal will see the rise the
preparation of the Asian Century yes and
and he is also Dr Ganguly talking about
like-minded and like like hearted
countries and how they can all become
part of one family and that is I think a
grander vision it's not its goes beyond
military or economic cooperation
absolutely of course those are necessary
strategic Partnerships are necessary for
India but over and above that to make it
a really thick strategic relationship
you need ah something like Buddhism and
I think in that sense it's also
practically very beneficial so viewers
you've heard how ah from the Great
Heights of Buddhist wisdom to concrete
implementation of those values on the
ground India is taking the lead I want
to thank Dr anubang Ganguly for sharing
wonderful insights deep insights we have
to still discuss how Buddhism and
Hinduism are linked at a Mystic level on
another day but that's all we have for
you this time viewers ah do think about
cultural diplomacy how important it is
the central place of Buddhism and why
India has emerged as a leader in
promoting Global Buddhism and how that's
being appreciated by countries
especially across Asia and what those
does to India's standing and stature in
the community of Nations I'll see you
again next time until then take care

willing
emotion moment
for me to receive this prestigious
honor and I am thankful to everyone who
encouraged me and who supported me
all right now what can you tell us about
your journey from India to Japan how did
you get to settle there after having got
your PhD from the center for Central
Asian studies Kashmir University back in
1999.
when it was marriage
it was in 1980s back in the 80s I was I
went to Mongolia
as a research scholar and I met dear my
husband who happened to be a Japanese
that is how I ended up in
living in ishikawakanazawa a very
culturally Rich place but very small
town unlike Tokyo and Osaka
all right now you've been of course
given this particular award for your
contributions in the field of Education
your citation also mentions that you're
the founder and director of the Ishikawa
India Association which has worked for
promoting India Japan relations tell us
about these aspects of your journey
well about Indian association it started
uh in 1990
and how it started it was really I came
to as I said it was a small place I was
the only Indian here and the people the
image of India their time in this region
was India is a hot country
India is has a curry rice
and that was it and then I thought I
have to
give their mind yeah show their mind
yeah
how deep our culture is so for that I
wanted to do something and one of my
friends said there is an association
told you in Tokyo Japan Indian assistant
in Tokyo I went there I registered there
and then soon after that I established
my own Association
which is involved in building the
good relation promoting the relation
between India and Japan that's we are
doing now with past 33 years so that is
how we are first in the beginning we
were just dealing with only with culture
bringing cultural groups to Japan and
sending looks to India and then we
expanded in education
and we started doing educational
exchanges and we started giving also
speaking scholarships to the sponsored
students who deserve and then we also
did some Moos in with different
universities
then that's what we are doing and then
also we are doing about this business
coordination between some boyfriends and
Indian companies there is a long long
list we cannot do it alone but with the
help of Indian Embassy in Tokyo and Isis
are in India Indian Japanese Embassy in
India and then the plant Foundation all
of and our professional government
everything together we started this
Association and it is now 33 years and
if I start talking about it it will be a
it is a long distance
okay okay now your citation also says
that you established the Ishikawa
International lounge and you've been
working for international foreign
students in the Ishikawa prefecture now
how exactly have you been helping these
students and what does this Lounge
exactly do
and there were not a lot of Partners
also but we don't we didn't have any
place to sit and discuss things exchange
our areas and for that we needed a place
and I connected I asked requested a
professional government and there was
this International women's wind and they
with the help of them we established
this uh International launch as uh what
we do there was to teach Japanese
language free okay
and then Japanese culture and then there
also I got uh I was teaching English and
Indian uh whatever culture I could do
that time because I was also young so
those days uh those people who come
there
they learn Japanese culture and they
become the ambassadors of Japan when
they go to back to their respective
countries they just take this good
beauty of ishkawa to their country and
that helps bringing
people back to ishkawa that's how it is
still working and I'm proud of that
still working and the number of students
have increased tremendously now there
are so many foreigners here so it's from
a small ishkawa International launch it
has really expanded into a big big thing
where people are learning free of course
it's the totally totally volunteer work
wonderful very very commendable we're
running some images also that you in
fact sentences across of all those
activities that have been done over the
years now let's get back to your
citation again because it further says
that you've been assessing kashmiri
female students through Kashmir Japan
scholarships since when have you been
doing this and how many girls students
have you been able to help so far
it's also actually uh I am a member of
international factorization of women's
Association and we have also Japan
Women's University association with the
help of this Association I requested
them that we should do something in
Kashmir for this Association only backs
uh supports the girls students who want
to go for a for a higher education and
we have in uh currently we have to enter
29 students in Kashmir and every new
students come and we give scholarship to
deserving students who want to go for
higher education that's what we are
doing we have two colleges Kashmir
yeah
great and your books have also been
mentioned in the citation saying that
they helped promote India culture Indian
culture in Japan now what kind of books
have you written and how do they help
bring India and Japan closer
well
um I have abandoned many books several
books but to name a few those those are
in my own field of studies but uh
besides that I have written some books
about Japan Japan seen by the eyes of
Indian girl which is in English that's
for everyone who wants to know about you
know Japanese culture Japanese education
system Japanese work culture that you
will find any in India mostly it is in
every Library I think it is still there
I suppose I hope and then there is
another book which I wrote is about
wonders of sorry
that I wrote because uh in my restaurant
I have a restaurant I operate a
restaurant also there so far we have 50
more than 50 000 women who were sarees
that is a record okay and for that I got
the governor's award also and I have the
book is about how to drape the sarees
and how was the reaction of these all
wonderful Japanese women when they were
Indian costume how they felt and then
there is another book which is called
Tara
it is in Japanese and it is about Indian
family system Indian parenting Indian
education system and this book actually
uh was uh inaugurated and uh this
opening ceremony was done by our former
prime minister honorable and
he took this book along with him and he
visited India in 2002 and he he said it
was a great help to talk
because he already had this little hints
what
Horticulture we have in India what
culture we have when we deal with
friends that's that's that good and the
last book 2020 it was 2020 I wrote is
about my proud country India and Japan
it is also in Japanese it is uh in this
book it is mostly about the current
situation current relations between
India and Japan and I I am sure it will
help people and it is helping people to
understand India much better and so they
want to go to India invest in India to
it is all history and current so I think
these are helping
accident that's quite a wide selection
for people to pick and learn uh you know
what's our relations India and Japan
have had through the years and even now
uh now according to the profile that you
sent in you mentioned it as well you've
done your bit to put the Indian cuisine
on the map as well in Japan so how did
that happen the restaurant business
yes when I was thinking what to do with
the this I need a plate for my associate
I was thinking it was not uh still in uh
there there so I thought I need a plate
for that as you know everything starts
with food it is a window to heart so
I thought I need this and I started it's
Indian cuisines first then I started
Association and this is now 36 years old
restaurant and it is the first Indian
restaurant in Whole Creek region we call
it
so region and we got many awards for it
and it is it is have it has become a
cultural Hub everything starts from
Rubina all the meetings all the our
former Prime Ministers or all our
investors everyone who comes this side
of Japan or in in our restaurant so it
is
really playing a great role it gives
good tasty food and then it gives a
platform to discuss India enjoy India
know India that's how it would be nice
working and you have Cuisines here from
all corners of India
Governor when I want to make some things
why this is also interesting I we sell
panipuri
I used to treat food also and people
love it so
and this time former uh our current uh
prime minister has gone then he visited
India he has tasted this Indian Pani
Puri and last time when I was in Sakura
mini party in Tokyo Embassy and our
Indian Embassy Mrs Ishida our prime
minister's wife she came and she had
also Pani Puri
I'm sure he was uh quite impressed uh
because it's such a it's such a a small
gas Board of all kinds of flavors and
spices really Pani Puri it uh really
encapsulates all of India now you've
been living in Japan for several years
so it must have given you a lot of
insight into the Japanese socio-economic
milieu as well what common ground do you
see with India which could be built upon
further to bring the two countries and
societies even closer
as you know yourself also will
our relationship
good
and in this time India has Manpower
intelligent educated Manpower and Japan
has technology and skill combined if we
come together
combine these two it will tremendously
change the scenario of every you know
all this house in countries everywhere
so I think we have a lot of Hope and we
have a lot of what you call it
um
I I I'm missing the words what what do
we say we have a lot of scope uh do more
in uh to have our
relations not only in culturally
business-wise also we have Smart cities
in India we have so many things and they
are there we can use the Japanese
technology we can improve their skill
and Japanese people they have understood
that also they know the importance now I
can feel that they know the importance
of India now 30 years back 40 years 36
years back I had to tell them what India
is but now they are coming to me and
they are telling me Oh maksuda India is
great we have to go India we need India
that's how it's it I can see it oh
wonderful because uh the uh unique
things that India and Japan have
together is a good blend of tradition
and modernity of course there's
democracy as well which is commonly
shared and a lot of affinity for each
other and will to take business forward
as well not just trade but investment as
well uh so again that brings me around
to the next question as to how is
interviewed by the Japanese answer that
already but is India seen as a rising
Global power as well which is also the
voice of the global South as it is
seeking to be while hosting the G20
Summit this year
of course of course everyone knows it's
like which is going to be a global power
everyone knows that that our GDP is
increasing everyone knows that our we
are going very soon to be the fifth in
the world economy so you know we are
already the fifth largest
there is no denying it they know and
they they are they know how important
India is for Japan and for that also
they want before I was going to them
please invest now they are coming to me
show us the way we want to invest we
want to go and uh just contribute there
we want to and our ambassador put it
very uh nicely that when he told them
you go and earn money in India and bring
Japan back to number number three
position so that's how it is happening
so everyone knows and I'm feeling so
proud of it wonderful now Indians have
had a long-standing presence in Japan as
well the numbers are modest around 40
000 but range from professionals to
business persons to educational such as
yourself now how have they been
contributing to the advancement and
progress of Japan how is their
contribution viewed by their adopted
country I believe your contributions
have received numerous recognitions by
Japanese different Japanese authorities
as well
actually yeah it is really everywhere
everywhere all Indians who are here all
any part of the world they are
contributing their own ways uh to in
that country and here also in in Japan
there we have a big community in Tokyo
my place is very small as I said we were
very I was the only one now but now
population wise also Indian diaspora has
increased it also here but in Tokyo
we have so many people and now there are
International Indian schools who were
more Japanese students are enrolling
than Indian students and then we have
recently we have someone who was
selected uh actually who was selected as
a local assembly member that's how it is
happening here and IIT sector is going
really wow it is doing wonderful job
here and then
I'm about to um
my as I mentioned before also about how
the local Authority is going to see us
is it is from the very beginning when I
established Indian association from
there to very beginning we I started
with people who were in working in the
government offices like uh our present
first present I was not the president
first because I did not know Japanese
language that all right and so the first
president of Indian association was Dr
okabe Who was also the assemblyman but
professional assembly member that and
Governor is our honorary advisor all the
professional members we have assembly
League
India Japan friendship assembly League

diplomacy
show on nadur darshan India's national
television channel about India's foreign
policy India's international relations
and how India is a good Global Citizen
and promoting Global public goods
viewers in this episode we are taking up
a very very important theme of Indian
foreign policy which is its South South
cooperation with the continent of Africa
the African Union has 55 member
countries and it's a big Collective and
India has bilateral relations with many
of them at a very high level but then we
are looking at the continent as a whole
India's approach to Africa and what are
its unique attributes and the benefits
that India Africa cooperation generates
for people of both sides and to discuss
this I have very ah distinguished guest
with me joining us in the studio today
Dr ruchita Berry
Dr Berry is a senior Africa expert in
India she is a H worked in the manohar
parikar institute for different studies
and Analysis for a long time and has
headed the Africa research and policy
advocacy Dr very welcome to Indian
diplomacy thank you so much sriram
Dr Berry when we talk about India Africa
cooperation ah there are so many
elements to it so many facets but if you
look at the big picture ah how would you
characterize India's approach to Africa
and South under the under the South
South rubric and what is distinct about
it I mean prime minister Narendra Modi
has outlined ah some of our core values
and principles in Kampala Uganda a few
years ago ah but please tell the
audience what is it that India does when
it goes to Africa when it engages with
Africa and what is the core I know
ideation behind India Africa cooperation
uh sriram first of all let me share with
you that India Africa relations are very
old they go back to ancient times you
know there was contact between India and
Africa some part of Africa in the Indus
Valley Civilization also that's how old
our relationship so it's not new but in
recent years we have been focusing on
the fact that our relationship with
Africa is based on a partnership it is
not a donor client relationship in terms
of development partnership is something
which is unique and the uniqueness of
the relationship is emphasized I think
by three points I would like to make
about that you know that there are three
important features and there are three
C's of India's development partnership
I'm saying the development partnership
because if you look at India's
development cooperation with Africa
lines of credit as an important
instrument of India's development
cooperation with Africa 40 percent of
them are directed towards Africa so
obviously Africa as an important area of
cooperation now what are the three
features that I am talking about
which make India's relationship or
India's approach with Africa so unique
first is that it is a policy which is
based on consultation it is consultative
you know that we say that our
relationship with Africa is based on
their own priorities on the African
countries demands and here again I would
like to mention prime minister Narendra
Modi during his address to the
Ugandan Parliament in Kampala he
mentioned that Africa will be our our
partnership will be driven by the
African priorities and this is something
which we have kept in mind uh we are
looking at in each and every uh meeting
that has taken place we have kept the
African priorities in in place in that
and the this is reflected in the fact
that Africa we have said in the the
India Africa Forum Summit on 2015 that
that our partnership will be driven by
the Africa agenda 2016-53 which is a
Vision document developed by the African
countries about how they want the
continent to be in future so so that's
been a focus that we are looking at
African demands and priorities second
important feature of India's
partnership development partnership in
particular is that it is based on
capacity building capacity building
particularly human resource development
we have focused on human resource
development and again if you look at the
the African plans and policies and
priorities they also put
they also call about bringing us skills
and education revolution in Africa
that's what agenda 2623 talks off so
there is a a kind of parity between what
India is thinking about
its approach to Africa and what the
Africans want sure so it is driven by
again the African needs and also it is
focused on capacity building human
resource development and that that
that's an important area within India's
development Paradigm also it has been
focusing on skills enhancement and in
Africa also it is doing that third is
that India's approach to Africa is
collaborative that we are collaborating
with African countries in building their
economy in building their various
aspects of their life and India has been
Indian companies have been in the
government has been involved in in
capacity building in various sectors in
in collaboration with the African
countries whichever area is priority for
them so whether it's Health whether it's
it's agriculture whether it's
e-governance or or rural electrification
agriculture India has been involved in a
big way in these African countries and
and lockable going into the specifics ah
Dr s Jai Shankar India's external
affairs minister has been saying that
our current and future priorities in
Africa are in three broad areas green
meaning green energy and you know green
growth and tackling climate change and
those sort of issues ah to health health
care and the third is digital ah which
includes you know Digital Services
fintech and all these things so um
these three are the focus areas right
now and presumably going by the three
C's formula you just mentioned this is
what African governments African people
African ah you know organizations the
institutions are asking for uh as their
priorities or have identified them so
that's why we are focusing on these
isn't it yeah that
that's true
the other areas which priority for the
Development Bank says and each and each
of the African countries is also looking
at these areas covet has made Health a
priority area for every country in the
world you know they've realized that
health is an important area where they
need to expand their infrastructure
build their capacities and Africa is no
different and while India and Africa
have been cooperating on health issues
for a very long time it's nothing new
it's not just the covet that led to
India's cooperation on health but
obviously it has escalated India's
cooperation with the African countries
on the health sector India is known as
the pharmacy of the world and and a
large number of Indian companies are
represented pharmaceutical companies are
represented in Africa and
um so so for the Pharma sector and green
green the green again given the solar
electricity
development we are focusing towards
clean energy so again our focus is on
Solar Development solar energy renewable
energy of which India is the third
largest
representative country in the world
which has the and so many and so many
African villages have been electrified
for Indian solar power generation
definitely India's
not just in terms of the loc projects
which have been involved in setting up
manufacturing plants of for solar
modules and others but also at a at a
civil society level India's some of
India's ngos have been involved in a big
way in lighting up Africa you know there
there is the the the the the project
which have been launched by a number of
ngos in from India yeah like barefoot
India has had a digital Revolution we
have uh
revolutionarized the way we deal with
the e-commerce or uh with e-governance
and these are the models which are uh
finding a lot of resonance in the
African countries and I heard a lot of
the digital payment systems that we have
designed have been adopted across the
continent many countries are interested
in the India stack uh you know open
source software by which they can
deliver ah you know welfare benefits to
the poor and those sorts of things so
these are really concrete things where
India seems to be making a difference so
viewers uh there are the three C's but
there is also a lot of trade Commerce
and investment between India and Africa
and that's been growing and this is a
healthy sign for the relationship Dr
Berry was saying is not a donor
recipient relationship anymore and there
is a equal economic exchange between the
two sides and its growing so on this I
have a video about trade and investment
and what more India can do for Africa
from Dr chisom Uber he's a Nigerian
Economist who teaches at op General
Global University let's hear him and
continue the discussion
India and Africa have always been
friends always been friendly but this
has been strengthened in recent Times by
the result of the current Administration
um with the establishment of the India
African Summit Forum that has really
helped to solidify this relationship
even further
um India Africa trade has been very
robust worth over a hundred billion
dollars this is not insignificant it's
quite comparable to India American trade
or India European trade for example so
Africa has been a very good trading
partner India has done a lot a
tremendous deal in terms of helping
Africa's development for example by
extended lines of credit worth over 12
billion dollars for the establishment of
special economic zones and Industrial
sectors uh in all kinds of knowledge
transfers human capital development in
the fields of business entrepreneurship
education on Health Care agriculture so
many different fields so they've done a
tremendous amount more could be done
perhaps in terms of the you know
physical infrastructure like highways
Railways ports Etc this is one way to
warm your hearts into the African the
minds of the African people
um I also think that the rich could be
improved more African nations can be
reached and the impact of this
development assistance can be felt in
more areas also in terms of knowledge
transfers especially in manufacturing
and the entire manufacturing value chain
that can also be improved If this
relationship is strengthened India will
benefit a great deal because Africa is a
large Market a very extensive Market
Africa will also benefit tremendous deal
from the huge knowledge base that India
has from its years of development
experience which has been exemplified by
the wonderful way it's been leading the
G20 representing all of us in a global
South
so viewers you got a small snapshot of
various economic areas where India and
Africa are cooperating from Dr jisho
mubabuko Dr Berry
um Dr obob was talking about
Manufacturing in Africa this has been
one of the major concerns and the
priorities for the African Union and for
individual countries as well because
they have been primary products based
economies largely historically speaking
and for them to make the leap to
manufacturing there is you know India
has been supporting special economic
zones he was talking about in a number
of countries like Ethiopia for example
and there is also you know power as well
as fertilizer and such sectors where we
have set up actually help set up
manufacturing and and processing right
there in Africa but that is seems to be
like the next Frontier where India can
support our investors are quite bullish
about Africa
um I was hearing uh Sunil bharti mithal
the chairman of the Airtel Group which
is operating in 14 countries in Africa
in Telecom sector and he was saying that
Africa is like the next Bastion of
global growth and the fastest growing uh
you know continent with such a young
demographic and this huge anticipation
that the middle class will grow from 300
million to 500 million or 600 million
out of our total population of 1.2
billion on the continent so
um from that perspective ah how would
you see India's engagement in trade and
investment and what more I mean the
trade volumes have gone up now to almost
90 billion dollars and Dr obab was
saying that it's comparable roughly to
our trade with even the European Union
or the U.S so Africa is very important
and it's no less than any of the
developed you know parts of the world
for us economically and Indian
cumulative Investments I was looking up
the data is about 74 billion dollars in
the last two decades in on the African
continent so our FDI has also gone in
and of course much more will be needed
so your thoughts on the economic you
know the core economic trade and
investment and what more we can do with
the Africans we have see Africa has over
the over the last two decades really
changed in the image of Africa has
changed globally you know because there
was a time when people used to you call
Africa as a Dark Continent but now
Africa is a rising continent continent
with of Hope continent of progress and
the fact that among the 10 fastest
growing economies five are from from
Africa today that's what the IMF says uh
shows that you know that Africa is is
very different from what has been uh you
know whatever what has been the
traditional narrative that's changing
now about Africa if you visited the
African countries you could see the
progress in these countries and
therefore naturally you were saying that
Indian businesses are interested
definitely they know that this is uh the
the future continent this is where uh
the last Bastion of economic growth and
we need to be involved in these
processes and the other point which you
mentioned was about India's now focusing
on helping or supporting the African
objective of industrialization so that I
think has been there in India's efforts
in in India's development partnership
also we can see that I can give you some
examples from Africa yes like in case of
Ghana the first Sugar Factory was set up
with the support of India then secondly
India was involved in in Djibouti for
setting up the first semen Factory
Mauritania for the first milk processing
plant so India is been doing a lot of
things in Africa some of them are not
known to a lot of people because India
has not been advertising that in a big
way you know it's only now that we've in
the last five years that we've had high
level visits to Africa which showcase
the fact that India is interested in
Africa we have uh you know circumvented
the the visibility deficit that India
had for a long time with the African
countries and which is very important
when you're talking about trade and
investment relations that if the
government of the country showcases the
fact that you know it is interested in
engaging with with these set of
countries that that gives their
businesses also confidence to move in
into that sector that that reason in a
big way and I've been part of the CIA
Africa country
experts committee for a very long time
and
the the the the business the India
incorporate has been very much
interested in doing business with Africa
for a long time and they are even now
very much interested in enhancing their
presence in in the continent and and
it's being facilitated our exim bank and
all these play a big role in enabling
two-way trade and Industry we started
with the
Africa program
when we said the government said that
they will support the increase of
exports to Africa by by India and
subsequently all the various initiatives
that have been launched in terms of
enhancing India's trade with with the
African countries or India's economic
cooperation with with African countries
so many Summits the all we've we've had
now a structured engagement with the
African countries with the the India
Africa Forum Summit starting in 2008 and
the last one 2015 we made it to uh you
know we opened it to all the African
countries all 54 of them so so it was
not just the the government to
government Summit but also the
businesses from all these countries have
been involved in a big way in and they
are interested in doing business with
India why because they understand that
the the style of funk of cooperation
that India offers to the African
countries is unique yes is unique
because we are transferring our model of
AAA model which I say you know which is
adaptable we offer them technology which
is not offered by a number of countries
which is Affordable which is adaptable
you know so so yeah these are some of
the reasons why Indian companies and are
very welcome absolutely and there are we
have of course other big Powers Western
countries China I mean many of them have
done very controversial economic
interventions in Africa you know
plundered the natural wealth and
resources of the continent and clearly
our approach is quite distinct and a
different model altogether so viewers
India is doing a lot of good and also
receiving a lot of benefits from Africa
it's a mutually beneficial and that's an
important Point ah but apart from
economics there is also peace and
security and this is one area where
India has been a major pillar of support
for African countries and African people
over the years let us hear from ruchira
camboge India's permanent representative
to the United Nations Ambassador camboge
talking about the India's approach to
Africa's peace and security and we'll
resume the discussion after this
terrorist outfits like armed groups
deserve the priority attention of the
council in their response to addressing
security threats confronting Africa
today
in the Sahel and throughout the Lake
Chad Basin region as well as in Somalia
and Beyond African States face
persistent threats of terrorism from
groups affiliated with the al-Qaeda and
daesh
National and Regional security forces
are the prime responders to combat
terrorism
capacity constraints and lack of
Financial Resources have however become
major impediments in the fight against
terrorism
initiatives such as Atmos the G5 Sahel
Joint Force the South African
development Community mission in
Mozambique and the multinational Joint
Task Force need more encouragement from
the International Community U.N
peacekeeping operations and special
political missions in Africa need to be
appropriately mandated and resourced our
experience in peacekeeping in Africa
shows that such missions often struggle
to implement ambitious and
under-resourced mandates furthermore
peacekeeping missions should have a
clear and well thought out exit strategy
prepared in consultation with national
and Regional stakeholders since the
1960s Indian peacekeepers have served in
22 missions in Africa so far currently
Indian peacekeepers are serving in eight
U.N peacekeeping missions in the African
continent India has also contribute
towards the training and capacity
building of peacekeepers from Africa
India believes that Africa's rise is
essential for True multipolarity in the
global order that we are committed to
so viewers uh you heard from India's
permanent representative of the United
Nations Ambassador uchira kamboj about
the issues of peace and security on the
continent and India's views India's
preferences both bilaterally and
multilaterally ah how we can better
secure and create stability and peace on
the African continent Dr Berry
um
Africa has changed but there still are
pockets on the continent where there
have been persistent armed conflicts and
now this jihadist threat has also Arisen
and has grown especially after the Libya
you know collapse in 2011 The Fallout of
it has been pretty bad in the sahil
region and all that so India of course
ah there is a lot of joint
you know exercises now we are doing with
African armed forces the AF index ah you
know military we had I think more than
two dozen African countries jointly
training with the Indian Armed Forces we
do naval exercises ah with the you know
number of country especially the ones
along the Indian Ocean Coast the eastern
coast of Africa we've done trilateral
ones with Mozambique with Tanzania and
Kenya and all these countries so um
obviously there is a lot of capacity
building even in the security sphere
that we are doing for African countries
ah but ah of course there is much more
that we could do and so your thoughts on
the ah peace and security situation
there I mean there are foreign actors
external actors and interventions which
have often destabilized Africa but India
does not at all come with that intention
or effect at also it is actually to
counter the destabilization so ah how do
you think we have been doing on this
front
yeah so you uh you're very right when
you say that you know that there are a
lot of security issues which still
continue in Africa can conflicts are
still some simmering in some parts of
Africa like in South Sudan or in
Democratic Republic of Congo uh there
are terrorist groups which are present
in Nigeria in the Sahel region in North
Africa in countries like Libya there are
in in Horn of Africa Somalia has
we've seen the presence of Terror groups
there which have impacted the
neighboring countries like Kenya and
Uganda and in southern Africa we have
the emergence of a few years back
another terrorism
you know so
so so terrorism is something countering
terrorism is something which is common
between India and and African countries
the other common threat is that of
Maritime
insecurity whether it's Maritime
terrorism whether it's piracy whether
it's drug trafficking and other issues
of Maritime nature or illegal fishing
which in which India and uh and the
African countries share a common concern
so so these have led to uh in an
enhancement of India's cooperation in
security area with the African countries
traditionally I would say the the focus
of India's security cooperation or
defense cooperation with the African
countries has been on humans resource
development that has been the buzzword
of India's uh partnership with the
African countries is similar in the
security field you if you recall the
former president of Nigeria was trained
in in one of our training military
academies yeah and similarly the former
leader of Ghana you know so so there
have been a history of cooperation
between India and and the African
countries in terms of uh
support that India has given in in
enhancing the capacities of the the the
African defense officers Cutters and
we've also sent training teams to
to some of the African countries
military training teams whenever they
have desired that their presence is
needed and also help them set up the the
defense National Defense colleges in
some countries that's right and even
forensic University there's a new one
that Dr Jay Shankar is inaugurated in
Uganda yeah that's the first for India
for policing and crime and all these
things so security sector is one area
where you know India and Africa face
challenges and there are ways by which
India is continuing to try and build the
capacities of our African sisters and
brothers so that they can live in more
peace and stability ah viewers you heard
from Dr ruchita very so many you know
facets of India's cooperation with
Africa do think about the three C's that
she has mentioned ah and how India is a
Force for good and is partnering with
Africa in the best traditions of South
South cooperation as G20 president ah
also we have consulted a lot with the
Africans and brought their concerns to
the table of the major economies of the
world so that African voices and African
concerns do not remain neglected I want
to thank Dr ruchita Berry for sharing
important insights and for letting us
know about you know the future of this
important close collaboration with
Africa thank you so much thank you thank
you viewers Africa is important that's
the biggest message of the show and the
discussion do not underestimate Africa
Africa is rising and India is their
shoulder to shoulder continue to follow
this relationship I'll see you again
next time until then take care

Roy the show launched the same day same
time earlier this year around the time
the 17th ravasi bharati Davis convention
was held in madhya pradesh's Indore City
pbd provides a platform for overseas
Indian Community to engage with the
government and people of India and share
their experiences and insights it also
helps Trend and ties between India and
Global Indian diaspora and to recognize
the achievements and contributions of
Indians living abroad the prabhasi
bharti saman awards are an integral part
of the biennial event and are conferred
by the president of India upon members
of the Indian diaspora who made
exceptional contribution in their chosen
fields and have acted as India's
ambassadors in foreign lands Our Guest
this week is one such a body this year
Dr vikantum Iyer lakshmanan recipient
award and
philanthropist welcome to Diaspora
diamonds Dr lakshvardhan and thank you
for joining us from Toronto Canada
now first of all congratulations for the
award what were your first thoughts when
you heard that you're getting the
highest honor that the Indian government
can give an Indian living abroad
thank you very much Gautam
it's a privilege
accepted the award
when the call came from matrubhumi when
the High Commissioner is Excellency of
armanji called it in swamp I felt very
humbled and Mata bhumi calling it was a
privilege that being part of this great
honor I want to thank governor of India
on the Indian Community whatever thank
you very much
now what can you tell us about your
journey from India to Canada how did you
get to settle there after having got
your PhD in chemistry from the
University of Bombay and post talking
lecturer at Birmingham University in the
UK
is a great question
everything depends on a teacher that you
get in your life
I was privileged that I had Professor BC
haldar as my teacher teaching me
inorganic and nuclear chemistry at the
Bombay University
because I heard that studied under
pressure sarkar PC rape and Glenn cyborg
in Berkeley University
with his Rich experience he shared his
knowledge with students and I was one of
a chosen student to work under him for
my masters and PhD in the phase of
inorganic and analytical chemistry
during those years Gotham it was a
privilege we could get samples
irradiated at uh Absa reacted and Cyrus
break the samples to the lab at Bombay
university studies solvent extraction
the field of solvent exciting even at
the age of 83 I'm working on solvent
extraction but the strong fundamentals
were taught to me by the great Professor
first of BC haldar what they learned a
servant extraction from a PhD thesis
continued in my journey when I went to
Birmingham the university asked me to
set up a radio chemical laboratory at
the department of minerals engineering
right in surveying examples irradiated
on Cyrus here I got them irradiated
Alderman reactor bring them the
short-lived isotope to the university do
my work on separation technology and uh
and uh and under making high protein
materials yeah Gotham what is very
important is what is very important
about them is the field of solvent
extraction as part of an emerging field
of hydro methodology was an infancy at
that at that time and that brought me to
the field of minerals engineering a
combination of chemical engineering
along with uh methodology and chemistry
introduced me to many people in the
field of social chemical industry the
eminent scientists working from Harvard
and bnfl and Society of chemical
industry and that introduced me you know
in England you had to call it Birmingham
training people in the field of mining
but in England itself it said the coal
mine did not much much in mining but
people who got educated in England went
to Australia Canada became very very
senior officials
they have come to a Birmingham
University and uh hired people to go and
work in their countries so it was a
privilege for me when God industry from
minister of energy Minds resources in
Canada came and recorded whether I could
come to Canada as you know I as you know
got um Canada is a rich country the
second largest in the world but also she
has lots of mining companies major
mining companies so working at
Birmingham University teaching a mouse
engineering gave me an opportunity to
come down to England along with my wife
to Canada along with my wife Sharda and
I started working in the industry mining
industry in Canada and that was that
started my job great wonderful now
you've been given the pravasti bharti
Salman award for your contributions in
the field of community welfare but
you're also a scientist and a innovator
with multiple patents and an
entrepreneur as well tell us more about
your event full life journey in these uh
facets of your life
well Gotham I had the unique opportunity
not to learn working in the industry the
other nuclear Miranda but also it gave
me opportunity to work as Adjunct
professor at the University of Toronto
the department of military and materials
and also the McMaster University at the
department of chemical engineering so
all my life I had opportunities to work
in the academic field and also in the
industry but also I I I after working at
the Elder nuclear one of the five
nuclear refinery in the world uh you
know if Eldorado nuclear became chemical
and today India of course gets a lot of
uranium from chemical and the original
chemical was yellow nuclear and
Saskatchewan mining development I had a
unique opportunity work in the mind side
as well as the refinery at the Port of
mine site at uh at uranium City so
uniquely I got after after a nuclear I
was offered a position at a time enter
your Research Foundation they are
leading technology development
organization a crown Corporation between
between Ontario government and Canadian
exporters and manufacturers the primary
objective here was to look at the
problems for the clients be it a small
and medium-sized or multinational and
that gave me unique opportunity it is
not really enough to write papers under
undercut patterns but also very
important to understand the the need of
the client and the tailor-made solution
for the clients needs but today's time
Gotham as you know today the knowledge
economy and the intellectual property IP
is very very important and we have to
and how do you convert the IPS into
commercialization to create the Economic
Opportunity and reimus back in research
and develop opportunities for the
community thank you okay now education
and experience puts you in a unique
position to tell us about where the
Science and Tech innovation
entrepreneurship partnership stands
between India and Canada at present and
where it could reach in the future
but um
very very interesting uh uh uh question
Dr my city and many boards like I see
back I see that the kite at the
University Health Network all these all
these opportunities help me to interact
with other academics and uh and the
people for people people from the
industry what is very important in India
with the 1.3 1.4 billion population and
Canada the second largest in terms of
area but about 40 million population
when we came to Canada and my myself and
my bride inshallah when we came to
Canada in um in 1974 population of
Canada was only 19 million today it is
40 million today it is 40 million and
drop them and Canada has plans to make
it to 100 million in coming years and
Canada is a unique country I you know I
I I just would like to say that the two
democracies looking through the their
opportunities be it clean technology be
green energy be critical Metals now in
Canada is a rich country with the
resources Gautam
and when you talk about the lower carbon
footprint the critical Metals becomes a
very enabler and India does not have
enough technical Metals whereas Canada
has got a lot of critical mirrors
because there's lithium or copper or
nickel or Cobalt or graphite so it gives
unique opportunity not only digging a
hole in the gum in the in the ground and
Kerala has a good ecosystem to take what
you mine from the ground to make
commercial opportunities create the
world and it has these law legal system
the financial their sex and everything
else and there's a lot of opportunity
whether it's Healthcare whether it is
whether whether it is critical Metals
green green energy or or artificial
intelligence there are a lot of
opportunities in India with the
demography it took them many years
average age there's a great opportunity
for Canada an India to be coming to the
to help the global village with a good
quality of life sounds great sounds
great it is some critical signs as well
recently as far as critical minerals are
concerned and let's hope that that also
stands Us in good stead now you've got
uh
award for Community welfare activities I
believe you're part of a wide range of
philanthropic uh Ventures as well or
activities from helping the blind to
even Indian students coming to Canadian
universities could you share some
details with us there as well
well I got some when we left the shores
of India when many of us when we do I'm
talking about we left nearly 56 years
back we all left for higher education
skill development or finding an
employment opportunity to go but in life
Gotham buying grocery alone is not
enough what is important
is when we came to buy groceries we had
to go to what he called Gerard City it's
about here to buy groceries in the
Indian groceries but now you get every
state corner you get Indian groceries
but what is important is it is not
buying groceries this year now what you
have to learn is to give back to the
community
I strongly very strongly believe it
being in the community 50 years back if
I had to go to a temple my me and my
wife Sharda we had to drive 300 miles
350 miles to Pittsburgh to Balaji Temple
will offered the prayer and uh take the
Prasad and come back that is 12-hour
trip we will do but today in GTA we've
got 160 temples but you don't stop the
building temples and gurdwaros but you
have to go beyond just be learned from
Jewish Community what they have done be
it Healthcare or or education now Gotham
our Indian committee has come forward
people like watching and all that we all
have contributed now we are doing very
strongly establishing associations and
institutions uh helping universities
like Waterloo my Pastor Joseph Toronto
as part of a team raising 250 million
dollars for
Institute so together what is very
important I want to emphasize is you
know buying grocery raising family
everybody does it that's not enough
leadership sure you give back to the
community and and we our community has
been very fortunate and many many
leaders in the community by the people
like Russia let me make sure that many
have come and contributing mobilizing
the community
we have to continually work together and
you know my wife Sharda has been very
very supportive he uh we we you know I
worked very closely with the former
president Kalam through him I got to
know the movement of a Pura and Pura and
small Thrillers and many other things
and in that yeah I had an opportunity to
participate and donate Mobile hospital
to Meenakshi Mission Hospital in madurai
and with that we gave your funds for the
Mobile hospital
gave the personal so it will go across
three or four districts and taking care
of people come and wait in the state
corner but they know when they come so
this is a small contribution about them
many drugs from an ocean these small
contribution and by an expired Indian
living in a distance distance decent
country wonderful now you've been living
in Canada for uh you mentioned over five
decades uh uh pretty much into uh going
to sixth one it must have given you a
lot of insight into the Canadian
socio-economic milieu now what common
ground you see with India which could be
built upon further to bring the two
countries and societies even closer
got them I'm from my mother bhumi the
Indian Nest never leaves me I may be
calling myself carry a Canadian passport
but it is a Bharat Mata lives in my
heart we Indians compassionate tolerance
and we have accepted people coming from
many countries
an Indian in the in India today what you
see it has been a Melting Pot for people
coming from whether it's from west or
east whatever it is we all may be
looking different but they are all
Indians but the same thing with Canada
uh you know through democracy the legal
systems similar to India common country
Dr Kerala has been very very you know
with the Open Arms receives immigrants
from various countries and the one of
the former prime minister of Canada Joe
Clark is to say Canada is a community of
communities and if you have Community if
your community a tolerant compassionate
communities the country becomes gentle
and also very welcome coming to other
people so there's a lot in common but in
India and Canada and this with people
from different faiths and different uh
different colors and different languages
they all come to enrich uh Canada
throughout three to four weeks
organizing a major event called the
Indian Art Festival uh and and focusing
on on the Arts from The Villages people
say Bangla people see
but there's richness in India in The
Villages
and we are showcasing uplifting when you
do that you make the local community
richer our children get to see how
wonderful this great country is but we
are bringing a rich tradition to three
thousand four thousand years old
tradition to Canada making the global
village very rich accepting adapting and
taking it further
now okay could you also tell us how is
India viewed by Canadians themselves is
it seen as a rising Global power which
is also the voice of the global South as
it is seeking to be while hosting the
G20 Summit this year
got them when I was in India to receive
the pervasive body someone award I could
see the G20 uh you know uh the flags and
the pr material everywhere I felt so
good I left India in 1969 but seeing all
this happened the boy coming to India
got them make you feel so good on my way
to the the award ceremony I saw all
these flags right what it does is India
becoming a major power India becoming a
major problem India is part of indoor
Pacifica uh uh pact what it also tells
you you know India during the Kobe time
the generosity of Indian government Modi
ji giving covet vaccines to Russell
world when some countries but you know
debating how to manage they didn't have
manufacturing capability India came
forward to give the vaccines to the
world so you know she accepted the
global citizen as part of you know we
are we are not living alone you share
your your strength of values you're
going to Cape time 2020 2000 Gotham in
my house we used to get a lot of Youth
coming to our place we used to have a
new year parties under 154 and you know
give jobs to you know arrange jobs or
mat whatever it is so make connectivity
for people so accepting India India is a
knowledge power be it Pharma be digital
and and people have come to recognize
with the Indian demography people see
India is a major power and they they
want to be working with India whether
you call it um in the Pacific whichever
name you call or break whatever it is
but India is a major power but also the
demography the young you know vibrant uh
population it is you know everybody
wants to be part of you know there was a
time you know India is a bride in the
you know everybody wants to be dancing
with 50 years back I remember one of the
High Commissioner going from Canada to
India they were saying lucky what what
do we do there but today nobody will ask
you because India is everywhere when me
and Sharda were living in England they
used to buy Guardian in times to look
for articles on India we were looking
for sentences on India today it is
everywhere you know we have seen the
transition and we are proud to be a
people of Indian Indian origin sounds
great now Indians have had a
long-standing presence in Canada as well
the seventh largest number of pios and
Aries are in Canada over 100 000 Indians
immigrated to Canada in both 2021 and
2022 now how have they been contributing
to Canada's progress in furthering ties
between our two Nations
Gautam
when uh
pichai became
CEO of Google
CBC came and knocked at my door
mm-hmm the guy came in at that time
about time you might have seen I
arranged a lot of conferences and
Summits and all that I was arranging on
Canada India Healthcare Summit you know
being imminent people from India and
Canada together talking about issues and
they had care so at that time CBC
reporter came and knocked at my door she
was saying to me
uh people call me lucky she she said
lucky how is it that we had another
Microsoft and now we have got um we have
got uh pichai in Google what is special
about uh you guys Indians what they want
to say to her which is in the
manufacturing economy bottom you need to
invest on Capital Equipment which needs
lots of resources
and it takes a lot of time whereas in
the knowledge economy is the
intellectual Capital that makes the all
the you know all the all the all the
contribution and we in India with all
the iits and others codes we have
brought in all these wonderful children
uh wonderful students with the with the
knowledge power when they go to other
places you know us has got the ecosystem
is not thrown the intellectual world but
she also whether in law by legal or
financial case whether in Silicon Valley
or Boston you have it there's so even
from England when you when you find
something you always go to U.S to do
whatever you do so CPC reported about
asking lucky men can be in Canada be a
Silicon Valley uh
you know I had to say that there are
these young children coming from India
every year you are getting you know this
year we got about 200 000 students are
coming from India India India
contributes Gautam the Aging population
in Canada of course in other countries
also they are under Western law but
India has been a source of young
Corporation coming to Canada
contributing with the economy with the
purchasing power whatever whatever it is
and they Canada you know at the end of
the day give a Level Playing Field for
people to come and participate and play
the game and here's Gotham these
students when they come after three
years after they get the education
Community system allows them to stay
here and they get the work permit and
then our permit they become a citizen
and the story continues and this when
Canada says we want to go from the 40
million today 39 million to 100 million
India will be playing major part and I
feel very proud India with its Rich
Heritage but you know I must say this to
you
there was a time me and my wife we used
to get the movies in an aluminum box go
to the bus stand collect it play the
movie in the basement with uh with our
Dosey get a projector from the
University Place puts the collector
money in the box and send it to the next
day today you get a Bollywood movies in
all the all the major theaters they can
see
made the theater you know we have come
to this great job you know the journey
has been very very very very very
interesting and they are proud that we
are part of this journey and today in
the digital world you can see everything
inside there was a time of about them
you know we come from Bombay my mother
used to come from parel to Martina in
train and my friend used to have a phone
in his house in Scion and we used to
have a coin box in Birmingham for
Shilling coin while talking half the
time they you know I won't have shelling
and I have to again my mother will write
a letter hey someone can we talk again
so so but children don't see all these
things foreign
and opportunities are many more
definitely and how is uh the
contribution that the Indian diaspora is
making viewed by their adopted country
in this case Canada you've been honored
by the Canadian government as an officer
of the Order of Canada as well so I
guess that makes you a living example
you know what I want to say to you the
glass ceiling was always um you know
always better concerned about but today
if you look around
Canada is a unique country even people
who are not born in Canada or or in get
position being in private sector whether
it's very much
whether it's the banking sector
Financial investment real estate hotel
and tourism Indians are playing a major
role we had a Diwali party and a major
Bank in the financial district in
Toronto in Bay City
and
an official a senior official came a
friend of mine Harry Pandey organized
that I was there it was in 1986.
said
hey lucky hurry you guys have come from
Zara Street to the main street
Gotham is the place where in those days
we used to go to buy groceries and
Indian restaurants eat and see some
movies and come that was her past time
during the weekend and she made a
comment coming from gerasi to Main
Street Gotham I want to say today the
Indian Community they are there in all
the in all levels of power be the
municipal or be it state level beard in
Ottawa Park order power volleyball
so Indians are not alone in the private
sector public sector also many Indians
today got them when I was taking uh Baba
president Kalam I brought him to Canada
for three or four times when I used to
take him to some universities professors
used to come you know we arranged
meetings when Naylor and everybody else
people were there today their Vice
chancellors of major University Waterloo
McGill they make good good friend deep
seini is the vice Chancellor in me what
more can we asked either academic
contribution or our political power or a
private sector yes lots of Indians in
Canada are very well placed now in
politics too uh they're in government
now before we let you go tell us about
the experience of attending the prabhasa
bharti Davis itself I'm sure you must
have also been coming to India every now
and then what are the Impressions that
you've taken back from your latest visit
about the country's progress and
development
uh got them in 50 years back when I came
to India to travel to another city you
know there were there were various
various um challenges but today
traveling in India is um is as good or
even better than many other countries
I've been amazing I'm a transportation
highways and you know India has jumped
you know the motorists and all that very
very impressed very very proud of coming
to Mumbai you know I I was born in Tamil
Nadu but grew up in Mumbai and uh and
seeing Mumbai you know coming from
Toronto another Financial Capital feel
very very proud and the vibrant economy
and the passion people worked you know
I've done projects with people like
vedanta tatas or other people people
working long hours it is not that in
India people from working eight to four
I see young people you know what makes
me feel very proud whenever in um you
know that poor in vedanta youngsters
sitting in front of the laptops and and
working even at nine o'clock ten o'clock
in the night with a full you know you
make it makes you feel proud people are
not gone home at four o'clock so India

India's national television channel
about Indian foreign policy India's
international relations India's
engagement with key strategic Partners
around the world and how India is
helping to shape a better world order
because in this episode we are taking up
India's relationship with a very
important special strategic partner
South Korea and South Korea's Evolution
as an indo-pacific power and to discuss
the importance of South Korea for the
indo-pacific region and especially from
a bilateral and Regional point of view
with India I have a very distinguished
scholar joining me from kongju National
University in South Korea Dr in Jung Lim
hello thank you for having me Professor
Lim thank you so much for joining Indian
diplomacy it's an honor to have you ah
to begin with South Korea has come up
with a new indo-pacific policy and this
has caught a lot of attention in India
because in the past it used to be
thought that South Korea is a weak Link
in the indo-pacific strategy of the U.S
Alliance System but now South Korea has
its own strategy and it matches the
strategies of many other countries
including India's own vision for a free
and open indo-pacific so I'd like you to
start by ah telling our audiences why
South Korea has come up with its own
indo-pacific strategy and what is the
thinking and what kind of regional and
Global factors have played into the
shaping of South Korea's indo-pacific
policy
sure absolutely thank you for raising a
very important question
um yes we have been a very much
pragmatic I would say because you know
Korea of course you know its size
Geographic size physical size is not
that big but we do have a pretty decent
number of population and based on the
manufacturing and free trade this
country has developed and then we
accumulated our wealth which means the
best condition best environment for the
South Korea like Merchant and a Trader
country again the superpower their
relationship should be friendly too
otherwise we cannot our choice and our
diplomatic choices will be pretty much
narrowed because as we all know South
Korea still faces Furious challenges
from the North Korea so as long as you
know we have this very deep conventional
security threat from the other side of
the peninsula we definitely need to
prioritize our Security even though we
want to be more pragmatic with more
superpower but still again this
conventional traditional security reason
is still there and in addition to that
U.S China again their strategic
competition has been increasing and
increasingly serious especially in the
field of new technology and having had
that structure changing in addition to
that again the Russia invaded Ukraine
last year and we all realized that this
kind of thing can happen even in the
middle of 21st century yeah and and
Professor Lim you mentioned North Korea
and obviously that is an overwhelming
threat ah that South Korea faces and for
various historical and emotional reasons
but the broader region you know the
indo-pacific strategy of South Korea is
not just limited to the Northern Pacific
it talks about southeast Asia South Asia
you know Pacific island States so there
seems to be a broadening of the
Strategic focus of South Korea Beyond
just North Korea isn't it and earlier
administration of President Moon Jain
had something called The New Southern
policy and now we have this indo-pacific
strategy so is South Korea looking to
play a bigger role ah in the broader
indo-pacific and if so is it moving out
of the ah you know U.S Shadow and trying
to play a more independent or you know
more forceful role in the region you
think
yeah
well um again as you highlighted our
previous government the moon jaein
government they also suggested you know
new Southern policy and they also
prioritize the relationship with the
asean countries or Southeast Asian
countries like India I think this is a
very Natural Evolution again as a
merchant and as a Trader Sasuke has been
always looking for good Friendly Market
and you know the place we want to invest
more
so in that sense again of course you
know China the economic rise of China
has been a fortune to the Korea's
economic wealth definitely having had
the rise of China I think of South Korea
could be able to again the develop
further so now you know South Korea is
one of the top 10 richest countries in
the world but again we still want to
maintain a good relationship with the
China but gradually the market or the
how how they conducted their policy it
has been gradually more and more risky
to the Korean industry and of course you
know the environment International
environment changed a lot too so having
said that definitely asean and
india-like countries this is a
fascinating fascinating Market uh to the
Korea South Korea again to India now is
the most you know most a populist
country in the world you know it
surpassed the China's position very
recently not only that again India is
the largest democracy in the world which
means you know we can understand better
again our regimes are much more
compatible and militarily too again the
Korea is of course a part of the Russian
continent but we are disconnected as
long as North Korea is there and as long
as we don't have infrastructure
connectivity with the Russian continent
you know we are South Korea is like an
island so it's very natural for us to go
out again through the Murray time
um you know the sea Lane and the
maritime security those things are
naturally important for Korea again our
energy for example you know 90 more than
90 percent of or oil gas those things
are traveling along the ceiling which
starts from the perish and Garf and
Malacca Straits South China Sea East
China Sea again the maritime security is
super super crucially important for this
island like country so definitely in
that sense you know South Korea I think
is very natural for South Korea to think
about a bigger role or more you know
more those responsibility in the
indo-pacific region right so South Korea
is looking to take greater
responsibility in the indo-pacific says
Professor engine Lim ah he was apart
from the indo-pacific policy there is
also the U.S Alliance and on that front
South Korea has been strengthening ah
the U.S Alliance and also patching up
with Japan and these are developments
and I'd like you to hear a very
important set of reports watch these
reports on the ah coming together of the
old allies U.S Japan and South Korea and
let's hear this and continue the
discussion
sure
the United States held joint hair
exercises bilaterally with South Korea
and Japan involving strategic bombers on
Sunday South Korea's Joint Chiefs of
Staff said the exercise demonstrated the
Allies overwhelming defense capabilities
and Readiness posture the South's
military said in a statement that the
exercise quote affirmed the United
States Ironclad commitment to the
defense of the Korean peninsula in a
separate exercise Japan Flew f-15s Over
the Sea of Japan with U.S bombers
Japan's defense Ministry said in a
statement calling of security
environment quote increasingly severe
readers of Japan and South Korea met on
Thursday in a historic moment because
it's the first time that a South Korean
president has visited Japan in 12 years
the two countries both allies of the US
but with centuries of animosity between
them are increasingly being driven
closer together by China's growing
presence in world affairs and Mutual
Security threats such as North Korea
underlining that subject North Korea
launched another long-range ballistic
missile that landed in the sea between
the three countries just hours before
President Yun sokyo arrived in Japan
this video released by Japan's defense
Ministry is believed to show the
missile's contrail Yoon and Japanese
prime minister fumio kashida hashed out
several new agreements in the visit
including tightening intelligence
sharing and ending in almost four-year
dispute over raw materials used in
high-tech equipment the visit also came
in the middle of joint military drones
between South Korea and America forces
it's not clear if the warmth between the
Japanese and South Korean governments
will change opinions at home a recent
poll by Gallo Korea shows 64 percent of
respondents there said there was no rush
to improve ties of Tokyo without a
change in Japan's attitude
so uh viewers you just heard the recent
geopolitical developments in East Asia
where Japan South Korea and the US are
closing ranks and trying to form some
kind of a united front so coming back to
you Professor Lim
um you already talked about how South
Korea's rise has been linked to China's
economic you know linkages and the
interdependence with China but there is
also this question about the U.S
containment or slash what the Chinese
are calling encirclement or suppression
strategy of China and as a U.S Ally if
you are getting closer and deeper into
the Japan U.S Embrace and trying to farm
you know doing more joint military
exercises and force posturing and all
those things intelligence sharing
um how would you then balance it with
the need to continue to have ah friendly
ties with China the indo-pacific
strategy of South Korea unlike the
Japanese and the Indian or even the U.S
strategy ah does in fact mentions China
as a key partner and as a friendly
country for peace and stability in
indo-pacific so there is some variance
isn't it and how would you ah categorize
South Korea's approach to China in light
of these developments ah especially the
union Administration the current
Administration South Korea the right
wing seems to be more inclined to ah go
along with the U.S but then how do you
then keep the have the American
friendship and also eat the Chinese cake
well as really difficult time for South
Korea like country again when
superpowers they are friendly to each
other that's the best time for
korea-like country but as we all know I
don't want to blame just one side but
you know just time goes by and things
have changed and now again we do see
um strategic competition almost like a
fatal competition between us and China
again the China's role is huge in many
ways to South Korea not only just
economically in the South China and
China is just you know bouldering with
us of course between between the two
countries where you do have C but at the
same time you know China is bordering
with the North Korea which means when we
try to resolve the North Korea related
issue without China's engagement it will
be almost like an impossible to solve
the issue any issue related to the North
Korea this is the our reality in that
sense we don't want to aggravate
unnecessarily
um our dear friend again the China but
as long as this power structuring power
restructuring I'll say power
restructuring is ongoing and as long as
you know armed races are getting more
serious
we need to prioritize our security and
deterrence capability first so I hope
again even though China will be pretty
much again the stimulated by all this
kind of unity between us Korea Japan or
even Philippine workers I mean if if we
touch on the Taiwan issue if so China
will be again the pretty much really
really sensitive to anything related
Taiwan as well
um but you know this is more like a kind
of security dilemma situations uh for
both
um but you know probably for South Korea
the best option is again we need to
definitely secure our deterrence
capability and then we want to and we
need to persuade China to help us again
the solve the uh North Korean issues
otherwise all these arms race will be
getting
um more and more serious or getting into
just escalation yeah Professor Lim
understood I mean South Korea has its
compulsions and it needs China ah but on
the other side you know the union
Administration has been talking about ah
aligning if not joining the quad which
includes India Japan United States and
Australia there are some working groups
ah under quad
um on vaccines and on technology
critical and emerging Technologies on
climate change and all these things
where the union Administration has been
indicating in fact it has been talking
to India and saying that they want
India's support to for South Korea to
play bigger role in the quad plus type
mechanisms and of course as you know
quad ah weather ah they officially say
it or not unofficially it is a means to
push back against what we in the quad
member see as a Chinese expansionism and
aggression so
um how would you characterize South
Korea's I mean are they have they moved
past the ambivalence and the ambiguity
are they ah more convinced about the
utility of quad and can that also help
with the deterrence I mean I understand
you need the U.S you know security
umbrella for deterrence against North
Korea but then what about the broader
role that you are envisaging for South
Korea as it becomes bigger in the region
can quad ah be one means or vehicle
through which South Korea can express
itself and join into creative
Partnerships and have bigger influence
in the region
sure again if we record our memory when
the Dan candidate Mr Yun Samuel was
elected again he made a phone call of
course the number one phone caller went
to the US but and then the second one
went to went to Japan and then and then
the United Kingdom and then Australia
and then the fifth was to to India so
exactly uh the UK of course you know UK
does have another like a very
interesting partnership for example
August was a lot of like a new probably
new military regime but anyhow
um you know except the United Kingdom
all these four countries are members of
quad which indicated that then elected
president to current to the president
he is a policy even at the time Luke 2
you prioritize this quad countries crowd
member
um of course you know Cod is
domestically in this country is more
controversial because the other group
the opposition group will be very much
concerned about you know retaliation or
anxiety
um unnecessary right unnecessary
escalation if the tension between the
China and the others were like even over
the Korean Peninsula definitely we don't
want that but as you just mentioned you
know card is not only for just you know
those military things again it can cover
climate change I think this should be
prioritized than many other issues
because all these Asian countries are
very much economically developing but at
the same time which means we are
consuming
tremendously you know huge amount of
energy which means again do we emit huge
amount of carbon dioxide all this you
know air pollutants which means we
definitely need to think about more
sustainable development of the
um Asia so definitely climate change
issue should be and can be I think
um one big agenda among this you know
quad work us
partnership or like a public health
issue as you just mentioned you know we
all realize that as you know Network
International network is really
important to deal with this overwhelming
challenge July covid-19 pandemic
more new technology too as I said
um you know power restructuring is
ongoing and Global value chain is now
going through the restructuring too so
we need to think about and we need to
develop a more sustainable
Network value chain or value Network
right in this region so I think there
are many many long lists of good agenda
a lot of a lot of a lot of
non-traditional security areas where
South Korea could partner with quad
without any qualms says Professor engine
Lim but viewers let us now focus on a
little more on the South Korea India
Special strategic partnership I have a
video statement from Dr titli Basu she
is an associate professor at jawahari
University and a specialist on
institution studies let's hear her about
the potential areas where South Korea
and India can cooperate let's hear her
and then come back to the discussion
sure you know there's a lot of
opportunity for cooperation within
India's indo-pacific oceans initiative
which we announced uh Prime Minister
Modi announced in the East Asian Summit
way back in 2019 and the Seven Pillars
so I think one vertical on which we need
to deepen the population is the maritime
domain awareness we have our information
Fusion Center in the Indonesian region
and uh is driven by the idea of or the
objective of increasing situational
awareness in Maritime Commons so it is
asking for support from offshore
countries and it would be great if South
Korea can which I mean one small step to
start with is sending eliaso to the
fusion Center South Korea is an
indispensable player when it comes to a
high-tech sector so uh discussion on
re-engineering Supply chains need to
deepen what we can bring to the table
and how we can take it Forward is one
thing that we really need to invest our
diplomatic political and you know energy
on India on its own has taken a lead on
various Global stages where irritiously
International solar Reliance or
Coalition for disaster resilient
infrastructure creating
um you know Global uh low carbon
Pathways so this is where uh Seoul can
again pitch in uh and contribute to
Global initiatives my fourth and final
point is about building effective
communication when it comes to defense
industry cooperation the strengths of
South Korean in the defense industry it
has emerged as a prominent player in
weapons export and our you know status
as a leading importer of arms
stays so kind of uh you know to kind of
explore the synergies between the two
countries regular and effective
communication at the highest level and
thorough understanding of the structures
and policies are important cooperation
and shim building is vitally important
private sector dialogue I feel uh can
facilitate defense exports uh further
and India is focusing on joint ventures
when it comes to it brings more value
whether it is transfer technology or
participation in defense Expo I think
these things you will Define the future
tone of the relationship between the two
countries so viewers you heard Dr titley
basu's talking about uh at least four
areas where South Korea and India can
cooperate coming back to Professor Lim
um the thing is Professor limb there the
South Korea India bilateral trade has
reached all-time high of almost 28
billion dollars and very interestingly
as Professor Basu was just mentioning in
the video uh defense exports from South
Korea to India are rising I was just
looking up the data after Russia United
States France and Israel South Korea has
become the fifth largest you know
defense player in the Indian market and
the Indian army is using the South
Korean K9 artillery gun for example ah
the Indian Navy is looking to get lots
of components that will help build
submarines and you know anti-torpedo
Warfare and these kinds of things so
very Advanced areas where we are talking
about defense cooperation so this is an
image charging area where South Korea
has come in in last few years and it's
been quite fascinating to see this
change so it's not only the
non-traditional areas but even hard
security India seems to be looking to
South Korea for co-production and
co-development of advanced weapons and
also on the other hand the critical
Technologies you know the we all know
South Korea is a leader in
semiconductors you know your companies
like SK High necks and Samsung are the
you know world leaders in semiconductors
and that's another area where India is
looking to bring in more foreign
investment so maybe there is ah
potential for ah Indian South Korea to
cooperate there also and these are in
many ways very strategic isn't it I mean
they are not aimed at a third country we
are not trying to do this as a
containment effort of anybody which is
ah which about which South Korea is
uncomfortable but in effect they are
also strengthening our hard power and
our scientific and economic capabilities
and increasing our overall power so in
that sense I think it's a win-win isn't
it so your thoughts on what more South
Korea and India can do to advance this
ah you know positive trend
this country South Korea's economy its
industry has been developing
based on the two things again as I
mentioned at the beginning manufacturing
and an export and Manufacturing careers
manufacturing has been
oriented from more like a strategic
calculation otherwise probably South
Korea didn't come this way for example
when you gained we we made the postcode
like a steel making
company again the primary the rest of
the world was very much doubtful again
the South South Korea back then was
nothing against the developed enough to
have that kind of you know heavy
industry but we did the reason why we
did was again do we always concerned
about the security reason otherwise
probably we just chose to be more cost
efficient but we couldn't be like that
way as long as we came to North Korea is
certainly us all the time so the reason
why I mentioned this is again the U.S um
I'm sorry India and Korea these two
countries are trustable this is more
than more important than anything I
think as long as we do have a trust
between them again the Korea and India
we can develop further strategic all
this again the industries as you just
mentioned defense Industries
semiconductor definite ships is almost
like a word these days so chips is
definitely
um the area we can work together or any
other crucial new technology related
industry we can work together again we
can trust each other and and and we have
the U.S Initiative for a chip for
Alliance that includes South Korea Japan
and U.S and Taiwan let's see if India
could join the chip for Alliance and
there are many possibilities there but
uh I want to thank Professor inglim for
sharing valuable insights about the
South Korea Indian relationship and also
South Korea's expanding role in the
indo-pacific this is very very vital so
viewers thank you so much for joining uh
on the show uh I want to conclude by
saying that South Korea is a very
important country and South Korea cannot
be underestimated and we just heard from
Professor engine Lim of kongju National
University about how ah South Korean
technology know how and also intent to
become a more proactive player is
remaking the world thank you Professor
Lim thank you so much for being on
Indian diplomacy
thank you for having me so viewers um
that's it from me on this occasion but
do think about middle Powers which are
ambitious and which have got a lot of
extraordinary economic and technological
powers like South Korea how they can be
valuable to Indian foreign policy I'll
see you again next time until then take
care

edraine Watson wrote
NATO on Sunday criticized Russian
President Vladimir Putin for what it
called his dangerous and irresponsible
nuclear rhetoric a day after the Russian
president said that he planned to
station tactical nuclear weapons in
Belarus according to Media reports a
NATO spokesperson said that Russia's
reference to NATO's nuclear sharing is
completely misleading
the spokesperson for the blame Russia of
consistently breaking arms commitment
with most recently suspending the new
start treaty earlier on Sunday Russian
President Vladimir Putin announced to
deploy tactical nuclear weapons in
Belarus triggering fresh fields of
nuclear threat in midst of the war in
Ukraine
meanwhile White House National Security
Council spokesperson John Kirby said on
Sunday that the United States had seen
no sign that Russian President Vladimir
Putin Was preparing to use nuclear
weapons Kirby also weighed in on
russia-china relations he said that
there is less than what meets the eye in
Russia China ties
characterize it as an alliance either I
think you know for all the the Bluster
about a No Limits relationship I mean
there there clearly are limits to to
what president XI uh has proven he's
willing to do in terms of bolstering up
Mr Putin now look they uh these are two
Nations that see common cause uh in
pushing back on American leadership
around the world and Leadership of the
West leadership of uh of NATO and so
they are sort of using one another uh to
uh to chafe into bristle uh an American
leadership around the world uh but it
remains to be seen you know how much of
a a of a true Alliance we have here uh
these are two Nations that want to
challenge the international rules-based
order in one case China they actually
have the resources and capabilities to
mount an effective challenge uh
President Putin sees that he knows that
um unless we believe why he's uh he's
cozying up a little bit more to
president XI

sustainability working group meeting uh
good morning we've been a broad outline
of the agenda that will be taken up
during this meeting but I would want to
get more details from you and our
climate uh sustainability and climate
change has been one important issue kind
of a bond of contention between the
developing world and the developed world
uh now when these delegates meet for the
second time now this would be the second
edition of this G20 environment climate
sustainability working group meeting let
us understand from you how do these
delegates you know aim to mitigate the
differences and uh what words uh what
what in a nutshell was the deliberations

edition of these uh talks let us get all
of that from you very quickly
so yes when the first meeting happened

climate sustainability and environment
the first Side Event of the first
meeting was on forest fires and on
mining affected areas this time around
in this side event which is on the first
day which is today of this free day
meeting uh first we are discussing on
Water Management water conservation
practices now what we are also seeing is
that other G20 countries about 10 j20
countries are also going to give
presentations today on their practices
on their methods of water conservation
and Water Management what we also see
here is that they will be taken to an
Excursion today where they will be
seeing the adalat step well which is a
very historical water conservation
practice that prevailed you know in in
especially in number of places in
Gujarat and one of the you know uh one
of the examples is the adalat stepwell
they also will visit the sabhamati
riverfront they will visit the sabarmati
siphon and Escape which is also one of
the parts of how Ahmedabad is you know
is steadfast thing in the sector of
water management so these this is also
what they will see historical and modern
types of water conservation water
management techniques while they will
also be sharing giving out presentations
uh on their best practices and their
water conservation techniques so that is
going to be important when we are
talking about sustainability we are
talking about environment water is
something that is very essential and
sharing best practices and so that you
know you know Tech transfer can also be
enabled that is also something that will
be uh that is going to be important in
the discussions specifically for today
tomorrow they're going to be discussions
on you know different sectors of the
ecosystem we're talking about blue
economy we are also talking about Marine
litter we are talking about
we are talking about restoring the
ecosystem land regulation and much more
so basically the three priority areas
that have been outlined in this working
group or the focus will be basically on
these three priority areas but obviously
the side events actually enable to have
more cooperation in different sectors
which are related to the environment as
well as related to climate
sustainability so this is in a nutshell
uh what is going to be the agenda of the
second working group uh the second
meeting of this working group but what
we obviously see is that a number of
initiatives of the Indian government the
central government will also be
displayed in an exhibit which will be

how India is uh you know working towards

deliberations at the environment and
climate sustainability second working
group meeting for now let's head to our
correspondent in Mumbai shishir who is
tracking the trade and investment
working group meeting the first one
which in fact begins in Mumbai tomorrow
uh if you could you know tell us how
this these meetings the first trade and
investment working group meeting is
planned ahead because uh the world is
seeing a global banking stress the U.S
and Europe are you know going to face
credit crunch in the times to come and
so in such a situation what are the
priorities going forward from this work
in group meeting especially from the
advanced economy side
well absolutely
activities across the world here
especially focusing the global global
South is what uh this meeting is
actually shedding for and nearly 100 no
uh the member countries will also
participate in White's country will also
be participating into this uh working
investment committee meeting here but
the most important factor is that the
aspect that this meeting is going to
discuss is about uh first of all is how
to exactly pronounce that the trade uh
especially uh to the developing
countries yeah the project for
developing countries here that's the one
aspect here the second important aspect
of course to understand the role of the
banks here uh you know the export uh the
credit uh agencies as well as the
financial institutions here that how
these institutions worldwide can
actually calibrate the growth and also
uh you know to give the investment for
the trade activities across Nubia so
that's the second aspect that probably
these uh will be focusing on and that's
the reason as the rightly said in the
first uh
as well and of course the previous G20

foreign
travel chaos across Germany expected
today as two of the country's biggest
transport unions called the Nationwide
one-day strike the strike Germany's
largest in At Last At least three
decades is expected to cause widespread
disruption on Railways and at airports
and Europe's largest economy the worthy
service workers union and the evg union
which represents the majority of the
transport Workforce will carry out the
strike the mass strike follows a series
of fatal talks with Employers in recent
weeks meanwhile German rail operator
Deutsche Bonn has announced that no
long-distance trains will run today with
numerous rains also being canceled on
Tuesday besides Frankfurt airport and
Munich Airport have canceled all flights
for today like in many other countries
Germans are struggling with surging
inflation after Russia's attack on
Ukraine sent food and energy costs
soaring employees in many sectors have
been seeking Hefty raises to reflect
persistently High inflation in contrast
to which employers have offered a hike
of less than half of what the unions are
demand date besides they hope it will
increase pressure on employers ahead of
another round of pay negotiations later
today the strikes will be the latest in
months of industrial action and protests
that have hit major European economies
wages in Britain too cannot keep up with
the soaring cost of Commodities such as
energy and food the chair of the office
for Budget responsibility Richard Hughes
said on Sunday that the country is
poorer as the price of what Brits
consumer has been rising at twice the
pace of what they produce
okay growth has been held back by a
range of Supply constraints on some of
the key drivers of growth we've lost
around 500 000 people from the labor
force we've seen stagnant Investments
since 2016 and also our productivity has
slowed dramatically since the financial
crisis not really recovered I think
we're seeing clearly the biggest squeeze
on living standards we face in this
country on record but we do expect as we
get past this year and we go into the
next three or four years that real
income start to recover but it's still
the case that on people's real spending
power doesn't get back to the level it
was before the pandemic even after five
years even by the time we get to the
late 2020.
British consumers have been squeezed by
inflation which hit a 41 year high of
11.1 percent in October and has remained
in double digits since he was also said
that Britain's departure from the
European Union had reduced its overall
output by around four percent as
compared to remaining similar to the
economic impact of shocks such as the
covet pandemic or the war in Ukraine
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey
said on March 24 that he expected
Britain would avoid recession this year
and an industry survey of British
businesses suggested the overall economy
had expanded in early 2023.
now the stress in the banking sector has
been closely monitored for its potential
to trigger a credit crunch a U.S federal
reserve policy maker said on Sunday as a
European Central Bank official also
flagged a possible tightening in lending
authorities around the world are on high
alert for the Fallout from recent
turmoil at Banks following the collapse
in the United States of Silicon Valley
Bank svb and Signature Bank and the
rescue takeover a week ago of Credit
Service in the latest effort to calm
investors the U.S treasury said on
Friday that the financial stability
oversight Council agreed that the U.S
banking system is sound and resilient
meanwhile in Europe the ECB believes
that the recent banking sector turmoil
may result in lower growth and inflation
rates its vice president Louis de gundos
said
meanwhile according to report First
Citizens Bank shares with an advanced
was in advance talks to acquire Silicon
Valley Bank four citizens could reach a
deal soon to acquire svb from the
Federal Deposit in Charlotte's cop also
for Citizens at fdaic are yet to make a
comment on the development
and now let's tell you how key Asian
stock markets are doing this morning key
Asian share markets followed U.S stock
futures higher on Monday on hopes that
authorities were working to bring
defense stress in the global banking
system even as the cost of insuring
against default neared dangerous levels
helping navs were reports that First
Citizens Bank shares Inc was in advance
stocks to acquire Silicon Valley Bank
from the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation so msci's broadest index of
Asia Pacific shares outside Japan edged
up 0.1 percent with trading cautious
Japan's Nikkei two to five index gained
0.1 percent and South Korea's Cosby Rose
0.2 percent the mood remained jittery
after shares in Deutsche Bank fell eight
point five percent on Friday and the
cost of ensuring its bonds against the
risk of default jumped sharply along
with credit default swaps of many other
Banks
Elon Musk has put the current value of
Twitter at 20 billion dollars less than
half the 44 billion dollars he paid for
the social media platform just five

the platform at 20 billion dollars
slightly more than that of snap which
values 18.2 billion dollars parent
company of Snapchat or social network
and create a website Pinterest which
values 18.7 billion dollars both of
which unlike Twitter are publicly traded
masks said in December that Twitter is

playing in front of the home crowd so
this medal is very special to me uh
hopefully I'll keep winning like this
and make my country proud in future as
well you fought six bouts even for our
toughest boxer in the world it is very
tough to fight six bouts and win a gold
medal so what do you say on this
definitely this competition was a great
experience and learning for me because I
have a box like played six bouts here
and I was unseated and uh then back to
back matches it was really tough for me
but I still managed to win all the bouts
uh against good boxers and at the end I
won this gold medal for my country and
I'm really happy you're playing in front
of the home crowd how much it gives you
the Cure any pressure sometimes in some
routes there is the opponent is a very
aggressive when the crowd just cheers
you does it helps definitely when uh you
know when I throw a good punch and it
lands on my opponent people cheer up and
they shout and they celebrate so that
motivates me to repeat that again when I
come back in the corner in the rest time
uh when I my score is uh like above my
opponent when I'm leading so people
celebrate it so then it motivates me to
do better in the next round but yes uh I
mean the kind of support I got from the
crowd I'm uh I mean it's surreal I am
really grateful and I thank everyone for
coming and supporting me and Team India
from 44th to third rank what's the key
reason you find behind this it's all
because of the support we are getting
from the PSI BFI and the government of
India and the coaches the high
performance director we have like they
have they are really working uh hard uh
for us and they are making as you know a
better boxer and hopefully through all
their support and encouragement we will
do well in future so our stupendous rise
here in the Indian boxing 4 out of four
for India and nickat won her second gold
medal and if you talk about the support
and it's a extensive support from the
BFI Ministry and the government of India
and we are hoping that the Indian boxer
will continue this trend and will more
medals for the India in the upcoming
events like Asian Games and the Olympics
with camera person Narayan Singh Didi
India New Delhi
applauding the gold medalists president
of the boxing Federation of India BFI
Ajay Singh said that the Federation is
extremely proud of all pugilists that
have scripted history with their gold
medals asserting that securing four gold
medals at home in front of such a
passionate crowd is a fabulous
achievement Ajay Singh said that the
performance of these pugilists will
undoubtedly Inspire young girls from the
country to win medals and Elevate Indian
boxing to Greater Heights isn't it
history has been created and it's four
out of four for India in the Women's
World boxing championship right now we
are joined by the president of BFI Ajay
Singh sir uh congratulations a great
achievement four out of four in the
finals was it on the expected lines
you can never expect four gold medals uh
in a championship of the sort uh given
that India has never won more than one
so I think we are absolutely delighted
it's a fantastic day for Indian boxing
and as like you said history is being
created here uh we are so proud of uh
for a wonderful world champions and we
have absolutely no doubt that these are
not the last of their medals that they
will continue to win medals uh in the
future and Inspire
thousands and thousands of young men and
women to take to this photo boxing so
range of the bi at that time things was
not up to the mark and after joining the
ranking has been improved from 44th to
the third so what's the key reason you
find
facilities best of training the best of
Championship practice and the the belief
and the strength that the country is
standing behind them
so uh you know our boxers are really
hard working and very very talented and
there's no reason why our number three
ranking will not change to number one
soon right now it's a great achievement
so for the Olympics and the Asian Games
what are your plans
uh well one thing at a time I think
first for the Asian games uh we of
course want to send our best team it's
also a Olympic qualifier event and uh
some of the boxers who fought here uh
you know our policy really was that
those who would enter the finals of the
world championship in the category of
where Asian games are being fought
you know those people will get directory
but for the rest we will select so we
will put our best foot forward try and
send our best team to the Asian Games
and try and get as many qualification
births as possible for the Olympics talk
about the Indian sports arena and the
boxing also we have seen a manifold
increase in the performance of the
sports persons so what's the do you
think uh government also playing a
crucial role in it for sure I think uh
government is playing a very very
positive role in in all this besides the
funding there's a lot of support and and
more than anything else I think you know
it is a sense of self belief and
confidence that been imposed by the
leadership of our prime minister Mr Modi
I think he's showing to the world that
India is no less than any country in the
world and that we should be proud to be
Indian and a lot of that self-confidence
I think flows in every stream including
in in sport so
we have seen the Indian women boxers
have won four gold medals at this
coveted Women's World boxing
championship and we are hoping that in
the upcoming events like Asian Games and
the next year the Paris Olympics also or
boxer will maintain this trend only with

Pradesh indoor City pbd provides a
platform for the overseas Indian
Community to engage with the government
and people of India and share their
experiences and insights it also helps
strengthen ties between India and the
global Indian diaspora and to recognize
the achievements and contributions of
Indians living abroad the pravasi bharti
saman awards are an integral part of the
biennial event and are conferred by the
president of India upon members of the
Indian diaspora who've made exceptional
contribution in their chosen fields and
have acted as India's ambassadors in
foreign lands Our Guest this week is
recipient
award and renowned biotechnologists come
entrepreneur welcome to Diaspora I'm
you are of course settled in Germany but
we're glad to have you here in our
studio first fall congratulations for
the award what were your first thoughts
really when you heard that you're
getting the highest honor that the
Indian government can give to an Indian
living abroad who's uh settled now of
course in Germany
first of all namaskar namaskar
namushka and I thank you very much for
having me in your show
yes what was the feeling of
after getting the award
first feeling was
a sense of elation
being grateful for the recognition that
our work received
from the government of India
the second was that
I was among the 26 others
Giants who have been making real good
contribution for the cause of India
and the wonderful thing about it is that
we have formed a social media Network so
all this 27 award is they are now
connected
and we know each other
and we communicate to each other we
learn from each other so for me that was
also a wonderful feeling to be among the
Giants the third was
the motivation
so this award gave me
a motivation
promoting me to do even more
to do even more the work that we have
been doing both in India and in Germany
great now what can you tell us about
your journey from India to Germany how
did you get to Germany you know because
uh there is of course that link that you
have there in terms of academics but uh
still being in Germany to choosing to be
there in Germany must be in quite a
decision
well it was actually an easy decision
because uh as I was a faculty member of
The Institute of Medical Sciences bhu
Varanasi
I received a fellowship a postdoctoral
fellowship
awarded by German academic exchange
services
and this Fellowship was awarded to me to
carry out postdoctoral research in the
city of Hamburg at the University
Medical hospital yes so for me the
decision making was easy because for me
research was the first love
and I got a great opportunity to work
further in a wonderful uh well
well-known reputed lab in Germany so I
could just move easily and we were given
German language courses okay
at the good Institute and for this we
had to stay a few months without our
family I was married at that time but I
was told not to take my family the idea
was that I will stay with a German
family and speak only German language
and not my mother that must be tough
that has was tough not for me but for
the German family because they had to
understand what German I was speaking
okay okay now you've been uh given the
prabhasi bharti someone award for your
contributions in the field of Medicine
and Community welfare could you tell us
first about your activities related to
the field of medicine particularly
medical research
uh well um as I mentioned that research
has been my first love and both in
Varanasi in India as well as in Hamburg
I was focused mainly on Healthcare
research medical research and I was
based in The Institute of Medical
Sciences in bhu and the University
Hospital in Hamburg therefore the
medical health care that was right
ingrained in my work
but what I really
focused on
later on and for which I think I just
received this recognition was that we
set up a platform called emsiatic India
colloquium
on different topics of health care okay
and there we started first in 2006.
to making a conference in the German
conference where the dialogues will be
conducted between industry Academia in
India and Industry and Academia in
Germany put them together find ways for
cooperation moreover in 2006 India's
uh image was not that polished as it is
today so my focus at that time was to
tell how good this how much good
research is being done in India promote
India promote Indian science Medical
Science in Germany so we used to do it
we started in 2006 okay and the last one
we have done is now last year and that's
12 years 12 times you have done it and I
tell you one interesting story that
2006 we started this
hansiatic India dialogue and
pharmaceutical Healthcare biotechnology
research
2007
the Humber government when they got the
wind of this indo-german
conference they decided to start a
program dedicated to India okay and it
was India week so they said not to one
days conference we will do a week of
celebration of India where we'll discuss
business we discuss medicine we'll
discuss science we will have lot of
cultural Extravaganza excellent so India
week started in 2007 and I we take small
amount of pride that we were the seed
to start with India week and India week
has been going on since now it has
become a very big institution and
hansiatic India colloquium is now part
of India week every time so it is like a
yeah foundation stone India and you've
also been an entrepreneur for several
years now setting up that is founding or
co-founding at least three different
Enterprises tell us more about your
businesses as well
I will I will be very short because I
love to talk about
my non-profit
activities most but I will mention
quickly uh we have I have been in the as
I mentioned I was in the medical
research biotechnology biochemistry
Healthcare
so
I have been almost all the time in the
free economy what is free economy means
uh well we work as an entrepreneur
research scientist but as an
entrepreneur
so there what we have done is that um
I've set up a company called age lab
pharmaceutical which was proteomics best
company and then later on I set up Elga
biotech which is a company to do
Consulting and helping cooperation
between Indian pharmaceutical companies
and German pharmaceutical companies
right and right now we are um in the
process of uh for uh setting up a new
company which will be dealing with
eco-friendly manufacturing of drugs and
other Biologicals so here the focus is
on green chemistry and eco-friendly but
coming up it's not yet set up it is in
the process of being set up okay we wish
you all the best for that Enterprise
thank you we're calling to use the
extent of cooperation currently uh that
is you know ongoing between India and
Germany where medicine Health
biochemistry and biotechnology are
concerned and what's the scope in the
future
I think India is taken very seriously
now in the pharmaceutical field India
has shown the world how to make covid-19
vaccine India had a name of vaccine
producing country
always and when it came to covid-19
India showed the way and this has been
recognized by all Western countries
my country Germany is very happy to
cooperate and talk with many Indian
companies several Indian companies have
set up their base in Germany even you
know one of the biggest takeover was by
Dr Reddy's okay uh the in German company
the beta farm and it's been a very
successful takeover and I think biocon
is also quite active in Germany work
hard has been active so and when a
Pharmaceuticals active so they have been
a very good positive interaction in
terms of uh you know pharmaceutical
field between India and Germany great
now you've also got the award for
Community welfare activities your
citation says you've carried out
humanitarian activities in the
sundarbans by helping the locals with
solar powered Health Centers and bakery
units but by the Sundar buns in the
first place in these specific efforts
you have now hit a bee hype because if
you ask me to talk about this topic I
think I will be talking until the cows
come home
but you're being very friendly so I will
not cause this embarrassment to you I'll
try to thank you brief
um
we have set up
an organization called Hanseatic India
forum
with the idea that we will promote India
in Germany
what providing scientific discussions as
we do in hanjiaric India colloquium
academic discussions
and cultural presentations so we always
carry out every year twice or Thrice
different kinds of cultural
presentations
aware Indian artists they present their
art to the German public but also to our
diaspora public
we have a very large diaspora in Hamburg
and surrounding areas right mainly
because of Airbus
but also the I.T specialist they are all
there
and so we they need also a connection to
their home country and this is what we
provide through this kind of cultural
function like we do Diwali we do
Vaisakhi and they are very very well
attended very popular okay then we also
work for the charitable projects in
sundarban why sundarbans because I have
myself traveled there it was just after
a cyclone devastated sundarban area then
I went down to see what we can do how we
can help them
and when I went there I found it was
still
a long time ago
um India's development has taken some
years but at that time the villages
particularly the remote Villages they
didn't have any electricity they were
not very well connected the
infrastructure was not so well developed
and of course as in the village uh
villages when if you go to the interior
uh economic situation is not always very
good and especially for the women who
work who are in The Villages they have
disadvantages in terms of social status
and income
so when I went there first of all we
realized because of the lack of
electricity or
not so frequently available electricity
the hospital there had problem with the
women's health issues
for example delivery which mostly
happens at night and if there is no
light available electricity available
then it's a problem so they needed light
for the surge operation theater for the
delivery room yes also you need a
refrigerator which must work fully to
keep medicines which are required to be
kept at a lower temperature for example
anti-snake Venom yes medicine or rabies
medicine or even for the women pregnant
women you need this RH compatibility
antibodies correct
so all these therefore we talked with a
German company near Hamburg and they
made a solar supported solar power
supported Healthcare System
aware there were lamps for the surgery
lamps for the delivery room and a
refrigerator running on solar to keep
the medicines so that's how we started
there
and then soon very soon we realized that
the women in The Villages whose Health
Care was being taken care of but they
need some kind of income right to get an
income you need Skilling
so uh one of our idea was at that time
that set up a bakery because we know
that in in Germany Christmas time and so
on housewives they do a lot of baking at
home right for the family he said if
they can do the German whites can do it
maybe the housewives in the village of
sundarban they can also do it so we
generated funds from
individual donors but also from
foundations
German foundation so with that money we
set up a bakery together with an
organization called shobhuj shanghal
These are also an NGO a registered NGO
in working in sundarban area with them
together and the whole Bakery was handed
over to the women's self-help group
so they manage that the ladies who are
working they were skilled they started
making bread
that time when we started in 2013 we had
only five kilo flower would be worked up
every day now 300 kilos wonderful so now
they are completely independent
financially they have given employment
opportunity at least 50 women or I think
even 60 50 to 60 women they are all
earning money in the village their
social status
have improved great
and at the top of it they are able to
take care of their girl children in the
family
so we have also set up with them sorry
just
once one short sentence that we also set
up a handicraft Training Center for
Women in the village so that's also
generating jobs for the village women
super now you've been living in Germany
for several years it must have given you
a lot of insight into German
socioeconomic milieu as well so what
common ground you see with India which
could be built upon further to bring the
two countries and societies even closer
well um I think
our ambassador
um in Berlin the Indian Ambassador in
Berlin his Excellency he fights
pronounced the name very correctly is
the
Parvati neni Harish and our Consul
General in Hamburg
Mrs Soma Gupta
um both of them are working very hard to
bring Germany and India together and so
much so if you remember
that in the Munich security conference
the chancellor of Germany
quoted
the external affairs minister Jay
Shankar
statement
that
I I still I do not
quote it exactly perhaps in the same
words but
our external affairs minister Jai
Shankar said that Europe thinks its
problem is world's problem
and this was quoted by olap Schultz and
saying that
Mr jayashankar has a point
and that was registered at the
Munich security conference yes so
obviously India is being taken very
seriously now uh
by Germans by European powers
and at the same time as you see that
risk very recently I think a German
ambassador
to India in Delhi Mr Ackerman and his
team performed the dance natu natu and
Chandni show
so it's a soft power it's not not you
know
any nuclear power or or power of
engineering and so on but the soft power
which is bringing these two Nations
together they've started understanding
that in a
re-engineered world India and Germany
must work together is India also being
seen as a rising Global power as a voice
of the global sound as it's seeking to
be while hosting the G27 this year yeah
that's exactly what I was mentioning
because the moments is quoting our
external affairs minister
that tells you that how important India
is now becoming
in the global Arena
and this is absolutely true that I think
there's been a regular interactions
between Germany and India and uh
both
India and Germany they realize that they
need each other
it is getting very very complicated and
the World Arena and it's getting very
dangerous even and that's something
where both India and Germany can
contribute to stabilize the situation
there's a lot of distractions I don't
wouldn't mention the all the problems
the political problems that is happening
through throughout the world
but what we may say that it the
situation is getting quite dangerous
both in terms of economy in terms of
Peace maintenance and in terms of
international relations between the
countries yes and there India and
Germany must come together and this new
order has to be planned and promoted
certainly now aliens have had a
long-standing presence in Germany as
well indo-german culture cultural
linguistic and intellectual ties really
go back centuries now have India and
Germany been able to build upon these
ancient relations to the full extent in
your assessment
um yes I think
both the countries are moving together
with the same wavelength
and the understanding has become better
over the years
mainly because that India's image has
improved tremendously during the last
three four years I I give you an example
how how good we feel as diaspora how how
uh
empowered we feel in the else diaspora
simply because you look our consulate
when I went to
Hamburg Germany our Consular small
there's some like a small counter window
where we will give our passports and get
things stamped and so on now we have a
big building
and they say it's a historical building
which has been taken over
okay the big building or small building
that's not the question what the most
important is that in this building
the external Affairs Ministry have
thought to have the building in such a
way that there is a big Auditorium
in this and we can do all our
conferences our events in that
Auditorium
that gives us first of all as Indian
diaspora
an image that we are doing it
in a
in an in our own
Auditorium we don't have to rent it out
from somebody somewhere else yes that's
great and then that that's a good
feeling and and this way I think the
Indian diasporas are really uh having a
an
a sense of Pride certainly now there are
2.03 lakh Indian passport holders and
pios in Germany uh how have they been
contributing to Germany's progress and
further implies the two countries
I'll tell you one thing
recently there was this data released by
I think labor market in Germany
Indian diaspora
they are working they are skilled they
have certain level of income
we have other immigrants also they are
also working skilled they have certain
level of income
what has been calculated that the
average income of the Indians
average income of the Indians was the
highest among all immigrants
then they compared
it was found out that the average income
of Indians was even
11 300 Euro more per month than average
income of Germans right
so you can imagine those Indians who are
now in Germany
or Indian origin people in Germany
they are really skilled they are very
highly paid and they are contributing at
high level
they are not just painting the ships or
something like that but they are
building they are teaching they are in
medical profession
their ends in software areas even Airbus
cannot think of building a plane without
the skill of the Indians right
now finally what do you think this honor
that you've got and uh select few others
have earned for themselves this year the
highest that the Indian government can
give to Indian living abroad would mean
to the larger Indian dance for a
worldwide
a such an award such a recognition of
our work of the diaspora organization
sends out a very very positive signal
from Delhi to the world capitals
so wherever the diasporas are working
and living and doing their job
they feel that they are being honored
by the
government in Delhi
our
home
and this feeling is something which can
only motivate all the dashboards
to do even more
provide even better Services Better
Health to their
people left behind at home
great a great speaking to you today
about your experiences and not just in
Germany but also in India when you came
here to receive the award thank you for
joining us and talking about it today
thank you so much Mr Ray having me with
you and it has been a pleasure really to
express my opinion and my thoughts but
kindly note that these are all my
personal opinion and personal thoughts I
understood understood congratulations
once again thank you so much
that's it for the moment and ask for the
diamonds uh do join us every week on
every Sunday at 10 pm to meet another
illustrious Indian diaspora member
thanks for watching

namaskar and welcome to change makers
I'm shubhind the Ghosh good roads and
efficient transport are key to public
convenience safety and progress they
literally paved the way towards growth
and development of the nation today
let's talk about Innovations in Mobility
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
Indian economy is on the rise
infrastructure development road
construction is taking place at a rate
not seen in decades such Mega
development boosts connectivity and ease
of living but many common yet serious
challenges remain challenges that we all
face in our everyday life potholes
broken roads rash driving did you know
India records nearly 1 lakh 50 000
deaths annually in Road accidents what
we need are innovations that can help us
harness the true potential of expanding
infrastructure our innovators are using
cutting-edge technology like artificial
intelligence machine learning to
efficiently track and Report road
conditions they are working towards
creation of smart autonomous vehicles
which significantly emulate the scope of
human error here's how
India's fast-paced infrastructure growth
is barring its economy multimodal
connectivity is taking shape Indian
innovators are capitalizing on this
growth opportunity they are providing
innovative solutions to mobility issues
of the present and defining how we will
travel in the future
foreign
maker is Road metrics from Bengaluru
founded by dipen babaria and nikhil
Prasad maroli in 2019 roadmetrics
provides AI based road condition
assessments that uses rode video data
from a smartphone Municipal councils and
infrastructure firms can expect to save
up to 30 percent in road maintenance
costs using Road metric solution for
data-driven road maintenance planning as
opposed to manual inspections Road
metrics Enterprise dashboard helps
visualize an entire Road network with a
bird's eye view and use smartphones to
identify over 10 types of Road defects
and 65 types of Road and street level
features the road assessment tool helps
locate and Track Road surface cracks and
major potholes thereby guiding Public
Works authorities in prioritizing
maintenance action plans and Performing
budget allocations using
roadmetrics Enterprise platform The Mask
rcnn object detection machine learning
models are able to classify them into
three levels based on severity and size
that is minor moderate and severe it
also allows the team to get an
approximate idea of the dimensions of
the road effect given an accuracy rate
of 95 percent

our next change maker is -0 from
Bengaluru founded by gagandeep rihal and
gursimbrankalra in 2021 minus zero is
India's first startup that is building
fully autonomous vehicles minus zero is
building its proprietary nature inspired
AI that focuses on developing a highly
intuitive and human-like AI system which
does not rely on any expensive 3D
sensors like lidas or high compute
systems or High Fidelity maps with its
Advanced artificial intelligence system
that operates solely based on camera
sensors the smart vehicle scan easily
adapt their learning abilities to
unprecedented traffic scenarios minus
zero are headed towards making
driverless Vehicles not only 10 times
affordable but also a reality matsuna
the team has successfully tested a fully
driver last prototype on unregulated
public roads becoming the first Indian
company to achieve the feat minus zero
is set to launch India's smartest
vehicle a vehicle that is fully
autonomous doesn't have any place for
driver to sit or a steering wheel to
control the company initially aims to
Target in-campus Mobility use cases such
as University campuses corporate Parks
residential societies airports and other
similar environments
[Music]
what unique Innovations in action let's
now meet our change makers learn more
about their work and vision
let me welcome the pain babaria
co-founder and CEO Road metrics and
gagandeep co-founder and CEO minus zero
we saw your amazing Innovations welcome
to change makers
now your Enterprises make use of
cutting-edge Technology like artificial
intelligence machine learning uh for
such Innovations Enterprises to evolve
and succeed one requires a certain
supportive ecosystem what is your
assessment of the manner in which this
ecosystem has evolved in India
yeah of course so India's ecosystem for
cutting-edge technology such as Ai and
machine learning have been evolving
rapidly in recent years there have been
surge in numbers of startup and
companies that are using Ai and machine
learning to solve traditional problems
in various Industries such as
infrastructure Healthcare Finance
agriculture uh the also the Indian
government has also taken a several
initiative to support the growth of the
AI machine learning ecosystem the
national AI strategy aims to make the
India a global leader in AI research and
development an international program on
AI has been also launched to support the
startup Research Institute and also
universities to develop the innovative
solutions using AI on the business side
it might take some time for the
customers to adopt the AI system
transitioning from the traditional
system but it is improving as we see
starting from a private sector who can
take this contract the Innovative
solution to the government sector who
have to be more stable in trying and
testing the solution extensively before
deploying it as a at a city state or
national level
you know uh I think it's uh definitely
you know kind of a different uh I would
say situation for us at minus zero uh
because uh when we talk about autonomous
vehicles in general it's not just uh an
AI problem statement it's quite
interdisciplinary uh you know whether
it's intake Automotive Robotics and all
into one picture right and I think
that's where uh we were first who was in
the space in India because
people always believe that particularly
ABS uh are still far far away you know
they still do not see them coming out
very rapidly in countries like us we've
been India still decades away and that's
where you know there was absolute
absence of ecosystem when we started
so you know being a first mover came
with their own set of challenges that
the responsibility of us was not only to
uh build that tech for the product but
also start driving that Innovation a
basic ecosystem in this direction like
on AI side though we had started earlier
as a country uh for any AI enabled
Technologies but whenever talking about
any kind of AI use case which is very
very safety critical I think that's
where this was an uh Big Challenge and
uh there are a lot of ecosystem problems
that we have solved up until now that
includes you know whether it's simplest
act starting from having sensors that
are built in India not really putting
them from outside or even these
Technologies of these EVs and all
so yeah I think we have started out the
country has started down in right
direction but there is still a very very
long way that we have to go and I
believe you know there still we all need
a lot of other I would say entrepreneurs
and all the stakeholders that uh are
into this picture to kind of push it way
way quicker you know we saw how with
space Tech you know though we were very
late to start but the way we progressed
rapidly I would say that was unmatched
in the industry I think that is uh
needed in this part also we have been
quite late with respect to the entire
Globe but we have capability to make it
like do it at a much quicker Pace I
think it's time we all join hands
together
right those are interesting insights now
let's talk about your individual
Enterprises let's first talk about Road
metrics the pin I'll come to you now
your Enterprise is simplifying the
application of an advanced technology to
help solve a common problem potholes
maintenance of Road something that we
all have faced as a challenge how did
you think of coming up with this
innovation
yeah so the idea of leveraging the
technology in solving one of the most
pressing and annoying issue uh in the
country uh got us three years ago when
me and my co-founder was navigating to
one of our friends Place using Google
Map I'll go although Google Map will
suggested it's an alternative time
saving shortcut route but it took us
twice the time owning to the bad road
condition and inaccurate crude
information at that time and this was
apnea is one of the microcities so at
that time we thought if this is one of
the uh one of the major issue of India
since so many years so they're not
present any data or the system which
allows us or which shows us the root
characteristic data uh at that time we
decided to start researching on it and
created a system that detects all kind
of Road information
uh from a road condition road signs Road
assets from a simple smartphone because
we wanted the system to become much more
affordable and plus the uh
invertible also so that's how we came up
with the system we moved to Bangalore we
did some of the trial with
infrastructure companies a
municipalities uh private cities also
and we we are trying to solve the root
condition data from uh from it uh core
level like uh potholes uh I mean to take
particles are not just a nuisance but
takes a thousands of life every year uh
so uh why not do the preventive
maintenance uh rather than the reactive
maintenance of the uh root
infrastructure so that's how we came up
with a solution uh and we've been trying
to do that ever since
that's interesting uh depend now give us
some more insights into uh how does Road
metrics work how do you go around
mapping roads and is it context agnostic
in the sense that uh can you can you
apply this technology in urban areas as
well as rural areas
yeah so the solution is simple we just
have to mount the smartphone on the
car's pencil and start uh Road Matrix
data collection application and start
driving it will record the video data as
well as the sensor data of the vibration
uh so this data is then uploaded to our
server when our air algorithm which is
trained over 2 million image point of
the root condition from previous part of
the country process those data and
detect minute details of those data from
a root condition small crack alligator
traveling pot holes and then we map
those data into our web GIS platform
then this platform is being used by the
infrastructure companies uh municipality
city councils uh to do the prioritize
maintenance to do the data driven
maintenance planning of the entire city
for the city planning uh at the same
time this data can be used in the
navigation application for the user uh
to navigate from one point to another
with more comfortable root so this is
how the entire solution works it's been
working on the both turbine and rural
areas we have also mapped uh some of the
villages in the Assam and the Bihar
State and that I think uh the
application might be different but the
data driven uh the diameter using the
road maintenance planning using the data
is always uh creating a big impact uh
they've been using it to save around 30
percent of their root maintenance budget
to uh detect the defect at a early stage
rather than to repair the pothole uh so
yeah it's been working on Urban as well
as in rural areas both
no it depend now uh your Enterprise Road
metrics is a classic example of make in
India make for the world as we speak you
and your team are in London for an
assignment uh how has been the response
abroad for an Enterprise that was born
in India yeah so uh that feedback and
the response have been tremendous good
uh so for the any country I think uh the
progress of country directly depend on
the how the road infrastructure of that
country is uh so that's why all the uh
currently different nations may also
trying to solve that problem uh so here
we've been working with the city of
London uh you have borrowed Leicester
city councils uh and uh we are trying to
change the perception uh from the
reactive maintenance to the preventive
maintenance in more developed countries
they are more buyers towards the uh
preventive maintenance they want the
portal free City uh they so enter at
least to detect that patterns of the
pothole so we are doing this here uh
register to detect the patterns of that
portal and able to report that to the uh
city council so they can make the
decision at the least at the same time
they can save that taxpayers money to do
the route maintenance so I think London
which is I think a phrase of the tourism
right now so uh they wanted to be too
much of the aggressive on the road
maintenance uh uh they they want zero
portal City so for that purpose they
were connected with us and we've been
working with them right Japan it's great
to learn about the story of Road metrics
now let's talk about minus zero
gagandeep uh your turn now uh Indian
roads can be a challenge for best of
drivers we've heard about driverless
technology driverless vehicles but
imagining them on Indian roads is quite
difficult how did you think of making
one
you know definitely I uh there is a very
interesting angle to it uh I would say
it was an overlap of three things that
came together uh initially my uh like uh
background was more towards like AI
Robotics and all you know the purpose
was how we can kind of achieve the human
level of understanding or Intelligence
on the computer because right now I
would say this we have this utopian
dream of AGI artificial general
intelligence that mimics a human brain
but as an industry we are still very
very far away from that you know and I
think that was how this journey started
but I you know over the course of time
they often say right when you face
certain problem you know you try to find
those Solutions and if they do not exist
you if you wanted you start building
them yourselves so I think that's where
there were two metrics that came into
butcher you know like the pain said
Mobility is just not about traveling
from one place to another right it's not
about you want to go to your work or
something Mobility is a very integral
part of any country's economy you know
whether it's Logistics whether it's uh
you know moving people or something or
delivery and no matter if we are doing
air mobility and all still for any
country out there even for the developed
countries that road Mobility is a very
crucial Factor you know this initially
started with you know with whether
you're in Delhi Bangalore you have this
encounter you know
you get frustrated getting stuck in
traffic
right now 90 of the accidents that
happen on the road happen due to human
error right that is a very major pain
point and you know this is what started
out you know those accidents and traffic
congestion problem and then you realize
that okay you have your car
how many hours of the day you were
driving that car maybe half an hour one
hour two hour that vehicle is sitting
idle for a lot of uh maybe 90 of the day
when it could be utilized
and now you imagine this problem of when
you talk about congestion we have too
many vehicles which are being
underutilized
and that is Inlet leading to this
congestion you know slowly when you
start doing deeper we've even got to
understand whether it's supply chain and
all Mobility impacts a lot of Industries
not just you know taxes or something
every industry is impacted I think
that's when you realize that okay
there's an overlap but okay you need to
make these experience of Mobility for
people and also for businesses more
efficient
more economical
and more safer and that's when this
Focus went entirely into autonomous
vehicles uh we we both started uh what
me and my co-founder started one year
back and the purpose was you know if we
had seen these the Great American Dreams
you know uh which had billions of
dollars to spend on R D they're single
single products product it may be costed
Way Beyond what an average business even
could afford you know and you realize
that 90 of the world is not U.S in UK
it's all these other countries which has
let's accept it which has competitively
poor infrastructure
right and also
they do need that the world is you know
you know that is where the problems are
actually that inefficiency
inefficiencies are there
so that's when we both started one and a
half year back and it has been
interesting Journey so the goal was
always to make sure this technology has
to be democratized unless you are able
to cater to the masses unless you can
impact everyone even a small person who
has maybe some access to Mobility is
impacted by that that's where you really
bring a global change right that was a
purpose
that's interesting again but um I'm
curious to learn about what happens to
the human aspect of mobility in the
future if driverless vehicle become a
norm uh how will it transform the manner
in which our societies are people travel
see
the first part is definitely we are
talking about a very efficient way right
amount of time that
we are wasting on roads and you know
whether you have to see very simple
paint ones
is not every India Indian worried or
frustrated with this congestion problems
you know do you like traffic right you
might love driving but you do not want
to just get stuck in that Hall baby you
know that traffic light or something
waiting for getting frustrated when
you're tired from the day right
see there are a lot of things there are
very lot of pain points that are
affecting each and every one of us but
you know there's before these Solutions
we cannot do anything on our individual
level you can't say okay I'll stop
driving the car that is not the solution
you have to solve these pain points
right because like I said Mobility is a
very crucial Factor so I think if how it
is going to be different is it is going
to be making our lives way more units
and experience this is going to make our
lives both businesses and consumers more
efficient
uh you know and more but safer I think
it will be able to utilize our creative
minds
in much more efficient ways rather than
just trying to escape through these uh
vetro graphics
right again I understand that uh an
innovation uh as transformative as a
driverless vehicle would require large
scale testing a lot of safety protocols
that you will have to adhere to a lot of
legal clearances that you uh need uh in
this journey of creating a driverless
vehicle what has been the experience
like any interesting Insight that you'd
like to share with us
and also I think in that case
you know the very catches you know just
you keep on testing more and more number
of miles and all making sure trying to
capture all those uncertainties that
happen on Indian roads you know very
simplest Act of whatever you were
driving suddenly is uh a dog might come
immediately in between the road and you
have to react very very quickly you know
that's why your algorithms have to be
fast robust and all you know a simple uh
simplest Act of okay there is an ice
cream truck which is in the shape of an
ice cream
your Al shouldn't shouldn't identify it
as an ice cream it should know it is a
vehicle and you have to be you know
aware of that so yeah I think that has
been the case that uh the way we have
been trying but uh definitely there is
always this issue of that regulatory
uncertainties you know and I think that
is where
it's not about it's about lack of effort
you know there is no regulations in
place to uh I would say kind of
those metrics you know how do you define
that CP so that's why even in our case
we have to take a lot of ideas from Fest
whether it was Europe's encaps ended or
the status defined by you know us and uh
maybe countries like Singapore Japan to
take a lot of ideas from them you know
making sure you try to comply with all
those because in in the end we are
building a product for the world right
the technology is not restricted for
Indian but yeah I think this lack of for
that regulations is still a thing that
we have to tweak our way around but yeah
let's see how that goes
right it's it's amazing to learn about
the work that you're doing at minus zero
uh gagandeep and as we come towards the
close of this uh special conversation
I'd like to learn from both of you how
do you see the road ahead uh for the
mobility sector in India in the in the
country and the opportunities and
challenges that lie ahead for
entrepreneurs in this sector
yeah uh so I think uh uh road ahead
would be in the terms of the mobility if
I say would be the best future would be
connected Mobility connected Mobility
there are various aspects uh uh vehicle
to vehicle connection B2B equal to
infrastructure connection v2i vehicle to
Cloud connection so once we are able to
achieve this connected Mobility I think
uh the future would be great contact uh
challenges some of the challenges that
we are facing right now I mean the India
being the very different environment and
the rest of the world uh so deploying
that uh deploying the solution in such a
vast environment with so much uncertain
uncertainty so we have to be tested
extensively before deploying it uh any
solution so that is one of the
challenges that I think we could be
facing I could take some time to work
with the regulations work with the
compliances also to to make a comment
that
right and govern your thoughts
opportunities and challenges you did
list some but your thoughts for
entrepreneurs in this sector right so
you know I think uh whenever you are
solving a problem that may be let's say
whenever you're first member in any
domain you know we saw those first
members coming in space take those
possible was coming in EVS coming in
drones and now you know even Mobility I
think they all have these uh similar
overlap of challenges which and that's
what we started our conversation with
you know having the right ecosystem
I think that is where uh I do not say it
would be a problem for entrepreneurs but
uh it's more about the how quickly we
can do that you know
entrepreneurs in India and even any kind
of talent in India I think that is way
more capable than any country out there
it's about you want to do that in one
year or ten years I think that is where
the uh we saw the example the capitals
of India the way it did with them just
you look two years back with space stick
there was no Clarity on that ecosystem
whether it was a regulation whether it
was the entrepreneurs or it was you know
any and Adrian Technologies there was no
Clarity you know we were way late within
these other countries but the way we
progress you know within span of
one year what the country has achieved
I think that is commendable so
definitely one thing is clear it's not
about the capabilities of India and you
know I think that Mobility uh initially
we saw that with EBS that also happened
very good now it's this AI or corrected
uh Mobility you know digitally enabled
infrastructure Mobility you know that is
I think coming in that same cycle
again I have the same thing we are
capable let's not wait
it's time you know since we are capable
let's not wait for maybe right time or
something let's fuse that very quickly
all stakeholders coming together so that
you know we can leave lot of other
countries behind
on that note thank you very much for
joining us on change makers sharing your
stories our best wishes to your teams
it was great interacting with our change
makers their work gives us a glimpse
into how technology and science are
transforming public mobility in the
present and how it will be shaped in the
future whatever may be the degree of
automation there will always be need for
the human angle a human intent a change
maker I will take your leave for now

in a major development Russian President
Vladimir Putin has announced that Russia
will station tactical nuclear weapons in
neighboring Belarus marking the first
time since the mid-1990s that Moscow
will have based such arms outside the
country Putin made the announcement at
the time of growing tensions with the
West over the Ukraine war and are some
Russian commentators speculate about
possible nuclear strikes who then told
State television on Saturday that
Belarusian President Alexander
lukashenko had long raised the issue of
stationing tactical nuclear weapons in
his country which borders NATO member
Poland Putin did not specify when the
weapons would be transferred to Belarus
now tactical nuclear weapons refer to
those used for specific gains in the
battlefield Putin said Russia will have
completed the construction of a storage
facility for tactical nuclear weapons in
Belarus by July 1st adding that Moscow
would not actually be transferring
control of the arms to Minsk the U.S
state Department said the Pentagon did
not immediately return messages seeking
comment
Russia has stationed 10 aircraft in
Belarus capable of carrying tactical
nuclear weapons he said adding that
Moscow had already transferred to
Belarus a number of his scandal tactical
missile systems that can be used to
launch nuclear weapons when the Soviet
Union collapsed in 1991 nuclear weapons
were deployed in the four newly
independent states of Russia Ukraine
Belarus and Kazakhstan in May 1992 the
four states agreed all the weapons
should be based in Russia and the
transfer of warheads from Ukraine
Belarus and Kazakhstan was completed in
1996.
the critics was the statement of the
British defense secretary that they were
going to deliver depleted uranium
charges to Ukraine it is still connected
with the nuclear technologies it is
obvious however even out of the context
of those events and this statement
Alexander Gregorio Rich Luka shenko has
been bringing up the question of
deploying Russian tactical nuclear
weapons in Belarus for a long time
the pro the president of Russia also
said that the move would not violate
nuclear non-proliferation agreements and
compared it to the U.S stationed its
weapons in Europe
Alexander grigorovich is right he says
listen we are your closest allies why do
the Americans deploy the nuclear weapons
at their allies on the territory train
the crews Pilots how to use this type of
weapons if needed we agreed that we will
do the same without violating our
obligations I emphasize without
violating our International obligations
on the non-proliferation of nuclear
weapons
meanwhile the United States the world's
other nuclear superpower reacted
cautiously a senior Administration
official noted that Russian Belarus had
talked about such a deal over the past
year and said there were no signs that
Moscow planned to use its nuclear
weapons

the man died from his injuries according
to Morgan County Sheriff's Office that
appeared to be the only reported death
in that state as of of afternoon on

their severity the Storm Prediction

there's not much of a difference for me
I signed up the Army to serve this

India's national television channel
about India's foreign policy India's
international relations and also Global
geopolitical and economic developments
that have an impact on India's rise in
the world ah viewers in this episode we
are taking up a very interesting
development which is the ever closer
tightening strategic partnership between
Russia and China and what this means for
India and for the world this is what we
are going to be discussing in this
episode and ah to help us understand the
intricacies and the nuances of the
Russia China relationship I have a very
distinguished guest with me in the
studio let me introduce you to him
Ambassador pankaj sir thank you thank
you Ambassador pankaj Saran was a deputy
National Security adviser of India
former Indian Ambassador Russia former
Indian High Commissioner Bangladesh and
convener of nat Strat so welcome to
Indian diplomacy thank you thank you
very much for having me and hosting me
thank you Ambassador you served in
Russia and you've closely tracked the
Eurasian region over the years in your
career
the Russian the Chinese leaders are
saying that their strategic partnership
and friendship if not Alliance quote
unquote has reached a level unseen in
the last 100 years or longer and at
least the rhetoric is that this is ah
you know unprecedented and that they are
toasting raising the toast to this
special bond and more and more and this
is triggering lot of alarm bells in
Western countries and also some concern
here in India so ah your opening
thoughts on where you see this
relationship between Russia and China
going and of course the reasons behind
this you know ever closer and Tighter
partnership yeah so thank you very much
for hosting me on the show it's a
pleasure on the question of the Russia
China relationship
uh this has been going on for a few
years the strengthening of the
relationship and we have to remember
that they've had a very very difficult
history there was a period a few decades
ago when the Soviet Union and China had
split up on ideological grounds they had
a border Clash they have a common border
so there have been ups and downs in the
relationship but over the last since the
breakup of the Soviet Union there has
been study growth but this has
accelerated I would say in the early
2010s in the middle of the 2010 decades
and it's been going on progressively and
I think that trend is going to continue
in the future but there are different
dimensions to the relationship there is
the economic the security the political
the cooperation in the international
Arena so they are moving at different
speeds and there are different speed
breakers on each of the pillars so to
understand it in its totality we need to
disaggregate and see what is the
behavioral pattern under each pillar as
to why this is happening well obviously
there are many reasons again
firstly both are proud civilizations
huge countries massive in terms of land
area
powerful they have hard power at their
disposal so they have a certain image
about themselves and they really believe
that they constitute essential pillars
of the global political system a
multipolar in a multi-polar order number
two uh there is so this is what brings
them together
what also brings them together is their
geographical contiguity and the
relationship of the economic integration
and trade with Russia supplying the raw
materials and energy to the Chinese
market and China growing rapidly and
China in turn providing material to
Russia but unfortunately it's not very
much
and the third reason of course is that
they have been driven into this
partnership because of their adversarial
relationship with the west and if you
look at the U.S national security
strategy it clearly identifies both
Russia and China as threats to the
United States so it is quite logical for
the two of them to come together to sort
of develop a partnership in the midst of
this kind of Western
adverse system that they both confront
but they are the Western adversity
against Russia and against China are
quite different and we have to also
therefore understand the Russia West
contestation and the china west content
station and many times
we find that
they don't necessarily match what I mean
is
when China and the West collaborate or
cooperate there is a huge amount of
economic integration yeah between China
and Europe and China and America
this is not the case with Russia and the
West
so we have a situation where China
despite its friendship with Russia is
not holding back
for advancing its own national interests
in developing relationships with
countries which are Russia's adversaries
yeah in the West
so there are multiple Dimensions to the
relationship and perhaps that's why
ambassador of President Xi Jinping is
often heard saying that the Russia China
is a no confrontation no Alliance and
not aimed at a third country because
like you're saying they want to have the
K candidity too they want access to
Western markets Western technology and
all the and do trade with an investment
with the US and Europe but also want to
challenge them using Russia isn't it so
they seem to be
trying to you know hunt with the hounds
and run with the hairs yeah so in this
relationship you know it will be
interesting to discuss who is driving
the relationship and who's setting the
terms of the relationship is it China or
is it Russia
or is there some kind of a balance
between the two so for example when the
Chinese pushed the belted Road
initiative
what you will find all the time is that
it will be juxtaposed with the Russian
Eurasian economic Union initiative so
when it comes to Eurasia
neither side is going to seed space to
the other
it's just that they have developed a
modus vivendi in the centralization
regions in the post-soviet space where
they will collaborate and cooperate
there also there is a division of labor
informally where China is actually
bankrolling the economic development the
infrastructure whereas Russia is taking
care of the hardcore political and
security Dimensions including internal
developments in the post-soviet space so
there is that Dimension also but yes the
fundamental difference between Russia
and China is that China has is a story
of runaway success economically you know
17 18 trillion dollars Russia is stuck
at two trillion dollars so that is real
asymmetry in the relationship and
therefore the Chinese footprint globally
is actually today much more than Russia
so yeah definitely it's an imbalanced
relationship and
that's something that should concern the
Russians but apparently they have no
choice as Ambassador Saran is explaining
because they have been pushed to a
corner because of Western hostility ah
viewers uh president Xi Jinping and
President Vladimir Putin have met dozens
of times in their long political careers
at the Helms of their respective
countries and the most recent meeting in
March 2023 we have a report about what
all happened between she and Putin let's
watch this and continue the discussion
Chinese president Xi Jinping and Russian
President Vladimir Putin met for second
day for formal talks in Moscow on
Tuesday the talks focused on Ukraine
crisis and Russia's deepening economic
ties with China leaders discussed
further development of strategic
cooperation between the two countries
both countries also signed a number of
important bilateral documents
this was the second day of meeting in
Moscow the leaders met on Monday as well
the two leaders discussed the deepening
of economic ties and promoting beijing's
role as a potential Peacemaker in
Ukraine in televised Commerce Putin told
she he viewed China's proposals for
resolution of the Ukraine conflict with
respect
the Kremlin said on Tuesday that Russian
President Vladimir Putin and Chinese
leader Xi Jinping had held a thorough
exchange of views during their first
year of talks and had discussed
beijing's peace plan for Ukraine
earlier on Tuesday Chinese president Xi
Jinping met with Russian Prime Minister
Mikhail Mr Steen in Moscow on Tuesday at
the house of government of the Russian
Federation the Russian Prime Minister
said Russian Chinese relations are
entering a new era wazna I would like to
congratulate you on your re-election as
president of the People's Republic of
China and sincerely thank you for the
great personal attention you pay to the
development of friendship and
partnership between Russia and China it
is important that you make your first
foreign visit to our country after being
re-elected this testifies to the special
nature of Russian Chinese relations
which are entering a new era
so viewers you here the Russian
president and prime minister saying that
we are in a new era of special
partnership with China Ambassador
you already mentioned the economic and
other pillars of the Russia in a
relationship the trade volumes have
almost doubled in just two to three
years and clearly these are linked to
the Western sanctions and all these
things on both these countries so
um I mean one of the big geopolitical ah
you know points has been that the West
has actually alienated both of them so
much that they're coming together and
creating this united front so in that
context ah what do you think how
sustainable do you think this is because
ah presumably if the West reopens a
Channel with either of them in a way
that reduces their strategic tension
perhaps then this united front will
again weaken or loosen I mean I or do
you see see this as actually ultimately
maturing into some kind of a
full-fledged Alliance like a military
Alliance even though they are pledging
that is not an alliance yeah this is
actually a good question in other words
you're asking how much of it is driven
by the actions of third countries and
forcing them to come together and how
much of it is autonomous in the sense of
the merits of the relationship and these
are both very important I think it
consists of both elements the external
pressures on both which in my opinion
are going to increase definitely in the
case of Russia because the tensions are
going to continue for a long long time
and in the case of china it is going to
be medium to long term threat to China
from the west and China is preparing for
that scenario so that is in so far as
the external angle to the relationship
is concerned insofar as the intrinsic
merits
is concerned I think the fact is that
the neighbors they have a common border
there is complementarity in their
economic strengths
but they are not able to translate all
of this into the kind of integration
which for example China has with the
European and American economies right I
mean they both bring different strengths
to the table China today needs Russia
for various reasons
including the fact that it visualizes or
it foresees the possibility it's not yet
a certainty but a possibility of the
more Western pressures on China
including on Taiwan and therefore it
needs a strong Ally not in a military
sense but in a political sense because
both are in the security Council they
both vote for each other and they
support each other and that is really
critical
and Russia needs China obviously at this
point because it is under pressure from
the West
how long and sustainable this
relationship is will depend on many
factors including you know as I
mentioned the growing asymmetry in the
power between the two
uh Russia will never accept to be a
junior quote-unquote junior partner it
will never accept that status the
Chinese are very sensitive to Russian
sensitivities on this score but this
relationship is here to stay and we have
to deal with it I do not see it heading
towards any kind of a military Alliance
except in a worst case scenario where
there is actual military confrontation
between the west and either Russia or
China but I don't really see that as a
reasonable direct Clash I don't see that
as a reasonable scenario that's probably
a worst case scenario and an ambassador
um on the triangle Russia China U.S I
mean there are some I read Fareed
Zakaria in Washington Post saying we
have become too inflexible our policies
are you know driven by ideology and we
are saying we Biden we meaning the Biden
Administration they are saying that they
are going to counter all authoritarian
countries at the same time and in a way
he was like reminding us of the
Kissinger era when they divided China
and Russia against it as during the sign
of Soviet split which you mentioned so
ah forcibly I mean let us say the
ultimately the Russia Ukraine War Winds
down and some of these ah you know
extreme tensions ah are moderated over
let's say over the next five years or so
and presumably there is still a
possibility that ah the U.S should
reorient and focus primarily on what the
Chinese are saying containment and
suppression of China isn't it I mean
because like you said the power
differential is so vast if you just look
at the between Russia and China
um it it's a no-brainer that the number
one systemic rival for the US is
actually China and Russia cannot match
the U.S in most parameters of power
except maybe military to some extent so
ultimately ah probably this Russia China
the bond homie and the you know close
tight friendship that we are seeing
today perhaps could be loosened again or
or is it too far down the Horizon to
imagine right now no I mean anything is
possible I mean it could loosen uh the
fact is it depends on actions of third
countries but this what you mentioned is
very interesting the triangle between
Russia China and the United States and
here I think it appears to me sitting in
Delhi that the American establishment
seems to have come lately to the
conclusion that China is the long-term
systemic rival of the United States and
the United States position as the ah
number one power of the world but the
problem is that their actions actually
do not suggest that they have
internalized this what everyone else
sees as a clear threat to American
Supremacy so the kind of resources being
deployed in the current Ukraine conflict
against Russia tens of billions of
dollars already and it's not just
military or economic or financial they
are burning a lot of political capital
in the entire third world because the
third world is not buying the argument
that Russia is an evil country and so
this kind of onslaught
using the Russian actions in Ukraine
last year as an invasion etcetera is
costing them a lot of political Capital
so one would have as an Indian as an
Indian
I would be much more comfortable and
strategically much more at ease
if the United States and the West
were dealing with the China rise of
China in a much more systemic and a much
more focused single-minded yeah and so
everything which the West does I have to
ask myself
are they helping China's rise
or are they with me in dealing with its
rise and making China a more reasonable
country and a more stable country to
deal with insofar as I am concerned
sitting in India absolutely well uh
viewers the thing is uh Western Follies
there are quite a few many that one
episode will not suffice to recount all
of them but the point is is this a big
strategic blunder by ah bringing Russia
and China much closer this is something
history will have to answer but talking
of the India Russia China relationship
now let's shift gears to how it matters
to India now and I have a very
interesting comments by the Russian
foreign minister Sergey lavrov who was
in Delhi about the role that Russia
plays as some kind of a mediating or an
intermediary between India and China and
the utility of this diplomatic
facilitation let us hear Sergey lavrov
and continue thank you
and we are interested in these two great
Nations
to be friends
and we're trying to be helpful it was at
the initiative of my great predecessor
Evgeni primakov
that Eric was created Russia India China
Troika
he initiated this and this was the
beginning of the process which
eventually culminated in brics formation
and now bricks is a very popular among
about two dozen countries who would like
to join
so but the
momentum
was insured by the decision to create
this Troika Russia India China the more
they meet the better
and Rick is a
platform for Indian China in our
presence because they might not feel
themselves them themselves comfortable
being one-on-one all the time
you know to find some additional common
grounds brics is another another
platform and of course we strongly
supported in the joining Shanghai
Corporation organization
including from the from the point of
view of providing another another place
where India and China uh can can
cooperate together and can look for some
common Solutions
so and we can we will continue this
policy we never we never engage in uh
playing uh any country against
any other country
and this is unfortunately uh what is
being tried by some other outside
players
so viewers a Russian foreign minister
saying that China in India two great
friends of Russia and that Russia wants
the two to be friendly towards each
other as a certain the geopolitical
realities and the kind of uh Power Play
of Xi Jinping ah probably will never
allow this kind of friendship that the
Russians are envisaging but ah
nonetheless we have all been of the view
that Russia helps to moderate Chinese
Behavior towards us you know and there
are many practical examples during
crisis where Russia has played a helpful
hand ah between India and China but ah
is that really viable going forward now
that they are so close and
of course Russia retains its strategic
autonomy is not a client state of China
but given the differential and possible
dependence of Russia going forward on
China for selling its oil its gas its
weapons coal
um
could do this foresee a situation where
we can no longer rely on Russia's good
offices under the Rica under the bricks
and all these things because there is a
question mark really given the
expansionist conduct of China whether
Russia can be of any help for us anymore
in the future on this front
yeah so actually there are many points
in the question that you have raised
um but firstly I don't think Russia will
not gauge its foreign policy to China
and number two
we have to remember that historically it
is the russia-india relationship which
has actually been the most consistent
and has stood the test of time and all
geopolitical changes as compared to the
Russia China relationship we just
discussed the big split which took place
in the 50s and 60s and 70s
between Russia and India there's
actually never been a Fallout except for
a few years after the creation of Russia
as a country
so that's the second point thirdly we
are not asking anyone for their good
offices when it comes to resolving our
problem with China
if Russia says it has its offer they are
fine they are welcome to make that offer
whether I take up that offer or not is
my decision
number four I will like to proceed with
Russia and judge Russia on how it
responds to meeting my critical National
Security interests and how I move
forward in my bilateral relationship
with Russia
and I have so many opportunities to test
Russia's not just intent but also
willingness to see whether it is moving
with full steam ahead
with all the issues of importance to me
and not allowing any breaks to be put on
them by China or any other country so
and the last point is that in the
Eurasian land mass the two largest
countries are Russia and China
I have a serious problem on the border
with China I have no such problem with
Russia until as long as Russia deals
with me with open arms with transparency
and with a good intent
I see no reason why I should not
reciprocate and move forward with Russia
keeping in mind also that there are so
many critical
needs I have from Russia and I'm not
talking of military alone yeah I'm
talking natural resources I am talking
energy there are so many other things I
mean there is geography which dictates
geopolitics yeah no but Ambassador um
is it possible that this so called you
know sky is the limits friendship of
Russia and China reaches a stage where
China actually imposes conditionalities
ah in return for say economic favors or
something to Russia saying you know
don't give the Indians Advanced
anti-aircraft you know system or
anti-missile systems or ah you know
don't give them anything that will help
them ah blunt the military conventional
military superiority of China with India
I mean and if so then I mean I I was
reading Ambassador Mohan Kumar your
former colleague's opinion piece saying
that our strategic space is shrinking
because of this Russia China closeness
and that eventually if the world gets
divided into two camps again ah you know
we can't be nonline because the Chinese
are breathing down our neck so then we
will be actually forced to move away
from Russia and what happens with this
relationship I I think
again I mean to unpack the comments that
you have made
look if we find or detect and it's very
easy any in any science of Russia
holding back under pressure from China
we will take commensurate action I mean
we are equally hard headed in our policy
making as Russia or China or in America
or anyone else so we are not sitting
here uh trying ignoring what is going on
on the ground so that's the first point
secondly the record of what you are
saying is exactly the opposite that
still now Russia has given us whatever
we wanted yes
and that speaks for itself that's a
matter of historical record but the
third element here is that it is also
reality that in the last 10 12 years we
have actually begun we have started
diversification of our military supplies
away from Russia towards the west and
Russia is seeing this so Russia will
also internalize this and we will have
to see how they react to this kind of
changing reality of from where India
procures military equipment
so I do not believe that
and lastly of course if such a scenario
were to happen where as I said Russia
kind of in some manner or the other
mortgages its relationship to India with
India to China
I will take commensured action also yeah
it is not that actually create that cold
war divisions that they are saying that
they don't want no I am not helpless
yeah I mean in the last one or two years
my relationship with the West with
various constructs in the indo-pacific
this that have significantly grown
stronger absolutely so viewers the point
is India has options it's not
necessarily uh all negative I mean the
Russians and the Chinese getting
together Ambassador Panka Saran has
explained is has got a logic of its own
vis-a-vis the West that doesn't
necessarily mean that it is going to
weaken India's ah privileged strategic
partnership with Russia ah there of
course ah lot of dilemmas that India
faces going forward as a result of this
changing geopolitical configurations but
I want to thank Ambassador pankaj Saran
for giving such deep insights to the
audience thank you thank you sriram for
having me thank you so much so viewers
keep your eye on the Russia China
relationship do not fall for the
hyperbolic ah comments saying that this
is a Factor Alliance or it's something
that reached you know Sky High limits
there are still ah lots of limitations
to how far they can go and of course
there are other players ah U.S Europe on
one side in India on the other that will
have an impact on this relationship so
keep an eye out for studying the Russia
China relationship and its various
ramifications I will see you again next
time until then take care

just their third home ODI series Lost in
eight years as Australia sealed the
three-match assignment by clinching the
final contest by 21 runs at the Amica
Damron stadium in Chennai here are the
key reasons behind India's loss of the
three match ODI Series against Australia
Australia's lower order score too many
runs with only three decades left to
take Roots Sherman and Company were
expected to wrap up the Innings quickly
but Cena but Ashton agar Mitchell Stark
and Adam zampa the visitors lost four
battles added a combined 63 runs hitting
three fours and three sixes between them
Australia were eventually bowled out for
269 with one over two spare and the runs
that their low order made proved to be
different in the end the men in blue
should have done a better job at
cleaning up the tail failure of the top
order across all formats India's top
order failing across all formats is
becoming a headache for the team
management the Indian topwater failed in
the first ODI against Australia in
Mumbai as Michelle Stark ran through
them the match was ultimately won thanks
to the heroics of KL Rahul and ravindra
with the bat a repeat of the issues was
seen in the ongoing ODI in vizag a stock
once again was the chief destroy oil in
the mat batters lacked game awareness
some of the shots India's better place
to be dismissed were inexcusable Adam
zampa and Ashton ago were clearly the
biggest wicket-taking thread for the all
Seas but the home side's better
bizarrely try to take them on repeatedly
okay Raul tried to hoist zampa over the
straight boundary and found long gone
Virat Kohli survived one lazy chip down
the ground of agar before managing to
pick out long off zampa had two overs to
goal in their third power play he
managed to price out hardik and jadeja
who tried attacking him by heaving
across the line even Captain Rohit
Sharma who was the first to be dismissed
paid a pull shot that lacked conviction

the much awaited Indian Premier League
2023 just around the corner and will
commence from March 31 the first match
of the league will be played between
defending Champions Gujarat Titans and
Chennai Super Kings at the Narendra Modi
stadium in Ahmedabad let's have a look
at the major changes made by the BCCI
for the mark event
teams to have two team sheets at doors
captains in IPL 2023 will walk out for
the tours with two different team sheets
and hand in their final 11s after the
tours that is one of the significant
tweaks to the ipl's playing conditions
the IPL becomes the second T20
franchisee League after South Africa's
T20 League to allow teams to announce
their 11th after the toss in South
Africa T20 which stage its inaugural
season earlier this year teams put up 13
names on the team sheets initially
before announcing their final 11s after
the toss
vrs for wide and no balls players can
now challenge the wide and Noble
decisions of the umpires using the
decision review system the Women's
Premier League 2023 became the first
tournament to introduce the rule and now
IPL will also see it being implemented
in their 16th Edition in the Women's
Premier League opener Mumbai Indians
Captain Harman preet core used the
review to challenge a white call by the
Umpire and became the first Giver to
Avail the benefit
New Impact player rule BCCI has also
added a new impact player rule in the
IPL 2023 that allows every team to
replace one of their own field players
with any of the four substitutes at any
moment of the match however the replace
player will no longer be able to
participate further in the match not
even as a substitute Fielder notably if
a team names four foreign players and
they are playing 11th then the impact
player can only be an Indian apart from
this unfair movement from the Wicket
keeper will result in a dead ball and
five penalty runs

World Athletics have banned the
transgender women from competing in the
female category at the international
events a walking group will be set up to
conduct further research into the
transgender eligibility guidelines the
world athletic Council has also voted to
reduce the amount of blood testosterone
permitted with athletes with difference
in sex development such as South African
star caster semenia
World Athletics voted on Thursday to ban
transgender women from competing in a
light female competitions and Titan
testosterone restrictions for other
athletes the council has agreed to
exclude male to female transgender
athletes who have been through male
puberty from female world ranking
competitions from March 31 this year
World Athletics president sebastianco
said that the decision to exclude
transgender women who had gone through
what he called male puberty was based on
what he said was the overarching need to
protect the female category
the council has agreed to exclude male
to female transgender athletes who have
been through male puberty from female
world-ranking competitions from March
the 31st at this year
however in order to do further research
in while transgender eligibility
guidelines we will be establishing a
working group whose remit will be to
consult specifically with transgender
athletes to seek views on competing in
athletics to review and maybe commission
additional research where there is
currently limited research and to put
forward recommendations to council where
the science is insufficient to justify
maintaining testosterone suppression for
transgender athletes the council agreed
it must be guided by our overarching
principle which is to protect the female
category the new rules will also impact
athletes with what is known as
differences in sex development the most
famous might be South Africa's two-time
Olympic 800 meter winner Caster semania
who has X Y chromosomes and blood
testosterone levels in the mail range
the council vote will require DSD
athletes such as semenya and nambia
silver medalist Christian M Boma to take
testosterone reducing medication and
maintain low levels of the hormone for
two years before they are cleared to
compete
that could keep some DSD athletes out of
events for 24 months although KO said
some could apply for a shorter 6 month

ioc president Thomas Bach has said that
the Olympic Games and its ruling body
official cannot act like a referee in
the global political disputes defending
the ioc's plans to include Russians and
Belarusian athletes at the Paris 2024
games speaking at a political form uh
Bach said that game should be stay away
from politics otherwise they would lose
their uniting power citing examples of
past boycotts in 1970s and 1980s
foreign
development regarding ioc's plans to
include Russian and Belarusian athletes
at the Paris 2024 games ioc president
Thomas back defending the ioc's plan
stated that the Olympic Games and its
rulings eight National Olympic Committee
cannot be referees in global political
disputes in 2024 Paris Olympics in a
speech at a political Forum Bach warned
that if the games got involved in
politics they would lose their ability
to bring people together he cited
previous boycotts in the 1970s and 80s
as evidence in his lecture Bach argued
that politics shouldn't determine an
athlete's participation because Sports
and players will become political Pawns
if politics decide who can take part in
a competition then Sports and athletes
become tools of politics it is then
impossible for sport to transfer its
uniting powers we know well that
politics rules the world we know well
that our decisions have political
implications and we have to include that
in our thinking but we should not make
the mistake to raise ourselves to
referees of political disputes because
we will be crushed by this political
powers
ioc issued sanctions against Russia and
Belarus following Russia's invasion of
Ukraine the sporting World took
stringent action against them and
boycotted them after more than a year
International Olympic Committee feels it
is not fair to completely banish their
athletes from the Olympics after more
than a year for fear of a return to the
Cold War era by courts before Bach's
speech a small group of protesters
including Ukrainian refugees assembled
outside the performance hall to voice
their opposition to any athletes from
Belarus and Russia competing at the
Paris games They Carried placards
demanding a total ban on Russian and
Belarusian athletes as well as images of
bombed athletic venues
I am here because I am stunned that
sadly yet again a German has become
poutine's Staples holder just like our
former Chancellor it's simply
embarrassing I think it's a scandal that
Ukrainian athletes will be asked to
stand on the podium next to Russian
athletes who will laugh and smile at
cameras while they are thinking of their
deceased colleagues family members and
friends I just don't understand that
earlier un experts commended the
international Olympic Committee for
considering allowing individual athletes
from Russia and Belarus to take part in
international sports competitions as
neutral athletes on 25th January and
following discussions with two special
rapid Hills the Executive Board of the
international Olympic Committee issued a
statement referring to the need to
respect the rights of all athletes to be
treated without any discrimination in
accordance with the Olympic Charter ioc
then set out a pathway for competitors
from Russia and Belarus to earn over big
slots through Asian qualifying and to
compete as neutral athletes in Paris
next year some Federation substance
re-admitted Russians and belarusians and
competitions but there is also
considerable opposition to the ioc plans
[Music]
I find it interesting that all of
international federations the fencing
Federation was the first to re-admit
Russian athletes it should be recalled
that Mr Bach was an Olympic gold winner
in fencing
Ukraine which has spearheaded the call
to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes
has also threatened with boycott of the
Paris Olympic should they be allowed to
compete their no final decision has been
taken on this matter Sports test

it's very hard to reach because it's so

well an event on digital India
empowerment and transformation was
organized by policy Circle in New Delhi
this is the second event in the series
of events planned this year to coincide
with India's G20 presidency
joined virtually as the guest of honor
at the event the event was attended by
policy makers corporate leaders and
leading economists
Deputy head of the mission of the
embassy of Estonia and India
Marcus solson also addressed the event
and highlighted how Estonia has been
steadfasting in the digital field and is
also cooperating with India on different
fronts
I think about 30 30 bigger Indian
companies up to 200 companies we have as
I said we have 7 000 Indian e-residents
and and this number of of people
um fondly fondly working with Indian
friends is growing we are ending a
little bit of our Finnish friends
because they have bigger number of
people from India we wish and wish to
extend cooperation without a I.T
companies from India and and and kind of
offered and friendly Harbor Freight
Harbor in in Europe that that Indian
companies can can offer their services
directly from from Estonia
also addressed the event on readying
world-class digital infrastructure and
said that hybrid model of aadhar and
hybrid model of UPI will be the future
all of this is possible through open API
I think that is the key part of our
approach to uh
digital public goods or digital
infrastructure that the middle path is
about not
you know a very large private Tech
platforms dominating the landscape or it
is not about completely distributed
completely autonomous uh you know Edge
based Computing it is a hybrid model
where we have the central big platforms
at the same time we have open apis where
anyone can participate and and that
grows the network and and we've seen
that stupendous you know growth with UPI
transactions where uh the the open API
architecture allows everyone to
participate be it Banks be it small
vendors you know be it individuals in
fact I just discovered something very
interesting
but with an aim to achieve Net Zero
carbon emitter by 2030 Indian railways
has recently successfully completed the
electrification of all broad gauge
tracks in chhattisgarh the move will
boost the speed of the trains and
thereby reduce the travel time between
two stations the electrification of the
1170 kilometer
root of broad gauge lines in the state
will increase the sectional capacity of
the trains and reduce the dependency on
imported crude oil and safe for an
exchange it will also reduce the
operating and maintenance cost of
electric locomotives this sustainable
move has been loaded by prime minister
who appreciated the 100 electrification
of Railways in the bilaspur raipur
sambalpur nagpur and Walter division of
chhattisgarh State

in a major development U.S and Canada
have reached a deal that would give both
countries the authority to turn away
Asylum Seekers at The Unofficial
Crossing points on their shared borders
President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau announced this
on Friday and starting early Saturday
morning migrants who cross into Canada
between official ports of Entry will be
quickly returned to the U.S the new
agreement will also allow the U.S to
send Asylum Seekers who cross the
northern border at unofficial Crossing
points back to Canada according to the
publishing test of a rule that is said
to be published in the Federal Register
the deal is the latest move by the Biden
Administration to discourage migrants
from crossing the border illegally in
order to seek Asylum over the objections
of immigrant Advocates of and some
Democrats the U.S and Canada have long
had what's known as a safe Third Country
agreement in place that allows them to
turn back migrants if they cross through
official ports of Entry but Canada has
seen a dramatic uptick in traffic at
unofficial Crossings
in a joint press conference the two
world leaders also discussed their
efforts on a range of issues which
included the climate change Russia
Ukraine war the China along with China
and instability in Haiti among other
things the U.S president said that China
has not provided significant weapons to
Russia for its war in Ukraine
I don't take China lightly I don't take
Russia lately but I think we've vastly
exaggerate I would hear I've been
hearing now for the past three months
how about China is going to provide
significant weapons to Russia and
they're going to well I've been talking
about that
doesn't mean they won't but they haven't
yet and as we head into the second year
of Russia's brutal Invasion are are our
Unity is not going to break we're going
to keep the pressure on Putin through
our historic sanctions and tariffs and
we're going to continue to provide
Ukraine with training equipment
humanitarian assistance it needs and to
defend itself against Russian aggression
while you as President Joe Biden said
that United States is preparing to act
forcefully to protect Americans
commenting after the U.S military
carried out air strikes against
iran-backed forces in retaliation for an
attack that killed an American
contractor and wounded five U.S troops
last night U.S military forces carried
out a series of airstrikes in Syria
targeting those responsible for
attacking our personnel
my heart and deepest condolences brought
to the family of the American we lost
and wished a speedy recovery for those
who were wounded but I'm also grateful
for the professionalism of our service
members who uh so ably carried out this
response and to make no mistake the
United States does not does not
emphasize seek conflict with Iran but be
prepared for us to act forcefully
protect our people that's exactly what
happened last night
president President Biden said that U.S
is looking to support the police
department in Haiti and studying whether
the United Nations can play a role to
quell the violence there Biden also said
he didn't rule out the possibility of
sending the military to stabilize the
country would have to do so in
consultation with the United Nations and
with the government in Haiti
the idea of how do we deal with what's
going on in Haiti where gangs have
essentially
taken the place of the government in
effect they run they rule the roost as
the saying goes and uh so I think that
what the Prime Minister has spoken about
makes a lot of sense the biggest thing
we could do and it's going to take time
is to increase the prospect of
the police departments and Haiti having
the capacity to deal with the problems
they're faced
and that is going to take a little bit
of time we also are looking at whether
or not the International Community
through the United Nations could play a
larger role in this event in this this
circumstance but there is no question
that there is a real genuine concern

Narayan Singh's report Sports desk did
India
well two boxers would be in The Fray
today it's been a golden Run for the
Indian women boxers there in the ring
this time in the national capital to get
a perspective of can we expect four gold
medals
or we are at least assured of four
silver medals joining us this evening is
Narayan Singh Narayan looking at the two
bars that we're going to see tonight the
two boxes that are going to be two women
boxers that are going to be there in the
ring let me first begin by talking about
swathi Bora you know she is in that 81
kilogram category but what's the sense
that you make of that particular final
bout is it uh you know punch for punch
kind of an outing that you see or does
the Indian boxer hold the upper hand
if you talk about the sweeties my
channel uh the way she has performed in
this tournament is exceptional in 2014
she won the silver medal at the world
women's boxing championship now uh she
is just one step away from winning that
elusive goal uh to add that big medal to
her cabinet and the kind of performance
she has done in the store room at his
excellent and if you talk about her
performance so far even in the
semi-finals it was a very big bout it
was a very tense bout a pressure boat
and she overcame her opponent and she
booked her birth in the final and her
today's opponent is also a very highly
decorated opponent that Wang Lena of
China she's a Asian Championship
medalist and they're all Championship
medalist so it's going to be a tough
bout for her and but the kind of
performance she had showed definitely uh
sweetie has upper hand in this match
you know one man looks at you know
women's boxing in particular and the
other boxer there in the ring tonight uh
neetu how do you look at the two boxes
you know especially when it comes to the
48 kilograms they've played before so
this is a rematch that you would see and
maybe revenge on the guards in front of
the home fans that Nita would be looking
to you know pull off tonight
definitely a fantastic box uh the kind
of a phone she has shown in the recent
past she is the Commonwealth goal
Commonwealth against the gold medalist
and also a two-time youth women's youth
World Championship gold medalist she we
can say that she's the kind of
performance she had displayed in the
past she is going to the next maricom
she is very aggressive boxer if you take
a look at it performing this tournament
she won her initial three bouts by the
RSC that the referee stops the contest
and her semi-final bout was one of our
we can say that it was by she won by the
split decision she was the same opponent
in the semi-final who outstud neetu in
the last Women's World boxing
championship so also she settled the
score with her and the kind of bout she
play she also said that it was the most
pressure about in this tournament and if
you take a look she always remains calm
even in the very
this is a USB and definitely today she
is the medal Contender for India she has
the ability to win a gold for India last
time she missed she lost in the quarter
finals but when you talk to her
definitely she said this time her Target
is to win the gold medal okay how does
one you know comprehend lavalina's
carrier you know post that Olympic
Triumph that she had she's had many ups
and downs if one looks at her
choreograph was that do you see she back
in the top of a Mojo when she enters the
boxing ring for that final about this
time around definitely the way she
played in the storm and especially the
semi-final match uh she was up against
uh world-class boxes she was also a
Olympic medal winner her opponent in the
uh semi-finals and also a world
championship Medal winner so that was I
think was her toughest battle in the
tournament and hoping that she will
replicate that performance that she
displayed in the semi-final in the final
also and will the gold medal here at the
women's world boxing championship
consists the fact that when we talked to
her she said that she want to give a
befitting reply to her detractors who
wrote about her before the Tokyo
Olympics heroics so she won she is in
full confidence she's full confident
that the way she played in this
tournament is great and she is
determined to win a gold medal here also
okay one final word before I let you go
last boxer that we are talking about
niket zareen she's already played five
bouts there in the ring somewhere deep
down you know she is she is considered
to be the beaten holder taking forward
that Legacy from MC Mary com in that
context how do you see Nick at zarine
and the final that she plays tomorrow
definitely a champion box and Anil if
you take a look her career she won the
last year's Women's World boxing
championship and here also if you take a
look her every boat her reflexes her
footwork from her movement from the back
foot to the front foot and the way he
just foxes her opponent is great and the
form if you take a look how form in the
storm it is exceptional in the previous
match that it was against that Colombian
boxer Ingrid it was a world-class match
and the way she just defeated her
opponent with the counter attacks we can
say that she just the Colombian box was
trying to be more aggressive in the
first round but after that the way she
used the counter punches and the counter
attack and gave no space to or that uh
Colombian opponent and booked their
birth in the finals and hopefully she is
one of the best boxer in the India right
now and she is we can say that can carry
forward that pattern the legacy of Mary
comb and she just one step away last
time she won in the previous edition of
the Women's World boxing championship
and the kind of form she possessed the
the form she is in right now definitely
we are hoping that nikith will win her
second Women's World boxing championship
gold medal okay thank you and appreciate
your joining us and look forward to
Indian Eaves they are all for getting us
you know it's going to be a glorious
night for us four gold medals will be

who's joining us from Tel Aviv in Israel
welcome to Diaspora diamond srinagi
thank you so much well first of all
thank you thank you uh same to you now
first of all congratulations for the
award uh now what were your first
thoughts when you heard that uh you're
getting the highest order that the
Indian government can give to an Indian
living abroad who settled in Israel
complete shock complete shock I I didn't
think I deserved something for being a
proud Indian
what I did I did all my life with my
family
surrounding me and just being very proud
of my Heritage wanting to spread the
word word around of
Indian Cuisine actually culture through
Indian cuisine
and that was the go get from the
beginning and then it just spread all
over Israel
wonderful and how did your family and
friends feel were they taken by surprise
or did they feel that the award is good
recognition for what you've been doing
uh so far in Israel
right they always supported me my family
was always around me
the people of Israel support me a lot we
have a very strong Indian Community over
here of uh first it was 85 000 now today
I'm told we are more than a hundred
thousand uh Indian Israeli Jews here
from India and so the diaspora is big
and a lot of responsibility my
restaurant was full of flowers from
every Israeli
and uh I didn't know how to say thank
you and they all said it was very well
deserved because like I'm a walking
talking
uh ambassador of India
and it's I think simple folks like me
who have will leave a lost lasting
impression
and that's what it takes
great much is already known about you
you're called the curry queen of Israel
who's uh played host to a Galaxy of
leaders and celebrities including both
the Indian and Israeli Prime Ministers
together at uh whose home but how did
this entire Journey really begin as a
chef as a restaurateur
but well uh mine was an arranged
marriage by my dad
Punjabi and my mother but Daddy Jewish
Iraqi Jew
and uh it all started with me sailing
with my husband we know the who was a
captain and Merchant Marine on board the
ship
and mime is a university of life I got
married straight after school
so for me it was a whole new world ahead
of me
and uh on both the ship I had nothing to
do but just read books from one end of
the library to the other or to to to to
here try to catch some radio frequency
or to just go
on the bridge be with my husband
and look forward to seeing New Ports
but then slowly slowly I made friends
with the the chefs on the ship you know
we had two two different uh kitchens one
was for the crew and one was for the
officers so slowly slowly they became my
friends and that's how I found myself
being exposed to World Cuisine for nine
years on the ship this was like a base
for me I didn't have any culinary school
it was just being
standing in the kitchen and making
friends with all the chefs and seeing
different Cuisines every year because it
was 10 months every year on auto ship
and that was really my my
uh
my you can say journey into a culinary
school and then later on going and
learning different kinds of Vegetarian
Cuisine for my Punjabi mother-in-law who
used to cook food without onion and
garlic and this was a young Jewish girl
in her kitchen without without any
issues so this was quite an experience
to start and come and then I we want I
wanted my husband actually to leave sea
life and on one of our voyages we landed
in Israel
right and we said why not uh start to do
something here and
and over here Israelis felt that we
dropped from the sky
what was this I was selling uh because I
started with a restaurant called ichik
Dana why ichigana because
that's what Israeli is new about India
Raj Kapoor the song
and uh and uh Indira Gandhi that's it
and then come this Indian couple who
says that look at us we are Indians and
we have brought you our Vegetarian
Cuisine and at that time vegetarian
food was was a taboo in Israel because
here they they are meat eaters
or one one cucumber or capsicum in their
fridge and that was what was vegetarian
for them
for them suddenly this young lady comes
and sells Pani Puri and thali and it was
it was uh you know it was we were like
in a in a place where where we were
close by to an army base and they would
look at us in the afternoons and think
where did these people drop in everybody
would would take our chairs away
and this was like a kiosk and then
suddenly in the evening the Indian
people heard that there was this place
opened and they would come with their
trans you know their transistors and
their and their Bollywood music in buses
and half of them would pay and half of
them would run away
and uh well we thought this is not what
we came to do all the way so my husband
went back on the ship and I asked for
one more chance
to do something with meat this time
and that's how
we opened Tandoori okay
I didn't look back after that
wonderful
your journey is also made up of an epic
anecdotes and even historical moments
significant in the world's quest for
lasting peace tell us about those as
well
right
um
Oslo these talks started in our
restaurant in tanduri Tel Aviv
and how did we come to know about it
because suddenly we were watching
television and then
they showed the famous handshake on the
on the launch of the White House between
uh prime minister Rabin and chairman
Arafat and ABC American television said
we'll take you back now to where it all
started
when did this happen what did this
happen well at that time we started with
our right foot we used to bring in 15
staff every restaurant from the oberoi
so we were like professional from the
beginning
I still don't call myself a chef I call
myself a cook a good cook because I'm
learning every day from my chefs in my
kitchens and
um
and suddenly we heard that they had had
this special uh lunch with the
Norwegians the Palestinians and the
Israelis
and that's where the whole Oslo Peace
talk started
and from there they moved into Jerusalem
and from there to Oslo for the famous
peace talks and then the European
newspapers quoted it saying that peace
talks
peace talks heat up over hot curry okay
so the Indians also have a have a role
to play over here with their spices but
I think it should be a neutral ground
people feel very comfortable to come to
us
and we've always welcomed everybody I
think that's uh that's your uh bharatiya
saman that you give people
so everybody feels comfortable to come
to us and I think that's the reason why
they hosted their first meeting in our
restaurant then after that
um when uh you know I mean all the
dignitaries used to come to us I mean
after that we opened eight restaurants
and seven uh Express and then the
factory and we were catering all over
Israel and we used to uh always welcome
Hollywood stars or our our dear uh
feistra Zubin Mehta would bring in all
his musicians and the prime minister at
that time
um prime minister
Netanyahu was I think Deputy foreign
minister
and he used to visit us very often and
it you know in Kota Tandoori caught up
and uh
uh suddenly uh in 2018 okay 17 when
prime minister uh
modiji visited Israel
and um I was asked to to come in with my
team firstly we were at the King David
catering for and preparing for the whole
delegation but apart from that
uh Mrs Netanyahu and prime minister
Netanyahu requested me to come to their
home with my team yes in that dinner
that uh who hosted for Prime Minister
Modi is also quite legendary now
my first date
Sarah was to rina's restaurant in Tel
Aviv
and it was so
so why not play the magic again with
India and this time you know with with
the connection through food
and do a half and then on to politics
and uh that's how the whole world came
about to know about it actually in the
next day on their peace conference he
quoted it again
in the foyer I had all these Indian uh
journalists and all the TV Crews saying
that did you know that their first date
was in in your restaurant and I said yes
I don't mention things but now he's
mentioned it to the world and then later
on I came with him to India and he
mentioned it to the whole of India and I
think
Indians embraced him for that for
respecting their cuisine
and for respecting their culture and
tell me which prime minister does that
anywhere else in the world yeah you know
who stays a staunch believer in his food
his yoga and his culture exactly you
know that's one of the things that I
feel that you know people talk so much
about India and its soft power and how
Indian films represent a great part of
its software they talk about Bollywood
not just the films the music itself of
the films then of course there's yoga
now
ayurved but you know the thing that is
not talked about as much as it should
perhaps is Cuisine so what do you think
about that you know India taking its
Safa to the world with its cuisine we
would like to know from the queen of
curry in Israel
right to tell you frankly
it was very difficult to sell Indian
food into this country because
the the Indian Jews who came here were
more engrossed in assimilating and
proving their jewishness
then concentrating on their cuisine
and I am always
there to say that Indian food is gourmet
food never mind how it's presented
um and today I think Israelis have have
begun to realize that more than anyone
else in the world and I think they can
teach me about what it is to to cook up
a good Indian meal apart from teaching
them to to eat Indian food I've also
taught them how to cook it on different
in Israeli channels great but but I
think
uh food has brought uh Indian food has
brought many people I think all
dignitaries from all over the world or
to our tables and uh and that's what's
taken a step further into politics great
great now you've got the PB saman award
in the category of business and
Community welfare you have a chain of
Indian restaurants in Israel now
spreading the aroma of Indian cuisine in
your adopted country tell us about this
aspect of your life and how you've
channeled it even to do community
welfare
well as I mentioned to you we have more
than a hundred thousand Indian Jews now
the first thing is the new generation
proudly comes to my restaurants
um telling their their Israeli partners
that this is what India is all about so
I'm very proud about that firstly but
secondly is
um taking taking advantage of this new
government I hope that we will have one
representative from our community
[Music]
representing the whole Indian diaspora
over here which has really not happened
in all these years and I've been pushing
for that and I think after getting the
bhartia Privacy saman I think more
responsibility has been added to my
shoulders
to push in the right government for our
Indians to get into Parliament okay okay
um and and the kind of community work
you must have been doing it must have
also given you a lot of insight into the
Israeli socio-economic believe as well
now what commonalities do you think are
there between India and Israel which
could be built upon for others to bring
the two countries and societies even
closer
see um
line talk positions all over the world
um there are a lot of things that we do
not do we can take a page
from the from the Jews
who are together in their diaspora
helping Israel from outside and that's
what the Indians should do when they
come to pbd every year it's they should
take up projects and help their cities
or their Villages that's what I'm a part
of lion of Judah and they're only Indian
representative we are 20 000 women from
all over the world
and we do we take up projects to help
women and children
and I think this is what pbd I think all
the Committees all over the world coming
across every two years into pbd should
do they should have different projects
not only to come to see our dear prime
minister who is our Superstar or or
their president or the ministers but to
come with an agenda how can we help the
man on the ground how can we help our
cities how can we help our our
Villages through our different
Technologies which we are experiencing
and through our different contacts all
over the world
and I was very impressed by one such
session that I attended at PVD was the
women entrepreneurs and I hope to be a
speaker next in next pbd at that uh
event
telling the world how you can be you
don't need to come from wealth you can
be a middle class Indian you can be a
middle class lady coming into this you
can help
and uh and move worlds for other people
and I think I think that's what we women
are all about
I hope that works out well now uh also
tell us how's India viewed by Israelis
is it seen as a rising Global power
which is also the voice of the global
South as it is seeking to be while
hosting the G20 Summit this year
India has always been a world power I
mean look first you know you used to
have only the Backpackers going as
tourists to India today you
uh then their parents followed and after
that you know you take a step at a time
after that the business people followed
after that the government's uh uh spoke
to each other uh this is what Modi ji
did he took it one step at a time and I
think it's about time that India
um take on not take on uh take on
um in in in professionally
uh to to represent uh India all over the
world like you know where not only where
you have something to do with arms or
technology but but things on the ground
like the infrastructure like uh like I
mean start with the airports you have
one of the best airports in the world
you have the best facilities at the
airports I compare you to the west and
uh it starts with there so India is
progressing and you see the progress on
the ground
every visit that I take and I think we
should be proud and we are able to stand
with the other G7
countries and represent and go ahead
with India certainly now India's also
had Indians have had a long-standing
presence in Israel both as Israeli Jews
you mentioned them and those who live
there for work in their studies now
what's the composition of the Indian
diaspora now and how is it contributing
to Israel's progress
I remember
about
10 years ago this was that when our
recent Ambassador singla was then our
DCM and I arranged a meeting for the
first uh with the dean of reichmann
Institute for the first Exchange program
of students coming into Indian students
coming into Israel and vice versa and
now I see that happening on the ground
one of my restaurants is is located in
the it it area where you see a lot of
representation of uh of young I.T
Engineers coming into Israel to work and
learn
so I think this is a big start this is
apart from everything else that is
happening on the ground with agriculture
and and Technologies exchange
Technologies and now you have Mr Danny
bought hifa Port so you will have a lot
of interaction at with Indian ships
talking at the port
and uh just the whole country opening up
more to India right and uh don't forget
it all started with my small small uh uh
Lassie or panipuri or Tali you can I
mean there was no no even not even an
Indian Embassy here we welcome the
embassy we welcome the Indian Banks we
welcomed uh the Indian ministers and I'm
proud to say I am a president of
overseas friends of BJP here I'm not at
all political and I was asked and I

nIx8shs0OIo,Indian Diplomacy: Japan-India Defence Cooperation,Analysis of the worsening regional security situation in Asia and what Japan and India can do for strategic stability. Anchored by ...,2023-03-18T15:51:12Z,DD India,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nIx8shs0OIo/hqdefault.jpg,"foreign
[Music]
India's national broadcaster about
India's international relations Indian
foreign policy India's major Global
Partnerships and India's involvement in
shaping and making a better world order
because in this episode we are looking
at a very pivotal relationship of India
something that's been a defining one in
Asia this is the partnership with Japan
Japan India Global strategic partnership
ah goes back a long way but it has New
Dimensions as a result of changing
International environment and this is
what we are going to be discussing with
a special focus on defense cooperation
between Japan and India and to take us
through this analysis I have a very
special guest joining us from Tokyo
Japan Dr sathuru nagao
Dr nagao is a non-resident fellow at the
Hudson Institute an important American
Think Tank based in Japan a writer and
commentator on Japan's strategic issues
welcome to Indian diplomacy Dr Naga
thank you very much for inviting me it
is honor to comment in this CP
so Dr nagao when we talk of Japan and
India
um defense cooperation is emerging as a
very very Central pillar of this
relationship it always has been but we
now have a two plus two dialogue
involving foreign and defense ministers
and even when the top leaders meet the
prime ministers meet and another Summit
is happening ah we see that there is a
lot of focus on defense and Security in
the indo-pacific so
um you can sense that both our countries
feel a very special need to come closer
on Military and security issues because
each of them sees the ah security
environment around them getting worse
and worse day by day so we'd like you to
start ah with your thoughts on how Japan
sees the indo-pacific region and the
security in the region and what are its
main concerns as its looking at this you
know expanded neighborhood of Japan
came from three countries especially one
country China
uh because uh Japan population National
Security strategy new one last December
at 2022.
and that National Security strategy
identified three countries as a
challenge against Japan's interests
first one is China and second one is
North Korea's advise Russia and Japan is
facing all of three at the same time but
Japan's way of writing the top is a
priority so this means that first one
China is a priority and to deal with
China India is the most important
country to cooperate because Japan
is a Pioneer to suggest indo-pacific and
correct which country is most important
India India is important because in the
Pacific compared with Asia Pacific India
is the new one correct the three other
countries are usris but India's newcomer
that's why when Japan introduced
especially since Robert
introduced the indo-pacific and the quad
this means that Japan want to cooperate
with India so that's why Japan focusing
on India to deal with China is a very
important
yes very much so uh no question that
China is uppermost on the minds of both
India and Japan and I think that remains
main shared perception in fact the new
National Security strategy you mentioned
of Japan says that China's aggressive
posture in last few years poses an
unprecedented and greatest strategic
challenge to Japan I think the same
language can be used if India were to
Define its National Security strategy in
similar terms so ah the Chinese military
buildup Dr nagao ah has been of a great
concern for both our countries the kind
of Defense ah spending the fastest
growing Navy that they are doing and
also is not only the capabilities but
also there is a change isn't it in
China's behavior and attitude towards
its neighbors I mean if you just go back
10 15 years ago it was not like this so
especially in the Xi Jinping era ah both
our countries Japan and India find China
very Troublesome so so uh sitting there
in Japan ah you know as the Chinese are
building up their ballistic missiles
even testing them ah close to Japanese
Islands in order to threaten Taiwan and
other countries and of course
challenging
um your your control over the senkaku
islands and many other you know Maritime
spaces
um How is Japan reacting to this I mean
this is a historic challenge like you
said and avisan ah you mentioned the
great Shinzo Abe he used to say that you
know if he looks at Asia in 2014 the it
looks a bit like Europe in 1914 which is
on the eve of World War One you know so
ah but the alarm bells are continuing to
ring and it does not look like China is
changing its Behavior so that is why we
have to cooperate much closer isn't it
Japan and India should cooperate against
China in this which she has the same
problem
the when we checked the number of the
incursions in the India China border and
when we checked number of
uh in casual the sea allows the same
calculator in the East Tennessee indeed
we find the similar pattern in 2011
number was not so many but in 2012
number increased drastically in the both
side against East Tennessee against
India China border and the strategy is
the same number content and in 2090 the
boss of the two side China increased
number to enter the Japan side and
Indian side so India and Japan sharing
same problem China's provocation
that's why two country should cooperate
that is the fasting but how to cooperate
indeed China's territory expansion also
has a pattern
when we check to China's activity in the
South China Sea
in 1950s when France withdraw from the
region China tooks the half of the
parasite
in 1970s similar father has happened
when us withdraw from Vietnam China take
another half of the parasite Island in
1980s Soviet troops in Vietnam reduce
the number China took the sixth features
in 1990s when U.S Israel from Philippine
China took the mystery free so when they
find power vacuum created by changing
military balance the spirit so that's
why China's pattern of territory
expansions look like sea they find
something antiquity so if we maintain
military balance we can deter we can
deterge China's activity because they
cannot find the power vacuum but the
maintaining military balance is very
difficult job because China is Rich
China increased their military budget
very rapid Pace under such kind of
situation what should we do if Japan and
India cooperate what happened China need
to divide their defense budget to side
if the US and usually also joins and
divide China's defense budget China need
to divide more so cooperation is the key
to maintain military balance that's why
India and Japan should cooperate in
Africa and Russia and U.S or other
recommend country should cooperate each
other to divide China's budget to
maintain military bonds to maintain
peace that was Fair concept absolutely I
am maintaining military balance is
critical ah for peace and stability in
Asia says Dr saturnagao viewers I have a
very interesting report about Japan ah
revising its military budget to respond
to this you know increasing Chinese
build up and let's hear from this report
and then continue the discussion
Japan on Friday unveiled its biggest
military buildup since World War II the
320 billion dollar plan will ready the
pacifist country for sustained conflict
and includes buying missiles capable of
striking China as the government fears
Russia's invasion of Ukraine will
encourage Beijing to attack Taiwan and
threaten nearby Japanese Islands prime
minister fumio kashida branded Japan as
being at a turning point in history
we can feel a rapid increase in the
severity of the security environment
around our country the
day
in countries and the region surrounding
our country a strengthening of nuclear
and missile capabilities a rapid
military buildup and attempts to
unilaterally change the status quo
through Power are becoming more
pronounced
Tokyo also fears an attack by China
could put a potential Stranglehold on
sea lanes that Supply Middle East oil as
well as disrupt supplies of advanced
semiconductors
China's current external stance and
Military Trends are a challenge to our
country's peace and security the
securing of global peace and stability
and the enhancement of international
order based on the rule of
laws
China accused Japan of making false
claims about its military activities in
the new security strategy according to a
statement from its new Embassy in Japan
The Five-Year Plan which will double
Japan's budget to about two percent of
GDP will make the country the world's
third biggest military spender after the
US and China based on current budgets
so viewers uh you saw how Japan is
responding in a more robust way than
before to manage this Juggernaut of
China that is rolling in its backyard
and that's trying to compromise Japan's
natural influence in Asia
um coming back to you Dr nagao
the we just heard the Japanese prime
minister talk about the you know
historic turning point for your country
and here
um they I mean sometimes there is more
media attention on the North Korean
problem ah because you know they create
ah you know they have missile tests and
possibly nuclear tests up their sleeves
and they behave in a roguish quote
unquote manner that upsets Japan ah but
then ah if you look at the big picture
then ah North Korea at least in my
reading is a subset of the Chinese
problem and not a you know a separate
problem on its own and sometimes I
wonder whether Japan is distracted by
North Korea and not fully focus on the
number one issue which is China although
the National Security strategy clearly
says China is the biggest issue so um
your thoughts on how Japan is managing
the North Korea issue and whether it is
in a way deviating from the main issue
or is it of subset or a part of the main
issue which is Chinese expansion where
North Korea is also acting ah to promote
Chinese ah geopolitical interests in the
region
aspect are very important China and
North Korea is a former Ally of China
and China has only one Ally indeed North
Korea's only
so 3D base that's true so that's why
China's program and North Korea program
is one one set of problems
but at the same time North Korea is
independent country North Korea has
their own voice that's why in this case
there is another aspect North Korea
itself is an independent problem so two
aspects there are two aspects at the
same time in this case why China support
North Korea because this is that North
Korea's location is defense line or
basic that's why North Korea where China
neither North Korea but at the same time
North Korea so I want to want to possess
their own nuclear capability and there
is a possibility China supported but
there is no
[Applause]
a strong connection we can we haven't
found it so there's a possibility they
support it but we need to get some more
evidence yes and are talking of other
hot spots I mean the Korean Peninsula ah
is a flash point no doubt and a matter
of concern for Japan and then you
already mentioned the East China Sea and
the senka coils as well as the South
China Sea the parasail and the spratly
islands but the biggest ah talking point
in the last couple of years especially
has been Taiwan and ah your National
Security strategy ah talks about Taiwan
as a important friendly country of Japan
ah with the long historic ties and I
know you are highly concerned Like Us in
India about the potential of China
invading and forcibly taking over Taiwan
and that will of course change the
complete balance of power you were
talking about earlier in the show so um
How is Japan preparing for any kind
contingency or emergency such as an
invasion of Taiwan and what kind of
support or resistance can Japan and
India and all our you know like-minded
countries we mentioned in in the quad
like Australia U.S what can we all do
about taiwan's independence and to
preserve taiwan's Independence ah from
possible Invasion and occupation by
China
we need to remember that Taiwan has
already independent country so as a
reality so but China I do not automate
it China tried to host other country to
admit this is part of China but we can
see the real independent government in
Taiwan so under such kind of situations
China want to change the status quo by
force that is a problem so China to try
to invade Taiwan and what will happen
that will be the matter of concern and
priority for Japan just now in this case
went to China invade Taiwan the most
important aspect of Taiwan is Will Japan
support Taiwan defense because when you
look at the map the supply line to
defend Taiwan is derived on the passive
Pacific side the Japan in the
Philippines
so if Japan and the Philippine corporate
with the United States to support Taiwan
in this case Taiwan can defend
themselves very strongly because one
side is open and we can provide many
weapon supplies from each side
so in the taiwan's ammunition dump was
located in the Pacific side so if the
China
China want to invade Taiwan in this case
China need to come to the Pacific side
and attack from the Pacific side and
Destroy these ammunition dams so they
are Bankers Under the Mountain so that's
why
Japan Japan
will support taiwan's defense it's a
vital part to defending Taiwan
absolutely
Japan cannot escape from this conflict
yes to deter the China's military
operations Japan supporters were very
brighter part
and in this case I need to mention the
India's role India's role is a little
different India's Road there's a huge
possibility we can imagine India would
send the aircraft carried our fighters
to defend Taiwan
but at the same time gift chair India
try to protect India China border area
China need to share some certain amount
of military assets and Military
resources including budget against the
India China border side so firstly in
this case
India reduced China's military resources
against Taiwan that is passing and
secondly
in this
China China start to believe China can
win if they invade Taiwan that that's
why China will invade Taiwan so but
in this case if Japan will not support
the U.S will not support Australia will
not support Taiwan China can
miscalculate so in this case economic
dependence is around the fact that China
believed Japan will not support Taiwan
U.S will not support Taiwan we also
support Taiwan so economy economic
aspect is there to deter China's
Invasion so you're saying um there are
military economic as well as diplomatic
elements to ah the defense of Taiwan and
these are well points well taken now
coming back to the Japan India viewers I
have a video statement by ah simran
Walia she is a resource researcher at
the center for air power study is a
military think tank in India talking
about Japan India defense cooperation
specifically on the bilateral and
Regional side let us hear her and then
continue the discussion with Dr nagao
in 2020 India and Japan signed the
acquisition and cross servicing
agreement between Japan's self-defense
forces and India's military for a
reciprocal provision of supplies and
services to enhance the military
cooperation Japan's participation in the
multilateral exercises Milan for the
first time in operationalization of the
aksar is one of the major highlights of
the progress of Defense cooperation
between India and Japan
both in both Nations conducted the major
bilateral air exercise known as whale
Garden 2023 recently in January and this
was aimed at promoting air defense
cooperation between the two countries
Japan also wishes to promote training
and exercise along with collaboration in
the defense equipment and Technology
with India
many other bilateral exercises are being
held regularly between India and Japan
known as the Dharma Guardian which is
between Indian army and Japan's ground
self-defense forces then there's Malabar
Naval exercises between India Japan the
United States and Australia
and then there's also cinematry exercise
which is the bilateral exercise with the
Japan's air self-defense Sports the
Ukraine crisis and tensions across the
Taiwan Strait have prompted Japan to
reconsider its security policies and
therefore Japan recently released its
revised National Security strategy which
aims at boosting defense spending and
possessing Counter-Strike capabilities
to deal with the growing threats from
Neighbors like China and North Korea and
this would also enhance defense
cooperation between India and Japan
indo-japan collaboration and defense
manufacturing and enhancing defense
equipment would also boost the Japanese
economy and help India become more art
maneuver a new dynamic in the defense
ties is that of the joint research on
Advanced Technologies and systems
development which would also impact the
inter-pacific security in the long run
China obviously remains a very critical
factor in promoting India Japan defense
relationships and therefore the
Strategic aspects of the relationship
have recently gained momentum reflected
in the bilateral and multilateral
engagements such as the court and other
trilateral initiatives involving India
and Japan for instance the India Japan
U.S trilateral and there are also many
other potential trilaterals that are
coming up within India and Japan such as
the India Japan Italy trilateral and
India Japan Russia trilateral to mention
a few
so viewers are you heard the simran
Walia speaking about
nitty-gritty of Japan India defense
cooperation and coming back to you Dr
nagao
um you know ah India Japan the
militaries are getting very very tight
and we doc simran Walia was talking
about the ah Logistics Mutual Logistics
agreement for supplies and services
between our two militaries and the whole
range of uh joint exercises that Japan
and India are doing is really
unprecedented I mean even five years ago
it was not that much so that shows the
urgency of the security environment the
deteriorating environment that we
perceive ah which we just spoke about so
ah and then there is also a talk about
Japan potentially also exporting ah
fighter jets and missiles or jointly
producing them with India unmanned
aerial vehicles and you know Advanced
Technologies and critical areas where
Japan has you know great technological
ah superiority so
um where do you see the defense
relationship going and what more can we
do together ah in this sphere ah apart
from the broader geopolitical ah
configurations which we spoke about let
us come down to more specific Japan
India what all we can do now ah in the
defense sphere
of course this is very development very
important development so especially the
Air Force exercises between two so it
was the first time for the two countries
conduct via Guardian which is a fighter
jet exercises Japan possessed American
fighter jet of course this is license
production so Japan made ourselves but
designed by the United States and India
possessed a variety of the fighters
including Russian Mage but in case of
the suhoi city this is the fighter that
China also imports from Russia or
developed themselves too so that's why
this is uh this issue maybe looks like
China's weapons from Japan so
in the Pakistan youth some American
fighter jet so in this case if Japan and
India cooperate each other
uh India can't train how to deal with
China American fighters yes right the
F-16 Japan F2 is maybe more developed
version of the F-16 but at the same time
to Country to Air Force uh training each
other in this case
how to deal with Pakistan F-16 is maybe
India's Air Force side can improve the
capability and Japan side of course we
need to deal with super excited fighters
of China in this case when we train each
other we can understand how to deal with
so this is a mutually beneficial yes and
on the naval side Dr Nago on the naval
side ah already we are doing more joint
exercises is joymex and ah of course we
are part of quad and then there are quad
plus and many other new formations in
the indo-pacific but in the maritime
Dimension ah what more you think Japan
and India can do as this you know the
Perpetual threat of China seems to be
getting bigger and bigger what more ah
your final thoughts on what we can do in
the maritime domain
in this case
if India in Japan or other German
determination like the U.S Australia
corporate each other for example the
sharing information or other
interoperability between the Neighbors
in this case we can do more to deal with
uh to
control the situation in the Indian
Ocean because for example that when uh
or where the Chinese summary operate in
the Indian Ocean if we can access a
database U.S has we can easy to identify
where it is more exactly and more
real-time
a real-time basis so that's why this
current with the type
military corporation so this is a
military beneficial so for India this is
beneficial for the United States for
Japan this is beneficial we need to deal
with China's expansion
uh and in this case China is not
friendly for these countries including
India that's why we need to take the
initiative to control the DC right in
this case a corporation they can get as
a big benefit for both sides of our
Indian side and or Japan side or U.S
Australian side all other monitor
themselves and like-minded Countryside
so that's why which the corporate
teachers and this will be beneficial for
Indian future absolutely so uh viewers
uh you heard Dr satru Naga talking about
so many dimensions where Japan and India
can cooperate intelligence sharing is
one and ah we need to have we need to
have a lot more ah real time knowledge
of Chinese movements in the waters of
the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean
and there is much that the two countries
are talking about it ah the level of
Advanced Technologies ah in order to
become inter operable and even
interchangeable interchangeability of
the militaries is the higher level and
even more advanced and interoperability
but we have ah you know a lot of
strategic trust with Japan and it
continues to build at the level of our
leaderships and also or the private
sectors and I'm sure that going forward
we will be able to ah implement this
vision of a free and open indo-pacific
based on common values of rule of law
and of not changing the Status Quo using
Force so ah I want to thank Dr Satya
Nago for sharing wonderful insights with
the audience for the Japanese
perspective it is very important for us
thank you so much for being on Indian
diplomacy
thank you so much
so if it was um you heard how Japan and
India are teaming up this is of course
the most important security relationship
in Asia and there are other players like
the US and Australia and asean countries
but without Japan and India as the two
fundamental pillars so we cannot imagine
any kind of balance of power or security
and stability ah in the indo-pacific and
in Asia so let's ah cheer for Japan
India security partnership ah this is
going to be very very vital for your
freedom and mine I will see you again
next time until then take care

okay okay
India is a very good name everybody from
Croatia wherever you say oh you're from
India welcome even the offers you for a
coffee also but today in India we have
about 100 peoples are came from India as
a research we are trying for the
students who get from India also in
Croatia as Croatia from their first of
January in Schengen and they go to Euro
currency also
so let us see be able to talk with the
ministry education ministry here and
with the principals of the colleges are
here they are all Keen to do this one
but we are still just now starting this
one therefore the students the first
Indian students are here
in Indian searches are here also there
comes and goes
now how critical is the kind of
community work you've been doing uh for
the people of Croatia as well
this is a local community decorations
they are very very interested in
India as I told you earlier there's the
sibling who own the family people the
traveling every year to India
to see India to see India College they
mostly go they said okay tourism here
they can go from Delhi other golden uh
triangle this is a daily Agra
Jaipur

all right we are increasing our society
members also so Society is doing a
good job okay I'm president of society
from last five years only

band of the when they established our
society in 1994.
so the local people that are just like
Indian peoples they are very uh they're
they're very uh but they make always
their host you very well they always do
a good job
to respect the Indians
when when they meet them here
language is a difference of course it's
a crucial language
but language is no problem when some
people like them mostly these days
everybody speak English young people
sadly
now all this community work must have
given you a lot of insight into the
Croatian socio-economic milieu as well
what commonalities do you see with India
where sharing experiences and knowledge
could benefit both the countries
as in accurations are a lot of they are
doing Innovation they have done in a big
innovators
he got a Innovative gold medal
in Hyderabad in uh
three four years back
they went to the Mount Everest
he said he went there two three times
so we asked always do the seminars to
tell his experience in India or he went
there and then he come back to the
delegations
the Indian partner and the brother were
mountains so they are actually what I
say now the in we're also in the
business houses so when doing the
business from last from 1975 the time of
yoga slavia but when we started here
when they came here so this is the
Croatia is now as a new European country
they came in 1913
and is the first country anyway in the
European Union who joined the European
Union in 10 years they are in Schengen
they are in Euro currency
so all this uh they said we fulfill our
all our uh
aims
these are the
they're doing very well the Indians who
come every time when any Indian comes
here
even earlier also
even today also have any Indian Province
here so Embassy and we have to complain
to the ambassy and Bessie always said
you can say please try to solve this
problem and go to the meet the people's
local
the owner of the company why they're not
getting the basis now this problem will
start from last three four years only
so they are very helpful people be
Christian peoples like buoya
now you did mention that you're the
president of the Croatia India Society
there in Zagreb what sort of work is
this Society or you doing in that
capacity to further expand India Croatia
relations especially in trade investment
you know and of even the movement of
people skilled workers uh uh what sort
of an activity is being undertaken there
apart from you know art and culture and
education
Society we are working in all fields of
in all fields to make a better relations
between India and Croatia Croatia and
India both sides India trade is a
very good
as it is a very small country as I told
you earlier this is tourist countries
and even a lot of tourists comes from
India also to Croatia
whether societies as we said you could
do some
[Music]
do some events on the tourism also
where the tourists somebody came from
come from Delhi from India on speak on
tourism
the Declaration
tourism uh papers
city city tourism directors of the
Croatian National tourism board so
always trying to get this together how
we can do the makeup buildup there are
more relations
in every seminar and this also here this
is the Mahatma Gandhi's birthday
this is the Indian Embassy and the other
things and if somebody can speak on the
Mahatma Gandhi's of Russian side and
from India side and there's a there's a
college indological College in Zagreb
which we established in 1962.
it was a very very long time their
people
understand Hindi they speak some
people's Hindi language also
So when you say speak something Hindi
you're surprised
so that was very old relations and one
of the in this uh Eastern Blog the only
one college in Zagreb The Logical into
logic
uh
1962. so this is the name of this Arab
and the endology college in Europe is
one of the European
uh a city named kams or India comes in
this country we always got this Indian
Professor London as a teacher Professor
come from India and give it
two three years right and they gave
their lessons to how to speak and learn
the Hindi language now background of
course everything concerns and today
even I surprised that last year came two
professors also
from Delhi so peoples are local people
young people are also very interested to
India to go to India to say India Indian
culture Indian religious multi National
Multicultural country or they are living
there
but there's a lot of things are
explaining them here
I'll I always take the if somebody sends
the seminar the first take the just see
the India how is India is doing you have
just to follow them something
of course you are in this Europe so we
will follow up Croatia is a very big
football players football team they get
the gold medals in
or silver medals in uh
football in water polo in handball they
are very good in sports
you'll be surprised that today our coach
Russian coach in Indian national team Mr
Igor stemas that's right they're from
last Tuesdays and brands are more left
and let us see what will happen maybe
India will join one day in the world cup
or in the Olympic games in football also
well that's that hope let's hope that
happens soon but you mentioned that a
lot of Indian tourists visit Croatia as
well so uh uh what sort of uh what sort
of infrastructure is in place to ensure
that these Indian tourists in Croatia
feel at home uh there are some Indian
restaurants for instance in Croatia
because uh that's what Indians miss the
most abroad you know their Indian home
cooked Foods
Indian food at least they do really look
for
this Indian tourism people as I told you
ghost people like from Croatia they get
a very easily visa from our Indian
University here for the Visa Visa
tourist visa to India they stay for two
weeks or one week
even today our this is a main person
from indological
Professor he's in India he having a
lecture in Delhi
yesterday even today or so
last 30 years all the investors we have
a very good relations with them I myself
personal relation personal relationship
with them
Society what we are doing here
and the same same like that Indian
investor to Croatia also as I told you
earlier also because we are doing a
weird thing we think the we can increase
more tourism
and more Goods with
uh India can India is exporting to
Europe
is a Croatia in the Eastern block of
Europe Russia is a very big Port Richey
and Reka is a destination for container
loading and doing the good supply to the
never countries even to to Slovenia to
Hungary to Austria even to the South
part of Germany
on the other side so it is too fast so
we are doing in all Fields as they told
me and also our aim is business is the
number one top authority of course the
culture and the other things also we're
going together as we are telling them a
lot of this function and events
they're very successfully and accepted
by the Christian peoples and the invite
the Indian peoples both have
and today we have from India about uh
more than about seven eight thousand
Indian workers especially workers labor
workers
but they are coming
Russia easily get them to working
working Visa for one year's time
but problem is the language here of
course
and then they were our workers they
don't speak English again they will be
problem the problem comes and we are
sitting here to solve the problem or we
can make it easy for the future
foreign
wonderful now you did mention that
India's viewed very positively in
Croatia as well but is it also seen as a
rising Global power which is also the
voice of the global South as it is uh
seeking to be while hosting the G20
Summit this year
yeah G20 now G20 is a very very uh
interesting India is hosting the all
these are countries in G20 and we like
this I told them G20 award is a very
good
but we can say logo or our m one Earth
one family one future
everybody like it here they said one
thing is a very good G20 okay Russia is
a small country
I don't know maybe he will uh they will
be invited by the Indian government uh
as a guest
but uh
other countries will come of course in
their sense and the z20 is uh everybody
like this as I told you the then the one
one thought to one family one future
know this world
earlier
so I hope this is a one of our foreign
minister is also coming to India now
soon
prime minister let us see what they will
discuss again will developer to
understand Shankar
yes Shankar is our foreign minister
we have a big diplomacy of course
background from English yes
Russia is a small country they are
opening their different schools or
colleges now
the after
94.95 so this is they have some lack of
diplomacy I can say with myself because
these words I can say our investor
cannot say these words
all right yeah all right yeah okay now
Indians as a diaspora have had a long
historical relationship with Croatia as
well croatians visited India as
missionaries first in the 16th century
now Indians also travel there for work
when Croatia was part of Yugoslavia but
what is the nature of the Indian
diaspora in Croatia now and how is it
contributing to the country's overall
progress
this Indian diaspora in Croatia is a
very last actually maybe we can say
about
[Music]
100 people
but uh with people who comes and goes
from here they're about 150 people then
as I told you the working class Who
coming here there about six seven seven
thousand people are here with me today
but we cannot say those workers are as a
diaspora because they're coming on
temporary correct
so even if I go back to it's known as
last year we uh print this book
cultivious relation between Croatia and
India
this book is so good that Croatian
India indological College
their professors
and their academics they write that book
organize
across the idea was of our investors
and then
organized by the or printed by this
Christian Indian Society right
so this has to start from not from Los
celtia it will start from 16 years for
15th Year yes yes
in 1782 which asked that Sanskrit in the
European language
but this is a urban National or other
national anthem garbage other people are
going to Christian uh
who write the
in Croatia this is a national song
national uh song
so he is also uh
convertible Sanskrit also we write book
India also they are writing okay before
we let you go tell us about the
experience of attending uh there was
convention in Indore I'm sure you must
have also been coming to India every now
and then so what are your impressions
that you've taken back from your latest
visit to India about its progress and
development
this is actually then up as I told you
that the last year there's no in
February
can I apply
to get this award
yes sir
you can apply why not
so after they are born the 24th I told
you he's always call me can you go to
India and if I speak of January um
I said yes
I said that I'm a retired person but who
will pay my tickets
to to India
is a silly question but I asked him he
said don't worry we will take you from
and we'll bring you back to zaira
I said or if you cannot go we'll
gradually on this okay
I said sir I will go
so it was a so great that I went to
India get my award
do not go to India so it was a different
story I did not know how big it is this
award for myself
yeah after 30 years a job doing all this
so what we mentioned earlier also our
society
as a presidential Society the founder of
society so
it was a it was a great to see indoor
and get this award and I think one of
our 27 colleagues who got the awards
they came to me to them also
the second biggest thing we have to tell
things groceries and people say I had a
lunch with the Prime Minister Mr Modi
foreign
was doing their
honestly job
they always need the honest person who
can only think about India thought we
can make the good relations in all the
fields not only the business business
when this is a one part
cultural meet with the peoples
so I think I have met here maybe I don't
know not hundred thousand but at least
400 000 people there in two Russia it's
not the last 30 years
so same thing was in uh at the time of
Jehovah's library before

this award and uh we hope that you do
much more in the coming years to further
strengthen the friendship between India
and Croatia and establish India you know

diplomacy a show on India's national
television channel do darshan about
Indian foreign policy India's
international relations India's Keys
strategic Partnerships with countries
around the world and also how India is
involved in shaping and remaking the
existing world order we was in this
episode we are looking at a pivotal
relationship of India with Australia
Australia India our comprehensive
strategic partners and the scale and the
scope of the cooperation between these
two ah vital near Ally like countries
continues to grow and become bigger and
bigger we're going to be discussing
Australia India relations with a special
focus on the indo-pacific and how these
two countries are able to shape the
Dynamics of this critical region and to
discuss this I have a very distinguished
guest with me uh in the studio let me
introduce you to her The Honorable Lisa
Singh thank you it's lovely to be here
Lisa Singh is the CEO of the Australia
India Institute at the University of
Melbourne one of the important research
institutions uh promoting the bilateral
relationship between Australia and India
she's a former Senator Minister and a
public figure it's such an honor to have
you here thank you it's lovely to be
here uh Lisa G the Australia India
relationship
you know it's not an exaggeration to say
that it's probably the fastest growing
bilateral relationship in our region and
I recall few years ago we used to say in
India that Japan India was the hottest
thing but now last couple of years we
have really made giant strides we have
signed our interim Trade Agreement ah
comprehensive strategic partnership
there's been upgrade it's all looking up
and so I'd like you to share your
thoughts you are in Melbourne and you're
in many ways giving the ideation to uh
you know Advance this relationship so
sitting there and looking at India and
Europe of Indian origin you've been
awarded prabhasi bharti saman the
highest Award of uh for for expatriate
Indians in the diaspora so looking at
India from there and now you're here as
well why is this such reaching such
stratospheric Heights and what is so
special about Australia and India
well as we know our indo-pacific region
is being reshaped and here are two uh
two partners Australia and India that
are taking uh the values that they hold
for the region very very very seriously
and for Australia and India their shared
values we have a lot of common interests
as two countries that really want to
play a role in shaping our region our
multi-polar region as it's becoming and
I think that's what we're seeing between
Australia and India two consequential
partners that want to come together and
really play an active role in creating
peace and stability and of course doing
that through building stronger trade
links our economic links you're referred
to through a comprehensive strategic
partnership but also through our
security
relationship as well and I think that's
the one that we've seen a really
heightened lift in in terms of foreign
policy and defense here are two
countries now that have a range of uh
military exercises and Naval exercises
Australia in itself is going to be the
host of exercise Malabar yes in fact so
there is so much for us to do together
if we want to share this this vision for
our indo-pacific region let alone how we
support and work with Pacific island
states that the small island States
asean we you know as two countries we've
very much strongly support asean
centrality I know that India's played a
strong role in signing its own
comprehensive strategic partnership with
asean so there's a lot we can do
together and that is why you are seeing
this lift between both Australia and
India because we have developed a really
trusted partnership yes consequentially
because of what we know is going on in
our region
and that is we want to see not one
country dominate the region but but but
like-minded countries coming together
through a shared set of common interests
and values such as peace stability
international law the rule of law and
that is what Australia and India uphold
absolutely the question for us in India
when we look at Australia also is you
know the
multi-partisan bipartisan ah you know
consensus about India that has emerged I
mean you've been politics in Australia I
mean go back 10 in 15 years there was a
sharp divide between left and right on
these issues about China and India but
now it seems like whether it's labor or
conservative or whichever you know party
is in power it doesn't matter they are
continuing to advance the India
relationship and seeing uh this it must
be you know very heartwarming for you
because you believe in this relationship
and you want continuity of this you know
strategic partnership going forward
absolutely you have not seen any change
in the strong australia-india
relationship under the Albanese labor
government in fact I think you've seen
an even stronger commitment to to India
from the Albanese labor government it's
the very first thing that our Australian
prime minister did after being sworn in
as prime minister was to fly to Tokyo to
meet Prime Minister Modi and other quad
partner leaders through that quad
leaders Summit there's been a continuing
growth between Australia and India since
the election of the new labor government
and I'm so pleased to see that that
growth continue of course Australia and
India today are are such strong Partners
compared to you know being on the
opposite sides of the Cold War blocks
some you know
four or five decades ago but feels like
ancient history huh ancient history but
of course we're in a new history now one
that we want to play role in reshaping
and that yes as you say has been borne
by the fact of some of the activities of
China of the dominance of China be it in
the Indian Ocean or through the Pacific
and through the Pacific Islands
countries so that geopolitical tension
has certainly created a stronger
Australia India relationship but I tend
to think that you know our relationship
goes beyond that we are two democracies
we we both have an interest in ensuring
that we create resilient Supply chains
that's been another consequential
outcome and that that's really important
very important for Australia
particularly when we look at the issues
that India wants to progress through the
G20 as G20 chair I know India can place
such a strong role as a leader and is
doing in clean energy Australia wants to
be you know partnering with India on
that looking at how we can create a
stronger renewable energy supply chain
landscape absolutely we've got the
critical minerals and I know that India
wants to do the the sort of
manufacturing to to make that clean fuel
happen absolutely so there's so many
points of convergence Lisa Singh is
talking about
geopolitical and Regional of course is a
very Central aspect viewers on this I
would like you to listen into the
foreign Ministers of our two countries
Penny Wong and Dr subramaniam Jay
Shankar about our shared vision for the
indo-pacific let's hear these two
important policy makers and continue the
discussion
Australia and India are comprehensive
strategic Partners we are
quad Partners we partner in many other
ways and most fundamentally we share a
region the indo-pacific region and
between our countries we span a great
breadth of the indo-pacific with our own
areas of deep connection and expertise
we've got a shared interest and we share
an ambition
and that is our region being stable
prosperous and respectful of sovereignty
where countries are not required to
choose sides
but make their own Sovereign choices
we don't want to see any one country
dominating or any country being
dominated
we both recognize our region is being
reshaped economically and strategically
and I think our partnership is a
demonstration that we understand that
this period of change is best navigated
together
I make this point for the Australian
government's perspective we can only
build and sustain
the region we want by working with
others including by working in
partnership with India and for Australia
this partnership is a critical part of
shaping the region we want I think from
what I can see the Australian view is
very much aligned with the tinking which
I have put forward
for me uh this relationship is
exceptionally important and I can only
underline that by the frequency of my
visits that it is exceptionally
important it would for us make a big
difference in the G20 in the quad
bilaterally and I think regionally as
well you know I'm coming here after
spending three days in Fiji so do bear
in mind that the India that I represent
today is also in India whose influence
and interests and footprint is growing
in the world
we feel we can be of uh of uh utility
and support in regions which may not be
that proximate to us so that too has
been part of my conversations in
Australia
so viewers you just saw the foreign
ministers talking about the region and
lisaji you are originally Indian origin
from Fiji and you know that's your
background and the Pacific Island region
is of course the backyard for Australia
historically and um
there is you know clearly Chinese
penetration of that region they're
trying to you know enter into security
packs with small island nations there
and essentially you know push out
Australia and the U.S from what has
historically been their zone of
influence so there is a direct challenge
there and here in India in our uh you
know so called backyard also in Sri
Lanka Maldives uh you know to lesser
action Bangladesh and the Indian Ocean
region we also feel a similar kind of a
you know expansionist uh Challenge and
in that sense our experiences are very
similar we are both trying to make sure
that there is room for us to have a say
and to have our own you know Zone where
we are influential so um you are you
know given your Fiji background and
given how involved Australia has been in
that region what is the think and how
can India come in you think you know in
this picture or or how could Australia
come in here
to ah Indian Ocean how could we what
would we do more in the Pacific Islands
and of course in the asean region where
we could complement each other's
strengths and ensure that as the
ministers were saying that no single
countries you know got hegemonic control
over this space
look I think this is where the
australia-india relationship can really
take off in our region because this is
where we can work both bilaterally and
multilaterally I know that our foreign
minister in fact has just been in Fiji
for the Pacific island forum and as your
foreign minister has just been in Fiji
for the world Hindi conference
two significant visits by both of them
because again it's showing a commitment
to to small island States not just in
the hard power areas of security which
of course we know is important
particularly when China is trying to you
know sign deals to to sort of shore up
resources and ownership of certain areas
of the Pacific but more in terms also of
humanitarian assistance of looking at
the environmental issues that face the
Pacific Islands Nations
these are areas where India is leading
the way the the solar Alliance that uh
Global solar Alliance India has led on
very important for our Pacific island
neighbors and I also know that India I
what I think there's something like 33
years since an Indian Prime Minister
visited the Pacific was the first done
by Prime Minister Modi in 2014. I
remember that visit very distinctly so
that that act East policy I think of
India really shows a commitment to
already to to to the Pacific and to
small island States and similarly you
see that from the Australian government
our foreign minister has had so many
visits to the Pacific and really said we
are here to to listen uh to not lecture
and to really be a strong Pacific
partner in the region you know we see
the Pacific island as our neighbor of
course in Australia so strong commitment
there but a lot more I think that the
two Nations can do together similarly
can also happen in in the asean region
some of that I think is happening
through the Australia India Indonesia
trilateral agreement Maritime very good
yeah exactly very major power to three
major powers in our region really
driving and shaping what this new
multi-polar region will look like
through Maritime cooperation and I think
similarly the exercises of Maritime
shared interests that happen through Oz
index and uh pitch black there are a
number of them happening between
Australia and India together bilaterally
are also really really important to
helping shape the region but also to to
sort of put out a message that these are
two countries that really want to play
an active role to create peace and
stability and cooperation which is what
we heard our foreign ministers are
mentioning there I have to say though
that in my current role post politics
one of the highlights was uh and very
early in this role was to host your
foreign minister Dr J Shanker at our
University of Melbourne and I got to be
in conversation with him at that very
large uh Forum where he made it very
clear that he said in the top five
countries that India takes seriously
Australia is right up there that's right
up there so you know we similarly take
our partnership with India very
seriously and we're seeing that not only
through through these sorts of formal
agreements through this comprehensive
strategic partnership and our new
interim Free Trade Agreement called ecta
which is obviously in Hindi
Unity right yeah McDonald's yeah so uh
you know very formal formal ways but
also then through these other mini
lateral or multilateral opportunities
through the quad
through trilaterals
and playing out through the Pacific and
asean and presumably these smaller
countries if Australia and India and
Japan for example or with the U.S I mean
in you know small groups they come in
and offer assistance support for
infrastructure or health care or you
know build uh you know projects or skill
capacity building those sort of things I
think we should That's the Way Forward
isn't it I mean otherwise when we say
the region we are showing up the region
it should have some concrete uh you know
basis to it and like you said it cannot
be just Maritime patrolling and Naval
activity we have to focus on development
of these uh small island nations
absolutely and again I mean I take my
hat off to India for playing a role
there that created that infrastructure
resilience for small island States
initiative iris iris again Australia was
was very quick to come on board and
support India with that because we know
it will develop that infrastructure
that's so much needed in in the Pacific
particularly when it's facing all sorts
of climate change outcomes through you
know the natural disasters of hurricanes
and Cyclones and the like so there's a
lot of work we can do that is capacity
building and there's a Japanese
partnership for Quality infrastructure
we have a supply chain resilience
actually in terms of concrete uh
institution building Australia and India
doing a lot you know is not just hot air
that we're talking about viewers and um
uh it's important to keep in mind that
this relationship uh also involves other
powers so let's expand this discussion a
bit let's hear from the U.S defense
secretary Lloyd Austin along with the
Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard
malzweather talking about the U.S
Australia relationship in defense and
how it's strengthening and it hasn't uh
you know it's it's tangential to what
India and Australia are doing and we'll
come back to that but let's see at the
tightening of the U.S Australia defense
relationship
United States and Australia have
long-standing ties of trust and
friendship and we're both deeply
dedicated to freedom and to democracy we
also share an unwavering commitment to a
free and open indo-pacific
a region where all countries are free to
choose their own destinies
and where States respect international
law and where disputes are resolved
peacefully without coercion or
intimidation
these shared convictions Run Deep and
they are the foundation of our
unbreakable Alliance
today the region and the world face a
growing Challenge from autocratic
countries attempting to change the
status quo
through threats coercion and provocative
military activities and even make it
aggression we're deeply concerned by
China's aggressive escalatory and
destabilizing Military activities in the
Taiwan Strait and elsewhere in the
region the Deputy Prime Minister and I
had a very productive discussion about
steps that we can take as allies to
enhance deterrence and strengthen
Security in the indo-pacific
we talked about enhancing our
interoperability
and expanding our operations
in advancing our ongoing posture forced
posture initiatives
in deepening our defense Industrial
Corporation
we talked about August
which I'm pleased to say has made
tremendous progress over the past year
we also had a good discussion on the
renewed importance of the trilateral
cooperation with Japan
it was a U.S Alliance System there's
been an effort to reinvigorate it and of
course Australia the treaty Ally of the
U.S and August the Australia UK U.S
military Alliance has also been newly
formed and is making rapid strides Lisa
in this context has been a lot of
interest in India about August and there
have been some calls even should India
join August what about Japan you know
should we all also come in there but of
course we have a quad as well and
there's some overlapping membership in
these two but overall the Australian
establishment and even public opinate
seems has moved in a direction where
they are in favor of uh strongest this
Force posture and security cooperation
with the US right I mean and that also
helps because India U.S strategic
partnership is also growing so in that
context how do you see our defense
relationship because it looks like
Australia is leaving no most stone
unturned like they have the old
historical you know U.S Alliance but now
there are all these uh almost de facto
Alliance like arrangements with India
now we have mutual Logistics agreement
our militaries have interoperability
we're doing joint more joint exercises
you've already mentioned so uh it looks
like they are clear about their security
goals you know and they are doing it
despite ah you know threats and uh you
know backlash in form of uh trade
measures and other things by the Chinese
so uh where does India fit in with
occurs and with Australia's you know
enhanced defense posture that we are
seeing they are also committing to
higher defense military spending as well
in the coming decade
absolutely I think one of the messages I
heard very clearly there from the U.S
Secretary of Defense was this shared
conviction for a free and open
indo-pacific now of course that is
something the US and Australia share but
it's also something that the U.S
Australia and India share so that is
where the relationship plays out at the
quad level for Australia of course
though we have a very long-standing
security relationship with the United
States that has been going for for over
70 years now but I think what we've made
clear is what we would like to see is
the US playing more of a role
economically in the region as well when
we talked about supply chain
diversification which I know is being
looked at through the quad this is where
India plays a really important role even
if we look back at what's just occurred
through the covid-19 pandemic India you
know was stepping right up there in
vaccine manufacturing yes there is so
many other ways we we want to shape that
free and open indo-pacific that's not
just your your usual sort of
hard security areas but looking at those
sort of environmental security areas
humanitarian security food security
many ways in which we can come together
in a stronger partnership that aside
Australia and India aren't setting sort
of sitting back and thinking well there
is all this other sort of architecture
in place we don't need to keep
strengthening our relationship we
certainly are and you raise the mlsa as
an example of that I think that can go
even further I think though on August
there's a lot of discussion at the
moment about whether or not we should
have India and Japan as part of orcas
orcas of course is a long-term game
whereas the quad I see is an alliance
it's it's a security Alliance but a
broadening out of that security
relationship of four like-minded
countries that can really play an impact
in our region today
orcas however has that longer strategy
particularly for Australia in terms of
our submarine capability having
nuclear-powered submarines is at the
heart of that orcas arrangement I know
that India and the US have a very
long-standing bilateral relationship you
know in terms I think when I look at
Australia for example I do look at the
U.S and India relationship and how the
diaspora have been very much part of
building the bilateral relationship and
that's something we can learn in
Australia of course the fastest growing
diaspora community community in
Australia is the Indian Dias it's nearly
a million people it's really grown quite
rapidly over a short space of time and
it's fantastic to now see just looking
at back at the 75-year anniversary of
India's independence our Sydney Opera
house lit up in the tri-colors same with
our old Parliament House in Canberra
something that Minister Jay Shanker got
to to witness
this is this is us really taking our
relationship seriously and seeing that
our diaspora can play a key role in that
absolutely so Cricket uh Curry and
commerce and then there's the diaspora
and then maybe in a negative sense also
China and there's so many others you can
add on uh last word lisaji on
um the future for India Australia you
know we are two important pillars to
make this indo-pacific become a reality
I mean it's a construct and if I'm not
wrong it's only the the very term
indo-pacific came from Australians uh to
start with about 15 years ago and it's
then become mainstreamed and we have all
you know
adapted to it so indo-pacific
Australia's commitment seems Ironclad I
mean they really and that's we are
suddenly finding that there is a willing
partner there you know and that's why
India is I think also warming up so much
to Australia so what's the future are
there any areas which I think are like
you know
critical for this relationship to go
forward in the region look Australia
clearly has a shared vision for the
region and that Vision includes India as
a strong partner you know we we want to
see economic relationship grow a lot
more than it currently stands we want to
continue our strong security partnership
we want to ensure that we you know play
our active role through other sorts of
groupings like asean through our Pacific
island neighbors and through other sorts
of trilaterals we haven't quite touched
on the India Australia France trilateral
which is another thing we are trying to
revive now after a bit of absolutely yes
of course Australia has a much better
relationship with France now under the
current Albanese government so now we
can really Advance the Australia India
France trilateral through again looking
at those environmental security issues
critical Technologies cyber security
there is a lot more that Australia and
India can do together and I'm looking
forward to that a lot more that we can
do together as sky is the limit uh the
Lisa Singh says and you know viewers
there is also lot of litmus tests coming
up uh the region you know we are seeing
uh unilateral conduct by China which is
affecting the sovereignty and security
of a lot of smaller countries and let's
hope that there is no big crisis over
Taiwan or over the South China Sea or an
Indian Ocean country which may require
military action but you can't rule out
and that will be ultimately the test of
all these key strategic relationships if
there is a big crisis how will Australia
and India stand up shoulder to shoulder
but we're preparing for it and I want to
thank Lisa Singh for sharing original
you know insights and for uh also for
the work that you're doing to advance
our bilateral relationship it's really
commendable thank you Dr challia so
viewers do think about this big
relationship Australia India we are just
making rapid strides uh and uh in a way
it's non-problematic there's nothing at
all which can be seen as a conflict of
interest between the two sides uh and in
that sense sometimes it's off the radar
because but quietly behind the scenes we
are doing a lot of work to make sure
that this architecture in the region for
indo-pacific is in place so that
whenever there is trouble or crisis we
are all prepared for meeting these
challenges I'll see you again next time
and until then take care

this amount of water and associate
professor department of public
administration and DM College of
Business and economics valega University
nickente in Ethiopia welcome to Diaspora
diamonds Dr ramble
thank you
and first of all congratulations for the
award now what were your first thoughts
when you heard that you're getting the
highest honor that the Indian government
can give to an Indian living abroad
and thank you so much for the message
really I was so grateful to government
of India and I feel so humble and
thankful for this highest honor real I
was very happy for this award
wonderful and how did your family and
friends feel were they taken by surprise
or do they feel that this is just uh you
know just Truth for your labor
yeah there are some mixed reactions
there are people who really know that I
deserve this award and they were happy
about this one there are people who are
surprised those who are following Mimi
from the beginning and how I struggle in
this environment and working with the
local communities they felt really very
happy and they they said that I deserve
this award yeah okay now tell us a
little bit more about yourself you know
what are your qualifications and what
exactly do you do in Ethiopia
yeah I I I started my schooling from
government School in Tamil medium uh in
government higher Secondary School
Parliament uh later I I came to madurai
city where I got my bachelor degree in
theater College
then I got completed my MMA in public
administration from Madras Christian
College then I moved to Delhi uh where I
did in jagalander University I did my M
Phil and PhD
and then I I came to Ethiopia and I
started my career as a lecturer in
oligar University later I promoted to
Austin Professor then associate
professor I am teaching public
administration uh in different courses
so you've not been in Ethiopia for that
long you mostly you most of your life
has been spent in India and then you
went to Ethiopia in recent years
okay you've got the award in the
category of community welfare now tell
us about your related activities in
little more detail as to what all did
you do as far as Community welfare is
concerned
um first of all my project is a team
oriented we are working together with
the local communities and the students
and different stakeholders we organize
local communities at the grassroot level
and we are doing a certain
infrastructure in the rural area mostly
in the rural areas it includes
construction of bridges developing water
spring
now we are doing the check terms as well
as electrification of villages also we
have will do one toilet in schools so
our projects we have multi-dimensional
project we work in different uh areas
OK and how did you find the funds for
all this work that you've done you know
as part of your community welfare
activities uh has have the funds come
from the communities itself or other
people pitched in as well
uh first of all our projects are
partnership oriented we share some part
from our side we the community shares
some part so most of the participation
the comes from the community for example
the stones the sand the wood the labor
force it comes from the local
communities what we share the factory
product like a cement and the Sun so
mostly initially I spent from my salary
but later I the media covered my work
and a lot of friends who wanted to
contribute last year Indian Embassy in
Addis server they mobilized 200 000
Ethiopians through the India business
forum and others they supported my
project so whoever support I I
acknowledge them in my social media
pages so now there are many people who
voluntarily to support our our project
but the main one comes from the
community for example electrification
project there is a One Foundation in USA
Archer Foundation it supports server
project now there are some individuals
come forward to support our project so
our projects are a kind of partnership
we share the materials I learned the
expert to work where I do the
engineering and the Machinery work
myself so like that we share the
um what you called the expenses okay
that's what and and has it been smooth
sailing throughout right from the time
that you started or have there been
challenges that you had to overcome
along the way as well uh were the
communities that you were trying to help
with you right from the start or was
there some initial skepticism and
hesitation and resistance too
since I come from a different country
when they you can see that the people
first they react you know kind of
suspicious but later you know after
they're seeing my the intention of my
work they become very happy
um
uh so therefore now uh the people are
feeling that very happy for what we are
doing we've of course we faced a lot of
challenges but later once the community
knows Our intention what what we are
going to eat they support us and even
they are more interested for our
projects
okay and and the work that you do does
it also involve you know getting Land
from the communities themselves or from
individuals in the community or from uh
different uh government uh bodies and uh
what is involved in that
so our uh we we are working in different
days with different stakeholders the
government has its own role in this uh
um projects because they are they are
facilitating our work uh because when we
go with the government agencies uh we
have different kind of responses so they
have different uh stakeholders but the
major part comes from the local
communities my students are involved the
very University I work with University
it contributes it share so we work a
different
um with the different stakeholders okay
and this work that you're doing is it
confined to the area that you are in at
the moment in Ethiopia Ethiopia or has
it been adopted in other parts of the
country as well
uh most of our work for example we will
see 93 Bridges 55 water Springs and we
have two check terms and toilet so most
of the work in one like a region where I
work uh it has four zones also we have
worked far far from where I am working
for example it is almost 2000 kilometer
far there is another region called the
South National nationality we have done
project there so our project goes in
different areas even very far from where
I'm working
and just tell us a little bit more about
Ethiopia in terms of why is this kind of
work really required in that country you
know building these Bridges these low
cost Bridges as well as these water
Springs and other structures that you're
building
uh but we have to stick the
socioeconomic conditions the topography
and where the people are living in
different areas that we have to take uh
basically it is a mountainous areas
Ethiopia means Highlands so the people
are living in a scattered areas uh you
have the a lot of mountains so if they
want to go from one Village to other
Village or one Village to neighboring
town they have to pass through different
Rivers so of course they are in every
day their activities they have to cross
over the rivers so that is the main
reason again the water Springs are
located in the horses where they are
collecting the water and drinking which
is not pure so therefore this kind of
locations need such a project where we
cannot do it a uniform project we have
to adopt according to the conditions
again when you are involving the
communities when you are enrolling the
people where we can share the expenses
the Grassroots level because the big
project the reaching that area it's not
possible at the moment so therefore this
micro project with low cost
techniques it will be more easy to
implement there and will be more helpful
for the people than the mega project
what we are planning it may not be
possible at the moment naturally now how
critical is the kind of community work
you've done for the people of Ethiopia
because even the citation says that it
has made a tremendous difference in the
lives of those communities
yeah it is a if you take every project
it has the immense benefit for the local
community and you you may see that
social media Pages however the people
have been appreciating our work uh
because
um for example if you take the bridges I
said before it's a mountainous area the
people are living in different mountains
so what they are producing the
agriculture produce they have to take to
the neighboring market so the urban
rural linkages even what they need they
have to buy from the urban area to the
rural areas the basic necessities I will
salt the rice whatever they need so
there this Bridges provides that kind of
connectivity because in Ethiopia three
or four months Heavy Rain season so that
time the water is Flowing full in the
rivers so therefore that time the people
couldn't cross the that Rivers so our
bridges now make it easy for them to
cross over the uh the the dangerous
Rivers Again The Childrens are not going
to the school alone the parents are
supposed to accompany them to the school
but the parents considering their
economic background they are more
engaged in agricultural activities for
other activities so the students
naturally not going to the school
uh so accessing to the Health Center the
religious place even for crazing land
taking their cattle to the crossing land
neighboring areas so it was so many
difficulties and another important one
somebody died to carry them uh in a
technified manner it was difficult
because of that one so the people now
using the river and the bridges carry
they are crossing the river easily
sometimes the wife is falling and
husband trying to catch them them and
both died the cattle died so so many
things has been happened yes and we have
a lot of stories about these things but
after the bridge we constructed now the
life become easy the children's are
independently going to the school
without the parents accompanying them we
gain the water if now the water is very
clean then no need to wait for longer
time they go easily Fetch and come back
so the time they save from there now
they can use for other socioeconomic
activities for their economic benefit
again healthy expenses before they used
to spend more they expect a lot of
health problems by drinking this water
which is not clean now that money they
can reinvest in other activities
naturally and these structures that
you're building such as the bridges they
are sturdy uh are they long term they
can stay in Place season after season of
these heavy Monsoon rains and not be you
know swept away and the need to rebuild
does not arise
we have a some of the bridges had some
problems we have learned lessons from
that Bridges so when we are going to
build the bridges we are looking for
locations for example this particular
Bridge you can see that the naturally
they had another place but for this
particular Bridge we change the
locations we have to see the Natural
Stone is there any good natural wood
which will support the bridge there so
like this we study the areas we discuss
with the communities the communities
also study which location is best for
this Bridges after we construct the
bridges we try to make some kind of
natural
um support on either side which protect
the bridges in terms of durability
we study the bridges which Community has
built before Natural Bridges only by
wood so that bridge survived for five
years or six years without any concrete
with any steel reinforcement right so
therefore when you compare that to
bridge our Bridge we have a cement steel
enforcement so there is not this bridge
is not exposed to the rain and the
sunlight so the tech is very less
therefore these Bridges Will Survive
more than what the community had earlier
had that Bridges so that's what that the
duration is more for our bridges
wonderful so your practically India's
bridged man for Ethiopia but do tell us
how and why you chose to focus on
Building Bridges water Springs micro
check dams another Community where Fair
activities and structures because you
are not an engineer Yourself by training
so when we started a master program in
our department so I thought my students
would have learning something more than
the other level students so I thought
Maestro's latest it some rural areas we
collect some datas without any plan that
we will do something some kind of
project so it's a kind of a data
collection tool so while we are going
some areas we found that there is a
small stream where elderly women trying
to crush and we see found very difficult
so I stopped my student look at this
problem it is very simple why don't we
build a small Bridge here and
immediately my students told her it no
no it is not easy here there are so many
processors so many problems is involved
in building like this I told no we need
only wood we buy the nail let us do a
bridge so we stayed One Day More and we
did a bridge and the people were very
happy and when we come back and we
shared the experience with our students
in the classroom the students were very
happy that we can do like this in other
places so like that we started the
project
um but I don't have a technical
background so I invo I I I took one
person who is an expert
but the cast he asking very high okay
and his timing my timing was not you
know going matching because I teach the
classes then I had to go to the project
so it was very difficult so I thought
why I don't learn this one then I became
a missionary then I become a the
engineers by self-made and I started
learning many things from the YouTube
and internet I'll watch so many
documentaries about construction
hydrology not only the modern techniques
involved even the ancient one so that
helped me I became very interested
also every project I am making I learned
from that project if there is a
challenge in first project some default
in first project then I try to improve
my second project so if you have seen
the sequences lot of improvement we made
with projects wonderful so powerful that
you could learn something new and then
implement it in this manner that is
helping thousands of people there in
Ethiopia and all this community work
must have given you a lot of insight
into Ethiopian socioeconomic value as
well now what commonalities do you think
there are between India where sharing
experiences and knowledge with Ethiopia
could benefit you know both the
countries in fact
yeah I have a lot of insight I I travel
mostly in rural areas I stay with the
people also the where I'm working and
that I can interact with intellectuals
also I have a connection with the
government team uh the those who are
practicedness so we have a lot of inter
interaction I learned more from them uh
even I I learned from the communities in
rural areas so that the culture wise
there is a multiculture between India
and Ethiopia uh in Ethiopia we have a
different culture ethnic groups the
language is a different it's a
Multicultural Society
uh also the people more living in rural
areas
um there are people dependent
agriculture more so our projects are the
low cost project
um where we are involving different
people the most of things we are giving
to the community this kind of practices
can be said in India there are
communities living in rural areas
instead of waiting for the big project
the mega project there are some low cost
projects can can be done it can serve
the purpose for the people so that way
that our experiences can be served in in
India elsewhere because it has produced
lot of results
um here in Ethiopia
okay great now you are of course one of
India's ambassadors there in Ethiopia uh
so uh you would be the best person to
ask how is India viewed in Ethiopia is
it seen as a rising Global power which
is uh also the voice of the global South
as it is seeking to be while hosting the
G20 Summit this year
uh India with the friendly countries
um the India Indians are highly
respected in Ethiopia and there are so
many International forums India and
Ethiopia supported each other in lot of
mutual issues concerning their mutual
interest
um again
when you see the G20 India has
contributed a lot in global issues not
only the global South even the world
lasts a large whether it's a climate
change a discernment or
counter-terrorism there are so many
issues India has done taken the
leadership role uh globally therefore
India deserves
not only the G20 team also the U.N
security Council the membership so the
not only Ethiopia there are many
countries supporting India stand because
it is a legitimate right for India to
hold this one today the world has
changed immensely and not is in 1948-45
but today the world has changed so
India's presence in everywhere right
contributions is visible everywhere
therefore
um therefore India deserve this one and
Ethiopia and India are friendly
countries they are always supporting
each other in every important issues all
right the Indians as a diaspora have had
a long standing relationship with
Ethiopia historically as well there were
thousands of teachers there from India
at one point of time just like yourself
now what is the nature of the Indian
transport and Ethiopia now and how is it
contributing to the country's overall
progress
a lot of historical documents available
um for example teaching profession where
I am there the Indian teaches a very
early teaching in the schools in higher
secondary schools whenever we meet some
elderly persons they used to recall that
with their teacher name and what subject
they taught for uh for them and how they
were a brilliant teachers and they were
teaching them the Ethiopian students
well so they used to recall that work so
that contribution that Foundation they
made is still is Remembered in in
Ethiopia not only this one the Indian
business
Investments are very high here we have
around 650 companies who are doing a lot
of work giving employment opportunity
for Ethiopians there are a different
field agriculture in other field India
and Ethiopia sharing
um
their experiences so therefore the the
diaspora contribution immense even in
culture uh there are a lot of exchanges
the yoga is a dot in here also the
Ethiopian Cinemas and other cultural
activities undertaking India so there
are a lot of activities are going on
between India and Ethiopia uh so
therefore the diaspora presence uh the
diaspora's contributions in Ethiopia is
highly immense that will be acknowledged
okay okay now before we let you go tell
us about the experience of attending the
prabhasivarti there was convention in
the world I'm sure you must also be
coming to India every now and then what

engagements at the top with leaders of
both sides the intergovernmental
consultations that we have has also been
expanding so ah
seeing India from your side where you
are in Berlin how does it look and why
is India becoming more Central to the
way Germany looks at Asia and the
inter-pacific in particular
so how Germany looks at India you know
it has gone through a remarkable shift
when we look at the time when Chancellor
Merkel was in power India was always on
the sidelines uh Germany's Asia policy
was simply put only its China policy and
all the other countries all the other
actors were on the sidelines this
started to change towards the end of
Chancellor merkel's tenure where
conversations about China became more
rapid more tense the debate on China
started becoming more sharp in Berlin
this really came to an uh to a head with
the coronavirus crisis where the image
of China really plummeted not just among
policy makers but also among domestic
publics that is when decision makers in
Berlin started looking at India started
understanding that they need to create
new Partnerships diversify away from
China and they started looking at India
in a new light this is really visible in
the Coalition agreement of the the new
German government even before they came
to power they had a coalition agreement
which mentioned two important things one
the dangers of reducing the dangers of
over dependence on China and two the
need of revitalizing the Germany India
partnership they mentioned that the
Germany India partnership had not lived
up till up to its full potential by now
and so the new government will focus on
that and we've seen that Focus
translating into practice the German
foreign minister Angelina bebok was in
Delhi in December last year and now
Chancellor Schultz is visiting it is
important to note the mea announced that
this is the first time a German
chancellor is coming outside of the
intergovernmental consultation mechanism
so the igcs for your viewer this is a
mechanism through which Germany and
India meet regularly this is the first
time that a Chancellor is coming outside
of these consultations in addition to
these consultations which really show
shows the importance that India has and
in addition to China I I have to point
out Ukraine is also a factor as soon as
this war broke out many countries in
Western Europe including Germany
realized how difficult it was for them
to create coalitions and get the support
of Partners in the indo-pacific and
that's when they realize that they
really need to invest in these
Partnerships uh particularly India
um and and increase their engagement
with with Indian counterparts so both
China and now the Ukraine factor is is
an issue why India is suddenly important
in debates in Western Europe but also
particularly in Germany yes and Dr Mohan
um on this Ukraine issue the German
Chancellor's security adviser was in
India and he was saying that we see the
world with similar lenses we don't want
war and we don't want uh conflict and
fighting and we don't believe in these
and we also have this shared approach of
multilateralism in our foreign policy so
in that sense India in Asia and Germany
in Europe do seem to
have very many common
characteristics isn't it and there are
similar types of powers both leaders in
their respective regions but with this
preference for multilateralism and for
resolving disputes peacefully and that's
I think one of the reasons why these two
seem to be so gelling so well isn't it
indeed I mean Germany and India do have
a similar approach uh support for a
multi-polar world uh support for
multilateralism India and Germany are
also working together
to ask for Security Council reform for
example at the U.N so of course these
are factors that are keeping both on the
same page I have to say Germany is a bit
more reluctant as a leader in its own
neighborhood
um India is more keen to fill the
leading power role uh Germany is used to
Leading from behind or leading from the
middle
um a lot of other European countries
actually have criticized uh Germany
particularly in their response to
Ukraine but overall yes there is a lot
of commonality in how we see the world
and our foreign policies and what's the
security advisor to the chancellor had
mentioned and at that point he said that
he understands the difficult
geopolitical neighborhood that India is
in and I think he was trying to draw
pattern is with the European challenge
with Russia and the Indian challenge
with China saying that there is a lot
for the two partners to talk about and
and uh you know they are in challenging
neighborhoods both of them absolutely so
uh much in common uh similar types of
countries uh with common Destinies that
have tied them together uh viewers um
the point is that the Germany India
relationship is grown in lots of
practical areas of cooperation and let
us look at a few of them uh Dr garima
Mohan already mentioned the
intergovernmental consultations so the
2022 igc prime minister Narendra Modi
was there in Berlin and he spoke about
some key areas that are of high
importance for the German foreign policy
and where they are cooperating with
India let us listen into this practical
cooperation agenda and continue the
discussion
Adam
Germany partnership
on green and sustainable development
climate Ambitions
and sustainable growth Article of Faith
foreign
foreign
foreign
so viewers you saw uh prime minister of
India explaining three areas in which
Germany and India are advancing their
strategic cooperation one is a climate
change ah the second is energy and the
third is joint activities in third
countries ah and on this there has been
progress also in countries of Africa
like Malawi Ghana Cameroon and also in
Latin America and Peru Germany and India
are actually doing joint projects ah so
coming back to Dr garima Mohan ah Dr
Mohan the thing is
you just heard the prime minister of
India mentioned the areas of cooperation
and why ah has climate change for
example always been an important public
policy you know interest for the German
government but what about energy and
Third Country cooperation these are very
interesting new ways in which we are
doing ah you know joint projects and I
think it's worth understanding the
reason why German and India are
partnering in this fashion
this is a new facet of our cooperation
and a very important one at that let me
start with climate I think climate has
been a central part of German foreign
policy but it is even more so now in
this new government with the Coalition
partners of the green party the German
foreign minister comes from the green
party and they have very clear
Ambitions when it comes to dealing with
climate change with particular Partners
India also has given a lot of importance
to climate not just in our national
policy but also in multilateral
negotiations in talks about climate
change India wants to take a leading
role so this climate cooperation is
crucial for the India German partnership
in addition to that Germany is also home
to a lot of companies working with
Advanced Technologies particularly when
it comes to meeting renewable energy
targets India has very ambitious
renewable energy Targets in here German
expertise German businesses are quite
important partners for India so this is
also a part of the partnership that has
become important and then working in
third countries that to me is the most
interesting part of this cooperation so
far which is not just working
bilaterally with each other but actually
taking our respective expertise pooling
it and taking it to third countries now
this is important because so far it's
only been countries like China through
projects like the belted Road they've
really been making inroads in Africa and
Latin America where there's a lot of
demand for new energies for new
infrastructure and I'm really glad to
see that India and Germany are working
together to fill this vacuum so this is
not just an economic cooperation it's
also a strategic cooperation
um filling in a vacuum where there's a
lot of competition now this is a space
where there will be competition and it
is interesting to see Germany and India
working together on these I was also
interested to see that in the statement
from the Ministries about Chancellor
Schultz's visit security defense was
also highlighted as an important factor
of cooperation I think this would uh
very much be talking about China as well
as Russia
and Ukraine between the two countries
and then of course I think we'll also
talk about uh the mobility uh agreement
and the need for young educated
professionals that countries like
Germany and in Western Europe have and
um are also looking to India as partners
I think the cooperation has really
become more broad-based in their new
areas both Germany and India are
um trying to you know explore and work
together on absolutely so the migration
and Mobility agreement is a new
development in the Germany India
relationship it has implications for
movement of skilled professionals on
both sides and for service sector ah
trade so this is also on the way up and
its a positive development ah but we was
Dr garima Mohan already mentioned China
and the China factor is preponderant in
the way Europe has been trying to
reappraise its approach to to Asia and
to the indo-pacific and John money is no
exception to that let's hear the German
foreign minister analina bear book
recently when she was in India talking
about the China factor and how important
it is and how China looms large in the
way Germany and Europe look at this
region and that of course has an
implication for how they view India as a
counterweight let's hear the German
foreign minister and continue
yes with a view to China
as our European friends we pursue a
tripartite approach that is enshrined in
our Coalition treaty as well
almost to the day we have been in office
for a year and we are pursuing a
strategy with three parts China is seen
as a partner in global challenges a
competitor and increasingly as a
systemic rival as well
China
has changed very much over the last few
years and I think the whole region can
see this and feel this so the exchange
with actors from the region is very
important to us especially India as a
direct neighbor this is very important
for us to
have a good assessment of the challenges
ahead we one of the newer points in our
China strategy
is the indo-pacific strategy we will
have more diversification in the
indo-pacific area there is huge potent
for German and European companies until
now we've been focusing very much on
China but there are also ties with India
and Japan but not so many with many
other neighboring countries and when it
comes to India we have both highlighted
that there is huge potential for further
cooperation both in terms of economic
ties but also when it comes to the
security situation
in Germany we have seen what it means
when you become strongly dependent on
one country a country that does not
share your values so with a view to the
political and security policy aspects
and developments in the region we will
closely cooperate with our partners in
the region
right so viewers um annalina berbock the
German foreign minister
calling a spade a spade and saying that
they see China as a systemic rival Dr
Mohan
um Europeans have juggled with this
dilemma for a long time and you've been
studying it how to approach the
indo-pacific there are a number of
countries that have including Germany
there are very strong economic ties and
even dependence on the Chinese market ah
over the years and yet the issues of
human rights in xinjiang in Hong Kong
the issue with the Russia Ukraine war
and the way China has been siding so
blatantly and openly with with Russia
all these factors seem to have soured
the mood in Europe about China is it and
therein ah looks like like you said
India looks so much more benign
non-threatening and more welcome and
trustworthy partner so how have how
would you see the evolution of German
and European approach approach to
indo-pacific and with a specific focus
on China
indeed the mood in Europe has definitely
soured
our dress for your viewers because it is
very apparent to me just sitting here in
Berlin how much the debates on China
have changed in Europe often when I come
to Delhi people say that Europeans are
not aware of the China Challenge they're
not critical enough they're still doing
a lot of business with China and I have
to tell you that the debates on China
here have changed remarkably so it's not
just
um you know Ukraine it started before
that it started with the issue of
investment screening saying that Chinese
companies are trying to get a leg up
over European companies there's no Level
Playing Field
um on crude critical Technologies like
5G the the the role of companies like
Huawei was being questioned it was being
seen as a national security threat and
then came the Ukraine conflict where the
role of China in tacitly supporting
Russia of course has captured the
attention of people but also so policy
makers are drawing a very important
lesson as Minister bareback just pointed
out they realized that they made crucial
Mistakes by being so dependent on Russia
for their energy needs and they said
that they are making a similar Mistake
by being so dependent on China when it
comes to the economy and market and
businesses that's why the number one
focus of these countries now is to
diversify particularly in terms of
Market access and companies to go out of
China either go away from China or look
for a China plus one model here
countries like India Vietnam become
really important Partners
um so a lot of countries in addition to
their China strategies are creating
indo-pacific strategies simultaneously
which means how to deal with China but
at the same time how to look for
alternate Partners so that they take
advantage of the dynamic and growing
economies that we have in the
indo-pacific where India of course is
very very important
um in yes Dr Mohan ah yes the
diversification ah in economic terms
makes sense but about the defense role
of the Europeans including Germany in
the indo-pacific there have been some
joint exercises they have done they have
shown a presence through by sending free
Gates and other things into the Indian
Ocean and South China seas and there is
the eu's indo-pacific strategy which has
got a strong security component as one
of the pillars so on that front I mean
some people are skeptical because the
Europeans are so far away geographically
and they cannot really project power in
indo-pacific and be a big balancing
Factor the way U.S is for example you
know so but France of course does have a
stronger military hand but Germany and
the the rest of them seem to be more
capable only in the economic sphere or
would you say there is also role for
them in defense and military cooperation
and joint exercises and you know show of
force that can deter you know Chinese
expansionism in this region
I think there is a limited role that
Europe can play on hard security and
heart defense when it comes to for
example frigates joint exercises yes
these are important symbolic gestures
how will they tick the scales
um in terms of power projection that is
still unclear so I think there are two
ways that Europe can help in managing
Security in the indo-pacific one is
indirectly one is by playing a larger
role in its own neighborhood with the
Russia challenge Europeans have realized
that they need to sort of wake up and
deal with their own defense in
conventional defense by doing so if
Europe plays a more active role in
protecting its own borders and
neighborhood that frees up the United
States to engage more with the
indo-pacific theater so that is one part
where Europe can play a role second is
of course these joint exercises and
particularly actors like France and the
United Kingdom that have presence in the
indo-pacific but I think the third and
most important role that Europe can play
is not just in terms of economics but
also in terms of Technology
infrastructure dealing with
non-traditional security challenges like
climate change which to be frank is an
existential uh threat to Island states
in the Indian Ocean and smaller
countries and we've seen that often
these countries have been ignored and
they turn to countries like China who
then come along not just with economic
investment but also political influence
often setting up basis in these
countries so they're having partners who
can invest in infrastructure who can
provide technological
um assets who can provide all of these
capacities it is important because it's
not just about economics it has a clear
implication on security as well so when
it comes to these challenges you know
the implications of economic Investments
when it and the impact of that on
security of strategic projects here
Europe can be an important actor and we
have not really utilized
um this aspect of European presence
investment capacities money to deal with
some of these challenges so I think when
we look at security more broadly Europe
in certainly play a role in in the
indo-pacific yes including the
non-traditional Arenas where in fact the
EU is the biggest investor collectively
in the indo-pacific region people often
don't realize that just if you add up
all the individual countries investment
so perhaps a more strategic and
consultant unified approach will help
although there are countries with whom
China has been courting in Central and
Eastern Europe and trying to form
separate subgroups within the EU and
divide the EU on this question and
weaken their indo-pacific Outlook so
last word Dr Mohan Germany Europe and
India a lot of positive developments but
like you said at the beginning maybe
unfulfilled potential also so any one or
two growth areas you think where we
should focus on more to help shape this
region Chancellor Schultz has already
said that he agrees with India's
external levels Minister Dr s j Shankar
that Europe should take the problems of
other parts of the world more seriously
not just be Naval gazing only internally
at its own problem so it suggests that
Europe wants to play a bigger role and
is Keen to contribute and help Partners
like India going forward
definitely I think two points from my
side to conclude this one would be a
strengthening our economic partnership
uh the EU is the third most important
trading partner for India but India is
only number 10 for the EU I think
um before we can get to the Free Trade
Agreement which is very complex there
are other smaller steps we can take to
attract businesses attract companies
attract investments in India and this is
uh this is a low-hanging fruit it can be
done easily and would immediately expand
the potential of this partnership second
I think Europe and India really need to
talk more about their own neighborhoods
and their strategic challenges after
Ukraine only did people in Europe wake
up and realize that India has a very
different relationship to Russia than
they do Indians have also been talking a
lot about their relationship with China
and Europe has been a little late to
understand that so I think uh given how
closely Russia and China are cooperating
it is in the interest of European and
Indian Partners to talk about their
respective strategic neighborhoods and
the overlap in challenges they see on
all sides absolutely so much to do for
Germany Europe and India viewers says Dr
garima Mohan and indeed there is a lot
of expectation on both sides that each
should support the other in their you
know crisis and in their critical
moments and we hope that we can do more
through convergence and mutual
understanding and deeper strategic
cooperation ah so I want to thank Dr
garima Mohan for sharing specialist
insights about this topic thank you so
much and thank you for your work for
promoting India EU and India Germany
cooperation
thank you very much thank you for having
me so viewers Germany in India are
upping the cooperation to higher levels
and it has implications because Germany
is the de facto leader of Europe and so
the entire European Union usually
follows the cues and the you know lead
agenda set by Germany and France if
already France and India have got a very
very strong Cooperative relationship and
now with Germany and India also get
stronger you can ah you know assume that
the whole of the EU will turn in India's
geopolitical and economic favor and
that's what we are looking for so ah
keep thinking about these shifting times
and changing Landscapes and how far away
countries can play important role in
India's rise I'll see you again next
time until then take care

[Music]
India's national television channel
about India's foreign policy India's
major strategic Partnerships around the
world and India's contributions to
Global good in the form of Economic
Development peace and prosperity
in this episode we are taking up the
theme of India's emergence as a leader
in the field of humanitarian assistance
and disaster relief hadr over the years
India has become a major responder to
crisis whether they are natural or human
made around the world with a great
degree of ability and competence and
also compassion and Humanity so we are
going to be discussing how India became
a leader in hadr and talking about
recent examples of how India has become
a friendly need for the whole world and
to discuss this topic viewers have a
very special guest with me in the studio
let me introduce you to him Commodore
Anil jaising
is a veteran submarine officer of the
Indian Navy he is Vice President of the
Indian Maritime foundation and a
prominent commentator on security issues
so welcome to Indian diplomacy Commodore
thank you very much Professor thank you
Commodore uh hadr uh is a field where
India has really shown its metal and
over the years we have honed our
capacities and have reached a stage
where we can claim with objective
evidence that India is a leader in this
field and is being acknowledged around
the world and so if you were to trace
the journey back and see you know the
major milestones and how we have become
so good at this rescue and relief and
Rehabilitation work around the world and
what are the you know unique attributes
that we India brings to the table that
makes us so special in this field
I think at the very outset ah are very
civilizational ethos of India lends
itself to this kind of a role as a as a
force for Global good
uh
we know what the G20
theme is
one world one family so India at every
stage I think has endeavored
to
provide the world a favorable
environment to be seen as a Force for
good and that is perhaps even when India
was economically not so not not as
strong as it is today we had just become
independent and the first two or three
decades also we were always able to
punch above our weight in organizations
like the United Nations when it came to
initiatives promoting World Peace So I
think that is part of our ethos as a
country insofar as hadr's specific
specifically
we were constrained by our economic uh
uh you know we were not rich we had
capacity constraints we had capability
constraints so we were always part of a
larger un peacekeeping Mission or a U.N
Goodwill humanitarian Mission and not
doing very many things individually as a
country except in an immediate
neighborhood I think the tsunami was
really the coming of age of Indian hadr
2004 and the way the Indian Navy reacted
or the government of India reacted I
think that really
stamped our presence as a country that
takes this role very seriously and a
country that is developing the
capacities and the capabilities to be
able to uh deliver when when uh called
upon to do so and that not only
established our presence as a
as a country which will always be
available for providing humanitarian
assistance but as a first responder I
think that was the first time that we
really were able to be First Responders
on a scale that was unparalleled at that
time in magnitude by anything we had
done before that yeah we Sri Lanka
Maldives Indonesia we covered all the
affected countries during the tsunami
despite the fact that we ourselves had
been ravaged by the tsunami we were able
to send with by by noon that day that
very morning by noon 21 ships 15
helicopters and a few aircraft had
already been dispatched and within the
next 36 hours more than 30 ships uh and
more than 35 aircraft with Medical Teams
relief material Etc had already been
dispatched to all the countries you just
mentioned besides offering assistant to
Chennai the andamanicobar island which
had also been devastated by the tsunami
so I think that really was awareness a
lot of international praise that was
that was like a you know
pivotal moment in the rise of India's
hrd that is correct yes missions and of
course subsequently we have done many
more ah there was the Libya operation
2011. uh there was the Yemen operation
2015 operation Rahat and many other ever
since covid-19 crisis 20 20 21 we did
many operations and missions around the
world so ah you can see how and we
obviously learn from the previous
missions and then prepare for the next
ones and that's I think been part of the
curve as we have progressed that's
correct in fact immediately after this
Boxing Day the tsunami was the uh you
know the huge earthquake in Kashmir
where we extended so much Aid to a
western neighbor who still seemed
hesitant about taking that Aid at that
time but I think yes all these all the
events you mentioned we've really grown
as a as a hadr power in the world
definitely so viewers uh the thing is
India has become a bigger player from
being a poor Nation with a lot of
Goodwill for the world and we always had
to arrived from the Korean war in the
1950s we have been involved in medical
assistance and evacuation efforts and
such things around the world but uh it's
only in the last two decades where you
can say in the 21st century that India
has really become a bigger player and
one of the most recent instances of this
which we just saw is the devastating
earthquake that shattered turkey and
Syria and the Indian operation Dost that
was launched was on a scale and a
magnitude that few could match around
the world it was one of the biggest
missions even though the ground zero of
This Disaster was 4 600 kilometers away
from India still Indian army and Air
Force and India's national Disaster
Response force all of them jointly did
this operation those on this I have a
interesting video where Indian army
officers who have been involved in this
are talking about how they did it and
what they gained what the local people
gained from India's contributions let us
watch them and continue the discussion
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
which is the first respondent for any
International disaster scenario so our
team consists of 96 persons in total and
we have
Orthopedic Specialists with us surgeons
GI surgeons Maxillofacial Surgeons to
take care of multi-trauma cases that are
expected in such a disaster scenario
[Music]
I must mention that the people of turkey
that they are very strong-hearted and
the community spirit that they have a
lot of volunteers have just poured in
from all corners of the country and they
are providing interpreters interns
nurses pharmacists doctors whatever is
required to run a facility like this so
I'm thankful to the people local people
also and I slipped their spirit I can
see it in the eyes even if they are not
expressed in the language that we
understand that they are grateful for
the services that we are providing to
them it is very obvious in their eyes
when I look into them
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I'm really grateful to them because they
are the first group you know arrived in
Scandal room and with a group of army
with a group of people and they actually
arrived in Adana Hawaii Mona first which
is a Providence in turkey and we met
them there actually it was sudden random
thing because I'm a group of uh
Rescue Team actually we helped team in
the field with the translation
so viewers you just got a glimpse of the
extraordinary effort that India made at
a time of deep crisis uh prime minister
Narendra Modi said we will do everything
possible to save lives and to help
rebuild the shattered societies of
turkey and Syria
Commodore we just saw operation those
and just the speed with which we did it
and you were all also talking about the
swiftness that is one of the specialty
of Indian hadr ah despite the distance
ah few hours the way we mobilized and we
had a complete You Know Field hospital
that we transported so Indian Air Force
Army all of them doing this together
together with some of our paramilitary
forces who are part of the ndrf now this
kind of mission is complex and the
number of teams that we fielded across
turkey and Syria was showed the scale
also you know so both in speed and scale
this seems like one of our best missions
and it's been widely appreciated so your
thoughts on how this happens and you you
know why is it that India is able to do
it while many other developing countries
of the similar you know scale uh level
of development and capacities are not
you know so clearly I think we are
better prepared for these and how how
have been how have you been you know
acing this so much
I think three or four things come to
mind when you when you see this this
particular operation that India mounted
this HDR operation firstly is I think
one of the best things that India could
have done was institutionalizing the
entire HDR mechanism in the country by
by passing the NDM the national disaster
management act followed by the setting
of The National disaster Management
Authority followed by the National
Defense management National disaster
management policy followed by national
disaster management plan which was first
came out in 2016 and was again revised
in 2019 so it's moving with the times
it's moving with India's capacities it's
moving ahead with uh what are the sort
of global responses required so that is
one aspect of it you know in fact the
global disaster management plan the 2016
plan was the first and the only plan in
the world which was in conformance with
the San Diego framework of the United
Nations in terms of disaster management
so I think that in itself was a was one
aspect so when you have this sort of an
institutionalized mechanism and you
exercise over the years with multiple
agencies involved you build up
efficiencies you streamline your
procedures and I think more than that
was one part of it the second part is
India over the years has developed the
capacities till a few years ago we
wouldn't have been able to airlift so
much so far away now we've got the c-17s
we've got the whole Master Hercules yeah
you've got all these aircraft which
we've got strategic airlift capability
we have strategic sea lift capability if
required uh the way we were able to put
the ndrf the Army the Air Force
altogether in a very coordinated manner
all these Peak volumes for the for the
understanding of HDR as a concept and
understanding HDR operations and
executing them efficiently this the 60
field Hospital the 60 parafield hospital
I mean they've transported a whole
hospital and I think another Salient
aspect of most Indian HDR operations
over the years in various countries has
been we have never sought any help from
the country we have gone to assist we go
fully self-sufficient and fully prepared
to set up whatever is required to be set
up to provide that kind of Aid they have
so many burdens already we wouldn't want
the local Administration to have to take
care of us there's a lot of so-called
disaster ah tourism that many countries
and ngos and all of them do and they
actually become part of the problem
rather than rather than part of the
solution during humanity and disasters
but India you are saying actually we go
self-sufficient and do not rely on the
hosts and they appreciate it because we
don't want to magnify their problem
they're already dealing with a massive
you know human human toll and suffering
as the colonel said in this in the in
the in the video they went with
everything they went to generators they
went with operating tables they went
with operational operating Machinery
everything they took with them they did
not need to resort to Turkish help to
set up a field Hospital there so I think
that's another great Salient point of
India's hadr initiatives the third of
course is it's it reflects India's
software diplomacy I think it's very
important uh we know we've not we've had
differences with turkey over the years
on various issues uh
we'll put all that behind us when
humanitarian assistance was required we
were right there and I think it's won
the appreciation of the Turkish people
most important our initiatives mainly
when the appreciation of people not so I
mean the governments of course do
appreciate it but at the Grassroots
level even the people appreciated it
happened the tsunami and it happened now
if you remember there was a photograph
which went viral on social media on the
Press where this Turkish lady is
embracing the Indian lady doctor yes I
think that's a medical career yeah that
picture doesn't speak a thousand words I
think it speaks a million words about
about India's efforts being appreciated
so I think all these factors have
brought India to the Forefront of
providing of delivering public goods and
you know even the foreign minister when
he speaks about these things he's all he
always emphasizes the fact that India
takes this as a very serious
responsibility India does not take this
lightly this particular role that India
is expected to play on the world stage
and I think it is it is extremely
important I mean I don't know whether
it's true but I did read in some
newspaper that Pakistan refused
permission for these aircraft to fly
over its airspace when they were headed
to Turkey I mean that's very passive and
that seems you know that shows a sort of
differences areas between a global
approach a big Power approach and you
know a small car kind of trying to get a
brownie Point here or there very much
and um Commodore you were you know
you've been in the Navy and Armed Forces
generally they are trained to defend the
borders and Maritime spaces and to you
know fight the adversaries right but
here hedr is a completely different ball
game uh where there's nobody to fight in
the sense there is no enemy but rather a
lot of people to help so ah when armed
forces our Armed Forces prepare for
these through training and through joint
exercises with other countries and the
doctrinal and the conceptual
developments and all these things you're
talking about the practice ah
how do you make a soldier
become a nurse and and do this you know
caring stuff when the soldier is
supposed to actually fight and you know
and and and and to hit back at the
adversary so isn't that also an
adjustment our forces do uh or how do we
manage these two contradictions or
seeming contradictions it does because
as you said armed forces are meant to
fight but you know over the years the
focus from Interstate conflict
has slowly shifted to a lot of
non-traditional conflicts or
non-traditional security challenges and
each one of these even even natural
disasters are actually a security
Challenge in a way because it makes a
country vulnerable to animal forces it
makes a it makes a disaffected
population I mean if you really see the
the root cause of piracy who's uh people
being deprived of their livelihoods
because of illegal fishing and so it's
they're all interconnected so you can't
take a non-traditional threat in
isolation and say we are only preparing
for this you have to look at the entire
gamut of activity and I think hadr
becomes a very important part of that
the world has recognized it uh the quad
had a signed an hidr agreement just last
year in November it's become a part of
maintaining a rules-based daughter at
sea and a free and open indo-pacific uh
it's a common pillar both with the
indo-pacific oceans initiative and the
asean outlook on the indo-pacific there
are four common features one of them is
disaster risk production and and risk
mitigation
and now as as ah as the non-traditional
challenge is evolving
non-traditional countering
non-traditional threats will become a
part of all major exercises even
exercises like Malabar which which are
purely Navy Navy and nothing else have
an hadr element in it Army exercises
have an hidr element element correct
India itself conducted a hidr exercises
last year called summoned by 2022 and
that's where the defense minister made a
very pointed statement saying that India
has shifted its focus from being a
relief Centric hrdr approach to a
multi-pronged multi-agency approach to
prevent mitigate and respond so it's not
just about responding now we are
becoming proactive in ensuring that we
don't reach that stage where the
disaster of this magnitude happens or
affects people I think over the years
hddr is going to become more and more
important climate change is showing us
the the fury of Nature and the vagaries
of nature and and what all damage it can
do and I think for a country like India
it's very important that this element
you know we are now we have become the
voice of the global South and I think to
be able to Champion the cause of the
small island developing States yes all
of whom all of whom are threatened
inundation if the sea levels rise we
have to become their champion and
reflect their position on the global
stage and and in fact uh viewers uh
prime minister Narendra Modi has
announced uh an initiative to provide
medical relief supplies to all
developing countries which are in crisis
and humanitarian and this is going to be
our my three ah long term you know my
three agenda ah going forward so on this
uh we did the exemplary work with hadr
during the covid-19 pandemic and we was
a Indian Navy undertook Mission Sagar
which is to support literal countries in
the Indian Ocean region with essential
medicines and food lets why watch this
video from the Indian Navy and continue
the discussion
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
foreign
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
so it was a stirring scenes of Indian
Navy helping countries that are in a
deep crisis during the first wave of the
covid-19 pandemic Commodore Indian Navy
in the ior region first responder and we
have cemented this position and our
ability to reach so many corners both
the Western and the Eastern end of the
Indian Ocean and to coordinate with so
many countries our ministry of external
Affairs the diplomats are involved armed
forces are involved civilian
Administration on both sides are
involved these are complex operations
and at the time of the pandemic when
you know countries were shutting down
borders and movement on Maritime spaces
that almost come to zero this was a big
crisis and we stepped up and through you
know Mission Sagar and our operation my
three and all these things so
um how you know have the has a Navy
reason to this level and you've seen it
over the years and there are many other
missions apart from this in recent times
um you know if there was a cyclone off
the coast of Mozambique the Navy is
there
Madagascar no it's Sri Lanka wherever
there is Calamity India is there and
that too in timely fashion so you've
seen this evolve so your thoughts on how
we have developed in this field
again it comes to a question of
capacities Indian Navy has always been
at the Forefront in delivering
assistance whenever required if it
earlier it used to be Bangladesh or
perhaps Sri Lanka or in our neighborhood
as a capacity is increased we've got
bigger ships we've got an LPD we've got
we've got uh large lsts as as you saw in
sk3 they are able to carry a lot more
Aid they're able to carry more disaster
relief but after tsunami
every Indian naval ship that sails
carries disaster relief equipment on
board it will become a standard
operating procedure across the Navy
over the years this has evolved the Navy
started doing something called Mission
based deployments that it which means
that at any given time there are 12 to
15 Indian naval ships deployed in
various parts of the indo-pacific who
are not only carrying out whatever
they're supposed to do their primary
role of uh exercising insecurity but
they are also able to therefore become
the First Responders when a situation
develops yes and this I think is really
uh enhanced a capability to offer
assistance when the when the Cyclone it
I think in Mozambique yeah he dies was
right there yeah she was the first ship
today and we repurposed the mission
because we were doing other training
exercises there and the ship was already
carrying relief supplies yeah so it
didn't even need to come back to a
harbor to take anything or or or load up
it just was there so I think that has
made a lot of difference to the way the
Indian Navy approaches it Mission Sagar
of course was a very very sort of
focused Mission uh I think India's covet
diplomacy as we call it has been a great
success all over the world not only
terms of Distributing vaccines but in
terms of food relief
Etc when when multi when the Maldives
desalination plant packed up it was
India which supplied drinking water to a
whole country yes and that what was all
carried on Indian naval ships so I think
the Navy has got a very important role
to play because for two reasons one of
course is the fact that
unlike land borders there are no
Maritime borders every country with a
coastline is a maritime neighbor
ah so that is one the second thing is as
a it is a it is a major strategic
Outreach in a way also because at Sea a
situation can develop so fast and even
if it's developing many hundreds of
miles away from your own Shores it could
say very fast we saw with piracy we've
seen it happen over the years so the
very fact that we have ships all over on
Mission based deployments doing this
keeping we are supporting uh capacity
building in all these countries it's not
just about providing assistance it's
about capacity building for them to be
able to escape calamities yeah to give
them that feel of support So this gives
you the kind of uh strategic leverage in
a way in a nice way not in a not in a
coercive way but in a in a more benign
way to be able to shape the maritime
neighborhood to be able to shape the
maritime space in our area of primary
interest India is the preeminent
Maritime power in the Indian Ocean it
has to at all times maintain a favorable
Maritime situation and be a force for
good in the region and for the region
and I think that is the Bedrock of prime
minister modi's Sagar Doctrine which
should not be confused with this Mission
Sagar which is security and growth for
all in the region absolutely so viewers
Commodore Arnold Jason says that this is
also strategic and indeed humanitarian
relief we do it selflessly because every
life matters and we have the ethos of
vasudev kutumakum but also in key
regions of the world where India has a
primary interest and which fall within
Indian sphere of influence India has to
be the first responder and it is doing
so ah with a great prowess I want to
thank Commodore anal Jason for wonderful
insights thank you Commodore for sharing
so much with the audience thank you very
much it was a pleasure thank you so
viewers India has emerged as a leader in
hadr and India is also training fellow
developing countries in HR practices
meaning that we don't believe in a
monopoly we believe that the do the good
things that we do should be widely known
and can be replicated and I think
there's no greater example of a good
Global citizen than India when it comes
to humanitarian disasters and crisis so
do think about India as you know a
friend in need and which makes India so
reliable trustworthy and wanted by so
many players around the world it
enhances our soft power as well so do
focus on the hadr capabilities of India
and how they bring all our abilities
into one prism and make the world sit up
and say here is a leader I'll see you
again next time until then take care

welcome to Indian diplomacy show on
India's national television channel do
darshan about India's international
relations to help viewers understand the
nuances and the in-depth knowledge
gained in that knowledge about India's
Foreign Relations India's involvement in
shaping the emerging World Order
because in this episode we are taking up
the theme of India's trilateral
Partnerships India plus two other
countries jointly teaming up ah for
dialogue and for activities and projects
on the ground to remake different
regions of the world and also to advance
their respective national interests and
to discuss this topic I have a very ah
distinguished guest with me in the
studio let me introduce you to him
professor harsh vipanth
is one of the leading Scholars of
international Affairs in India he is a
professor at King's College London and
vice president of studies and foreign
policy at a top Think Tank Observer
Research Foundation harsh welcome to
Indian diplomacy hello hello sriram well
good to be here Harsha when we talk of
trilateral partnership trilateral
cooperation its obviously different from
bilateral and it's not as big as
multilateral as in broader bigger groups
so and it seems like India especially is
engaging in more of these trilateral
formats ah lately so ah why do you think
this is happening and what how do you
see trilateral as a distinct category ah
if at all it can be termed so from the
bilateral and the broader multilateral
this has this is an age where
multilateral institutions are not
working and everyone is disappointed and
dejected almost by the state of disarray
that we find in our multilateral
Frameworks and trilateral cooperation
takes us Beyond just a bilateral
interaction between two states and
allows us to frame our respective
national interests respective uh you
know functional cooperation in ways that
perhaps would not be possible in a
strictly bilateral format now triangular
cooperation which used to be the which
has been the norm for quite some time
where you will you will have you know a
relationship where two over three
countries would come together and you
know deliver Aid or work on
infrastructure in in certain countries
that had been the norm in if you
especially in the developmental eight
areas but what in recently we have seen
is a strategic cooperation has taken the
has taken the focus as far as
trilaterals are concerned and that in
some ways the world is trying trying to
fill a void that is being left by the
multilateral institutions so when you do
not have multilateral institutions
working it becomes easier for
like-minded countries to come together
from ad hoc coalitions around certain
functional areas and that is I think
what many countries are trying to do
including India in the range of
trilaterals that we have you know
articulated in recent years and I think
it's likely that this is going to be the
preferred mode of cooperation for some
time now given where we find ourselves
in the inflection point in Global Order
yeah so structurally the weakness of
multilateralism is propelling this trend
ah but going back to the bilateral I
mean obviously trilateral builds upon
strong bilaterals among all the three
players ah so why not just leave it to
bilateral so why should we extend it or
take it to the next level of bringing in
a third player I mean let's take the
India France UAE for example that's one
of the major new initiatives India has
taken in terms of trilaterals now
already India has got you know strong
strategic Partnerships with both France
and with the UAE right so what is the
need for bringing all three and pulling
all three into one format rather than
just sticking to the bilaterals that we
have uh with each other
because I think the bilaterals in and of
themselves would not give you the kind
of Leverage that you want in that
particular geography or on on certain
functional issue areas so as you point
out India has excellent relations with
UAE and with France bilaterally but
those are then bilateral distinct
relationships if you want a regional
impact of your foreign policy then you
need to bring these stakeholders
together and I think that's what perhaps
India has been has done with France and
UAE in this case and with other partners
you know in other geographies and other
functional areas so I think
bilaterals and the way uh are solid
bilateral relationship evolves takes us
logically into the trilateral mode
because if you are dissatisfied with the
multilateral institutions and you don't
have multilateral institutions for
example at the moment if you talk of
indo-pacific we do not you know it's a
new geography group exactly so how do
you manage that that particular
geography so in that sense it's easier
to build on the bilaterals if you have
strong bilateral relationships with
partners then you can bring them on
board and say let's you know let's try
out and see whether we can work as a
collective on certain areas so I think
that that perhaps is the logic of taking
forward the trilateral engagements and
the rapidity with which we have seen
these trilaterals grow uh perhaps tells
you that that many countries find them
very successful in the short term in
bringing to Bear their respective
capacities so if you have for example
India UAE you have certain kinds of
capabilities certain kinds of
interactions and India France another
kind then bringing them together perhaps
gives you greater leverage in shaping
the regional security economy prosperity
and stability and one can also pool
resources and each country each player
in this trilateral format may bring
their own respective comparative
advantages to the table which makes more
possibilities viewers India France UAE
we have just been talking about it with
Professor
I have a video statement for you from
shravana barua who is at the Indian
Council for world affairs and I'd like
you to hear her view on the India France
UAE trilateral and the Diplomatic
energies that we are investing in this
and then continue the discussion after
hearing from
India France UAE have been engaging in a
trilateral format since last year for
the first time it met in July for the
second time on the sidelines of the
177th U.N General Assembly when it was
elevated to the ministerial level and
for the third time on 4th February
recently there have been many areas of
Corporation identified starting with the
indo-pacific where engaging with forums
such as Ira have also been kept on the
agenda there is also there are also
areas such as energy where solar and
nuclear has found Focus given that in
the past India and France have
cooperated over the international solar
Reliance the UAE has led Mangrove
Alliance for climate these areas of
convergences are seen as timely
therefore also timely is the fact that
India is leading the G20 presidency as
well as that of the SEO this year and
the UAE is going to host the cup 28. on
climate issues India has also vision of
panchamrit making it one of the only
countries to have reached or almost
reaching its Target in the ndc's its
concept of life has also been endorsed
by the other two countries therefore
these areas of cooperation are not only
seen as convergences but also seen as
action oriented another area of
cooperation has been startup and
technological innovation in fact a
startup 20 engagement group has been
introduced under Indian presidency but
it is also to be remembered that India
has been engaging with other countries
in such formats the Australia India
Indonesia is one example Australia India
France is another therefore we have to
see the trilateral cooperation between
India France and UAE as also
proactiveness of Indian diplomacy its
capability in taking multilateral action
and growing complexities in the
indo-pacific
so because you just heard from a
researcher at Indian Council for world
affairs about growing complexity in
indo-pacific and India's proactiveness
and she thinks that that's why they're
trying the trilateral Partnerships are
happening uh
India France UE we've already spoken
about the convergence but she was also
mentioning the ones that trilateral
formats we have entered with Australia
and there is one with France involved in
it France Australia India and it was in
trouble for a while because of not
because of these three but because of
extraneous reasons which the U.S coming
in and playing spoil sport on a
submarine deal but Australia is another
ah you know major pillar with whom we
are doing trilaterals Australia France
India Australia Indonesia India and
likewise we have with Japan as well
Japan
Australia India again this is the
so-called J Japan America India and even
Japan Italy India we have formed you
know uh ah trilateral so ah and all of
these have the indo-pacific domain ah as
their basis and like you said The more
of a strategic element is visible in the
way we are forming these groups and some
of these of course are intersecting and
some of these also feed into larger
grouping like quad for example which are
four countries not just three
um but all of them seem to have the the
Bedrock which is that we want to be
proactive in terms of forming these
small clubs or groups ah with specific
purposes ah we heard about you know all
kinds of things ranging from climate
change to Maritime security to ah you
know infrastructure there are many
initiatives these kind of trilaterals
are engaging in so what does it all add
up to I mean when we say they are
strategic ah we would expect that they
are generating some kind of public goods
for the region helping to do the
rebalancing that we hope will happen in
the indo-pacific and I'll ultimately
probably providing some kind of a
counterbalance to a Chinese hegemony and
domination of the region so your
thoughts on all these you know
combinations that we are doing with
France with Australia with Japan as the
other major pillar but then bringing in
other third players into the picture and
perhaps from the point of view of the
third players like let us say Indonesia
or Italy ah just to take two as an
example maybe it's more comfortable for
them to be part of these kind of
groupings rather than directly join quad
ah Indonesia for example would be
hesitant because of fear of backlash
from China directly so maybe trilaterals
also give you some degree of comfort and
cushioning and protection your thoughts
on all these things
uh yes I think if you if you look at
these variable geometries that are
emerging in in in the indo-pacific in
particular because I think there is a
there is a logic to the emergence which
is as we were discussing that look this
is a new strategic geography all the uh
institutions that we have in this
geography they were part of that older
framework through which you used to look
at this disjuncture between Indian Ocean
and Pacific Ocean now that we have
brought it together in terms of our
strategic mapping it is very important
to have these institutions that can
respond to those challenges and there
are none at the moment at that scale at
the multilateral scale so I think India
has been pretty active in shaping the
regional Regional strategic architecture
by creating these these trilaterals and
of course the the quad being the other
one and of course squad on two sides of
the indo-pacific one on on the Pacific
one in the Middle East but I think
India's role uh in in terms of bringing
like-minded countries together is a very
important I would say innovation in in
our strategic thinking and in perhaps in
also International institutional State
craft because institutions you know the
understanding that that students of
international relations have is that
institutions reflect a particular
convergence around issue areas and
therefore they are they become more
formal over a period of time generate
their own standard operating procedures
etcetera but what we are now witnessing
is that a lot of these ad hoc coalitions
are emerging I would say ad hoc because
there is you know you have these many as
you as you're pointing out a number of
these trilaterals and and a few
quadrilaterals emerging are across this
vast
geography so how do you respond uh you
know when you look at the Strategic flux
in the region you respond by creating
some kind of an Institutional
architecture and perhaps this these are
the building blocks of that eventually
what will emerge from this flux and I
think China's rise is particularly
particularly important because we are
trying to respond to it much like other
countries are and because they don't
have any other Revenue they are much
more as you point out much more
comfortable in this trilateral setting
where you can come together join hand in
certain functional areas you are not
defining the remit very broadly you are
saying we are going to work on certain
areas as I think was pointed out in the
case of UAE and France we are saying we
will work on energy we will work on
climate change we are sustainability but
of course there is a there is a there is
a comfort because all three countries
strategically look as Western Indian
Ocean as their primary Geographic domain
so they are comfortable in operating in
that space so therefore that brings them
together to work on broader ah sort of
more
environmental sustainable development
related issues similarly when you talk
of Japan and Australia I mean
bilaterally India is perhaps most
comfortable at the moment with Japan and
Australia and divided indo-pacific now
how do you you know enhance the ability
of these bilaterals to shape the
Strategic logic in the indo-pacific you
do that by bringing in more countries
yeah now the easiest way to do more to
do that is by trilateral Partnerships
which as you point out in almost all of
them either Japan or Australia is the is
our preferred partner then we are
bringing in other partners to add value
to to to that relationship so I think a
number of very interesting Innovations
are happening uh and and but I would I
would look at it as as perhaps India and
some other nations response to this
institutional void that exists in the
indo-pacific what do you do if you if
your multilateral Frameworks are not
working or are not up to the challenge
of 21st century problems so if you're
feeling the vacuum in a way
also is it observable that leave aside
the Jai which in in any way has been
subsumed by the quad now Japan America
India but otherwise almost all the
participants in these trilaterals are
middle to Rising middle Powers so
there's something peculiar about middle
Powers isn't it where we have strength
in numbers and we have to come together
and coordinate ah because ah
multilateral or plurilateral or mini
lateral ah is the way for Middle powers
to exert influence isn't it and it looks
like a lot of these are middle power
coalitions or clubs and ah is that also
you think you know something to do with
the International System because we are
aspiring India is aspiring to become a
great power or leading power as we call
it we have you know on the way but miles
to go so in the meantime ah if we have
to shore up the region and if we have to
ah maintain seed lines of communication
and you know rules based order and all
these perhaps there is no ah alternative
for Middle Powers than to come in the
into these small group groupings yeah I
think that has been one of the most
fascinating developments in the last few
years that middle Powers shouldering
greater responsibility for provide for
the provision of public goods and I
think partly I see this as a response to
the structural Dynamic of China's rise
but partly it is also the fact that I
think many of these countries are
uncomfortable with where or unsure of
where America is going so you know a lot
of you know in Japan and Australia have
long relied on their alliance with the
US and they still do but I think there
is there is some sense of vulnerability
that they fear and so they want an
endogenous in the region yeah it seems
that and that's why you see you know
Japan under Abe was one of the most
proactive proponents of of or you know
middle Powers working together he pushed
India much more into into indo-pacific
and thinking more creatively about it
and India responded similarly you have
Australia now uh you know Post Its
disjuncture with with China looking at
indo-pacific in a much greater detail
and its partnership with India with the
greater strategic focus and so I think
middle Powers now looking at
indo-pacific resident Powers there
looking at this region as their primary
area and also thinking about how do you
manage the challenges in the absence of
America's commitment which may not be
total yeah because America either is
distracted or the domestic politics
within America is such that you really
cannot rely on the transitions happening
there so how do you ensure that you are
on a you know sure of footing and one of
the best ways to do it is to find middle
Powers with whom you are like-minded and
converge on certain areas and that's
what perhaps we are witnessing at the
moment yeah and harsh one of the things
you notice also with the trilaterals ah
India is also doing some very unorthodox
ones ah in the military domain defense
for example there is the ah
excess sit Max they call it Singapore
India Thailand all three of them ah
forming a kind of a defense trilateral
and doing ah joint Naval exercises and
all that and so it suggests that also
um if there is no way for us for the
quad to be expanded or for more people
to come in but we will find other means
through which to keep these countries
engaged and uh involved in ah you know
security for the region so specifically
on the defense side you know people know
that all the other things we are doing
on the civilian side you know
infrastructure and
climate change and energy and those sort
of but on the defense side ah how do you
think trilaterals will go I mean we also
have the Malabar which is four countries
ah which is essentially the difference
counterpart to quad but then there are
also other formations we're doing ah and
trying to bring in more players it looks
like our diplomacy our strategy is to
bring in more player years and the
Europeans have also come in and this is
making it more interesting this region
the one with Japan and Italy is
interestingly Japan and Italy are now
ramping up their own bilateral defense
co-production and joint ventures and
they find India you know useful and the
Italians are saying that they will bring
in their prowess with regard to
operation Atlanta which they had done to
counter ah piracy in the Western Indian
Ocean and likewise you know so ah there
is this
um you know defense side and how do you
think how far can this go and do you
think this is enough joint exercises or
we should be doing more through these
trilaterals I think on the defense side
we are still ah you know maturing in
some ways we are still trying to assess
how far we can go with some of these
Partnerships but it is very important
because I think one of the biggest
issues in the region is perhaps uh you
know how do you make provision for for
regional Security in a collective Manner
and and if you see the kind of
challenges that China is posing
everywhere and if you see the the
enormous imbalance in the region
defense imbalance given where China is
qualitatively quantitatively uh
countries that want to protect their
sovereignty countries that want to
protect their autonomy strategic
autonomy will have to do much more on
defense because at the end of the day
India as an emerging power will have to
give that sense to smaller countries in
the region to to smaller Partners in the
region that it is there you know of
course as an economic partner but also
the security guaranteed of some kind
yeah you know we may not be able to do
everything on our own therefore we need
partners that can work together and
India has I think Indian Navy has been
very very proactive from from for a very
long time for almost two decades now in
reaching out to you know literal
countries in the in the Indian Ocean and
in in fact India in the asean groups
that you talked about a lot of the
countries do regular exercises with us
and I think that has evolved to a point
where you can expand into trilateral
engagements or even bigger engagements
of that kind which I think gradually we
are moving in that direction so I think
defense is going to become an
increasingly important component of the
trilateral arrangements that we find
ourselves uh you know pushing but it
will be all almost inevitable that that
happens because of the security
landscape and how that is changing
particularly in light of what what may
happen or what what happened last year
in Taiwan and how you know suddenly the
instrumentality of force is becoming
such a visible issue in global politics
absolutely unilateral exercise of power
is a major threat perceived by many of
these middle and Rising powers and
that's why they're coming together in
trilaterals and other formats ah viewers
so we also have trade additional
trilateral cooperation initiatives with
the countries that are not necessarily
only geostrategic and these cover a
variety of issue areas and on this ah
I'd like you to hear India's external
affairs minister Dr subramaniam Jai
Shankar talking about how India forms a
variety of Partnerships based on the
issues ah let us hear him and then come
back
the statecraft
here is really how do you how do you
manage contradictions you know how do
you have different agendas different
partners different abilities to to deal
with them and that is actually the
challenge for diplomacy now it is also a
particular challenge for bigger
countries because bigger countries have
more varied interests so when you are
motivated interest you have different
kinds of Partners now if you look today
at you know who are our partners our
political Partners our security Partners
our developmental Partners our Energy
Partners our digital Partners would all
be different combinations of people
so it's not just how do you deal with
two sets of people depending on the
issue you will get a different
combination of countries to deal with
the viewers you just heard this um from
our external affairs minister saying
that we deal with different combinations
of countries depending on the issues
harsh there is the older South South
cooperation based uh you know trilateral
formats which have existed for a few
decades now for example we have the
India Brazil South Africa ibsa ah we
have the Ric Russia India China now
these trilaterals ah predate the
indo-pacific ones that we have just
spoken and in many ways they were formed
in maybe the Halcyon era of the ah you
know South South cooperation when China
was seen also as a you know a middle
power and we all had something in common
we wanted to make the world better you
know revise the international order and
fair and just way and of course some of
those concerns remain we still on
climate change on trade and such things
we have a lot in common with fellow
developing countries so if you look at
those older ones ibsa Ric the those kind
of trilateral I mean we still have
ministerial meetings and so on although
we haven't had Summits in on this format
lately so how would you rate these in
the current ERA I mean where there's
more geopolitical competition ah would
you say that these have lost their
relevance Ric and ibsa and we should
just forget them and just you know focus
on the ones which have more strategic
content or do you think that those will
persist and those have their own
momentum with will have to continue
given that we have these what Dr Jason
calls varied interests on a range of
topics as we become a bigger power
see I think ah you know institutions of
any kind they don't disappear that
easily so they will persist I am you
know in some way but the issue I that
that I that I find uh is interesting and
important is that the present ones the
newer ones that that we have been
talking about over the last few minutes
they have a strategic logic which is
very sharp and very visible the older
ones like ipsor Ric had some broader
logic as you were mentioning you know
the argument that look we are all
developing countries we all need to work
towards multilateral reforms all of
those issues are very much alive but I
think the context has changed so where
China used to be a partner in terms of
asking for multilateral reforms in a way
that does not destabilize the entire
system today China has a very different
agenda similarly when you look at you
know Russia for example it's it's still
a bilateral partner for India but on
certain issues like territorial
sovereignty and integrity are questions
around whether we will be a partner in
that context so though the issues remain
which these platforms had highlighted
but I think that going forward
particularly with respect to China it's
very difficult to see how given our
present state of bilateral relationships
we can move forward because the newer
ones as we were discussing have a very
strong bilateral component that when you
are bilaterally comfortable with each
other strategically you can then develop
those trilaterals in a much more robust
manner here the problem is particularly
with Ric is China and how our bilateral
relationship with China is is almost at
a very edge standstill so what is the
future ipsa I think still is perhaps
very important one for India given that
both Brazil and South Africa in
different geographies as as fellow
democracies are very important part of a
very bigger conversation of a larger
conversation that we want to have with
the developing countries and of course
India that wants to project its the
voice of the global South through G20
would find that Brazil and South Africa
will be very important Partners in that
Journey because they have very similar
developmental strategic agendas broadly
but I think on Ric you would you'd find
that you'll have to think more
creatively as to what is the future here
of course it then also morphed into
bricks which is a much you know bigger
platform yeah I mean sometimes Ric helps
to moderate the Chinese I suppose
through the Russian you know
intermediation and such things but
overall ah viewers you just heard from
Professor harshmanth about these two
different types of trilaterals and what
he's saying is that if there is more
competition internally within the
trilateral then they probably will not
have the same kind of you know
strength to be able to achieve the
shared objectives but overall the point
is trilaterals seem to be the trend ah
in diplomacy in Indian diplomacy and
also for many other countries so I want
to thank Professor Harshman for sharing
doing very valuable insights on this
emerging Trend thank you so much for
being here thank you
so that's all this time viewers do think
about trilaterals trilateral cooperation
trilateral Partnerships are emerging as
important ah combinations through which
India is trying to advance its national
interests and also bring together
like-minded countries to remake Regional
and international orders I will see you
again next time until then take care
thank you
