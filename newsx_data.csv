UxPxUE_t1Is,Election Commission cracksdown on TV Serials after PM Narendra Modi Biopic,"Election Commission cracksdown on TV Serials after PM Narendra Modi Biopic - After Modi biopic, EC crackdown on TV serials.",2019-04-10T11:11:05Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UxPxUE_t1Is/hqdefault.jpg,"I'm breaking news coming in after the
movie biopic the Election Commission is
now cracking down on TV shows - TV show
producers have been issued a notice by
the poll panel which says these shows
are promoting government policies and
therefore are in violation of the model
code of conduct remember the opposition
has been crying foul for a long time
saying that the ruling party is
repeatedly and their supporters are
repeatedly violating the model code of
conduct my colleague panca joining us
with more on that story
punkers the Election Commission now
really cracking the whip first the moody
biopic now notices issued to TV show
producers as well since the two
television serials have also fallen
under the ambit of supreme court order
which clearly mentions that any content
which has political intent should not be
put on television in electronic media
both in the form of TV studios or in the
form of cinematography which is a
reference to the movies so Congress had
actually gone to the Election Commission
saying that there are a couple of
television series or soap operas going
on Indian television which purportedly
promote the policies by the BJP Modi
government and him so they had requested
that a clampdown shall return on these
two television channels taking
cognizance of that complaint and now
Election Commission has given 24 hours
time to the producers of those two
television series to come with a reply
why an action should not be taken
against them alright thanks very much
for that
Pankaj we also have a cinema on the
phone line please take us through the
details what are these two TV shows that
have come under the scan of the Election
Commission Congress on Monday moved the
Election Commission against three
popular TV serials and at least that
they are being used to promote Prime
Minister Modi's and his romantic in
Congress image campaign ahead also of
the Election Commission to register kiss
against the PAP and stopped at any cost
of the period
remove that in the movie and his
government schemes on TV but suppose
that the TV serials are very popular
amongst our viewers the first one is
Harvey G Carper hair and the second one
also is a very popular between de our
viewers and this is the reason that
Election Commission approaches effective
congress approaches the Election
Commission and now Election Commission
are both TV serials director to file
their response within the period of one
day
and by Election Commission also are
asked why you are doing this first type
of content then the model code of
conduct is there now they have to file
the RF life within the period of twenty
all right I had massages for all those

the bubbly hot dog with me is my senior
colleague Rashad Gulati and we're now
taking a look at the BJP manifesto
versus the Congress manifesto what the
BJP promises what the Congress promises
and where they clash where they surpass
each other perhaps now the theme of both
the manifestos in the eye is the theme
of the Congress manifesto the Congress
has highlighted its minimum income
guarantee scheme throughout its
manifesto while the BJP has stuck to
putting the nation first the nation
first is its agenda in fact the BJP
manifesto even began with national
security and if we contrast that with
the Congress manifesto it chose to put
jobs and farmers first yeah very obvious
Sonia is what they've been talking about
nation first is the message they want to
send out pretty obvious over there if
you move on to the through the second
slide here you can see when it comes to
jobs the Congress has been very
particular in specifically pointing out
that we will create 10 lakh panchayat
jobs we will fill 22 lakh jobs their
income into position there are line
vacant so they've been very specific in
creation of jobs directly by the
government's on our we don't know how
they'll do it but somehow the BJP is not
talking about at all specific job
creation by the government they are
talking about creating the empowering
environment through startup capital
loans expansion of the madras scheme for
MSM d--'s especially for women
entrepreneurs to get collateral benefits
to get guaranteed loans by the
government this feeds in the poverty to
the entire conversation of they want to
push job creators not job seekers that
in fact piranha wanna debate some people
might recall happened that look even my
radio varas have a job it's not like
they're unemployed if you're running a
small business that also qualifies as a
job so this is a more job creator
approach this is the job seeker approach
more direct more indirect next we
looking at Kashmir of course the
Congress has said it will review as far
as far as German Kashmir is concerned it
will not touch the special status of
Kashmir and the BJP has stuck to its tan
and it said that it will abrogate
article 370 to the null
25 years this is about as different as
you can get in the two manifestos very
specifically the communist is talking
about reviewing of spa reviewing of
suave cause means the dilution of a spa
it's been a long-standing communist and
the BJP of course is not the party
that's going to be doing a spy at all
there's no mention of a spy here at all
but when it comes to article 370 and 35
is specifically which other special
status articles focus Meade
the Congress is saying very clearly that
they will not interfere with those
they've been lying steady for seventy
years the BJP has had a long stated
position about article 370 when it comes
to 35 a annulling 35 is more doable then
actually doing away with article 370
because the constitutional amendment
acquired for this for 370 will be a lot
more difficult annulment of 35 a is
still possible in a code mechanism is
underweight clearly differentiated
positions on Kashmir the Kashmiri
parties both the NCPDP are very upset
with the BJP position they've always
been the simple question when it comes
to this is this is the old way because
Congress is again talking about three
interlocutors they've done that in the
past in Kashmir so this is the old way
continuation of more of the same this is
the new way which is better of course we
don't get absolutely now NRC if we look
at NRC the Congress's stan has been that
knows no citizen of India will not find
a place in the final NRC while the BJP
has said that it will not only complete
the NRC but also ensure that all the
states have NRC implemented in a phase
man so nobody's against NRC
this is the - stand on NRC this is the
hawkish stand on NRC so when I think
more cities of India because there's
genuine concern there's somebody lost
their papers are unable to prove their
identity it shouldn't mean that they are
excommunicated from Indian citizenship
so this is the software approach this is
been a major issue in the northeast both
ways people who are very upset with
illegal immigrants will come in and
taken over their states literally and
displace local tribal populations
displaced minorities over there and in
fact a lot of my majorities that have
been converted into minorities in the
Northeast versus the slightly hawkish
approach means not only to do the NRC
but extend it to other states remember
extending it to West Bengal has been a
huge debate point already absolutely and
then we look at citizenship amendment
Congress had said it will withdraw this
I entirely withdraw this controversial
citizenship amendment
as far as the northeastern states are
concerned yeah so amendment became a big
debate issue in the budget session
protests were held in Parliament but
when it comes to the BJP they are saying
they don't only enact it they're going
to use it to empower people like me okay
refugees their families who've been
living in India for the past 60 70 years
thirty sixty thousand thousand families
which have important rights they were
there saying then use that to keep them
right of course very contentious but
very different positions on this matter
next is the middle-class Congress
manifesto really did not find any
mention of the middle class as such
although they did mention that we were
the ones who created it and the BJP said
that of course VG's given tax relief to
the middle class so the finance minister
was out making a lot of issue about the
fact that the Congress did not address
the middle class at all in his manifesto
the BJP has addressed the middle class
by promising a tax slap change
remember what we saw in the interim
budget wasn't a tax slab change that was
exemptions basically going up to five
lakhs but as soon as you want five like
at one you pay the full tax so a tax
that changed many middle-class people
who've been paying taxes fewer taxes
this tax slab change has found a mention
in the manifesto the interim budget is
already happened so you looking at maybe
next year than here after that but
here's a here's the dichotomy not to say
that other schemes like infrastructure
at all that open development don't
affect the middle class they do but
directly for the middle class
there was this nothing much of the
Congress manifesto tax flat promise and
GST promise manifesto next is the ROM
month a ratio of course the Congress has
stayed silent on it no mention of the
ROM on there but of course the BJP said
it will build it and not only build it
but do it so building a ramen there is
always been the BJP manifesto nothing
new there the word expeditiously has
been added which would seem to indicate
that they want to do it faster ramen
there of course finds no mention in the
Congress manifesto never has it remains
to be seen what that timeline the BJP is
talking about now if it comes back to
power there's already a core process
underway there is a mediation process
underway so whether this expeditiously
will be through that process of course
the BJP remember including the prime
minister himself has accused the
Congress party directly of trying to
slow down through nefarious means the
entire core process so this feeds into
the argument but we don't have a
timeline but the word expeditiously has
been added and farmers of course the
Congress had made its manifest
the farmers at least it claimed it is
one of the most striking differences
between the two manifestos the unsaid
striking difference the Congress is
talking about direct farm loans making
that a civil liability which means to
make it a national issue then it comes
to the Indian taxpayer to deal with
civil liability that's what it means and
of course we having more farm loans the
BJP is not talking about waiving famine
also completely economic diametrically
opposite views this is this is the
giving away those view there's nothing
wrong in giving those two farmers the
entire world is door to farmers but this
is the tools of view the other view is
the economic view which is you increase
incomes of farmers therefore they are
able to pay off their loans they are
also offering loans at 0% interest so
not an old waiver but at loan at 0%
interest up to 1 lakh rupees for farmers
between 1 to 5 years
so completely diametrically opposite
approach is most apparent most most
obvious in how they're targeting farmers
well that was our analysis will be JPM

YouTube I'm the party hostel which means
my senior colleague which ability and
right now we're going to analyze of what
the BJP and the Congress have really
offered to the middle class starting off
with the reduction in fuel taxes which
neither the BJP manifesto nor the
congressmen email us and you've gone
through this Congress constitute amana
Festo and BJP manifesto if in the middle
class the BJP is of course saying that
the Congress has done nothing the collar
is zinc the BJP is there nothing in the
end when it comes to one crucial thing
about something that affects everybody's
life fuel tax is no one's offering
anything so it's not even a promise
forget that it's going to happen so
clearly if you're looking for a fuel tax
cut or a fuel tax rationalization it's
been a huge debate point in this country
for the last seven eight months nothing
happening on that from the power well as
far as a hiking I tax lap for all to
five lakhs is concerned Congress
manifesto far no mention but the BJP has
promised tax lap change a major issue
for the middle class didn't happen in
the internet budget the BJP is promising
in its in a manner in his manifesto the
Congress makes no mention of it now
lower GST rates especially on services
do Congress has now promised a single
rate GST Bandar the be rupees promise to
simplify it yes the middle class what
does it want
simplify GST especially for people who
are business owners and adding to pay
GST and dealing with a complicated
regime single tax rate would be ideal
but very difficult to do same logic you
can't have milk inverse and he start
targeted to the same tax rate that's not
being solved the tax rates have been
rationalized right direction is being
done so the bishop is offering to a
simplified GST this is anyway operates
in a Mecca GST mechanism through GST
council governments really don't have a
say but when it comes to
operationalization this is what the two
sides are offered offering on the GST
number four is a help with old low home
loans and EMI is no mention in
conference no mention in BJP this was
targeted of course in the interim budget
so if you talked of the interim budget
as a as a pretty manifesto of the BJP
this has been tend to be there but when
it comes to specific additional promises
nothing much either from the Congress or
the BSP when it comes to the home loans
or EMS next of course is education loans
and Congress has been promising a lot on
education it will behave interests on
stood
luhan's BJP nothing much on education at
least yeah so when it comes to education
the BJP has dealt with education but not
specifically education loans again this
was a matter dealt with in the interim
budget so again if you look at that as a
pre manifesto that's a matter dealt with
over there the Congress is of course in
his manifesto offering waiving the
interest on student loans so this was
another analysis of what the middle
class needs and whether the BJP or the
Congress have been able to deliver it
let us know whether the Congress and BJP
have had a hit here scored a hit here or

well absolutely to discuss and dissects
the picture peas manifesto ameen joined
in the studio by cilantro senior
political analyst stop moon so thank you
the BJP has released its manifesto the
trust really is on nationalism
nationalism first nation first is what
the BJP is offering in its manifesto
from abrogation of course from refusing
of course to obligate you know 370 to as
far as you know 35 a is concerned the
beach appease made it stand very clear
that they are going to these elections
with a strong nationalism which do you
think that it can turn Congress's pitch
of populism meenatchi after BJP
manifested is very much clear whatever
the from last 60 65 days matter exactly
from the 14th of February the movement
is going on as for the campaign if you
say in the vice versa in the sense of
patriotism nationalism are putting arm
in front of the row is exactly just put
it some drop line into their manifesto
because the entire is end up for that
particular man first loss would be
transfer into nationalism and patriotism
number one number two if you just talk
about from 2014 to 2019 BJP manifests
two three four things are common in in
2014 they are offering 10 crore jobs in
five years exactly in 2019 they are
again promising jobs for youth but they
are not putting their number number two
in 2014 again they are talking for the
Romani in 2090 member number two in 2014
again they are talking for the Romani in
2019 this line should be sail but one
more line has added because of the court
decision so from last 30 years if coat
is not into positions to give this
decision because of sentiments of to
community so I don't know and I have
this very strong because you know once
you are into the market people always
ask you what exactly you are delivering
as a practical situation for the
individual being of course if you are
talking about the GST and the small
segment businessman today we are
offering some pension schemes to these
fellows but you are you are actually
demolish their future for the your
Gabbar Singh tax number one number two
if after killing the people and you
offering some sales it is not a good
thing no more
number two digit is again asking for six
thousand for the farmer where two
thousand already they are paid as they
advance for first quarter so exactly
what is in de is coming with the round
and this for six thousand month to be
fair to the BJP they have of course
offered not the six thousand Yoli under
of course after one month we kiss on you
available so often you don't know
interest on loans of one lakh rupees
they have also offered doubling farmers
will come back 2020 what is the meaning
of no interest of loan for five years
because in one clear line they are
mentioning you have to pay your
principal it means whatever the loan you
are offering to the farmers you pay
principal every year if you not pay the
principal every year certainly you come
into the court matter is going to be the
game changers and my esteem could be the
game changer you think it is very
important because once they're all
Gandhi's safe from criminal offense we
we are we are cancelling this criminal
offense as a bank loan exactly what
visit is saying is it is saying we pay
one lakh rupee you you take one lakh
rupees and you pay zero interest for
five years it means whatever that 10
years from 2009 to 2010 comes right back
up to 3.6 La Crosse they are saying we
are going to increase education budget
by 6% laughing no one not even going to
cut any subsidies when where is this
money going to come from all people will
do go ahead and Meenakshi just give me
90 seconds without any interruption I
try to understand from last 70 years if
if corruption is enhanced into the
tenure of Congress along with the
development is also very much into
high-level number one number two if is 3
lakh sixty thousand crore rupees for
their nai schemes apart from in number
of revenue sources already generated
because if you try in BJP manifesto if
the plan Finance Minister is talking for
5 trillion economy in the next four
years five year so of course this 5
Korean economy is coming from where
coming from the people from India so if
me on is the Armour she only some part
of things
development so you think when the
finance minister talks about five
trillion economy when they speak about
this phenomenal growth which is see for
union the coming years using this
message may not get percolate it down to
the rural level you know voters end of
the day you feel the people are going to
see how much hold all I'm getting
yes it's because the minute see in macro
the opportunity of income is very high
you so ever the boys and girls just pass
out the twelfth are drop out until they
easily get a zorb into the VP or call
center for twenty thousand rupees per
month so they enhance their income the
same situation because either BJP either
Congress they both have the center to
enhance the lifestyle of the farmers and
enhance the living quality of the poor
farmers are whosoever into the bottom
line lower class of categories but yes
yes but but but but just try to
understand if as for the BJP manifesto
tea selling is a job she only it's a
business opportunity but the entire
nation cannot survive visit easily speak
about jobs and sort of you know joomla
isn't saying o BJP wants to make
everyone chive allows us to get
specifics BJP is saying as far as
enemies are concerned I think that
create more opportunities there will be
more jobs and as far as the Congress is
concerned the Congress has actually said
yes to be specific BJP says and
educating six large jobs in with an M
SME sector and as far as formless is
concerned they talk about about 20 lakh
vacancies which they say they will be
filling out so what do you think is
going to really win in this sector when
we speak about job creation a it is a
big matter of understanding who's ever
person come into that category of
self-employment or interrupt me or see
either this government either previous
government they have list bother because
they are exactly not the water into the
high high trend the target for any
government is the who are actually voter
who are actually going foot pole so
either farmer either the labor class of
people are lower middle income lower
income people are the the key segments
for the water water category
say either BJP talk either Congress talk
what Congress is talking he is not
offering a number of thing is just
offering three things to whatever our
Buzzard we allocate six percent into the
edge okay
if 6% yes please please please please
please please
as on date 1.6% allocated into the our
defense sector as comparison to our GDP
so if 1.6 percent is equ equivalent to
that much of things buying either they
are in process for Raphael either
they're in process of Chino either
they're a process of s3 if 6% budget
should be transferred into education
sector what is the future of our youth
right now the mood of the nation and you
need to see that is well sir and on that
point I'd like to of course bring in my
colleague uh Aaron dontoh who is joining
us live from the national capital or in
LA take us through what are the beach
with pasty prom this is as far as of
course a bit of nationalism is concerned
looks like the BJP won't ship Trump
performances populism with nationalism
in their manifesto starts with a
nationalism pitch and the focus of
course because made of beer Defense
Forces the focus really is the pride of
the nation
well there that's right you know if you
see the the manifesto of BJP in totality
there are certain issues in manifesto
which has been there in the 2014 so
there were slight changes which BJP has
made in 2019 keeping the elections in
mind as well as national security is
concerned that's something which has
been the prime agenda for the BJP
especially you know the the surgical
strike and the Bala Cote strike ever
since
BJP and their ministers and the leaders
have maintained this fact that wherever
they go they have to actually take this
thing forward and therefore this is
reflecting in the manifesto as well as
far as if you go to the to the second
level of the manifesto it talks about
the youth the development and that the
women empowerment these were these were
the agendas which has been the focal
point for BJP in 2014 and this time this
time around as well now if you talk
about the youths they have spoken about
the the facilities which they're going
to provide and some how they relate
relating it to the jobs because jobs is
something which has been either a bone
of contention
you know whenever the opposition has the
raise this issue that in last four or
four or five years government has not
managed to actually bring up bring a
bring up their job so that's something
which has been a problem area for the
BJP as well and and also they have
spoken about the farmers that how
they're going to take this for we could
at this moment you know all opposition
parties are really taking the advantage
of the situation that the situation of
the farmers in the country is not good
and therefore they had to come out with
something in their manifesto to actually
bring that logic of the opposition
parties down and as far as the women
empowerment is concerned that has also
been a very crucial crucial point and
they have mentioned it into it that
they'll they will have a reservation
beat is in the Lok Sabha or isn't the
assembly for the women and also you know
women's security has been the primary
gender for them so I think in totality
if you see the BJP is a manifesto you
know they have they have they have
maintained all those things which which
were there in in 2014 and spell
you know ram ram mandir and article 370
at 35 a these were the issues which
everyone was very closely monitoring
that what will happen to these agendas
because in 2014 these two these three
issues were at the prime focus in the
manifesto of but this time around
you know these these things have
slightly I know lost their scene in
there Mary pesto's so I think it remains
to this in that how it actually goes
with the voters well absolutely remains
to be seen how the Butte reporter view
both the manifesto of the Congress and
the BJP is focusing on good governance
nationalism and empowerment of the poor
on that note of course Aaron and so

going through cancer I realize that you
know there is something that we need to
do about it and so I decided that we
need to create an awareness that that we
should have get early detection done for
the simple reason that if you detect
cancer early there are very high chances
of it getting cured
as a life insurance company it is
important that we spread the message of
why it's important to protect yourself
versus future issue that may happen with
your health and of your life and that in
that objective we thought we must
participate and co-sponsor with this
event this is about building brand of
building awareness on breast cancer and
various cancer items and shifting focus

video on new sex TV as well as on our
YouTube channel I'm going through ad
with me is Rishabh Gulati we talked
about the possibility we are of course
in the thick of elections but we are
talking about the possibility if Prime
Minister Modi comes back to power what
will be his big ticket items to ensure
that India becomes the superpower gains
its space rightful space in the world
rich up the first thing of course does
come to mind is the 250 billion dollar
plan to of course revamp defense
purchases yes so for 30 years we've had
been in something what what is called
the befores jinx that nobody's wanted
want you to take on defense contracts
therefore the modernization of the Army
and the Air Force is suffered we've been
more or less successful in the Navy not
to the scale that we should have but in
developing our first nuclear submarine
in in in completing our triad which
means we now have a nuclear capable
missile that can be launched from Assam
bring so land air and sea we've been
successful on that so this is something
that has already been planned but it
hasn't been successful only in the past
six months you've seen developments so
late in winter we got the first batch of
the M triple 7 howitzers that are going
to be the upgrade for the Bofors gun
very important especially in places like
the around the LOC in Kashmir you've
just had the chinook aircraft that
upcoming we know the first row file is
coming in this year we know there are
another 100 to 120 for modern
fifth-generation aircraft purchases is
going to begin so when it comes to the
army when it comes to the Air Force and
when it comes to this Navy a quarter of
a trillion dollar defense modernization
plan it will be one of the biggest ever
in the world at this point of time is
going to be huge
the only other country that is spending
as much of more on offenses China right
now the Americans of course obviously
spent the most but when it comes to
defense modernization you're keeping up
with China this is going to be the huge
push it doesn't tell in people's
day-to-day lives yes but every time a
small development also takes place
you said alarm bells going in all the
normal global foreign capitals who then
start computing their games and start
treating you with a different kind of
respect
is going to change car absolutely and
beyond that of course also there will be
a push as far as defense indigenisation
is concerned against something that has
been on the cards for some time we saw
some push towards you know that factory
being made announced in MIT but more on
that of course is likely to happen this
day so again just in the past few months
we've had Larsen and Toubro they've had
their first self profile propelled guns
that have rolled out of the assembly
line for the first time so we having
some development is taking place to
convert the fifty sixty billion dollars
a year that India as it is spends on his
defense of course a large amount of that
is paying salaries and paying a change
Pingping of people but to convert even a
small percentage of that looking at a
ten fifteen billion dollar a year
opportunity in india it's a large
opportunity talking about what was a
lack of corrodes so defense
indigenisation maybe not in making
aircraft yet we are not there yet but
certainly making making equipment for
the army heavy guns light guns machine
guns all of that the time has come and
the Indian ordnance factories has been
struggling along that time is that time
is also when it comes to our super power
projection being indigenous which means
self-sufficient in at least light and
heavy weaponry that's going to be a huge
push you can take that almost for
granted and look at the amount of effort
that is being made as far as our
corporates are concerned there is aren t
there is Mahindra there is Tata all of
them are not putting a lot of effort as
far as defense is concerned absolutely
right so look they're making an effort
into it because there's money to be made
yes Goderich is in LNT is in of course
you had the the reliance on the money's
in he's facing currently troubles not
only in that a file front which are
political troubles mostly but also in
terms of his own companies but all the
big corporate houses are getting into
this space because there's money to be
made the american big defense
manufacturers some of the biggest
companies in the world they are the only
ones who can compete with the googles
and the Facebook's in terms of how much
revenue they earn so we're getting into
that space because there's money to be
made and for us it becomes a strategic
push because this year for the first
time you will actually be exporting
defense machinery and to us to become a
net exporter of defense goods that will
put you and plant you as much
superpower status as destroying the
messiah's or destroy the satellite
absolutely and apart from that of course
the next big thing is of course going to
be much talked-about much delayed entry
of India in UNSC is p5 you know there
has been a lot of talk about how India
missed this opportunity you know 50
years back but we need to look ahead now
you know this is what India deserves as
far as its rightful place in the p5 Club
and not just that extending it to energy
and a couple of other things as well so
we have already gone into the missile
control technology regime okay so that's
already happened that was a big
development happened in the first few
years of this last term of marrying the
remote e n HT Nuclear Suppliers group
yes we are almost there we are only
being stopped by China and the same
problem you're going to face in the UNSC
but what you've seen now is a much more
aggressive India when it comes to UNSC
the examine is the the example of that
is the ICJ itself yes there was an
election that was to be held the United
Kingdom was hoping to retain its seat
it's always had a judge sitting on the
International Court of Justice until
this time and we said no way we are
going to get the what we are going to
win the word and the United Kingdom for
Mirage backed off and they withdrew
their candidate so a much more
aggressive India at the UN it might not
guarantee you even UNSC seat because
again China is there do we do it but a
much more aggressive India at the UN may
be a revamp of the UN itself you know if
if there is no way to you know
supplement the veto that China has may
be in there's no reason not a debate
about a rely on you and you will have
friends in friends in France
friends in the UK and friends in a
Donald Trump White House to revamp the
UN in such a model and to reflect the
changed power realities of the world
which have to include India there's no
way around it so you've seen in
aggressive the the yoga campaign which
happened to the UN India is piloting the
first treaty to actually give a
definition for terrorism
so India's been on the forefront on the
front on the front foot at the UN you
can see it get more aggressive and
you're absolutely right in the current
regime of things you can expect in a
second term if a narendra modi comes
back to see a much more
aggressive push on this and as we speak
you know the next logical thing that we
can of course definitely talk about is
the greater push towards reaching out to
West Asian countries particularly Saudi
as well as you a we talk on a day when
Prime Minister Modi has been given the
highest civilian honor highest honor for
a reason because of the push that he has
made in the last five years you know
Trish up just one statistic I was
reading out reading earlier which said
that Prime Minister Modi has gone to ten
best Asian countries which is more than
3/4 of his previous periods or his
predecessors put together that is the
extent that is that is the strategy that
has been put together by the current NSA
and the PM it is also a reflection of
the times that these countries now
recognize India as a major global
economic player these countries are also
trying to now look beyond oil yes so
they need an economy that sustains them
after the next 3040 years went by 2015
when the oil reserves start running dry
exactly so these countries now need in
India that's why you've seen the Saudi
prince come to India we know that there
has been a lot of Saudi intervention
which for example in the in the case of
a Bandhan Wing Commander up in and then
helped him get get us back get him back
within 48 hours the UAE is the country
that's handed back Christian McHale
hardly what four months ago they've
given their even moody that that a war
just a quarter cup on yesterday that
happened we've seen other developments
coming on the UAE when it comes down to
Dawood and other other keep key players
so also the deeper economic integration
can you imagine any other country being
able to extract a currency swap deal
that you know be able to pay for oil not
in dollars but in the innaka which is
what we do with Iran right and we are
being able to make that balance between
Iran Saudi Arabia Qatar which also has
won one of our biggest LNG suppliers
where all these people Qatar is an order
Saudi Arabia Iran is at or to Saudi
Arabia but we have been able to stripe
that very well the only major players
that are involved in politics in the
Middle it Middle East or West Asia are
the US and China absolutely no one else
and now we are in so you have the third
big player the third big power that puts
you into the super power Club because in
these people
treating you as such because they reckon
out because they're friends of yours
they got they recognized you as a
potential in which is where of course
the next logical thing would also be to
talk about you know the space surge that
we have talking about you know yes it
was a huge achievement that Prime
Minister Modi talked about and also
really sets the roadmap as to what we
can expect in a second down now what is
throw has done and credit to you know
visionaries like Vikram Sarabhai who set
it up is put India at the front line of
space States the future of space is not
about big achievement of course there is
a u.s. project to reach Mars we have our
own project tourisme reach mass but the
immediate neighborhood of space is now
about cost efficiency yes India compared
to NASA is Rho is almost a third of the
cost per kilogram of what you put up in
space the only person who's doing a
cheaper right now is Elon Musk so you
are even in a privatized space industry
which you can easily predict over the
next five years is going to happen it's
row is going to be on the front order of
that so that's already been done so if
you if we've achieved so much with so
little expenditure if these focus more
energy an expenditure on that are
willing to take the risk of course
whatever is tates incremental it hasn't
happened in a year or five so if you're
willing to take the risk
devote more resources energy to it we
can legitimately both in terms of
defense strategic defence remember GPS
we all use GPS is owned and controlled
by the US military and it also is
extremely important in terms of
locations as well which is where of
course one can expect a lot more focus
because very simply when you conduct the
airstrikes in Bala code for example how
do you do it
you need satellite imagery when you want
to check how much damage you had is this
cloud cover you need infrared satellite
imagery imagery high resolution imagery
we have some of this we don't have
already a lot of this is so in fact this
launch the satellite hardly three days
ago which is one of the satellites they
launch is going to be for fourth for the
defense area for the military to
actually utilize it for these scanning
imagery you need the ability to not only
clean up space debris to take on take
down satellites not that you'll ever
have to use it but the ability that you
have just like a nuclear weapon you're
hoping you never have to use it but we
must have demonstrated ability changes
you're profiling when people are doing
calculations
China is planning to put up a satellite
from which they want to launch a missile
into India in the future they know India
has they know we can shoot it down so
that that gets crossed off their
equations and that's how superpower
games are played superpower games are no
longer played in terms of you have a 300
thousand army and have a foreign army
yeah it's it's it's about what is called
a force multiplication which happens to
the technology that globally one is
talking about is about climate change it
impacts everybody yes of course you know
there have been some very extreme
decisions and and positions that have
been taken by the West case in point
being Donald Trump but I think India
till now hasn't really taken a very
tough stance as far as climate change is
concerned or also for that matter a
demonstration of what it's willing to do
in terms of its bit as far as the threat
of climate changes so we've been despite
the fact that Donald Trump has done what
he has done and pretty much all but this
I said that the u.s. is going to pull
out of all sorts of Paris Accords and
all those things India and incidentally
China I remain committed to them so the
Modi government and and the JI regime in
China okay actually it's not that big an
emission emitter of the gases it is
actually India the u.s. then China then
it isn't so if you look at simple
profiles we have to name nail climate
change because the energy consumption of
the West cannot be matched if we take a
billion and a half people and give them
the same kind of energy per capita
energy consumption if we take card s in
great densities of 40 50 cars per
thousand Indians where in America is for
500 cars per thousand Americans so you
if you if you put ten times the amount
of cars in India you won't be able to do
it so this is something where we can
pioneer if we should pioneer and once
again when climate change is a global
issue and global issues are dealt by
superpowers yeah the small unit is not
expecting another badge on or some
country to be the pioneers in global
change even though some of them like the
Maltese will be the biggest victims
family should be one of the biggest
victims of Roman but a big country has
to take charge yes India and China you
can expect to take charge of this and
this then since we are examining what it
takes to be a superpower taking these
kind of responsible decisions then makes
you that superpower because the rest of
the country the smaller players then
look
to you and say yes they are
understanding our message and especially
a younger millennial generation who
think more deeply about climate change
than generations past then start taking
you more seriously exactly and I think
the other important bit when you want to
really be taken as a superpower is how
you engage with your immediate
neighborhood which is where of course
the the initiative that India is
planning those rolling road networks
those rail networks deeper water
linkages with our neighbors is going to
be very important look if you just
picture in your head the image of India
in the Indian Ocean right India
dominates the Indian Ocean which is why
it's called the Indian Ocean you
dominate the Arabian Sea that's where
all the oil is you dominate the Bay of
Bengal that's where the Southeast Asian
countries start you dominate the Indian
Ocean with underman nicob Islands and
your naval base is there you dominate
the choke hold of the Straits of Malacca
from which about dating 70% of the
world's oil travel travel through that
very narrow state so if you nail your
own infrastructural corridors you by
itself become a sub continental to use
the power of the phrase from the Chinese
a subcontinent over so you already seen
the Mumbai Delhi corridor Mumbai AM Taba
the antipas corridor which is being
developed we know that through a man
AmeriCorps adore is being built with a
northeast gun the Ganga river is now to
be opened up to trade a part of it's
already done it's not a it's not a
roaring success but it's a start so when
India itself becomes the transportation
hub probably look at deeper linkages
with Nepal the moment you have the
entire water in it yes so BBI n is meant
to do this but on Bhutan Bangladesh
India and Nepal is meant to do this
these are plans on paper which have
already been made but they haven't been
completed and if you want to create that
infrastructure hub you can create an
inter link all of South Asia morning
Pakistan into this infrastructural hub
starting with yourselves by creating
these seamless corridors for anybody
who's traveled now through the airport
or traveled from between Delhi and Agra
how much a transportation corridor can
completely change the economics of a
region because you can travel between
the cities within a few within a few
hours rather than a few days by train so
you can completely change the dynamics
and because of the India has a strategic
position advantage because of where we
are and the
you'd see cause we have China remember
it's seacoast is facing Japan and the
Pacific Ocean the hub of the new economy
is around the Indian Ocean not around
the Pacific Ocean Japan is in decline
and the United States will always remain
a large economy but the growth is
happening here so the in so the Indian
transportation corridor both internally
through BBI n is going to opening up the
Northeast opening up Lane Ladakh
they are going to be completely
transformative and maybe not at the
scale but certainly at the economic
potential or for the South South Asia as
as much as over a so I think the next
finance minister of this country if it
is from the Modi government will have to
find a lot of money for the infra and of
course for defense because you know that
is where the two areas and wait and you
can find the money because you can get
private sector investments things it can
be on build operate transfer models and
whatnot let's quickly the last point and
the last point of course is about the
soft super soft power that every
superpower needs we started with yoga
day last time around and I think my
senses Indian culture does bind with
every at any part of the world you're
gonna see more thrust so we always
ignore soft power but where does America
get its power from it gets his power
from coca-cola and McDonald's let's not
ignore that the pair of jeans that you
buy the all the American brands and
products that we are all in love with
from the iPhone onwards upwards and
downwards soft power matters let's not
kill essence you know has great binding
power culture whether it is a language
there is an instant connection who's a
culture how many of you know that you
know a concept of trance music began in
Goa India and it's now popular all of
the worlds that is soft power when
people are in in Portugal at the boom
festival that's Indian music that is
playing over there we don't know it we
forgotten it about that soft power so
you saw it with the yoga resolution yeah
that happened the UNSC yoga day becoming
an official global event and look at the
scale and success of that and that is so
that's an example of soft power so when
yoga becomes synonymous with India and
cultural recognition happens same with
food clothing fashion design language
music movies that is equally important
and let's not play down the importance
of that so you can see that ah if yoga
was the first few years you can expect
on these other cultural front
the second push to happen absolutely
those are of course some of the issues
that we feel that if both the government
comes back to power those would be the
clear roadmap to make India a superpower

YouTube we are back with the results of
survey number 14 of our news X Facebook
poll the first question we asked you on
survey number 14 was which seat do you
think Rahul Gandhi will give up if he
wins both via nod as well as his
stronghold of armaiti
and majority of our viewers at 71.8%
think that it is going to be Wayanad his
second seat gamble the second seat he is
contesting from Kerala will be the one
he gives up in case he wins both and he
retains he will retain his stronghold of
Amaechi the bastion of the Congress that
ahoo Gandhi has been winning he will
retain that and let go of wine ardor why
do you think Rahul Gandhi is contesting
from a second seed and that too from
Kerala majority of our viewers think
that it is actually to boost the party's
South prospects that is the argument
that the Congress is putting forward
that the Rahul Gandhi is actually
contesting from the South in order to
bridge the gap they say between South
and North India a major national leader
a major national space contesting from
the south of India will boost the
party's South prospects that's the
reason given by Congress however the
center and the BJP in fact contends this
argument and says that a whole Gandhi is
actually fleeing from his seat of army
tea because this time the people of
armaiti will not vote for him it's
Smithey irani is a mammoth challenge for
Rahul Gandhi as far as Amit he's
concerned he's afraid of losing 41 / 41
percent of our viewers will leave that
they say that Rahul Gandhi is probably
trying to cut his losses trying to at
least win one seat in case he loses a
meet he that is why he made this
campbell encourage kerala kada just 2.6
percent think that is the reason why
he's going south
sure india restrict prime ministers to a
maximum of 10 your tenure and yes say
25.6%
maybe say 23.1% for viewers know clearly
a no safe 46.2% know is in the majority
but if you do Club the yes and maybe
what's a measure many of
viewers also feel that perhaps 10 years
is too long a time more than 10 years is
too long a time for anyone Prime
Minister to be ruling the country that
the tenure should be restricted to a
maximum of 10 years and 46.2% people
feel that it is too short a time 10
years - perhaps implement reforms and
promise may deliver on the promises that
every party makes in their manifestos
now wish promised in the Congress
manifesto connects with you best is the
next question we asked you and clearly
what stands out over here is filling
government job vacancies and every of
our polls again again jobs is the point
that really stands out jobs is the
primary concern of the aam aadmi that is
very clear from these surveys minimum
income guarantee the Congress's
highlight of the manifesto the nice
scheme 30.8% feel that that is perhaps a
game changer for the Congress minimum
income guarantee is what thirty eight
thirty point eight percent of viewers
feel they have they really connect to as
far as the Congress manifesto is
concerned single rate GST is also
feeling to fifteen point four percent
the rest of the points like ten lakh
panchayat jobs an amendment of the aft
spa and a probe into the file deal are
not really concerns for the people
they're concerned for issues that really
affect them like an income a minimum aim
income and job and a single rate GST
what's the one thing then that our
viewers hoped from the BJP manifesto
once again over here thirty five four
nine percent of the people say it's a
clear jobs plan that they seek from the
BJP manifesto and nothing else in the
Congress manifesto to a majority of our
viewers said that the jobs plan the
filling the government job vacancy is
what really appeals to them and for the
BJP to from the BJP to they expect a
clear jobs plan twenty point five
percent said a middle-class tax cut will
be great and seventeen point nine
percent also interestingly voted for
Rahman they the fact that the BJP
has been promising a ramen there and I
out here that seems to be an issue also
for many of our viewers not many but a
considerable number of them 17.9% feel
that the ramen there should be built now
within one year of the BJP coming to
power
remember the ramen there has been raked
up again and again during the course of
the BJP scam painting it also in resorts
back to the Mun their issue clearly it
does appeal to a section of the voters
as well 17.9% is a significant number
compared to ten point three percent who
want to see a minimum income guarantee
or a fifteen point four percent who want
to see a safer environment plan now who
do you think will hold the key to a post
poll Alliance deal now interestingly
although West Bengal sends 42
parliamentarians to the Lok Sabha mamta
banerjee in case she is able to sweep
these elections and win the maximum
seats from West Bengal she will actually
be the one who holds the key to the
Alliance but our viewers think otherwise
they say thirty five point nine percent
at least voted in favor of Chandrababu
Naidu Andhra Pradesh since twenty five
has twenty five looks of our seats
Mamta Banerjee's Bengal has 42 like we
just said thirty three point three
percent feel Mamata Banerjee will be the
kingmaker or the Queen maker in this
case Naveen but night's Odisha 21 seats
from Odisha for the looks of her and
15.4%
feel Naveen Patnaik a might hold a post
poll Alliance deal and as far as Naveen
Patnaik is concerned he has not really
extended a hand of support to the
mahogany bantha and he's kept his
distance from all those alliance talks
so there is a thinking that he might be
swaying and tipping more favorably
towards the BJP and perhaps he may join
an indie alliance of course all this
remains to be seen
so an HD Kumaraswamy in Sitaram Yechury
have just 7.7 percent of the votes
who do you think is more likely to
deliver on their manifesto promises
predominantly in fact it's a close
contest as far as this question is
concerned forty six point two percent of
our viewers feel that in the
Modi will be the one who delivers on the
manifesto promises Rahul Gandhi 38.5%
now this is a close contest on many of
the questions there's a stark contrast
between the boat votes polled by Modi
and the votes polled by Rahul Gandhi but
over here as far as manifesto promises
are concerned both of them come quite
close to each other month of energy 5.1
percent nodulation up 2.6 percent Arvind
Kejriwal seven point seven percent so
really if we compare them to Modi and
Rahu's figures they don't really count
who do you think would the better who
would be the better Prime Minister to
run a coalition government and although
the Prime Minister is viewed as a more
decisive and a man one-man show who runs
the government that is the perception
forty eight point seven percent of the
people have said that morena Modi will
be the best candidate to run a coalition
government
next is Chandrababu Naidu at twenty
three point one percent of the woods and
Rahul Gandhi gets seventeen point nine
percent of the votes many of our viewers
don't feel that seven Rahul Gandhi has
the power in him has that ability in him
to make a coalition government stick
mamatha just two point six percent of
kulish again just seven point seven
percent would a maximum of ten year
terms for Prime Minister's help them
reform India faster was another question
we asked you and once again yes said
thirty three point three percent of our
viewers know said thirty five point nine
percent maybe twelve point eight percent
and can't say was seventeen point nine
percent would maximum ten years terms
for Prime Minister has helped them
reform India faster was the question and
so clearly the yeses and the maybe is a
come do outweigh the number of knows at
thirty five point nine percent a maximum
of ten years may be needed for the Prime
Minister's to implement the party's
manifesto promises that is probably the
thinking over here and no said thirty
five point nine percent of the people
who perhaps feel that a maximum of ten
years is not required if you
do have the will and we do have the
capability you can deliver on the
promises that you have made in the
five-year minimum term that is given to
you by the people's mandate now sure
Prime Minister Modi spent less time in
campaigning in state polls if he wins a
second term yes sir thirty-five 38.5% a
little less said 28.2% sir
a lot less time the Prime Minister needs
to spend campaigning in staples if he
wins a second term that is a majority of
our viewers feel that the Prime Minister
should really cut down on all those
campaigning 'he's a little less a 28.2%
no clearly say twelve Cuevas and the
Prime Minister should be in pole mode

does come back to power so these were

this is going to be a rule is that the
Congress will appeal to the to the
Election Commission they think that this
is a reason for the reason why they were
raising objections against the movie
biopic is that that movie government is
trying to extract political mileage out
of this particular movie and the fact is
that of this relief of oil being one of
the star campaigner okay alright we try
and connect with British in a bit but as
I said Vivek Oberoi's recent movie a
biopic on Prime Minister Modi's life is
mire and controversy opposition has
asked for it to be pushed after
elections they've reached out to the
Election Commission they've reached out
to the course as of now there is no stay
on the movie though on Monday Supreme
Court would hear another petition having
said that if we make over I campaigns
for the BJP they will of course be
intense and sharp criticism that will
come in from the opposition rank as well
he's a film star he hasn't yet of course
joined the BJP until now he is all along
maintained that this is just a regular
movie any other movie just like any
other movie as far as moody biopic is
concerned okay
I believe Jason's back with us Rajesh is
my voice reaching you
go ahead finish the point that you were
making this is a reason why the Congress
party will are now of course they are
likely to oppose the Election Commission
they will say that shows that there's
merit in delegation with the eleven
again the release of Modi biopic and it
is me shown in the first act vivek
oberoi is one of the - peel off and part
of the BJP some other interesting thing
in the list is that apart from the usual
suspect original who is the Emperor MC
of the BJP and who is not getting
tickets also contest local election this
side is also one of the star campaigner
so it is particularly moving in the dark
and perilous is indeed extremely
interesting so the children vivek oberoi
I'm sorry showers are going to be one of
the two squash campaigner is the list
full canvass and see for for the BJP
member table absolutely but it's as I
said named number forty the last name on
that list of stock campaigners that's
raising many eyebrows one can only
anticipate that the Congress the
opposition would try and once again
reach out to the Election Commission
reach out to the costs in fact you know
as we speak a British though there is
more stay on the movie another petition
will in fact be heard on Monday by by
the court can anticipate to come in for
this movie in the you know let me ask
you this question also that you know if
one if one were to be very brutal II
honest about Vivek Oberoi's Bollywood
career in the last couple of years
one may just you know wonder as to what
kind of tracks
he has if you take away moody bio baker
from vivek oberoi well I think the fact
of the matter is that you know that
since the movie the possible this is
what is being said if they're the main
focus of the movie is to make sure that
the media is able to get a decent degree
of traction limited time frame is you're
talking about this book I like you know
that this particular movies gotta be a
self plastic or not it's a very limited
month and a half angle timeframe which
you are looking in through I think this
timeframe even if the movie is able to
influence therefore sample ten thousand
people are people and many say what
we've done even by the Congress go quick
who are you know to raise an objection
as far as when Commission is up there
now the other pile is instances in which
is going on the coastal media is that
they are things that are you know the
movies CC is so fast as the fact is that
you that they would mean is a lot an
abstraction for the movie I did not
entry I did not mean photo assistant or
which is being raised by the caucus
party all kind of here is the fact of
the matter is you are listing of a
po-boy and one of the thought happiness

coming in filed a reply before the

states that it has withdrawn the cups
director remember the poll panel has
issue a notice to the rail with a thing
is to submit a report by Thursday on the
slogan on the tea cup so that it can
take a call on whether it was a whole
code violation or not it has come to the
notice of the Election Commission that D
cups were provided for the passengers in

namely Frankel which contains the
political slogan of BJP and such merely
a closely related to violation of model
code of conduct according to Adams
notice which was issued by the Election
Commission now will be filed a reply in
the lair before Election Commission and
said they had withdrawn the cup and
penalize the contactor
writer so clearly of course our shisha
the railway is taking swift action there
obviously you know many eyebrows were
raised when these cups actually came to
the fore on various strains because the
cup had the BJP slogan of maybe chalk
Adar and this during election season
when model code of conduct is subject to
inquiry I think railway should conduct a
religious form of team or committee who
who can inquire this allocation that how
this cup come to railway and how the
power is provided to the passengers this
is a issue of enquiry I think but rails

before the Election Commission that they

my name is nacho Pratt I have with me my
colleague jabber and we bring to you the
election brief for the day jabber so the
article 370 war is once again being a
reignited yesterday we heard a lot that
are coming out of making this claim that
he will revive the sentiment for a
second a p.m. and president for Jane key
and at the same time today former Chief
Minister of the state and PDP chief
Mehbooba Mufti sees that in fact she has
attacked and said that they will review
ties with India 370 is touched look at
the irony of this devika they fighting
for elections into Indian Parliament
today when she made these statements om
ever Mufti was filing a nomination from
an antenna and so she wants to enter
Indian Parliament at the same time she
is talking of doing away with India if
article 370 is is revoked so what we see
here is in election time lot of politics
and a lot of people are playing to the
gallery so you see this stand of
National Conference n PDP they're
talking pretty much as as separatists
have been talking of that we have we
don't want to stay with India or those
sentiments are being revived so I think
it's political expediency it is at the
same time irresponsible all right these
elections will get over in a month or
two so what where do you go then so all
these things are being talked about
obviously BJP is slamming them BJP is on
record to say that they want article 370
to be removed it's part of their
manifesto has been there for a long time
they want to have a relook at article 35
way which has again sticking point
between the politicians in the valley
and in Kashmir and BJP Congress is
playing safe they say we don't want this
this was part of their their manifesto
but yes political expediency in the time
of Paul in the time of elections but
irresponsible at the same time
absolutely and another interesting
statement has come from Andhra Pradesh
today where my what he is campaigning
and during a rally she went ahead and
she has in a way expressed her prime
ministerial ambition something that has
been the talk of town the Marathi wants
to become a prime minister and she you
know takes all of the boxes as well a
fall put a possible prime ministerial
candidate for today during a rally she
said that it depends it depends on the
will of the people the desired rebirth
and quite interesting he she also said
that it depends on the post poll outcome
well if there is to be any chance of man
with the becoming Prime Minister face
then it has to be postponed or thematic
issues remember she is fighting just
contesting it note the police 38 seats
that is the mainstay that is the
mainstay state for for the BSP so just
38 seats somebody with 38 seats we never
we don't know how many seats they gonna
win out of those 30 seats but yet she is
claiming to a prime minister so but
those post poll equations will have to
factor in that if there is no BJP no
clear majority for BJP or Congress and
there is a third front that emerges so
who you never know if she is she is they
acceptable face to the in line and an
interestingly she is going out she will
see she made this statement in
campaigning in Andhra Pradesh you would
you would wonder that BSP doesn't have
much presence in Andhra Pradesh but but
she is going out there she has formed
alliances with Pawan Kalyan party so
she's she's trying to create that pain
India image for herself and you never
know in the post poll automatic if there
is a hung parliament you never know also
and its peak today the Prime Minister is
in a month of energy stuff and he has of
course made a scathing attack saying
that she's been the speed breaker to
development so moody once again making
the development pitch as he goes to
month of energy stuff West Bengal Devika
for for BJP is a high state battery
state
they look at West Bengal as an
opportunity where they can grow remember
it states like you peel all of these
northern states you P MP Gujarat
Rajasthan their chock-a-block I mean
they're they've pretty much including
Bihar they figures in 2014 were really
high so where they can grow where they
can grow so the BJP has been clamoring
for last six months eight months we have
seen which are going down Kailash
vijayvargiya has been there their post
lot of leaders from the TMC Congress who
have joined BJP shrank so they really
banking on West Bengal and Prime
Minister rightfully so was there and he
had a go at month telling that she is
blocking development in the state and
yeah so they she must be ruled out but
we know how fast e and how fierce month
of energy is so she had a go back at at
Prime Minister Modi that he should
believe they should tell the people of
the country how much has he delivered
and not ask of what has she delivered so
yes interesting play out there flat from
several parts of the country and several
politicians are coming out calling it an
illusion and a manifest of lies and
false promises you're talking from BJP
in their own language yesterday Arun
Jaitley had a go at the manifesto today
it was Defence Minister Nirmala
Sitharaman they saying that touka dated
a gang actually was instrumental behind
in forming this manifesto what they're
saying this manifesto is soft on
terrorists terror people who speak
international elements o : international
elements so it's soft there so they're
like you're sedition it wants to repeal
do away with sedition so they think that
is not on BJP thinks that that's not on
then it says that it wants to review a
spa so against is this something
controversial a lot of attempts have
been made in the past also to tweak our
spa but you need to factor in what the
Security Agency is in those days
or armies in the state so yes Congress
manifesto for day two was it has been in
news and yes
BJP being the opponent party will
obviously find fault with it right
absolutely and of course some
interesting developments taking place in
the south as well where come on Hassan
is now seeking Rajan accounts helper to
in the campaign to sort of become a
phrase you know to push his campaign
forward which is very interesting
yeah I remember Rajinikanth party is not
contesting in these elections so yes
Kamel has in fines and come Ellison has
not allied with anybody he's not in the
DMK camp he is not in the AI DMK camp
he's not with TT with Dena Curran
so he's fighting all alone so maybe he
in Resnick on and Resnick on may not be
contesting but he has a huge following
she was huge following in the state so
maybe common common lesson is reaching
out to him to win cash on his supporters
if he can get them so androgyny has not
ruled that out
absolutely and at the same time the fact
that Rajinikanth was expected to be with
the BJP somewhat considering what he
said in the past but he's now come out
saying that there is no possibility of
him you know coming forward in this
particular election but maybe come on
has some things that why left that
support base that fat is going to be
useful he wants to in cash on Resnick on
support base absolutely so that's it for

YouTube we're back with the results for
survey number 11 and here is what you
the viewer told us if you would like to
see a Rahul vs Modi presidential style
debate now even wild releasing the
manifesto Rahul Gandhi had dared the
prime minister for a one-on-one debate
sixty four point one percent of you said
this is absolutely something that you
want to see 15.4% settle said it'll be
nice to have such a one-on-one face-off
between the Prime Minister and Rahul
Gandhi let's see if that ever does
really take place now what do you think
is the worst thing about the election
season out of these options for buying
dirty name-calling
turncoat Netta's online abuse and trolls
abusive whatsapp for words of course the
majority of you over fifty percent said
that all of these are highly undesirable
but if we look at the options
individually then what buying is what
most viewers find most undesirable 23.1%
there and dirty name-calling also comes
closer 12.8% viewers feel dirty
name-calling your election season and
even otherwise for that matter is
absolutely unpalatable which matters for
you in candidates majority of you really
seventy six point nine percent said
experience Trump's age experience
Trump's religion caste gender all of
these but again popularity of the leader
does matter for some of our viewers
15.4% said that perhaps a mass leader
Nita who is a popular figure would be a
better candidate this is an interesting
question we asked our viewers who do
they rate the highest among the Gandhi
Nehru family Indira Gandhi takes away
the highest number of votes 28.2% feel
in the regard II was the more popular
person algae from the Gandhi Nehru
family of course despite you know the
three decades since her assassination
Indira Gandhi remains one of the more
popular figures from the Gandhi Nehru
family Rajiv Gandhi and Maneka Gandhi
come closer at 17.9% they hold the
second most
votes rajiv gandhi of course has been a
former prime minister and has left
behind a legacy of sorts Maneka Gandhi
perhaps because she's a contemporary
politician and she is a union minister
in the BJP government the first Prime
Minister of India halle-loo has polls
twelve point eight percent of the votes
viola Rahul Gandhi Varun Gandhi Priyanka
Gandhi his great grandchildren as well
as his grandchild Sanjay Gandhi have not
really come anywhere close the other
narugami family members now let's look
at who do you rate to be India's best
Prime Minister Nouri no more the at
56.4% really takes it away
utter Bihari Vajpayee comes to 15.6%
Indira Gandhi gets twelve point eight
percent of the votes love how the
Shastri 10.3% Manmohan Singh and nursing
her around resting Lee just two point
six percent and Marathi they sire Rajiv
Gandhi at zero now Narain Modi of course
the current prime minister naturally
perhaps polls the largest number of
votes Manmohan Singh interestingly at
two point six percent watch by who was
again a very popular leader just fifteen
point six percent now if we stand here
to analyze why our viewers voted in such
a weight it could be perhaps because
Modi is the current prime minister and
many of our viewers perhaps have not
experienced the governance under leaders
like law other Shastri Miraj either side
perhaps even in the raw Gandhi for that
matter or even narsimha Rao so so this
is how our viewers have rated all the
Prime Minister's of India and the next
question he asked was ha what has been
the best Modi government scheme over
here three things really pop out at you
that is the Swach Bharat abhiyaan make
in India and are you chuan heart-earth
these three appear to be the most
popular of the Modi government schemes
or Giovanna or Jenna interestingly which
the government does push a lot quite a
lot they see that
has reached many of the beneficiaries
and transform their lives our viewers
rate this fifteen point four percent of
our viewers say this has been the best
moody government scheme digital india
jonathan yogena have not really pulled
too many votes swachh bharat abhiyan
might make in india and Irish man
ferrets the health care scheme really
stand out among the Modi government
schemes who would be the best Prime
Minister for India's armed forces there
is a really no division about it
Narendra Modi eighteen nine point seven
percent of the boats that's nearly 90
percent of the votes go to Narendra Modi
because of the muscular policy that the
government has undertaken under his
leadership perhaps because of the the
surgical strikes the ballot code strike
the the retaliatory policy that is
perhaps the reason why Narendra Modi
really wins this Rahul Gandhi is the
other candidate who pulled ten point
three percent of the words
achalasia other month of energy they
regatta of course at zero
they are regional faces and of course
they haven't really proved their
national leadership capability yet the
HD they've got of course has been a
prime minister but this is how as far as
who will be the best Prime Minister for
India's armed forces is concerned this
is how our viewers have rated these
candidates now who as Prime Minister
would represent women the best once
again over here interestingly the three
women options of Priyanka Gandhi mamta
banerjee and my avati mama da and Maya
have pulled zero percent of the votes
Priyanka Gandhi at 15.4% she's of course
rated higher than her brother Rahul
Gandhi who's got twelve point eight
percent of the boats but once again over
here
despite the gender of the Prime Minister
Narendra Modi again stands out seventy
one point eight percent of our viewers
feel he will be the best person to
represent women which of the following
are voting issues for you this is a
question we do ask our viewers time and
again and in almost every survey nearly
every
surveys the chief concern of the aam
aadmi remains jobs once again this is
the proof 56.4% of our viewers said that
jobs is the primary and most predominant
concern of the army Pakistani terror
28.2% women's security 5.1 percent LGBTQ
rights again a minority feel that this
is the most important voting issue for
them 2.6 percent and minimum income
which is a flagship program of the
Congress the Naya scheme that it is
highlighting which is a game changer it
hopes for this elections the minimum
income has received seven point seven
percent of votes who has Prime Minister
would have a better plan for jobs
generation that is what we asked you
next and once again it is not in the
Modi at 82.1%
Rahul Gandhi at twelve point eight
percent affiliation has posed some words
2.6 percent the rest of the figures

no votes so that was survey number 11

excu tube I'm Corey and with me is my
colleague Trisha this is your daily
election brief so Rishabh
Prime Minister Modi had a rally in
Maharashtra today and he tore into the
Congress attacking them again for the
Hindu terror tag absolutely right so
this is emerged now as a major election
pivot you saw finance minister Jaitley
speak about it a few days ago all in the
context of course of the some Java
terror cases in which a trial court for
want of evidence let Swamy is even and
then everybody else go
remember this Hindu terror narrative was
spun by a sushi Kumar Shinde UPA
Minister that paratime Home Minister to
Don Graham Digvijay Singh who had talked
about this saffron terror Hindu terror
now what has happened today is that
Prime Minister Modi has very
energetically and aggressively injected
this into the election than a mega
coming out and saying that look
peaceable Hindus were defamed by the
Congress party they communal eyes terror
in the in the most horrible ways and of
course this is a direct connotation got
into the entire discussion that's
happening over the Pakistani dynamic
because Pakistan has been wanting to
have this Hindu terror attack sort of
inserted into the vocabulary of the
world so when they commit terror attacks
they have plausible deniability in
saying that yes fine they're a terror
terrorists that come from Pakistan but
look at these Indians look at these
induce these are terrorists also so this
is emerged as a poll plank a major one
today and you can continue to expect
that it will remain a major poor plank
over the next days and weeks okay moving
on to our next story to the second story
which is from down south so yesterday
Congress made it official
Rahul Gandhi is contesting a second seat
and now BJP has fever a candidate yes so
today the BJP has announced that they
will be sending in their one of their
allies from the from the Bharat Dharma
John Cena is a chap called to serve to
charville Nepali he will be contesting
on behalf of the BJP NDA take it over
there and be giving a contest to Rahul
Gandhi
via not a seat in which long considered
a congress bastion because the last
three times the Congress is won it
effectively the main battle is going to
be between the Congress and the left how
effective the left campaign is against
Rahul Gandhi remains to be seen whether
they'll put energy in
given the fact that they actually say
that they are an anti BJP front when he
in themselves they're fighting elections
in Kerala against each other with Rahul
Gandhi's entry has become even more high
profile but the BJP will want like in
Amity to give Rahul a good good close
contest because if they give him a run
for his money they sort of break that
last type that Rahul Gandhi is is
wherever he goes he can easily win so it
is a Congress Bastion Rahul should win
it comfortably but the BJP has fielded
one of its major allies to charville
happily to ensure that it it has an
energetic campaign in response so it's
going to be a close contest that's what
the media will go for the third story we
are talking about the Facebook clean up
so Facebook has basically said that it
has blocked some 700 Congress profiles
what is this about Trisha well Facebook
is has admitted remember about a year or
so ago that its platform was misused by
Russian proxies to influence the
elections in the United States in 2016
it was slammed for the use of the PEI
Facebook platform in the Brazilian
elections so there have been and under
due caution that when it comes to the
Indian elections that they are taking
measures and steps what has happened
today is that Facebook has announced
that about a 150 or Pakistan military
related websites groups and pages have
been taken down and about 676 80 or
Indian politics of related pages have
been taken down and the indications are
the BJP at least is claiming that these
are all Congress linked proxy pages that
were actually doing a lot of fake news
and Modi bashing so this has become a
major political contest or who's
actually doing fake news and spinning
theories and spinning lies and spinning
rumors on the online world and so many
people watching this broadcast would be
sick of all the kind of forwards they
get in the Facebook posts they get and
will be worried at how caustic and
extreme they are so the Facebook company
has issued a statement today saying that
we have removing the 670 order
Congress named Facebook pages and sites
the BJP of course is calling this
vindication correct it just goes on to
show how powerful these big media giants
have become with these social media
platforms moving on to another very
interesting battle which is shaping up
in Karnataka and it is heating up
further now what's happening what's
happening with nickel Kumaraswamy and
with someone Mata oh yeah
nikka kumara Swamy is the son of HT
kumara Swamy the Chief Minister of
Karnataka he was on a ticket to fight
from the JD's from the principal home
bastion of the DDS mondaya is the seat
but the principal opponent assumed
Anitha from the BJP has raised several
objections first she came out that a
specific number formed number 25 has not
been filled out that has to declare the
candidate has to declare assets of the
family in that form so her first
objection was that the second objection
she's come out with is that he was not
present during the nomination filing
process there's a claim going on that
the videography of the nomination does
not show him the GDS is saying that
videography was different in the sense
that 18 minutes was missing that's the
point of time the videographer did not
shoot that's when he was there the
election officer is saying that he was
there and he was there was no anomaly in
all of this so in the end the Election
Commission will decide whether the
nomination or the candidature holds good
as of now it has not been scrapped but
the BJP is taking on mind in mondaya in
technical terms and real world terms
very effectively but remember it is it
is a JDS bastion so the work will be cut
out for some other time the BJP to
actually take on and defeat
nakum on something okay going on to
another another political development
which happened today Bhadra was given a
his he was given an anticipatory bail
this was the case happening in which the
IDI has accused him of money laundering
in the purchase of a property Bryanston
Square in Branson Square in London the
property was worth about 1.9 million
dollars million pound sorry and this
property the EDA alleged was bought by
Bhadra and used for a money-laundering
cycle he's been given bail and to the
principle Congress relink lawyers who
were defending him kts will see an
ambitious menacing way of course were
out in crying vindication they have
obviously been calling this a political
witch-hunt
so water has got pain for now he will
not be going into IDI custody as of now
the pain was given enough 5 lakh will be
surely okay and and more news coming
from Orissa
breakthrough for BJP there well thus
politics is heating up because Narendra
Modi is expected to begin his first
rally there from tomorrow
so the aggressive campaign is going to
begin in that state from the BJP
tomorrow by the lead campaign ahead of
the Modi today there were seven MLAs and
four MPs of the bjd who joined and
flipped ranks into the BJP we've already
seen gen panda bettan panda join today
you had ball but Ramon G Arjun say T
vision panda and other four three or
four other emily's and MPs of join ranks
so in politics it does happen that
people who don't get tickets are unhappy
with their own party flip ranks but
therefore the BJP right now they see
this as a momentum shift in their favor
in Odisha okay and GST figures are in
rishabh record collections yes so it's
been a hot topic or debate topic and in
the middle of the election cycle we've
got the March GST figures remember today
is April 1st so the majesty figures are
in and they're at a record record level
1.04 lakh crores this is the highest GST
collection taken in a month since GST
started so that's going to be some good
news for the government to bandy about
similarly the Sensex Sensex has reached
some record points yeah the Sensex today
closed at 164 points up it was at a
record intraday high of more than 39,000
it reached 3 9 1 1 5 which is the
highest ever that the Sensex is hit it's
closed the month literally month of
March and April at the first day of
April at an 8 percent advantage over
over the month of December so since it's
on a record high and of course the
global environment economic environment
is is one factor RBI potential rate cuts
coming up is another factor and of
course election probabilities also being
factored into all of this regarding of

they preferred do I do with the

we're absolutely in what's really
leading to this rallying of the Sensex
today Shweta two reasons as to why the
Sensex is rallying first is the fact
that the RBI will be meeting for its
monthly monetary policy review this week
there is a feeling within the market
that there could be a rate cut remember
this could be the last
MPC meeting before the elections next

the Indian market is also very strong on

Now the question is what will ...",2019-03-31T07:29:18Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OYuV8isCw1Q/hqdefault.jpg,"allow your watching news X and musics on
YouTube we're getting reports that
terrorist Masood Azhar and Jesse
Mohammed chief has once again resurfaced
in Pakistan's Bahawalpur we have got to
know that Masood desert has established
his daily rant of bashing India and
Pakistan and his terrorist speeches and
we also got to know that that his reach
after the pull Varma terror attack has
increased now more youth is getting
towards him is attending his rallies his
speeches what do what else do we have on
this story well here's a rejection of
being extended you know it's a very
conflicting question I would say but yes
the report which has surfaced in news X
s sister publication the sunday Guardian
says that Masood Azhar is back in action
in Bahawalpur
and after a brief illness as Pakistani
authorities were claiming and he is now
back to giving hate speeches and
religious discourses in the area clearly
they are meant to be against India and
MT us also the Christians fight here is
in a broader sense the fact that what
was this going on all all over all along
when Imran Khan was saying that there is
no hand of JME in the pull bomb attack
on February 14 contrary to which that JM
had actually claimed the attack then it
was DG is PR from the Pakistani army was
saying that Masood Azhar is not in
Pakistan but contrary to Shawn about
Cory she is comments that yes he is very
much in Pakistan and he's unwell that's
what is said to one of the interviews to
a global network as of now what you know
who is to blame in my opinion it is
China which actually put Masood Azhar in
a very comfortable situation put
Pakistan in a position where the global
community cannot touch them and it used
its veto power to block that global call
to ban Masood Azhar and brand him as a
global terrorist this is not the first
time as we all remember that China has
done it it was the fourth time when
China actually blocked the proposal
which was mooted by US UK and France and
it remains to be seen if
Thun would actually act on terror on its
own although after be receiving a flag
from F ATF which will gave around eight
thousand seven hundred odd suspicious
transactions in Pakistan it was a
hurriedly called a high-level meeting
where Imran Khan met the ISI the army
chief and the finance minister of the
country to to track down all these
transactions the benami transactions are
done through fake account sir all these
things appear to be assure are as of now
because if things are going back to
normal in Pakistan when it comes to
Massoud other then it is clear that
Pakistan is not mending its ways and it
is not going to miniaturize ever when it
when we look at Pakistan and the way
there things are happening there and
with tacit support from China
definitely Imran Khan's feels more
empowered and remember there is money
also being pumped in it was only a
couple of weeks ago and the two billion
dollars came to Pakistan straight back
from China then there is CPAC then there
is Bri all these things are putting
Pakistan into the lap of China and
Pakistan doesn't want to leave this very
comfortable territory and hence China is
also using Pakistan to its own benefit
remember the Pakistani geography real
location as if now is in a way that it
gives China from the East a direct
access to the western country down south
to Africa also self passing India China
cannot pass through India for its own
trade routes and other imperial
imperialistic approach that it has got
so either way Pakistan helps China
geographically a lot enhanced China's
keeping them in good humor and for
Pakistan it's a win-win situation to be
on the side of China not just monetarily
but strategically also China remember
there were reports that how China
developed the Pakistan's nuclear arsenal
then there was an exchange of fighter
jets then you know the naval Armada that
Pakistan is going to acquire from China
all these things as of now put together
clearly put China in the spot and the
very question remains if the global
community is invoking you know all the
powers that be to ban Pakistan or to
segregate Pakistan from the global
network
shouldn't China also be facing the same
music shouldn't it be taken into
consideration from the same measure
because China is equally responsible for
actually the proliferation of terror and
the moment the terror ideas that ferment
in Pakistani soil China is turning a
blind eye to it and from blind I reminds
me that Pakistani Prime Minister Imran
Khan a couple of days ago to an
interview to a Turkish Network he said
that he's not aware of the atrocities
being a levied on the Muslim minorities
the Vigors in China he said that he
doesn't know about it and he has never
heard of it whereas the fact remains the
truth is that China has been on an
ethnic cleansing Street when it comes to
the Viger Muslims and they are is very
systematically clamping down on all
those Muslim community there in China
and they're very repressed they're not
just Muslims but the Christians also so
all these things as of now you know you
scratch my back I scratch yours this
kind of understanding between China and
Pakistan is going to be a headache for
the global community and I'm sure you
know in the days to come these things
will be taken into factor and they will
be factored in and China will be in a
very held responsible if something else
also goes wrong from the Pakistani side

acute ooh my name is vivica Chopra and I
bring to you the results of the news X
FB poll number nine yes remember that we
put out fresh questions every day on
Facebook because we want to put out the
people's faults out there this election
season next I've right into the results
question number one we asked the people
why do you think so many people don't go
out to work and of course the
respondents could choose multiple
options and that's reflecting you have
at the top 35 almost 36 percent of
people believe that it's because of lack
of awareness they don't know when the
polls are taking place they don't know
the process to reduce to themselves so
lack of awareness is of course key at
the same time apathy as well as tainted
changi rates here are neck-and-neck
people feel that because of the
candidates are tainted and that's why
people feel that it's a waste of their
time to go out and what that of course
also can translate into public apathy
people don't think that their vote
matters they always go by the assumption
that somebody else is voting anyway so
how does it matter at the same time some
people also believe that voter
registration issues as well as address
changing issues can also hamper the
entire process and make it very lemony
leading to frustration so that of course
was the first question that we asked the
people moving on with they're also asked
for some solutions now that we've looked
at the problems how can we improve water
turnout and once again people could pick
multiple options and at the same time of
course many people now the majority of
the people feel that water verification
through an app will in fact make more
people go out and vote so basically
people are demanding a simplification of
the entire process and of course the
other three options holidays on voting
days empowering the no 2 option as well
as more polling booths are all
neck-and-neck as far as this question
was concerned but of course what a
verification through an app is what
takes the
Georgiy of what's in this particular
question question number three that we
ask do you trust the EVM results now
remember that a lot of opposition
leaders have been launching this attack
over EVMS that the EVM czar 40 so right
here is of course the verdict of the
people thirty eight point five percent
almost thirty nine percent people feel
that yes they totally support it and a
similar amount of rest our respondents
also said that they mostly do believe
that the EVM results are in fact very
accurate and they can be relied upon so
of course right there the opposition's
claims of it being doubtful and
suspicious not a lot of people clearly
buying into that particular narrative
most people feel that EVM results are
reliable moving on we also asked the
people of India how has moody remained
popular what do they think in this
question once again people could take
multiple options and as we can see the
Prime Minister faring quite well as far
as his clean image is concerned so
majority of the people feel that it is a
clean image it says hard-working image
he is decisive action on Pakistan is
also very important and at the same time
a very interesting result here lack of
an alternative almost fifty percent of
the respondents who took the survey
believe that there is no alternative
right now in the country to Prime
Minister moody and that of course
continues to help him a very interesting
question and even more interesting
results moving on
what could Molly have done better in the
past five years that's also what we
asked the people of India once again
multiple choices were given and you
could pick multiple answers here as well
but a very clear what ik right here in
favor of clearer jobs growth so a lot of
people eighty-seven percent the people
felt that Prime Minister Modi could have
perhaps provided a clearer job growth
plan in his government are the same
a lot of people about 39% people feel a
prosecution of the corrupt we the UPA
government remember went out with and
the mud of corruption allegations and a
number of scams however we didn't really
see those cases go anywhere
another new government either so that's
where people feel that the Prime
Minister career perhaps are done better
lowering the fuel prices as well as B
monetization avoiding the monetization
have gotten the same a number of results
so a lot of people there feel that he
could have in fact avoided B
monetization is what a sizable chunk
they I would say moving on Whelan asked
what's the biggest poll issue right now
this of course is a question that we are
asking over and over again because as
the polls inch closer remember you're
voting issues will vary they will differ
very interesting result here something
that the Congress has been focusing on
jobs is at the top of the chart with 51
percent of the voters feeling that it's
jobs that are the biggest polling issue
right now and at the same time war on
corruption which has been the current
cover me a government's mantra really so
majority of the people feeling that that
of course is a major voting issue what's
also interesting is that the minimum
income guarantee scheme that was
announced by the Congress party recently
taking about 23% of the water's there so
clearly it's gaining some traction then
we also other B are people who has a
better plan for cash me this is very
interesting emphatic worried in favor of
the Prime Minister eighty percent of the
people
eighty percent respondents feeling that
it's narium Grimaldi who's the man when
it comes to a solution and a plan for
Kashmir our Gandhi far behind him but at
the same time quite interestingly the
regional players Omar Abdullah and
Mehboob am often not doing so well with
Mehbooba behind Omar on this particular
question
moving forward we also asked
who's the more trustworthy candidate and
once again an emphatic verdict in favor
of the Prime Minister sixty nine point
two percent people here believed that
the Prime Minister is of course the most
trustworthy candidate Rahul Gandhi not
reading that well far behind him and at
the same time the regional players Mamta
Banerjee Akhilesh Yadav really doing
poorly on this question what's
interesting is that she is not even
contesting the polls she's the U P
general east u P general secretary for
the Congress and Priyanka Gandhi is
faring better than her brother as far as
being trustworthy is as far as the
aspect of being trustworthy is in
question so very interesting result
there who will represent the middle
class the best of that has also been a
war who really is representing the
middle class of India once again people
feel that Prime Minister Modi about 69%
of the people feel that it's PM Modi who
represents the middle class the best
Rahul Gandhi behind him Priyanka Gandhi
behind her brother in this particular
aspect but at the same time quite
interesting in Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh
Yadav on a tie here as far as this
question is concerned we then asked
after Rahul and Priyanka who is the most
popular Congress leader now this of
course has been a debate for a long time
now that if Rahul and Priyanka removed
from you know the picture for a for a
bit then who really is there to take
their place and a very interesting
result here such in pilot hands down 41
percent of the people respondents feel
that it's such an Fallot who is of
course the most popular Congress leader
after Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka the
punjab Chief Minister Rindler Singh
behind such an power with 25 percent of
the votes and of course on the third
position is Jutra detest India with
about 18 percent of the war
so you see that the two young faces of
the Congress doing really well on this
particular question and with that that
was of course the end of our news X FB

fOcter_ylWA,Income Tax Officials Raids&#39; At Karnataka Minister C S Puttaraju&#39;s Residence,Income Tax Officials along with CRPF personnel carried out raids at the residences of Karnataka Minor Irrigation Minister CS ...,2019-03-28T04:31:47Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fOcter_ylWA/hqdefault.jpg,"shows were given to understand reading
multiple locations in Karnataka IT
officials have raided JD s leader HT
Raven has closed its residents in Hassan
earlier in the morning the residents of
Karnataka Minister CSS support Raju was
also raided Kannada Chief Minister HT
Kumaraswamy has said in a statement that
the IT department will be reading JD s
in Congress reporter he said that the
center is using the IT department at
target opposition for electoral gain so
this is of course the insinuation the
allegation that was leveled by the Chief
Minister what we're now seeing happen is
a theory of course that has been
propagated that the IT is acting at the
behest of the center my colleagues
Africa's joining us in the broadcast
Africa shall bring us up to speed with
what's happening on the ground
well after Kumaraswamy days of the
shocking statement that the IT
department was preparing our to hit the
radius and Congress leaders across
America what is the meaning is that his
aim was to preempt the IT officials from
reading but eventually from 5:00 in the
morning the IT department officials have
been fanned out across the state but the
initial confirmation coming from sources
that in two places which is the Hassan
and Monty are very important in the
cavalry Delta region where two of the
grandsons of HT Terra Cotta one is of
niki lauda son of Kumaraswamy the other
one is a jewel revenue who's the son of
history and a both are contesting from
these two key constituent cheese and
raids or have happening even as we speak
I don't 5 a.m. his foot reduce residence
in silk only in 1 dia where the idea
SLUSA swooped on the residence and are
they have locked in the house and are
right now going through the kinetic
documents in other place which is a
Hassan where the history one has son is
contesting this is where he's got close
ties with about 17 contractors these are
mainly contractors who are operating on
contract in irrigation and PWD
Department and they're supposed to be
front Hawk HT level 9
locations about the hundred IPO fischels
are in the residences and premises of
these or contractors and rates are
happening well initial reactions have
also started coming from Congress and
radius that Simon again but the IT
department is being utilized by the BJP
remember last time around when the links
happened this shuttle during a
simulations where raids happened and
also peak or in hot cash box you see
from different locations and this time
the general elections just 15 days to go
raised on these political leaders raises
many lie bro passage areas and the
Congress making no bones about it
claiming that the DCP is misusing the IT
agency to intimidate the coalition
partners is this in connection of course
you know Jaiprakash at this point goes
that also just like to a price of us the
exclusive visuals that we are getting at
this point of the raids that are being
conducted IT raids as the Jaiprakash is
pointing out there are hundreds of
officers in a multiple locations where
simultaneous raids are being conducted
income tax officials remember began
search operations at the residents that
belong to three contractors also said to
be close associates of PWD Minister the
current government HD Ravana these weeds
have started from early this morning as
JP is pointing out to us at this point
you know what is the allegation
Jaiprakash why what is the tip-off what
is the the behest at which these idea
fischels
are conducting the sentence well I mean
it is alarming that these are ideas are
happening and the timing is a suspect
here as I mentioned earlier this week
about Kamara saw me yesterday has got it
didn't report the central government was
mobilizing forces paramilitary forces
these mobilised her from neighboring
states and he was in fact a tough but in
agent agency that they will be right and
then he's gone into the details of the
size of these of troops that are being
utilized by the IT department usually
it's the State Department which is
intimidated and then the State Police
then the sense they're forced to hate
the ITF loose but this time around the
central the parametric forces of the you
by the IT department and this is one of
the main allegations by the sitting
Chief Minister by the current
dispensation here are saying that
specifically they are targeting the
Congress and the radius leaders we also
went on to say that up we will speak
later when the clean things are more
clear of because one of the BJP leaders
will be touched by these ideas only the
coalition partners will will be raided
and this smacks offer obviously you know
bias by the I teach IT officials and he
also went on to take over from yesterday
that the IT officials have to act
according to a conscience and should not
be used like a puppet by the central
agency but having said that
raids are happening right not in the
remains to be seen what are the kind of
cash hole that the IT department
officials and a poor cause of ragazza
here for Kumaraswamy new 12 hours before
the race yeah obviously who have
directed all the funds and IT
departments will have to return
empty-handed but having said that it's
too early in the day we've got
confirmation in two places there are no
reports are coming in dr. more locations
where high-profile brothels are being
contested like in Bangalore South the
bangalore north and other constancies
including Bangalore would become unglued
and a third consensus in the northern
Karnataka so all these the places are
also being looked into by the IT
department this is gonna get more
interesting as a day passes because of
change society rates throughout the day
all right so reeds are being also
carried out at the residence like we're
saying of Karnataka minor irrigation
Minister
CS puta raju at his residence at this
point they're also seeing reeds
taking place at associates as well as PW
Minister HD Ravana's residents and all
of this very interestingly coming a day
after the Karnataka Chief Minister Jerry
kumara Swamy had raised fears about
possible raids in Congress and JDS
functionaries in the state claiming that
crpf personnel were brought in from
various parts of the country to carry
out these raids in this state of
obviously insinuating at this point that
this is the political conspiracy that
the IT officials are acting at the
behest of the central government this of
course is a big story like jayaprakash
is saying that if HT Kumaraswamy did
have a de perfidy in advance it will be
interesting to see what these reads
actually reveal appreciated yeah Prakash
for joining us we'll keep coming back to
you for more updates on this big story

stepped up the ante
for the united nations security council
to blacklist
the head massoud azar of
pakistan based uh militant group
cheshire muhammad on wednesday after
china prevented an earlier move
two weeks ago the united states
circulated a resolution
drafted with uh the british and french
support
to the 15-member council that would
designate the jesuit muhammad leader
massoud azar subjecting him to an arms
embargo
a travel ban and an asset freeze
well this of course is the big story
that is coming in at this hour we have
breaking developments once again a
resolution with
the uk france and the us they have moved
the united nations security council
to seek a ban on masood azer so we're
joining us with the details
instead of a consensus the resolution
only needs nine votes
in favor and no vetoes by china russia
the us france or britain to pass is this
uh the big strategic move now we'll try
and reconnect
with in just a bit but the united states
britain and france has stepped up a push
for the united nations security council
to blacklist the head of pakistan based
militant group jaish muhammad on
wednesday remember
after china has prevented an earlier
move two weeks ago
the united united states circulated a
resolution draft
with the british and french support to
the 15-member council
that would designate jersey muhammad
leader masood subjecting him to an arms
embargo to a travel ban
and an asset freeze the joshua muhammad
remember
has claimed responsibility for the
february 14th attack that killed for
tcrp of germans
i do believe that sumit is back with us
on the phone line uh sweet if you can
hear me
you know how is this different from the
previous uh resolution that was moved
now instead of a consensus
the technicality of moving a resolution
is that it only needs
nine votes in favor and no votes by
china russia
united states france or britain which is
the
uh which is the permanent five members
to pass
well definitely this is it this isn't
all the individual
efforts have been uh have been made by
the various countries especially if you
remember that
before that that france and the germany
have clearly mentioned
that how they are going to ban and they
have also drafted
they have also presented this and they
drafted
the masood and in the european union
organization
and now the u.s have been drafting these
have drafted that
have circulated the resolution which
clearly mentioned
to put ban on these sanctions
against
british support so that is something
very important because now the
international community is also
continuously not only stood with me with
indian demand but also
they have been doing something
individually back to you
right so you know this is very
interesting because uh it's important
here to note
how a resolution works now remember the
u.s britain france had initially asked
the security council's
uh uh you know sanctions committee which
operates by consensus to blacklist
uh masood azad china of course had
blocked this
uh they put in a technical hold for the
fourth time
and blocked this bait now instead of a
consensus a resolution of this kind
only needs nine votes in favor
and no vetoes by china russia the us
france or britain which is
the permanent five members uh you know
needs it to be passed so this is
extremely crucial
to note the strategy that has been
adopted
well definitely this strategy or this
moves are definitely this strategy or
this
moves are more important very important
because
now the countries when they are there
when they are able to do it
uh the individual individual factions
and
that that too when they said that the
retail power of china doesn't exist
in this particular thing that they can
easily easily
ban all these outfits and they easily
ban these
this organization and the individuals uh
on their on their
on the of the other personal thing on
their individual decisions so that is
something important for the indian point
of view because now
that the countries
single-handedly and individually
favoring the indian indian demand that
is something that each and every country
have been so
this is a big diplomatic win as far as
india is concerned
it also uh you know in a certain sense
goes to show that back channel diplomacy
is robust alive and kicking when it
comes
you know to developments that are taking
place
well definitely this is a big win for
indian
diplomatic and diplomatic diplomatic
relations beyond the international
platform because
uh india is continuously making efforts
not only in the
united nations security council but also
with these would be with the
with the relation with other countries
especially not um
with the other organization like
european union other and many other
international organizations and now
when the countries like u.s and
and have been have been waiting there
have been doing something
like this and that is something good for
indian perspective
back to you right so you know this is of
course the big story that we are in fact
tracking
at this hour uh uh the
big breaking story coming in the united
states britain france
uh have stepped up another push for the
united nations security council to
blacklist
masud azer the jedi muhammad this of
course after china remember had
prevented
a move like this two weeks ago united
states has this time
circulated a resolution which has been
drafted with british and french support
to the 15-member council
that would designate the jewish leader
as a globally designated terrorist now
the difference between
the move earlier and the resolution is
that instead of a consensus
a resolution of this kind that has been
moved only requires
nine hits uh nine votes in favor and no
vetoes by any of the permanent members
can actually block this bit so this is
an extremely interesting strategy
uh that uh you know the different
countries permanent members have in fact
come up with
in order to overcome the chinese veto
this is the big story coming in at the
sun
and more updates on the story that we
have for you the united states has
slammed china
for protecting jeshi mohammed chief
masood from united nations sanctions
the u.s secretary of state mike pompey
has said that the world cannot afford
china's shameful hypocrisy towards
muslims
pompey said on one hand that china
abuses more than a million muslims at
home but on the other
it protects violent islamic terrorist
groups from sanctions at the united
nations
the us's statement can be seen as a
setback for china as a major superpower
including u.s france germany now stand
with india
uh to ban masood azer and designate him
as a global terrorist meanwhile focusing
on china's crackdown on ethnic muslim
groups at home the us has asked china
for the release of detained muslims for
from intermittent camps so meet back
with us on the phone line sumita
you know it does appear that trouble is
mounting for china
at the international forum the u.s has
now slammed china for protecting
the jeshi mohammed chief masuda from the
united nations
security council sanctions u.s secretary
of state mike pompeo has also said that
the world can't afford china's shameful
hypocrisy anymore
well definitely these are the ddd china
has been criticized
after by dividing secretary clinton
and especially he clearly mentioned the
the condition of minorities in the india
china especially
area and that too when the muslims have
been detained and they have been treated
very
uh unmanned
so the china china have been the issue
have been raised by this and they they
clearly mentioned
because in the initiative the secretary
family have clearly mentioned the
hypocrisy of of china towards
muslim on one hand he clearly mentioned
on one hand china
abused more than million muslims at home
but on the
other hand they have been protecting
violent
islamic terrorist groups from sanctions
at un
so this is this is how we are
we are also discussing that how china
have been these are double
double games they are playing a double
game and especially and they are not
only
playing double game but they have been
doing whatever they want in their own
country but
then india raised questions to
to safeguard and to to put sanction
against the terrorist organization
then that that that time they have been
given
example like like like like islamic and
all that or example and they have been
saving this organization on that
particular thing back to you
yes and this of course you know is uh
coming and sumit let's make no mistake
in the
context of the eagles in china the
minority muslim eagers in china
uh you know islamic countries have
continued to say
stay silent uh you know over uh
you know the eager families who remain
uh you know subject to the worst kind of
atrocities so
what essentially we're seeing happen
here uh you know
is uh that uh the us is speaking up for
minority muslims
in china they're calling uh out
the chinese on the atrocities that have
been committed
and also calling out china for the
hypocrisy wherein they continue
uh you know to to treat this minority
community
in china uh in the manner that they do
but then go on to protect you know
dreaded terrorists like masudas or so
china at this point finds itself
cornered
for supporting pakistan
well definitely china is not only
cornered but they have been criticized
at the very level we have just talked
about the
how they having uh the the
the u.s have been circulating the
resolution and on the other hand
they have been also criticized to see on
international platform that how they
have been treating their minorities
especially
in the junction since april 2017 how the
millions of the
uh of the of the muslims have been have
been treated by the china and the
various
various and and this is though so that
that is something happening came out
at the various level and now the
countries like u.s and other countries
have been
have been criticizing china's act
because on one hand china have been
talking about things
about uh have been putting this uh the
ban on the sanctions
and we are seeking uh uh by by saying
the by device by by protecting the
pakistan but on the other hand they have
been doing that they have been
they have been still cheating and they
have been to
the minorities in their own land
right uh also uh you know sumit how are
we
anticipating china to respond to this
because uh
you know this is uh name and shame this
is hugely embarrassing for a permanent
member of the united nations security
council
uh you know to a b cornered by a
resolution of the global forum that
where its veto will not work so in a
certain sense decks are cleared as far
as the designation of masood as a global
terrorist is concerned that's point
number one
point number two is that china's
hypocrisy
has been called out at a global state so
it finds itself in an extremely
embarrassing position
well now one thing is very clear that
china is
always pay for their own business
interest
they have been saving pakistan for that
thing only
and now when they have been have been
questioned and they have been criticized
at the various levels especially on the
international platforms
now they have been have been saving and
they have been hiding themselves and
what is most important because you have
mentioned that
we have to see the response of china
because
we don't know how china will treat how
how cannabis
will will take a shield of all these
matter but because
china never bother about anything at the
international level they always work for
their
for their business interest so we have
to see
the how china will will react on this
thing but
one one thing is very clear one thing is
very very very
very clear that china is now having
have been having synthesizers not only
by way the countries like india but also
by the uh by the uh on the international
platform
all right so we appreciate you joining
us with the details of this big story
it's gonna be a top focus
for us as we continue to track the
developments that are taking place
at the united nations security council
remember the new resolution that has
been moved
does not uh get affected technically by
the veto powers of
china or any of the other permanent
members of the unsc so that's the story
which i appreciate you so much for

alright the Prime Minister their
concluding his highly anticipated much
awaited address to the nation a brief
one there he spoke for about 10 minutes
essentially around saying that India's
anti-satellite missiles system has
carried out a successful to test against
a low Earth orbit satellite shooting
down a live satellite in space it has
been codenamed mission Shakti the Prime
Minister their thing Indians now in an
elite club of countries early early US
Russia and China occupied the space now
India the latest entrant into this elite
club also the Prime Minister they're
saying all move is aimed at our
self-defence enhancing our national
security and focusing on our economic
and technological advancement
not targeted against any country and
they're saying that India is very very
proud of its scientists and who have of
course ensured that we enter this elite
club with Mission Shakti as we said in
theirs anti-satellite missiles system
that is now well and truly in place it
has carried out a successful test
against a low Earth orbit satellites

Toto is the odd little pseudo time
alright so there comes the announcement
well certainly nothing like D
monetization and we can tell you going
by the reactions we are seeing online
specially on Twitter a lot of people
heaving a huge sigh of relief that their
money is safe that is the joke that's
currently doing the rounds on social
media
nothing like D monetization or surgical
strikes or air strikes but yes the Prime
Minister announcing India's giant leap
forward in space technology singing
there's now a true blue space super
super power let me go cross to my
colleague Rajesh Pandey at this point
Rajesh you know I'm reading some
reactions on Twitter I can tell you the
one overwhelming sentiment and common
refrain seems to be trying God our money
is safe so a lot of people there heaving
a you sigh of relief their money you
save no D monetization or nothing of
that nature and no nothing on the lines
of surgical strikes or air strikes
either the Prime Minister making an
announcement saying that India is now
truly a space superpower and that today
with this test you know and thanks to
our anti-satellite missiles system we
have now become a real space power and
entered an elite elite club of Nations
British your first thoughts
well I you know I mean you can also say
that you know Prime Minister has lived
up to his reputation for delivering the
unexpected I mean nobody had thought
that you know the Prime Minister would
be making an announcement about how
India has become a space superpower and
joined the elite company of two to three
compare countries now you know this
operation Shakti which was which was
absolutely successful and the Prime
Minister has conveyed that how India is
shot down elio live satellite which was
300 kilometers away from Earth and India
has entered its name as an elite space
power and anti-satellite weapon ASAC
successfully target a live satellite on
a low Earth orbit so oh so it's it's
clear that India has entered the space
for geek it has enhanced the space
capable capability unlike anything so
this is the big ticket announcement
which was which has been made by Prime
Minister Narendra Modi on this 27th of
March 2019 well yes this is the big
announcement but like I said in a
lighter vein Rajesh many also heaving a
huge sigh of relief not not ready to
take another knock like D monetization
and not you know a big bank announcement
like surgical strikes or air strikes
either so this really isn't to do
directly with national security but
indirectly certainly because this is
about the giant street leaps that India
has now managed to make in the in in
space and in the area of space
technology entering an elite club there
and of course Rajesh you can now expect
a slew of reactions political reactions
to come in to this you're gonna have all
the BJP spokespersons and leaders and
ministers congratulating the Prime
Minister and the government and the
scientists on this you know step forward
that India has taken in space technology
but I have a sneaking suspicion that you
know you may have some less than
flattering remarks coming in from the
opposition as you would expect an
election season
well of course I mean you know given the
kind of height that was surrounded with
the big ticket announcement of course
you know it has not exactly come all
come across as the kind of announcement
which many were expecting and this is
the reason why we would see a lot of
unflattering remarks also coming in
apart from few I would definitely praise
the India's entry into an elite space
club so this is this is something which
is bound to happen and most of it the
fact that the first phase of election is
practically round the corner we have 15
days away from the first phase of
all-important 2019 general elections to
be held and and and you know this is the
reason why this announcement the tweet
of the prime minister took the
expectation to another orbit altogether
where you know we were all speculating
about whether it is going to be either
some big a diplomatic success or it is
about you know whether the India has
been able to get a fugitive back it has
turned out to be an equally important
announcement that India is now a
superpower when it comes to space and
you know the operation Shakti which was
codenamed of codename of this particular
operation has been extremely successful
as the Prime Minister has informed the
country right and it will be very
interesting to see British the kind of
reactions that this is now going to
evoke because of course everything the
Prime Minister says makes news grabs
headlines becomes the subject of
television debates and a lot of
newspaper editorials and needless to say
a warrior words begins between the BJP
and the opposition and this wasn't just
any election speech or a political
speech this wasn't an election rally
this was an address to the nation Rajesh
there was a lot of hype around it a
massive buildup a lot of excitement a
huge sense of anticipation people always
biting their nails and wondering for
more than half an hour what's going on
what the Prime Minister is going to say
in what bombshell he is going to drop on
us and therefore you be very interesting
to see with this announcement what kind
of reactions were you likely to get now
particularly from the opposition which
I think it would be pretty safe to say
is perhaps going to have a few
interesting things to say to the Prime
Minister and to the government on this
announcement what else are you picking
up reduce well I think I mean you know
or the opposition must have definitely
heaved a huge sigh of relief because you
know everybody's was expecting some big
ticket announcement in the other react
of of happening you know they were
thinking that this could be you know
some big announcement it could be you
know a surgical strike it could be
arrests or someone a fugitive India has
been looking forward to or import our
input important terrorists have been
neutralized
all any of these kind of announcement
would have given or the government aah
as far as you know 2019 looks of is
concerned but with this announcement
that India entering into space a super
elite league of the space for must have
come as the opposition must have a huge
sigh of relief as far as at this
particular announcement is concerned
well certainly I can tell you to judge
that while we can celebrate this giant
leap that India has taken in space
technology entering an elite club along
with countries like the US Russia and
China as the Prime Minister mentioned
also a huge sigh of relief around the
country Ashish single strategic affairs
editor also joining us from the Jay talk
at this point you know as a journalist
who's been covering the BJP government
and Prime Minister moody for a long time
Ashish I would love to know what your
thoughts on the PM's latest address to
the nation are because I can tell you
that people were biting their nails and
speculation was going wild ranging from
is there going to be another D
monetization is this going to be another
Bala code is this going to be another
surgical strike so many in a sense
heaving a size relieved that leave their
money is safe but what what are you
picking up on the PM suggest to the
nation Ashish
sadly as far as the common man are
concerned that's what the expectations
were that the announcement would be of
that intensity but remember the
intensity remains the same it may not be
exactly in the manner water the
surgical-strike announcement walls or
the barcode strike announcement or the
demonization one this is something that
has very niche area and the domain for
example the kind of deterrence that
India has now created in this space
domain and the people who deal with
defense who deal with space who deal
with cyber people who deal with defense
who deal with space who deal with cyber
they would understand the importance of
beta this is something that is going to
keep all the adversities of India at bay
remember gone are the days when you are
going to when you're going to have a
man-to-man fight gone are the days when
the wars and the conflicts would be a 1
on the basis of just the mortar shells
or the firing or with the help of
weapons
when you have the domain of world going
into the areas of space and cyber in
that particular domain - - keep
India future ready for future Wars these
kind of deterrents are important and I
was speaking to the former DRDO
secretary and the other officials from
the space the issue organization but all
that this says this is something that
India must have this is something that
India was hoping to have for quite some
time remember the general information
the general knowledge the general
importance of these two domains of space
and cyber are not very directly attached
to people are not something that
everyone every common man understands
but as from the country point of view as
the international image point of view
when you have these kind of a Sat test
being conducted successfully that
certainly keeps India prepared for
future Wars and this is a big sigh of
relief this is a major achievement in
the domain of space and our military
remember this is something that only
three
and please before India have achieved
yes as far as the expectations are
concerned well there just before the the
timing of it when you had the CCS
meeting CCA meeting and the cabinet
meeting taking place in the span of just
three to four hours before the
announcement and you have just before
the Lok Sabha election these kind of
anticipation building up there was a lot
of expectation that there could be an
announcement that that's going to have a
directly
direct impact on common man it's when
you have Prime Minister's are speaking
and this anticipation building
approximately 40 minutes after when it
was scheduled to start the PM's are just
started that was the expectation
heightened expectation I would say
curiosity and anxiety that's what the
our people were hoping that there would
be something related to Adi monetization
or the surgical strike but now this
particular announcement coming from
prime minister it's not something that
would be felt and understood by every
common man as I mentioned space is not a
domain where common masses directly get
attached to is there they do not
understand the nuances of it
but in terms of defense and the
strategic affairs and the space domain
these are certainly the announcement
that will go in the history and this is
something that will have India keeping
at par with the top powers in the world
as I mentioned just three countries
before India have achieved this now for
the benefit of our viewers what does
that mean we have another guest on the
phone line let's get a reaction then I
come back to you
in fact I'm also going through some
tweets subramanyam Swamy senior BJP
leader tweeting tremendous achievement
by normal government it has thrown
Pakistan electronic guidance of their
jet fighter in to blindness even
Pakistani Air Force jet flying over
Pakistani territory can be shot down by
blinded Park readers alright a professor
is kid Hakka space scientist joining us
on the phone line at this point officer
dhaka thanks very much for speaking to
news EXA as my colleague ah she just
pointed out this is a very significant
achievement by a scientist by israel but
one that will not
be easy for ordinary people to
understand therefore sir if for the
benefit of our viewers you could explain
what this really means if you could just
put this into perspective for of
yourself I'd like to mention that I
think it's a big achievement for India
and I congratulate to the Indian
scientists and of course as our Prime
Minister has already announced so this
is something we should proud of and we
are in the category of the fourth
country in the world and you know after
America rules and China so China last
last last year they were successfully
they were successful to using a system
to destroy a particular satellite so
that was very highlighted achievement
for the China but India has done this I
also am really excited feeling very very
happy and cultural aid to our country
people that we are successfully in a
position to fight like in their space so
India is capable to hit the missile
system to the low Earth orbit satellite
which is the located that was like 300
400 kilometers above Earth so thank you
all right so also before we let you go
the fact that with this India now enters
an elite club of Nations only the US
Russia and China have been here before
what really does that mean sir in the
aerospace technology where of course not
many countries have taken these kind of
giant leaves ok I think we may have lost
the language of Professor Dr let me take
this back to our she's our she sure I'm
sorry I have to interrupt you there go
on please complete the point that you
were making about the significance of
this achievement and what a giant keep
this is for Israel and for Indian
scientists see this is something that
DRDO and Roy were in the making they
were basically trying to create
something of that sort the
anti-satellite missiles system das at
now if you see
from 2012 onwards for last seven years
the DRDO was ready I mean in 2012 I
remember the DRDO secretary had
mentioned that if government gives the
go-ahead if government gives the green
signal to the plan then deodoro can
create obviously with the help of few
other agencies as well can create an
anti-satellite time missile system so we
always had the capability but the green
signal was waiting by the government to
the DRDO and the Israel and now we are
told that by Prime Minister that the
ASAT has been achieved the successful
test of the mission mission Shakti has
been conducted now this is something now
for the benefit of our viewers I'll just
take a minute to explain how did this
basically work without going into the
much of tech and the specs part of it
see basically this gives India a
capability to shoot down enemy or
adversary country's satellite now why is
it important for example ah when you
have an Indian Navy specific satellites
ar Rahman II I said the Indian Navy's a
specific satellite all the warships all
the submarines all the ships of in the
Navy in harbor or somewhere deep in sea
have this direct link with Dirac many
satellite if any of our adversary
country shoots down r1 specific specific
satellite it's going to paralyze the
entire system beat of Navy or something
similar which is on the sea army relies
on an Air Force relies on or the cyber
up financial institutions like BSC and
other institutions rely on and when you
have these kind of satellites being shot
down that's war that's war in space two
men against India if that happens now in
order to have that kind of deterrence
for the adversary for the enemy to
basically convey the message that if you
should done a satellite we do have the
capability to shoot down your satellite
- that is what the deterrence was
required and that's exactly what has
been achieved
now if Indian satellites are shot down
by any country then
leah has now developed the capability
after the successful test of machine
Shakti to neutralize or shoot down any
other country's satellite that certainly
depends on the range of the missile
system we have tested and which orbit
the other military satellites or the
commercial satellites or the financial
satellites are in which orbit away from
Earth so that that's a range issue
that's something that is developed over
the period of time for example we test
Agni five of Nghia but with different
variants of our missiles it's a range
that can be developed over the period of
time but now India has the capability if
we didn't have the capability any
country can shoot down our power
satellite and we become paralyzed in
specific domain beat military finances
communication anything related to a
direct impact on country and we cannot
do anything and others who have
contributed to make India a missile safe
country this test today was an acid test
of your anti-satellite missiles system
this shows that India can strike down a
satellite that is low-earth orbiting
satellite within three minutes second
this also shows that India can knock
down an intercontinental ballistic
missile launched at it from any of its
at any of the countries now this
capability is only available was only
available till date with China Russia
and America and today India is the
fourth country in this world that has
entered this club now this if you see in
the larger contest today Pakistan keeps
harping they keep sending militants
inside and they keep telling us that
here a nuclear-armed country and keeps
reckoning that they launch nuclear
missiles now this makes that entire
scenes are redundant alright so
reactions have started coming in with
many congratulating Indian scientists
it's row the DRDO for this massive
achievement time could also take a quick
break but don't go anywhere when we come
back on the other side we'll bring you
much more on this big story and many
many more reactions that are coming in",True,en,521,2,8
a7lBaGE7GXA,NewsX Explained — What Is Mission Shakti: How India tested anti-satellite weapon?,"While addressing the nation, PM Modi asserted that India has become the fourth country to enter the elite space club after America ...",2019-03-27T07:55:41Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a7lBaGE7GXA/hqdefault.jpg,"hello and welcome you are watching
musics and musics on YouTube this is a
remarkable victory a remarkable
achievement for the Indian Defence
Forces when it comes to striking a
satellite in low Earth orbit Prime
Minister Narendra Modi made an
announcement a short while ago saying
that India has successfully destroyed a
live satellite in the low Earth orbit
which means India has now entered an
elite club where there were only three
members as of now US Russia and China I
have with me my colleague Meenakshi who
would explain to us the implications the
achievements what it does for India and
what it means for India and before that
let me tell you when it comes to
striking a satellite in space
it's a victory it's like nipping the
problem in its bud how come these
satellites are capable of tracking troop
movement they are capable of telling the
security forces that a nuclear device is
being moved from one location to another
interestingly they track the drones also
drones when they send pictures to the
enemy countries or the one who is using
them these are done through these
low-earth orbit satellites which are
easy to transport transmit I mean
actually explain to us the implications
and at some an advantage for India well
I think mongers the first advantage you
have explained and you have elaborated
on as far as the space warfare goes
after of course this is no mean feat
it's a historic day for India as you
rightly mentioned after this we
certainly have an advantage as far as
space warfare is concerned as you
rightly explained you know we can nip
the problem in the butt itself now India
will have a strategic advantage when it
comes to of course not only as you were
saying seeing troop movement even if
nuclear weapons are being moved that is
of course the first advantage second of
course as far as the Aeneid club is
concerned as you rightly said three
countries and only three countries are a
were capable of space warfare now India
also has that advantage what it does is
also sends a strong signal and message
to China China of course has been
increasing its influence you know maybe
be the South China Sea be the Strait of
Malacca China of course is trying to
show that it is the Big Brother here
you know in the South Asian region
certainly sending a strong message to
China not just that if we see another
big impact as far as superpower arms
ability is concerned India has now
entered that elite club now India is
showing that it is also a superpower
it's a strong message to the world also
to our neighbor like Pakistan of course
we had our tensions you know at its peak
oppose the Bala Code strike so it's
certainly strange a strong message or to
the world most importantly as far as the
indigenous capability of India is
concerned
absolutely this was done totally by the
DRDO this is completely indigenous so of
course it is a step you know as far as
in the right direction as far as
indigenous capability of India is
concerned this entire test was done
planned totally indigenously as far as
BRD was concerned so you know it
certainly shows the the capability Oh
which India scientists have definitely
under you know when you're talking about
research and indigenous research and
development you know we will be very
soon becoming familiar with the term
research in India you know this is the
beginning I would say when it comes to
space activities and space technologies
India has always had an upper hand here
and they have proven their mettle DRDO
I'm sure you know with in tacit support
with Israel also these achievements have
been you know carried out as of now and
research in India you know when we talk
about acquiring defense equipments or
you know getting or a file or make from
from foreign countries what we lag
behind or what we were lucky lagging
behind till now was you know the
research activities you know whether if
the students if the if the scholars
research scholars are conducting proper
research and they are being properly
funded you know they're it's not it
won't be too late when India would
actually be designing and developing all
those cutting-edge defense equipments
and remember this satellite tracking and
satellite demolition in space also you
know gives an upper hand when it comes
to intercontinental ballistic missiles
you know those ICBMs which can transcend
from one continent to another to track
them again you need satellite
their movement and to counter those
satellites if you have to put an
anti-missile shield over the country
these satellites help you to detect the
movement of a particular incoming
missile and how you can best counter
them so if if this technology is if or
if this capability for any country can
be neutralized I think the battle is
half won
well absolutely so in conclusion as far
as mission shakti is concerned it's a
step in the right direction an important
step as far as securing india's you know
India is concerned economically and of
course as far as security and a
strategic point of view is concerned
certainly it is a historic day for the
country and definitely and remember
those who are wondering what Donald
Trump was talking about when he said
space force your people might have taken
it with a pinch of salt there but as of
now what it looks like is if the for if
if the war is to be fought in space
India is ready for it and trust me with
this development and entering the elite
space club India is not leaving any
stone unturned to prove its mettle even

SfU7oBU0mtk,Pakistan PM Imran Khan: Indo-Pakistan Relations To Remain Tense Till Lok Sabha Elections 2019,Imran Khan said that he fears further military hostilities with India in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections. PM Narendra Modi ...,2019-03-27T07:00:21Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SfU7oBU0mtk/hqdefault.jpg,"hello and welcome you are watching
musics and musics on YouTube we have
another rant from Pakistan Imran Khan is
once again pointing fingers at India
blaming New Delhi for its failure to
counter terrorism on its soil itself
looks like pakistan Prime Minister
Imran Khan is running short of any
agenda and this time around once again
he says that the country Pakistan is
afraid that there will be more military
actions against Pakistan before the
Indian elections why he says so because
he believes that the elections in India
are going to be fought over issues that
how India deals with Pakistan however
Imran Khan must not forget that India is
the largest democracy of the world and
it focuses on basic issues like
education defense sanitation and other
activities growth of the very basic
people focuses on agriculture all these
things what are missing from Pakistan's
agenda when it comes to elections it is
well known to the world that election is
fought in Pakistan only on the basis of
anti-indian sentiments and that's why
the army still holds the sway over the
any ruling government whoever comes to
power this time it is PTI's Imran Khan
who is considered to be the poster boy
of ISI and the army both now he goes on
to say shritha that Jesse Muhammad and
Pakistan government have no links again
do you don't you think
Imran Khan is failing to read the
writing on the wall what the global
community is telling Pakistan loud and
clear
he's ignoring it and just as a kid I
would say if I may say so he is fixed on
the part that yes India is to be blamed
for terror Amin emanating from Pakistani
soil how's it possible he's fighting
like a kid if I if I could put it like
that and you know it's important to
point out that in his latest interview
to an international media organization
is reiterated those lies again
he continues to maintain that the fact
that India may strike you know Pakistan
once again is due to elections in India
not acknowledging the fact that the
country Pakistan continues to harbor
terrorists they continue to support
terrorists and India has provided proof
of it again and again you know after the
Pulwama attack we sent out Rocio to the
international community including
Pakistan of the fact that Jessie
Mohammed operates on Pakistani soil that
dossier was rejected just like the
dossier we sent after the Mumbai terror
attack so while on one hand in Ron can
you know continues to sideline all the
evidence that has been provided by India
over the course of last 10 oh you know
one decade - about last ten years that
it is Pakistan in fact a country that
harbors terrorists that support
terrorists if not Pakistani admitted
ministration then the ISI or the
Pakistani army that those documentation
and that evidence has been sidelined has
been neglected and here you have the you
know harbinger of change so-called
change who continues to propagate the
idea of Naya Pakistan who goes on to
continue and repeat those lies on
international forum yeah absolutely let
me go to one line here which is you know
while speaking to one of the
international publications Imran Khan
says and I quote here we cannot take the
stance any more where you have these
armed groups in our country we cannot
afford being blamed for any terrorist
activity like Pulwama like what happened
now one should wonder what does Imran
Khan mean with this because we have his
own deputy his own left inant shah
mahmud Qureshi clearly saying in an
interview with CNN that yes jessamine
jessamine but chief Masood Azhar is in
Pakistan and he is recovering from an
terminal illness such kind of in-depth
knowledge about a man who has been
branded as a terrorist as a global
terrorist shah mahmud courtesy Qureshi
says yes we know he is in Pakistan and
here we have Imran Khan the prime
minister again going the left hand
doesn't know what the right hand is
doing and he goes on to say that there
is no link between
gesture
and Pakistani government it it's a
clearly a double-talk and this does not
convey any message this only shows how
Pakistan doesn't know what to do as of
now it's it's deterring stance against
terrorism they they haven't come up with
any concrete action beat any other
terrorist attack in India beat on the
Western Front areas in Pakistan this has
as of now orders rule for that matter in
Afghanistan also to destabilize the
peace situation there all these things
if I'm wrong can choose is to ignore it
remains to be seen how long it can
survive like that because the global
community is fast taking cognizance of
of all the Sharad that Imran Khan has
been pulling and the previous
administrations have been doing in
Pakistan beat Germany beat France beat
UK us all of them have made the the
message amply clear that concrete
verifiable and irreversible action has
to be taken and then only a process of
negotiation a process of change of
stance good start let's quickly sum this
up punkish for our view was basically
three things that come out of that
interview first he's blaming India for
another air strike saying that in view
of Elections India could conduct another
air strike sidelining the fact that they
continue to you know support terror
groups and that's the reason why India
might strike the terror groups not to
civilians not the army camps not the
army establishment but only terror
groups a preemptive strike just like
Paulo quote it could happen we never
know but this has got nothing to do with
electorate fills the second lie he
continues to propagate is the fact that
Pakistan is cracking down on terror
organization so we have seen the history
over the course of last many many years
when Pakistan says it has it is cracking
down on terror many terrorists are in
house arrest they then float political
parties they continue to roam around and
you know happily enjoy in Pakistani
territory and the third lie of course is
that we do not support terror and Jesse
Mohammed does not operate out of the
Pakistani soil we have provided evidence
to the contrary so these are the three
lies in toto that Imran Khan continues
to propagate in the international
community

hello and welcome you're watching The X
Factor with me Neha Khanna big focus
tonight
just a few weeks ago the Pakistani Air
Force valley to the engineer space
crossing the line of control in
retaliation against India's air strike
symbolic or carried out in the aftermath
of the poll gamma terror attack not only
was this Pakistani act of aggression
successfully repulsed by the interne Air
Force they even lost one of their f-16
fighter jets shot down by a rather older
about to be phased out mig-21 bison for
a long time now India's defense forces
have talked about the need for
modernization and upgraded and
sophisticated weaponry given the
country's geography and the security
challenges it faces on several fronts in
line with that demand for Chinook heavy
lift helicopters made in the US have now
been inducted into the Indian Air Force
the first four of the Chinook
helicopters which were ordered from
Boeing in September 2015 have been
commissioned into the Internet forces
126 helicopter unit the helicopter can
carry out military operations not only
during the day but at night too Chinook
is an advanced multi-role helicopter
that will provide the internet force
with strategic airlift capability across
the spectrum of combat and humanitarian
missions speaking on the occasion of its
induction Indian Air Force chief des
dhanoa said the induction of the Chinook
one of the best in this category will be
a game-changer
the winner of fall is going to be in the
fighter fleet he said and I quote our
country faces a multitude of security
challenges and will require vertical
lift capability across a very
diversified terrain significantly the
air chief described not for the first
time there are far jets - as a
game-changer and added that the Internet
Force will receive a massive boost in
his combat capability with the induction
of the rofl fighter and that Pakistan
will not come anywhere near the line of
control or the international border
he said the roof on is superior to any
fighter jet in the arsenal Reviva the
Pakistani Air Force or China's of course
there are fire fighter JD has been mired
in a political controversy for a long
time now with Congress president Rahul
Gandhi accusing Prime Minister Modi of
being personally involved in corruption
Prime Minister speaking after the Bala
code airstrikes in fact had remarks had
the congress-led UPA government not
delayed the purchase of Rafal jets India
would have been in a much stronger
position today the first row file jet
will arrive in India in September this
year the remaining 35 are expected to be
delivered by Frances destroy aviation by
2022 and that's not all
India has signed to deal words three
billion dollars with Boeing in the US
government to procure 22 Apache and 15
Chino helicopters as part of the
modernization of the Indian Air Force's
Arsenal and as much as the Air Force
danos the first indigenous long-range
artillery gun meant to be an up
tradition of the Beaufort artillery gun
is being inducted into the Indian Army
the first batch of six guns will be
deployed along the China and Pakistan
frontiers by the end of the earth there
will be 18 just last month the defence
ministry along with the Indian army
approved the bulk production order of
118 of these guns the question we are
asking on the show tonight
is this from both foster AFOL have our
defence forces over the years and
decades unfairly suffered on account of
politics and political controversies
over various defense deals is it time to
divorce politics from our national
security interests and from those of our
armed forces on Monday the Indian Air
Force inducted four of the 15 Chinook
strategic heavy lift helicopters at the
Chandigarh India Air Force Station again
on Monday the 16th s here the light
combat aircraft made in India fighter
jet of India pages 16th production was
sat done under the IOC again the third
major achievement as for the entire
making India's concern is the issuance
of the first batches of the Dhanush
artillery guns which are also called I
call as the a modern before guns they
are being there the first batches are
being issued in Jabalpur it's ready and
the next few days it will be issued in
addition to that you will have the
scorpion second submarine Ayanna's
Kundera being commissioned in the navy
our next man
then you'll have approximately six
months from now the air fire fighter
jets touching down Indian soil and if
you see the entire sequence of events
there have been lot of inductions and
commissioning sir as far as the defense
preparedness murder than the
modernization of the Armed Forces are
concerned all right so what does this
mean for the Indian Air Force and our
armed forces to talk about that I'm
joined here in the studio by a group
captains and the America defense expert
Major General Dhruv Couture also defense
expert with us particulate pine
strategic affairs analyst on our
political panel Pallavi Sharma
spokesperson for the Congress we're also
hoping to be joined in a moment by China
in seals the BJP lately go to the non
politicians first group captain Sandeep
metha you've retired from the internet
force let me begin with you
now the air force chief on the occasion
of the induction of the Chinook said
that you know our country faces a
multitude of security challenges and we
require vertical lift capability across
a very diverse terrain the Chinook is
one of the best in its category and will
be a game-changer the way that a fall is
going to be in the fighter fleet if for
the benefit of our viewers you could
explain how the Chinook helicopters are
expected to be a real game-changer for
the internet force absolutely you see
heavy lift in in vertical envelope has
been a deficiency of the Indian Air
Force you know earlier we were we were
having only me 26 for a long time there
the numbers were less and there was the
serviceability was an issue and we had
serious issues we faced it even after
the Uttarakhand disaster when the relief
effort started over there and especially
in a strategic scenario like the chief
even elaborated on it that you know
inducting troops and in a quick time
using helicopters is one part but in in
altitude regions which is the kind of
borders we face with both China and
Pakistan it is important to have your
ready troops who are attempted already
it helped you to be inducted in the
right theta in the right time so that is
where this kind of capability
to be a game changer like that in all
aspects you know for disasters or any
other aspects plus it's a latest
technology with a night vision
capability and and you know all the best
possible aids all together
it's a beautiful platform and and we are
getting in good numbers 15 so it'll it
will really boost the air for strategic
heavy lift capability all right Jen with
the toast before we talk about your fall
with you in the rest of the panel let's
talk for a moment about Thanos which is
also being inducted into the Indian army
now this is an indigenous long-range
artillery gun which correct me if I'm
wrong is meant to be essentially a
replacement for the Beaufort gun yes now
the first batch of six guns are are
being deployed along the China Pakistan
frontiers by the end of the year we are
expected to have eighteen and a total of
118 have been approved you are an
ex-army Minh sir if you could explain to
our viewers the significance of the
induction of the Dhanush into the Indian
Army and what this kind of modernization
really means for armed forces but you
know when you look at it this way for
thirty years we are the are no new
artery can came into the Indian Army
thirty four thirty long years now once
we procured the Bofors we found the
worth of the Bofors in the Kargil
conflict they played an outstanding role
the question of the Bofors was that when
we purchased the Bofors we had also
purchased the the you know we were given
the permission to actually manufacture
this gun so we had paid for that and for
some reason we just let that lapse
now I think that was a very serious
deficiency because if we should have
actually gone on with the production of
the Bofors right at that stage itself
right indigenous production but anyway
now that we have come down to it we have
got the dilution now which is an
advanced version it is an improved
version of what the buffers work but it
is based really on the same system okay
so I think it's an absolutely an
outstanding gun that we have got now
which can be used both in the
both in the planes and the motor in this
areas now for the planes we've also got
the budget which is the self-propelled
gun' and for the mountains we have also
got the EM triple7 when you take the
fleet of all these three types of guns
which are being inducted into the Indian
Army it gives you a tremendous
capability as far as fire pie is
concerned which is going to prove
crucial in any battle which will be
crucial in any battle and let's not
forget that as the a chicken sells
pointed out
India's geography is such we feel
security challenges on multiple fronts
there is Pakistan there is China for us
to contend with and let's not forget
what happened just a few days ago in the
aftermath of the bell acute air strikes
we actually had the year the pakistan
air force violates the Indian airspace
trust the line of control it's now the
matter that that act of aggression was
repulsed and one of our mig-21 Bisons
actually managed to shoot down the
highly sophisticated and technologically
far superior f-16 I want to bring in
particulate fine at this point you know
since we are talking about what happened
between India and Pakistan a few days
ago you can't not talk about the Rafal
because days after the ball occurred air
strikes the Prime Minister while
addressing a rally said had the purchase
of the roof falls not been delayed by
the then congress-led UPA government the
Indian Armed Forces would have been in a
much stronger position even if he leave
aside for a moment what the prime
minister said because there's been too
much of a political war between the
Communists and the BJP over this the air
chief has been at pains to say not once
but several times over that the Rafal
fighter jet will be an absolute game
changer for the inland air force and
with its induction
Pakistan will not come anywhere near the
line of control or the international
border it won't dare to do so he then
goes on to say that the Rafal is way
superior to any fighter jet in the
arsenal of both the Pakistan Air Force
and the Chinese Air Force personally you
know I'm sure you would agree with this
assessment but to that extent how
significant is the induction of the
Chinook how significant and
game-changing will be the induction of
the ROA fall as in when it
is expected to begin in September this
year and then once we've talked about
this treaty the strategic significance
we will also need to dwell on the
politics that has impacted defense deals
over the years yeah there has been a
shortage at five areas helicopters
artillery air defense assault rifles
bulletproof jackets we proved that when
we talk about helicopters Shalhoub
helicopters Apache helicopters these
deals were you know hanging in balance
during the UK era they didn't clear it
the name in triple7 Hauser talked about
you'd had so I would just add one more
thing the raffle is one part of it which
is extremely crucial the other part is
that s400 a different system that India
has signed for in addition to the
medium-range surface-to-air missile deal
with Israel which was signed couple of
years back there has been a wide array
of you know Lupul systems which has been
acquired and there has been a push
forget about big-ticket reforms and
big-ticket acquisitions you know the
infantry soldier is fighting day in and
day out with the terrorists and we had
for 20 long years a deficiency of a
basic bulletproof jacket and the
efficiency is how we know the very last
alright for the judges ask ask any of
the generals yes they will agree the
incest literally does not you know
function in a close quarter battle right
now what has happened the sick so I had
72,000 has been ordered enough you know
fast-track procedure seven left 50,000 a
K 2203 which will be manufactured in
Russian collaboration for years we were
buying in installments small amounts of
ak-47 why did nobody think about
manufacturing the same in India and
apart from that there is you know a
fundamental shift happening wherein we
are talking about the private sector of
the country which has done good work in
the area of ID sector in the area of
other industries which they are being
you know made part of difference
production as part of strategic
partnership model where a lot more can
be done in this country and they're
being done I repeat artillery
helicopters air defense assault rifles
bulletproof jackets submarines warships
a large number of deals are up and one
last point
thousand crore deal was signed by Army
and Air Force only for ammunition that
was the you know permission that was
given by government because you know
weapon system is one part revolution is
a critical part of it yeah those things
were lacking for a long period of time
the intent was lacking without getting
into politics of it I will say it was
like political politics can go on again
these things are very critical
thankfully now it is happening I hope it
will continue with the next government
whichever government come soon you hope
it continues before adding this to the
political panel mr. panner I want to ask
you one more question because my job
here is to play the devil's advocate of
course you're making some extremely
valid points and you know the fact that
we hopefully lack your bulletproof
jackets is something that not only our
Jevons fighting along the borders have
had to suffer on account of it's
something that we've learned in a very
bitter and hard way even during the
26/11 Mumbai terror attacks but the
question I want to ask you is you're
saying you know why have we not why did
we not initiate the process of
indigenously building a lot of these
many many years ago now that is one of
the criticisms that is being made by the
Congress against a BJP government
asserts that a final deal is concerned
that you've given Hindustan Aeronautics
the go-by instead of the you know
getting 126 and 108 of which we're going
to be manufactured in India you are
buying only 36 at a much higher price in
a flyaway condition okay but in a
flyaway condition so what happened to
make in India there what about
indigenous manufacture so there are
certain is that a blow there somewhere
I'll tell you why in addition to the 36
that has been procured under the tariff
all earthing 114 under the strategic
partnership model will be manufactured
in India with the tin Alliance in a
collaboration with an Indian partner
that is happening right now
90 Indian companies which are offset
partners of the saw reliance is just one
of them
secondly when we talk about indigenous
manufacturing an RFP has been issued to
Hindustan Aeronautics for 83 light
combat aircraft in mark 1
a category 114 are being acquired in
addition to this under the strategic
partnership model where there will be an
Indian partner in case of Hal where was
the problem Hal was asking for two point
seven times more manpower if they had
agreed to this the Soraa file would not
have remained l1 I understand he has
categorically stated okay okay okay let
me now quickly bring in Pallavi and sana
into the conversation Pallavi you've
heard what the panel has to say we have
a two gentlemen who served in the Indian
Army and the Air Force particulate pine
is not a politician either but certainly
a strategic affairs expert all of them
are of the view that the Indian Armed
Forces have suffered over the years in
decades one because of the politics that
we've seen now over various defenses as
I mentioned from both foster default and
number two as mr. pine points out
because there was a lack of political
will is seen especially under the
previous Congress regimes to actually
invest in modernization of our armed
forces it's been a long-standing demand
of the army the Navy and the Air Force
but according to many like mr. pine
nothing moved under the Congress
government but it's only in the last few
years under the moody regime that the
change has begun to happen how would you
respond to that witnesses they have
first and foremost Mr Pyne might have
his own political bias to make a
statement agree with this and he has not
a spoke a tear or any cast aspersions on
him I cannot disagree with him because
he he's an expert when it comes to
matters of Defense and knows much more
than I do I'm a political spokesperson
he's a defense expose much more than
Dragon him but it's lying about they're
not making a statement hi if despite
that he's making a statement okay I take
my statement but even he is not aware of
the facts or even he has purposely
chosen to miss Lee so the fact number
one is this between 2012 to 2013 the
last years of the Congress government
was survey we made defense procurements
worth seven thousand corrode it's on
record
these are triple seven howitzers 145
lightweight howitzers
were sanctioned in the procurement for
sanctioned by the okay
Manavi says sanction the thorns but
Egret pine says the contracts were never
signed Paula we complete your point and
then I will go to China it also included
65 radars for l78 girls under my barrier
various other defense equipments level
to be brought in the country point
number one point number two when he says
that you know low defense equipment has
been brought in the last seven years
I never so I - I am fine together
however however usually clarifying that
he did not say that nothing happened in
70 and there was the journal and article
the general sense in the Armed Forces
for a very long time
Pallavi has been that modernization and
up predation was a dire need and long
overdue idea number one I substantiate
it with 7000 corrodes worries
point number two what about Sukhoi what
about me Raj what about Tyra suite Ron
they were all purchased when do you feel
government wasn't bad how can he
one second you complete your windows he
has to wait for by a man even the Falls
and malicious treatment she was making
but I did not interrupt it okay come on
you're number three he spoke about the
fire he said that a chill had asked for
more man hours and that is why the deal
was not given to them there's a large
day we saw and all across the world but
we are very happy I don't wanna work for
any political party and while Mr Pyne is
well within his rights to question
Bolivia on any facts that he disagrees
with however I do agree with believe me
when she says that there was that
meeting between the de saucé CEO and HUL
where the sword did say that we are
happy with ETL and then the allegation
made by the Congress and several other
opposition it is this something changed
overnight with an engineer once again Mr
Pyne I need to go to China and Sina
China we will talk about there a file
controversy later but you know first I
want you to focus on the larger question
that we are looking to address here
Pallavi says that you know the UPA
government sanctioned seven thousand
crores worth of funds for defense
equipment of course Mr Pyne doesn't seem
to entirely agree - he says it's a
miniscule amount now your government of
course has been repeatedly accusing the
Congress of not doing anything for the
Armed Forces the Prime Minister himself
has said that you know the armed forces
were just left language while since our
government came in we have clear defense
purchases one after the other
however the question really is trying
our that
hasn't Devon politics by all sides for
example if today the Congress and Rahul
Gandhi are making a true that you did
the same over both falls and as a you
know general Curtis pointed out and as
most military experts will agree the
Bofors turn out to be a fantastic deal a
gun that that helped us win the Kargil
war perhaps and therefore is this not a
political game that all sides of of
guilty of clink firstly that China
artillery better choppers all of that is
a probe on but look at the kind of pure
procurement systems we need to have a
transparency which our government has
endeavored towards whether it's the
pages fighter jets that were procured
more recently or if it is even if you go
into the past
a lot has been said about your file when
the Honorable Supreme Court's obscurely
said there has been no commercial
favoritism so I do not understand why we
key but in China then I can remind you
that nothing China I'm sorry I don't
need to interrupt you she's one one one
clarification there that is according to
the Supreme Court there is prima facie
no wrongdoing in the Rafal deal
something the Congress continues to
reject then well fact is that no
corruption allegations are proven in the
Beaufort skis either the Koch the case
was dismissed by all courts China so the
review petition for the file is still
being heard in this room I find it
endearing I am NOT right now discussing
whether there has been wrongdoing in
Rafal or not it is not for me to say all
I'm saying is China haven't all
political party especially the BJP in
the congress played the same game
something that has caused our armed
forces to suffer therefore hasn't the
time come I am asking both you and
Pallavi hasn't the time come to divorce
politics from the country's strategic
interests and from the interests of our
armed forces
well absolutely
absolutely but that's why I made my
initial point Mahon that there is no
point to get any politics in this this
is a matter of national security this is
a matter of what the Armed Forces needs
and the army if it needs to procure
better vanish artillery or whether it is
better guns or for that matter the four
big weapons that have been procured
during our regime is also something that
we must view objectively and understand
that national security is way above what
a political party is thinking on these
particular issues okay Holloway you've
been wanting to make an intervention
very quickly but we are not going into
whether they were wrongdoing in your
file because we're not in a position to
journal absolutely yeah see first and
foremost I'd like to say this that the
Congress party welcomes any move in a
spectrum of which party is in power in
which party is doing it with respect we
respect and welcome any equipment that
is being brought to strengthen the
Indian Army because that should be of
utmost priority for any government
that's in part that goes without saying
but should we be schooled by a political
party that has given the lowest defence
budget since 1962 to our defense forces
and is now going chest-thumping saying
oh we are the only political party
legacy of this country that is
strengthening the defense forces okay
number two they have snatched away the
medical benefits from our armed forces
there's no more medical benefits are
being given to the CSA is that the
equipment 68% of the okay now you go to
the experts ah we've heard the
politician so this to to me will
continue while the BJP says that we have
made more defense equipment acquisitions
than previous Congress government's
pallavi's are insisting that now we have
the lowest defense budget in decades but
group captain sandy Panetta I know that
you're somebody who would not want to
talk about politics but the unfortunate
reality is that even our armed forces do
get dragged into politics that there has
been politics over one defense deal
after another in this country whether we
like it or not and our armed forces have
some
on account of that what is your take on
that entire issue and how do we prevail
enough political parties regardless of
who is in power and who is in opposition
do not politic over something as
sensitive as a national security yeah
you're absolutely right in saying
howsoever
uncomfortable we may feel but two things
the politics and corruption allegations
these two have plagued our defense
procurement for last two three decades
to an extent that our defense
preparedness is getting affected the
basic question still remains who's
responsible responsibility it is to
equip the forces is it only the Chiefs
who are going to stand up in line and
make them make their less points have to
come from the government correct exactly
so the point is it is being made out as
where it is chief the national defense
is only the responsibility of the three
service chiefs where where as everybody
should be working in tandem here see the
net that the net effect was that finally
we came out with a 2006 DPP procedure
Yemen procedure how did it help it only
elongated the whole process and now at
every step and it any tendering process
anything can be questioned what can be
asked to go back and question it further
it only causes further delay absolutely
so and indigenous capability
unfortunately has absolutely failed to
match up with the requirement of the
nation okay indigenous capability has
failed to match up I think that is an
important point that you are making but
general to torch you would agree there
Armed Forces have suffered on account of
this urban politics how change it you
know I'll tell you one thing I just give
you the impression in the armed forces
and it is got nothing to do with any
political absolutely in my personal view
and I've spoken to every single defense
of Defense officer you know the upa upa
one and UPA - as far as defense was
concerned is considered today a period
of total disaster
where nothing moved and I think Antony
to that extent mister and do you believe
they Rock you see it doesn't no I won't
say it's either bureaucracy or political
will that we can sort out later the
question was nothing move and I feel
very hurt about that you see you know
even if you take a deal like Rafael
Rafael should have been concluded in UPA
- okay
everything was done at all the papers
are in order
hmm right the question we have to be
told it why did Anthony put enough
clause in that deal okay that da so
we'll stand guaranty for huh okay he put
in that clause and then the different
secretary said well the baby is dead why
did he kill this deal Yeah right
why is it that for those 10 years I
moved in the Ministry of Defense okay
and I think it reflects very poorly on
the whole system okay that when we are
looking at that's finally changing now
yes in the last couple of years I
personally know efforts which is
unbelievable you know Marie the late
Manohar Parrikar who served as a fine
defense minister I'm completely out of
time but Mr Pyne I'll give you the last
word you know let's let's forget about
BJP verses Congress here for a moment
let's look at the big picture more than
3 lakh crore worth of defense contracts
have been signed in the last four years
and all that free lakh crore has been
approved by defense acquisition comes in
today today every procurement takes two
three years time man it is not buying
grocery for what is it this movement has
to be continuous whichever party comes
in the power
okay we don't have the time
okay let's not listen to a shouting
match I request both of you we do not
have the time to now go back in history
and look into the merits of the deals
that were struck or not struck however
one thing that we can all agree on is
that national security has to be
paramount the interests of our armed
forces have to be paramount and there
must be no compromise on that and
certainly no politics over it is that
gonna change anytime soon time alone
will tell well that's it to me then
thanks very much for watching inside
famous watt panel for joining us

R3MhmD0OLXQ,Was Former PM Lal Bahadur Shahtri Killed? Why Shastri&#39;s Wife was Suspicious? The Tashkent Files,"As The Tashkent Files trailer releases, there are several question which are raised. Was Former PM Lal Bahadur Shahtri Killed?",2019-03-26T15:34:09Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R3MhmD0OLXQ/hqdefault.jpg,"are you watching us of musics and news
Xu - BAM - of karate mechanic devika's
with me and the simple question we are
asking is was the former prime minister
of this country null Bahadur Shastri
killed in Tashkent the reason this is
come up is because after a new book
vivica a new film is about to come out
called the Tashkent Files which is
trying to address this question what's
the film about then we examined what the
issues are right as you mentioned we
also spoke with the director of the
movie and he says that during the course
of the past years the issue came up and
he carried out his own investigation
which he's now converted into the film
butchers of course are said to release
it is of course addressing some
pertinent issues surrounding this
mysterious death of a former prime
minister okay so now let's examine was
something suspicious or not this vivica
is that one color photograph of Shastri
which his wife found very very
suspicious because she found everything
around this very suspicious when he came
back what is this photograph actually
showing us there you go right so if we
can like zoom in into this photograph
and show to our viewers this is that
last photograph - the fight found now
you clearly see that the photograph that
the face in this photograph is bloated
so that was the first thing that she
found suspicious but it doesn't end
there there's a lot happening with this
particular photograph
they were also Rishabh quite
suspiciously dark blue marks that were
found on camera closer right here I
would look so that we knew that
immediately after his death the Soviets
had done some sort of embalming process
but what his wife found very suspicious
was that there was bloating of the face
and you can see it's even though I know
this a bit grainy but you can see the
bluish tinge the dark bluish tinge on on
the face that his wife found very
suspicious though the face was bloated
they were dark blue marks and the body
itself was bloated despite the fact that
had been embalmed and these were the six
suspicions that Shastri's wife Devika
had if we look at look at them one at a
time there were six suspicions that she
had take us through the first one the
of course cut marks that were found on
Shastri G's body as well as his back the
back of his neck
quite suspiciously had a cut mark and as
per you know reports from back then off
his family also who also spoke out and
who were there when the body came back
they said that the cloth was in fact
soaked in blood from the cut marks that
were found at the battlefield I bought
the debate around this was that were the
cut marks something suspicious all what
the cut marks done postmortem as part of
an examination or the embalming process
and the counter debate to this was that
this was not in fact blood this was
actually embalming fluid that was
seeping out and that's why there was a
reddish tinge on the cloth that was that
was covering his body the second of
course is something that we were
discussing in the photograph was the
bluish marks that were all over the body
and face whether this was some sort of
bruising or indicative of some sort of
poisoning was something that was never
really resolved if you look at the third
thing that she found very suspicious was
that the body had bloated now this was
despite the fact that almost immediately
the body was embalmed so this was very
suspicious of why the body had bloated
despite the fact that it was very
quickly in bombed by the Soviet doctors
who were present on the on the side this
is what Shastri's wife found very very
suspicious the second thing was a
post-mortem now the Soviets and if you
read the book that arose that has
written the Soviets had offered a
post-mortem to be done but the Indian
side now the prime minister is dead so
somebody in India had to make a call
right that the post mortem need not be
done and instead his body should be
brought back to India
what examination was done on the after
he was brought back to India was never
publicly released nor was it released of
the family so that's going to be a deep
suspicion regarding the post mortem why
was it not done in Russia and when the
body was back what investigations were
done and what are the results of the
investigation
when will we actually find out and this
is the point that I was just making is
that the Russians had odd offered point
number five you bring up the Russians
had offered to do a post-mortem but that
offer had been rejected now who made
that decision to reject that postmortem
remains imp
and of course the sixth point is and
this has been quoted Shastri's late wife
has been quoted several times that she
wanted a probe to be done but this probe
was declining she wanted a probe to
happen but several times this propos
declined that prop was never done so
this is something very suspicious if we
now look at the last photographs often
Al Bahadur Shastri arrived alive have a
look at this first photograph here
coming up on your screens this is one of
the last few photographs you can see
Lars Bahadur Shastri here right and this
is a ute Khan who was the Pakistani
dictator general with whom the agreement
was being signed and you can see the
whole host of Soviet photographers and
and that are there that are taking this
photo right so this is one of the last
photographs that you can see of Shastri
alive
he seems perfectly fine he seems hale
and hearty and if you look at the next
photograph of him actually signing the
agreement have a look so this is the
photograph of him signing the agreement
this is Shastri sitting these are
members of the Indian Indian delegations
sitting sitting with him and have a look
at this photograph you can clearly see
that he was a slight man in Arvada
Shastri but this is literally you're
talking about hours before his death
there was no indication at this point of
time at all that if this was a natural
death in case of a heart attack no
indication of that you can have a
surprise heart attack the last
particular photograph of Shastri life
was when he was if I'm taking taking
that walk if I don't remember if I
remember correctly I here it is now this
is the last photograph after the signing
of Tashkent declaration where Shastri is
seen alive and you can see larva the
Shastri you can see Ayub Khan and of
course you can see anak sake Kosygin who
was the Soviet premier standing with
them so Shastri ru kannan and alexei
having that conversation you can see
Shastri here now as I mentioned was a
slight man he did have a habit to slouch
but otherwise is he standing and he
seems perfectly all right so this is one
of the last photographs the next
photograph of course is actually of the
funerary procession so this is of course
an exact pose again and I you can
carrying carrying
Kaskade that was in which there is lava
has velocities body and of course this
is being taken to the airport to be
repatriated to India so this is the next
day the last photograph of course is
where we began this entire conversation
was the funeral that took place in India
so suspicions have remained they have
not been answered and it yet remains to
be seen that both the concerns of
chastity his wife he had made that one
last phone call back home why that
post-mortem wasn't conducted in Russia
who made the call that the post-mortem
need not be conducted in Russia
what were the cut marks and the bruising
and bloating due to was it because of
the embalming process will was it due to
something else
did somebody examine the last glass of
milk - Shastri had before he went to bed
cool Deeb hire who was there with him a
journalist is no longer with us but he
wrote her immense treatise on what he
saw as an eyewitness account that
examination can be closely examined
several of these questions that remain
unanswered and several of these
questions are being raised in the book
uh nazar is written and of course in the
movie - tashkent files is now coming out
so we're trying to collate what's
happened what we know the information
they have the photographs that we have

YouTube I am do shibulata my colleague
Gauri is with me and we are here to
discuss that if Narendra Modi comes back
as Prime Minister for a second term
what's the Pakistan plan going to be one
thing is obvious Gauri this time there
will be no invitations for a swearing-in
ceremony no handshakes no hugs
I know impromptu stopping at Nawaz
Sharif granddaughter's wedding either so
there's going to be complete clarity
that no trade no talks and terror are
gonna happen simultaneously India's
gonna be very very clear on that
surprise so that ship has sailed so this
is not going to be a conversation with
Imran and umber on me anyway is a
different beast - what anniversary was
Nawaz Sharif at leas had some to and fro
NT that aunty thesis to the army Imran
is the Army's guy so there is no
absolute no hope that we're gonna see in
the next couple of years some again
hugging going on so that's out of the
window that chapter is closed that's how
this potential second term for Modi will
be different from the first term of Bodi
the second thing is this concept now
that instead of waiting for the world to
force them to make Pakistan act now we
are telling the world stop us from
acting on us back or else exam and
that's how we got the wing commander
I've been on that back within 48 hours
because a clear message went to the
world that if they don't return him it's
your responsibility that we will act and
it's your responsibility now to hold us
back and it's a template that has been
said that I think the Modi government is
only going to real force in the next
term which is going to be again you know
sending a message not just to Pakistan
but also globally so the basic
difference between what the earlier
strategy was in today's strategy or the
likely strategy going ahead is going to
be that where earlier we were giving
evidence proof diplomatic diplomatic
maneuvering lobbying other countries to
get them to act against Pakistani terror
now we are telling countries this is
what's happened this is what we intend
to do if you don't want that to happen
this is what Pakistan needs to do
immediately and if they don't do it
we'll go ahead and then so be the
consequences so that's going to be a
difference the third Gouri that we can
expect for our new second terminal arena
Modi is to create a larger space between
the Terrorism proxy warfare that takes
place and straight to
you clear that there is a space in
between and something like Mallicoat has
proved that yes exactly and also it has
busted once and for all
you know the Pakistani bogey that I know
we can also take the nuclear option that
is not an option that Pakistan is ever
going to take that movie has been
completely busted and India is only
going to reinforce its status from here
on air strikes never used except for the
1971 more that's a template that moody
government is going to so so air strikes
I'm not saying naval blockades are a
certainty but a Navy Indian Navy
menacing the Pakistani ports main port
in Karachi the main port in bother you
can expect more of this with with that
entire thesis that either its proxy war
or its nuclear that is now being
dismantled so you can expect more of
that in a potential second term of
Narendra Modi the big ticket however
move is going to be an economic
engagement with the Saudis you have now
MBS now mahmoud bin salam has taken over
basically the functioning of saudi
arabia's chief executive yes and he is
looking to diversify his economy as he
needs to away from oil to diversify the
economy pakistan is going to be not
helpful India is yes and I think that
has been very clearly laid out and that
economic deal with the Saudis deprives
Pakistan of their one major all-weather
allies absolutely so a deeper bilateral
engagement with Saudis exploring other
options apart from the oil engagement
that India and Saudis have is going to
be very very crucial in ensuring yes as
we have said cutting that cap for
funding for Pakistan if India and Saudis
do have a deeper economic engagement it
spells death knell is very clear India
as the size of the economy this how you
leverage the economy in foreign policy
that we are an economy this big Pakistan
is an economy this big they are an
economic drain the country is bankrupt
is relying on emergency loans from Saudi
Arabia UAE China to just stay afloat
literally just to pay their pay their
food and water bills so if you want to
diversify away from oil and engage in
different kinds of economic activities
with India then Saudi Arabia you can't
be helping out Pakistan and it is more
than just likely that the Saudis played
an important role in what happened with
wing commander Robin and then they
carried that message across that listen
if you guys don't return him there will
be hell to pay and and the Saudis are
already playing that
and it was no no coincidence that
Muhammad Wilson first went to Pakistan
came back he went back to his country
and then came to India keeping the
sensitivities in very very interesting
and so deal with the Saudis you can
expect more on that front very certainly
in a second term of honor in their Modi
then China you tackle China half your
Pakistani problems go away because then
Pakistan loses the last friend it has
yes and Pakistan will never asana will
never be your great friend but it can be
a pragmatic partner and again the
economy in this matters because China is
very clear it has to keep its own
interests above everything else which is
where the engagement at India has with
China in terms of economy is going to be
very important sixty seven billion
dollars growing at eight percent per
annum so so let's put that figure into
perspective the entire cost of the OBE
or the CPEC part which is going through
Pakistan in Pakistan is about fifty
billion u.s. dollars that is the entire
cost of building the CEPA corridor
that's the model knows the Chinese have
given to Pakistan India's China's trade
per year forget in total per year is
already crossing a hundred billion
dollars of a sixty seven billion dollars
is how much money China makes so China
in one year makes more profit in
cross-border trade with India then the
entire cost of the CPEC project that's
how that's how the economies of scale
actually work out so if India and
Chinese trade is expected to hit about
three hundred billion dollars which is
most likely is going to growing at eight
to ten percent a year so by the time in
ten years time you're talking about
tripling of trade if that is going to
take place you're talking about about
150 200 billion dollars versus forty
billion dollars it becomes a very
pragmatic thing the second pragmatic
thing is that the Chinese are as
antithetical to fundamental radical
terrorists as anyone in the world they
don't want to do in fact China also
absolutely and in their backyard they
are taking draconian steps that Pakistan
is not talking about that Saudi Arabia
is not talking about but they are taking
those Rakuten steps because they don't
want an entire entire population of
 as has been put into internment
camps indoctrination camps in by the
hundreds of thousands not a few by the
hundreds of thousands and and that is
something that China is very very
careful about so the only reason
actually the defending Park
son on things like Massoud is because
they fear that Massoud in the GM will
then turn that terror attacks on to CPEC
corridor projects rather than on to
India and that's the principal fear you
make the economic cost more palpable and
potentially gory even dangle that in
this entire region things over project
there is no way in the world o war can
be successful without the big elephant
in the middle which you can't make it
work so if you say ok we are willing to
have this conversation with you perhaps
build through India using our existing
infrastructure give you access in
through Nepal into into Tibet to trade
to oil and other things then the entire
need for C peg through Gwadar also
starts to diminish and that makes it
very very haughty for China that's
another way you you take away the
constant support the Chinese gives the
diplomatic military that Jets the
Pakistani Jets you look at the National
Day the Jets were from China the tanks
were from China the main people who got
awards were Chinese so so a large part
of that gets get dealt with
ok the next part is dealing with the
Afghan ease this is going to be really
important especially something that is
not an on on the public agenda in India
we will see almost forgetting that the
US couldn't leave Afghanistan the
Taliban is Pakistan's proxy we need to
deal with that so India has invested
very heavily in Afghanistan in the last
five years you know we have spent more
than a billion and a half dollars in
Afghanistan whether it is direct aid
whether it is in terms of those dams
those water projects we are investing
very heavily there and most importantly
of monies hate Pakistanis they
absolutely detest Pakistan is the
understand what is it that they have
done to their country if India can
utilize this position to its advantage
it could have a huge impact a solid
basically we have to see a potential
second term of a Narendra Modi
government spending a lot of diplomatic
muscle and time trying to deny Pakistan
placing pro-pakistan
talabani proxies into some sort of power
equation in Afghanistan which is what
they want to do so we want the current
regime which is very friendly towards
India and as I mentioned hates the
Pakistanis because they've been
terrorizing the country although all
these years and even the Taliban that
comes in potentially and they
get the entire pro-park sullivan lobby
people over sadly more pragmatic and
relies Pakistan the enemy so if we nail
that and you can imagine that a large
part of a potential second term if it is
going to involve energy doable is going
to be spent on this then the solar
Alliance now the reason the solar
Alliance actually deals with Pakistan is
that China is already the world's
largest producer of solar power and it
is growing many foreign I mean they're
literally they're doubling tripling is
the scale we are starting the solar
Alliance that's going to be the eventual
not immediate but eventual replacement
of things like things like oil this is
going to bring India and China closer
together they will and at the same time
but you know that is where it would be
very important to also keep India
sovereign interests in mind because you
know this is where it could get very
tricky this and over are the two things
I think reserve where Modi government's
second tenure its foreign policy would
actually be tested how maturely they
handle but if you nail it and that gives
you a lot more rev leverage in not
friends with China but in the
partnership with China pragmatic
partnership with China and every step
you take with China is a step China
takes away with away from Pakistan which
helps
we are already piloting a resolution in
the United Stated nations that is going
to define terrorism for the first time
so that these Pakistani terrorists can't
be defined by the world as militants
exactly and that's really important also
which also means that India is getting
backed by the world so and a lot of the
United Nations working is getting
regrouped it's getting realigned it's
also you know there is new thinking that
is coming in and a lot of that is driven
by India because it wants that you know
there should be new thinking in in in
the UN the the next thing is we've
already seen India was the guest of
honor at the OIC which is the
Organization of Islamic countries okay
that is literally parks only friend
friend friendly Club right now okay the
Saudis are the principal players there
including several of these Eastern
European countries if we can and very
likely you can say expect that in a
second term under either Modi a big
pushes push made to give India with its
huge Muslim population of 150 million
people and entry into oh I see not maybe
as a full member but as an observer
so that Pakistan's guarded the the
stranglehold that Pakistan has is gone
and we already saw that this time in UAE
the meeting happened the Pakistan is
actually boycotted they skipped it
because and because the OIC Pervez was
very clear that the invitation to Sushma
Swaraj would not be revoked they were
very clear that India will be the guest
of honor Pakistan had nothing to do
honey and we have friendly countries
where countries like of course
Bangladesh which are very friendly and
of course don't like Pakistan Authority
the Sheikh Hasina government does not
okay final point something called Bibi
ini it's it's an unsexy term right and
we don't often talk about it it's
Bangladesh Bhutan India Nepal this is
the replacement for SAR now we've
already seen SAR become irrelevant and
for good reason over the past five years
you can expect a second term with the
Modi government to actually connect the
dots so when we try to build these
corridors
China has a war plan we have an a South
Asia integration plan excluding Pakistan
so rail networks roadway networks
visa-free access between Nepal
Bangladesh India your open Sri Lanka and
a bit of Myanmar into this you can
create a different economic zone that
Pakistan is left out of but that is
where I think India will have to also
keep in mind how to checkmate China
because you know China has made deepen
routes into these countries which have
traditionally been India's closest
allies so yes how India balances that
would be very interesting because as
Richard mentioned there is over but at
the same time China has been giving out
those easy loans to these countries
which is where India will also to
revisit so the good thing on this is
that Sri Lankans have learned a very
bitter lesson yeah they've lost a humble
dota or to the Chinese because they
couldn't pay back their debt Lankan had
learned a bitter lesson and the present
Lankan regime is more amenable to India
they'll always be playing India and
China off for their own interests the
present Bangladeshi regime Sheikh Hasina
more amenable to India then the Nepalese
still issue to sort out the present the
renewed regime the returning regime in
Maldives also more amenable to India so
creating an economic bloc that excludes
Pakistan by keeping China in check you
can expect that physical integration of
actually getting those those rail links
done those road links done having this
sort of one
one of those Elsi contracts you know the
first Elsi contact lipid tell yourself
that the Prime Minister moody in his
previous government gave was actually to
Tibet it was the first was that thermal
power project to Tibet that is how to
Bhutan a big abundant that is what it
started yes so these are the things that
you can expect to see in taking on
Pakistan so raising the cost to Pakistan
is is one important thing because right
now for every shell that Pakistan fires
on the LOC also they don't have the
money to replace a quarry they just
don't and which is where India will have
to ensure as of now I think it's less
than two weeks even lesser than that
that's so literally all the ammunition
they don't have money there that
desperate they don't have the money they
don't have money to buy ammunition they
don't have the money to buy a motor
shells they don't have the money to buy
artillery shells the more you spend on
defense and the Pakistan tries to keep
up they burn out their money and
eventually the economic economy can't
afford that kind of military military
hardware so that becomes game over so
these are lists of things that you can
expect if an arranged remotely returns
to power these lists of things to take
place that would contain and checkmate
Pakistan completely unlike the first
time around where it was let's give
diplomacy and direct dealing with
Pakistan and other try if you've been

musics and musics on YouTube practice
what you preach is the message from New
Delhi to Pakistan's prime minister Imran
Khan New Delhi has expressed his anger
and dissatisfaction over the forceful
conversion of two minority girls in the
same province of Pakistan the news has
been making headlines since yesterday
and today once again the Ministry of
External Affairs has apprised Pakistan
of its displeasure I have with me my
colleague Shweta who has the list of the
checkered past when it comes to
Pakistan's atrocities on the minorities
shota I'm sure this is not the first
instance of an atrocity on minorities
not the first instance in fact you know
Pankaj Pakistan has a history of
persecuting its minorities now if you
look at the instances over on which you
know Pakistan has done so it's all
detailed and the detailed reports have
been put out years after yours going by
the latest report that came from United
Nations and the report of course on the
human rights violation in Pakistan the
report details as to how the population
of minorities which when you know
Pakistan in India were parted from each
other at that point in time was over 20%
by 1998 census that minority was reduced
to over 3% that is the overall minority
and then that dip is a huge dip from 20%
to down to 3% over the course of four
decades no very long period of time at
the same time India's minority has
flourished India's majority has
flourished while the minority has also
flourished those economically and
socially absolutely both economically
socially and we continue to maintain you
know human our human rights laws our
human right past record is absolutely
unquestionable bankage and we've never
come under the security or the scrutiny
of a global watchdog like Pakistan now
if as for the same report we're also
given to understand that you know it's
not just Hindus which are persecuted
also Christians as for the report in
Pakistan you know Pakistan is one of the
worst top five countries to be a
practicing Christian so it's not just
you
Hindus who are persecuted time and again
using their blasphemy laws or using
their voting rights but also it's the
Christians were persecuted and coming to
you know people who practice Islam the
Muslims remedy our Muslims have been
seriously persecuted over the course of
many decades their voting rights have
been denied they have been profiled in
the country and systematically all stood
out of the community so when you talk
about the minority rights or you know
various communities in Pakistan beat
Hindus with Christians or beat Muslims
the record of Pakistan is not very clear
very personal question on Prime Minister
and Ron hunts a very recent statement
when he said that as I promised an
election election season in India and
well the the talks will resume only
after that and secondly the minorities
in India are not properly taken care of
this was one of these statements which
made headlines and India rebuffed it
completely and now when we look at that
statement from this point of view it
clearly looks like you know a person
needs to introspect first before it to
points fingers at India or licious India
on that and speaking of you know the
kind of atrocities the minorities face
in Pakistan it's not just related to the
religious realm of it you know it's
physical its mental violation and the
tortures as well there are forced
conversions first of all then there are
kidnapping of non-muslims and there are
blasphemy arrests as you are mentioning
and attacks on temples and churches this
is something which is a very
synchronised systematic approach to
antagonize the minorities and to keep
them under threat and last but not the
least obviously are the sexual assault
so this is a whole list you know which
was prepared at once again this shows
that to Pakistan needs to do lot more
than what it is doing right now and
maybe you know instead of targeting or
finger-pointing this is the right time
for mr. Imran Khan to actually
introspect and do what it need what
needs to be done and what is the need of

53s4yVrcGVE,Pakistan Minority Report: 2 Hindu Girls Abducted on Holi; Sushma Swaraj Ask Indian HC to Send Report,Pakistan Minority Report: 2 Hindu Girls Abducted on Holi; Sushma Swaraj Ask Indian HC to Send Report - After External Affairs ...,2019-03-25T07:37:38Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/53s4yVrcGVE/hqdefault.jpg,"one of you are watching News likes and
I'm an actual preteen the top focus of
this bulletin of course the war of words
between sushma swaraj the External
Affairs Minister and the Pakistan inb
Minister of War of world remember has
broken out between the two of them best
over the reported abduction and forced
conversion and underaged are Hindu girls
in Pakistan sent Romans this pad started
after Sushma Swaraj sought details from
the Indian on Roy in Islamabad too much
Pakistan replied saying that it's
Pakistan's internal matter and that an
inquiry has already been initiated into
the matter he had the audacity remember
to say that Pakistan and like India is
in the land by religious minorities are
subjected to atrocities Sushma Swaraj a
member told into the Pakistan register
rightly pointing out that a mirror
report is making Pakistan so jittery
clearly there is something fishy on
their guilty conscience is now making
them spell out all those bogus arguments
and of course that is a big story which
we are going to be tracking today on a
news X as far as minorities is concerned
the condition of minorities and the
atrocities which they have been facing
in Pakistan is not new but now war of
words is broken out
it's a Twitter spat which has happened
between Sushma Swaraj's moustache the
External Affairs Minister and the
Information and Broadcasting Minister or
for Pakistan this after Sushma so had
simply seen the report into of course
the alleged abduction and conversion of
to Hindu girls in Pakistan it remember
drew a sharp response so from four-bath
who say no the Pakistan I envy ministers
of course he claimed that this was an
internal issue of Pakistan to which her
Sushma Swaraj shot back and of course
hit back exposing Pakistan thoroughly
ashish is now joining us on that big
story he has all the details on the same
ashish of more of virtually is broken
out between Sushma Swaraj and the
Pakistan inb Minister as far as the
atrocities so you know against
minorities in Pakistan is concerned
first of all take us through where is
the case stand as of now as far as
Pakistan is concerned looks like they
have ordered
drove into the same but is that
something which can even be taken
seriously so what has been done from
Pakistani Prime Minister
Imran Khan is as per the social media
and the Twitter
reports what basically has been done
primarily by the Pakistan Information
Broadcasting Minister for wada
is pakistan PM Imran Khan has instructed
to order a probe nothing beyond that
there is nothing beyond that that is
available in public domain neither in
Pakistani media nor in social media
about what has been done after that so
what is basically Pakistan doing is
trying to send out a message to not only
this Pakistanis but to the entire world
that they are very strict and the
Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan is
personally worried as far as the
minorities in Pakistan is concerned but
as I mentioned it's been almost 2 week
and there's not been any major step
taken from the Pakistan side apart from
the Pakistani Prime Minister instructing
to order a probe as for the entire
process is concerned but now this itself
exposes the Pakistan sir law and order
situation the Pakistan government's
concern as for the minorities are
concerned you need a prime minister to
instruct a probe into a matter which
should have been automatically as a
matter of default process should have
been done by the police should have been
done by the local government should have
been done by the central government but
really primary should instructing to
order the probe this certainly suggests
that you have Pakistani army and I say
completely controlling the local law and
order situation and unless a prime
ministership intervention comes into
picture you will not even have a normal
default SOP group ordered in the
abduction and the forceful conversion of
the two hindu girls to islam now that
certainly is a laughable thing now
remember the External Affairs Minister
Sushma Swaraj has been up speaking
publicly has been tweeting about it has
been making sure that the not religious
Pakistani government but the entire
world gets
- no this is how Pakistani government
operates the Pakistani Pakistan is
called you have Sushma Swaraj through
the Ministry of External Affairs - the
Indian High Commission Islamabad raising
this particular issue of abduction of
two hindu girls and the forceful
conversion of death in a last two weeks
time and that has certainly irritated
Pakistan because they are being exposed
but I would like to empower viewers this
is not the first time when you have
Indian government intervening or raising
this issue as far as the safety and
security of minorities specifically six
and Hindus in Pakistan are concerned in
2011 in 2012 in 2016 you will find
several looks about questions up in the
parliament scale in New Delhi where it
clearly has been mentioned that the
Indian government through the formal
channels has raised this issue of safety
and security of minorities in Pakistan
specifically six and Hindus in Pakistan
time and again
now what has been done in last week just
three days ago the External Affairs
Minister has once again not only just
asked the Indian High Commission
Islamabad to give a detailed record as
far as the abduction and forceful
conversion of these two Hindu girls are
concerned but also has pointed fingers
towards the Pakistani government to go
beyond just the instruction coming from
Pakistani PM to order a probe they need
to do something more in it but that is
not been done and that's where the
status of the case currently is apart
from the Pakistani Prime Minister Imran
Khan's instruction to order a probe
nothing major has been done no concrete
and substantial the progress has been
made in this particular case you know
well absolutely as she showed you stay
with us at this time of course I'd also
like to inform the viewers that we've
opened our call-in lines all of you can
call in and share your views on
Pakistan's Minority Report do you think
minorities are safe in Pakistan what
really should India do as far as this
report of the abduction of - in the
girls are concerned Imran Khan does he
need to do more he doesn't need to do
more thinking as far as his claims of
Naya Pakistan are concerned what do you
really think
about this wide-release Pakistan
targeting minorities and what the nation
needs to do you can Colin of course with
your views called numbers of cost ration
at the bottom of your Springs before I
go across to Ashish we have some
reactions coming in and leave my
colleague Aishwarya has done a special
interview let's listen into that and
then I'll go back to Ashish when I'm
being joined by bJP MP Rakesh and I said
what's wrong in India questioning the
human rights position in Pakistan Sushma
Swaraj tweeted an arson report by the
Indian High Commissioner about the
minorities being affected and the Hindu
sisters being converted in the Islamic
Islam in Pakistan now Hindus have been
facing repression coercion a persecution
by Islamic regime in Pakistan it is a
moral duty of India the question
Pakistan because after the partition it
was decided that my knowledge of both
the countries would enjoy the same
rights climate and opportunities in
India Muslim got these equal
opportunities and population increased
from 9% to 14% from 1951 to 2011 in
Pakistan Hindus population has decreased
from 22% to less than 1% the dignity of
woman and the leaders in freedom both
are under both have been under threat
and Pakistan Pakistani government
society and jihadis together are
replacing and course in Hindus it's time
to intervene and intervention has
legitimacy both pre partition
understanding and also the international
community's this is the time India has
to intervene
intervene in any manner to safeguard the
interest of the Hindus their human
rights their democratic rights they are
not getting equal political
opportunities in Constitution itself
they are being discriminated a Hindu
cannot with the president and the Prime
Minister of the country therefore this
is the time
the government has taken the steep and
eye-consciousness Maharajah for taking
such a steep one thing which country
must know the present condition of
Hindus Buddhists Jains and six in
Pakistan is due to Nehru Liaquat pact
this was most immoral pact without the
sanction of the dozen cabinet two
individuals did the pact and Jawahar Lal
Nehru is responsible for such condition
this was the region
dr. Seema Prasad Mookerjee had resigned
from Nero's cabinet death should be
corrected now arises that you've said
that there are a lot of minorities in
Pakistan which are being affected and
why is Pakistan so rattled if the Indian
have asked them for the condition of
minorities in Pakistan because they are
being exposed and now they are feeling
that India would actively intervene this
is the time that international community
international agencies must go to
Pakistan ensure that Hindus life
property and dignity must be protected
the manner to sisters kidnapped the
dignity attacked they were they are
converted is not a shame on the humanity
but also the International Committee
because they are not intervening
agencies like Amnesty International
silence they are just doing rituals this
shows that Hindus in Pakistan are being
targeted for the religious region
Pakistan being formerly in India as part
has duty to obey the understanding which
are during the partition if you are
prosecuting Hindus we will intervene so
lastly the reports are coming that
Pakistan has also ordered the probe into
this matter do you think that this rope
should be taken seriously no I think
this is a just a ritual to satisfy the
international community
this is pseudo-state by the Pakistani
government you know the Ahmadiyya had
been persecuted there was a manera
Commission manera Commission report has
catalyst said that how they are being
victimized and when the Christians are
being persecuted in Pakistan as far as
the reports of the Pakistani think-tank
in significant number of Hindus are
involved any kind of activity which
harms the Islam which which hurts the
government despite that Hindus are being
targeted how their number has this
Greece from 22 percent to 1 percent less
than one percent now they're merely
confined in the same this is the
question to be founded on and I think
previous regimes have ignored previous
Congress regime and pseudo secular
intellectuals have never expressed
anything on the repression coercion a
persecution of the Hindus rape of the
Hindu women in Pakistan quantification
of their property using the any property
act therefore I think now the time has
come to make a serious intervention and
teach Pakistan a lesson that if you are
prosecuting Hindus Buddhists Sikhs Jains
or Christian in the name of religion we
will we are going to come we are going
to intervene that was VJ BMP Rakesh
Anna's making two news expertise in this
power dispersion reporting for news
accelerating that was Rakesh Sinha MP of
the Raja Sabha from the VIP who was
talking about really the condition of
minorities in Pakistan and why India
seeking a reporter in the scene cannot
be viewed as meddling in their internal
affairs by Pakistan
Aslam party of cause joining us on the
broadcast but before I go across to mr.
party I believe we have a caller Gia's
party yes sir Grafton thank you for
calling us first of all go ahead with
your views what do you have to say
really about Pakistan the Minority
Report which of course has been exposed
to by none other than our External
Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj
oh nice big please yes sir please go
ahead
good morning I'm Judy from Hyderabad why
don't our Muslim brothers and
particularly mullahs condemn such
incidents happening in Pakistan people
within the country as well to condemn
these incidents as far as I think India
is concerned the External Affairs
Minister has made a point very clear and
has ask pointed questions from Pakistan
nothing wrong as of course many in India
are saying with India raising a question
which concerns human right violations
thank you for calling us let's also go
across of course to a salon party who is
so with a slime on the broadcast
yes groton thank you for joining us on
music so first of all the big question
and I know I'll ask you bits about the
condition of minorities you will tell me
it is your internal affairs India our
External Affairs Minister has no
business meddling in it the big question
why are you wise Pakistan so rattled so
what Sushma Swaraj has done is basically
seek a report and enquiry report until
an alleged human rights violation why
are you so rattled if our administration
if our government wants a report on the
same thank you very much for taking me
on discussion first of all I my question
is that did you on a British
Broadcasting Center BBC this is the
report of EBC in our newspaper that what
happened in Bengaluru what happened in
city never what happened in other parts
of India this is not Pakistani report
this is international report just
through girls that is Pakistani national
one what you are saying that they were
forcefully abducted and they were
forcibly converted to other religion
till time no such reports was there
Prime Minister had already Prime
Minister Imran Khan had already ordered
the probe but what you are saying that
while international community we evolved
and before me there was a bJP MP was
talking about that we should be focused
on lesson
ask him
come to the border I will teach him a
lesson denying these reports I mean this
is the Pakistani media those women
reporting sir there is an allegation
these are mine allegedly been abducted
and converting I even denying the peace
report
nobody can force a person to convert
religion he was speaking honest MIT
people they were very freely living in
Pakistan condition off for Hindus and
Pakistan everybody knows in the
condition of Muslims in India the real
task at hand for Pakistan considering
when you have these reports these
blatant human right violations which are
taking place blatant human rights
violation are taking place in Occupied
Kashmir not in Pakistan beware these
reports are Stanny journalists these are
not even Indian journalists this is
these reports are from BBC that is not
our influence that is not in your
influence they said that there is a
engineer engineering student was
attacked by going against India instead
of doing that should you not look at the
condition of minorities in your country
you know you're impure your kindness or
unconscious
I will teach India how to treat
minorities is this the lesson you want
to be change
if you want to teach us how to treat
minorities is this what you want to
teach us induction force you should
learn how to teach minorities from us
what you are doing with with Hindu comes
in in a while traveling while traveling
in New Delhi just a year back what you
were talking about you are talking about
the country which has some patience you
are going to continue this debate the
question will be answered with another
question if if one raises a question
asking you about what's happening those
who have been abducted and allegedly
allegedly I repeat force will be
converted instead of answering that you
are pulling out international reports
digging up dirt on India Ashish you know
why don't you join it at this point of
time of course you can hear us one party
from Pakistan no surprise that Pakistan
the argument is to answer a question
with a question
but what is a Pakistan really needs to
do should mineral first concentrate on
the condition of the minorities in their
countries instead of sermonizing India
after all you raised the question of
Emma DVD is a question of six and Hindus
everyone knows the condition of
minorities in Pakistan is in tadashi
well the answer of this was given by
Anna Sewell Dean Shah in December 2018
when Ron can't deny a prime minister of
the ayah Pakistan he tried to exploit
the entire minority issue after and the
Swedish as comment and national design I
remember it was exactly
23rd December 2018 just three months ago
he had mentioned very clearly to him Ron
Caan and mind your own business mind
your own country and the moment he tried
to exploit it further
you had the former Indian cricketer
mohammad kafir again hitting out at
imran khan so as far as the sermonizing
India is concerned this is something
that Pakistan wants to do it to please
their local audience nothing beyond that
but answering cry
answering a question with a question is
the old tactics you you know in this
last three three and a half minutes of
conversation with osman Bertie he is
refusing to up divulge any details as
far as the so called instruction for the
probe is concerned yes remember there
are two local governments involved here
the Sindh and the Punjab province
governments of the Pakistan the Prime
Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan has
issued instructions to both the
government's to formulate a strategy to
ensure that these two minor girls are
recovered and we are not just talking
about Reena and Raveena there are a few
other girls as well the minor Hindu
girls who have allegedly been kidnapped
and then they have been forced to
convert to Islam see someone whose adult
converting to any other religion bata
sinatun or Islam is an individual choice
no government we deal local or the
international or the neighboring
government have any right but in this
particular cases we are specifically
talking about the minor girls minors who
are from above the particular province
in Pakistan and their government has no
idea has no clue about where after gone
I would request mr. Bhati to show this
so-called international media reports
about these abductions about these
investigations about what is the outcome
of the Prime Minister's intervention you
have the prime minister of a country
intervening and giving instructions said
to the chief priests choice of the two
provinces in the Sindh and Punjab and
you have no outcome coming out in LA in
the last 72 hours in which democratic
country it happens there is no idea or
two these governments where are these
two girls yes these are minor girls if
you feel that it has been done legally
and rightfully let these two girls come
out but no one has any idea in Pakistan
at least in public domain where are
these two girl and this these two birds
and this after you have Prime Minister's
intervention that exposes two things one
that how Pakistani government operates
to
imran khan is aware of how these things
are being done at the local level and he
is under tremendous pressure these are
the two clear messages coming out of it
but the whereabouts of these two girls
are not known to anyone in public domain
so far
well do stay with us I'll come back to
you but first let's also go cross and
social activist is joining us on the
broadcast and I would think those two
questions person in question which is or
to us run for tea as well first of all
mr. up in the tank itself for joining us
on music sir you of course are assuring
the debates are under way as far as the
forceful alleged abduction and
conversion of two minor in the girls in
Pakistan is concerned sir so would you
agree and concede of course with you
know the tone and tenor of the debate of
course the voice is coming in here
purely saying that Imran Khan is all
about told talk but no sympathy towards
minorities instead of sermonize in India
he maybe should really look at what's
happening internally in his own country
and try to improve the condition of
minorities their family in your you know
Italy accustomed a big face with itself
one definitely implant on I mean the
business talk and secondly I was hearing
that some of our panelists were saying
that you know they are trying to send a
message to the domestic constituency I
think in addition to the domestic
constituency visited before party
fathers other scientists intimately
international you know scenario that we
have any renewal of resignation we go by
you know all the new properties and here
it is hunky-dory but you know let us all
be candid let us understand none of us
is perfect like nudism old neither
America nor Pakistan or India we all
have always you know false and true but
on a case-by-case basis as things come
to the front we have to take action so
in this case with the he'll be here this
factor has come to light so it should be
the event it should be acted upon
intently right okay and because the
responsibility the Pakistan government
the part-time system although I would
say one more thing because the amount of
this let's say unfortunate is begin this
is gonna be there is a slight shift in
Indian foreign policy always India has
normally fatally sounds that we will not
comment upon internal affairs of other
he very rarely comment upon in a human
type which use imagination
it's time disappointing consume a B it's
time very for India to raise his voice
is as far as human rights violation are
concerned you know this Ravinder are
sheesh and as rampant or for you please
stay with us at this point of course we
will slip into a short commercial break
we will continue more focus on the big
story on the other side as well",True,en,578,5,9

candidate row for Baramulla
parliamentary constituency Muhammad of
Berlin has stoked major controversy by
raising some controversial slogans he
said and I quote Pakistan zindabad those
are the slogans which this man trusted
and electrically prayed for as a
well-being of the country this is during
an election rally launched said and I
quote our neighboring countries of
Muslim country
let them prosper and succeed let the
friendship between Pakistan and India
bloom if anyone will abuse then once I
will abuse them a hundred times now this
is not the first time that no one has
been making a such statements and
raising pro-pakistan slogans earlier as
well-known had raised a pro park slogan
in Jammu and Kashmir Assembly after an
argument with BJP leaders who were
raising anti Pakistan slogans in the
assembly before we delve into the story
any further first of all let's listen
and - what - um mr. lone of the nc had
to say
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
as I found out joining us on the phone
line RJ this is an extremely
controversial statement coming in now
from Omaha McGlone first of all take us
what this candidate of the MC had to say
and is there any reaction coming in from
mr. Omar Abdullah me this is a man who
is you know a praising Pakistan on
Indian soil why is he still mr. Loomer
of the last party and why is he
campaigning of course for our upcoming
elections definitely Mohamed the Cologne
we can say he's not the first-timer but
even in the past we have seen he made
that statement favoring Pakistan our
robust and state when Thomas was low
inside even when he was a minister when
he was a speaker of German Kashmiri
assembly but the thing is that what
exactly if the politicians are doing
nowadays persecuting the apartments
elections and just to convince their
vote just to you know motivate their
vote bank towards them are very
unfortunate what what is a but if these
things going to affect definitely in a
larger perspective it's a it will give a
big damage annuity as well in coming
days because they are the politician
those who are for working the people
interests me especially we have seen
that how pacifier how could mere had
seen the disturbance and unrest in last
me so many years then who are the people
those who are responsible for this and
that's only these people those who
provoke the people even the innocent
people don't do don't know about you
know I about these things they provoke
them and just took it would be good work
getting votes but on the largest
perspective --'tis going to damaging the
in coming days and what is your up alone
in saying that Pakistan zindabad and if
anybody will abuse Pakistan and
definitely I will abusing 100 and she
clearly shows that awkward role is his
you know campaigning there in the
formula area I'm a conscience area and
definitely to get votes he is you know
saying poor pakistani slogans he's there
as doing such campaign in specially
definitely it is going to harm and the
security forces also because they are
the people those who are trying to
restore peace interest me whereas that
these politicians those who just for the
sake of poor thing they are giving such
statement and no such you know
clarification car bomber of doula and OH
Marilla need to see that for what kind
of you know politics their leaders are
doing this is the first time he's raised
up robach slogan all year is well he had
done a you know was similar act in the
Jammu and Kashmir Assembly after he had
an argument with the BJP legislators
there he raised both Park slogans and
looks like Omar Abdullah isn't no mood
to act against this person very hardly a
chance at a lot of the lot of artillery
here take any action against him but the
Election Commission needs to see that
who are the people those were fighting
the election and how they are
campaigning there in the underground and
especially you know that what kind of
campaign they are doing to get the
warrant and especially in at the
institution in in a situation we have
entity responding when nearest thirty
forces are doing so many thing they are
sacrificing their life and just to
restore peace in just means they're
fighting with the terrorism they are
fighting with the internal you know from
the separatist leader because they are
they are the real said to the especially
and what these people's is the
mainstream politicians are doing is not
less than accept is still doing form of
so many years I today I thank you for
joining us with all those details are
certainly really disturbing developments
coming in from Jammu and Kashmir the big
question really is that if Omar Abdullah
will act against you know Mohammed loan
who has of course raised

0Y9cyfHW1gY,NewsX Explained: Why Ban On Cabs Can&#39;t Work? Karnataka Lifted Ban On Ola Cabs,"NewsX Explained: Here's why banning cabs is not so easy for governments. Earlier this morning, Karnataka lifted the six-month ...",2019-03-24T15:07:05Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0Y9cyfHW1gY/hqdefault.jpg,"hi you're watching musics and music
studio I'm the partly with me is my
Ksenia colleague Pankaj Mishnah and
today we're discussing how Karnataka had
to within two days reversed the ban it
had imposed on the operation of Ola cabs
in Karnataka now of course it is a
massive headache to commuters putting a
blanket ban on cab services like Ola and
uber is going to hurt commuters it gives
them a massive amount of headache
because the thousands of people
especially in a major metros like
Bengaluru Delhi Mumbai they're dependent
on taking app caps for their daily
commute to their workplaces so you know
when when the gut reaction for transport
departments whenever there is a conflict
with these app cab services is to put a
blanket ban on their services it first
what it hurts are the commuters the most
but not only that the drivers are also
hit by this definitely the drivers you
know the kind of arithmetic that kind of
understanding they have with these
ride-hailing app services it impacts
their income also some of them are you
know contracted on a day to day basis
which are daily wages some of them have
a monthly target to achieve and then
only their their dividend will you know
come to them and one more thing which
happens is these are the drivers what
the drivers that we are talking about is
you know are the ones who are directly
linked with these services right healing
app services the probably it's an
interesting fact that you know when you
have these app cabs on the road you and
I tend not to take out our own car but
maybe it doesn't force me or you to go
ahead and buy a new car or a secondhand
if you don't have a car so this prospect
also you know takes a hit when a state
or when these app services are based
services cabs are actually stopped from
functioning and well in this context we
are speaking as of now about Bangalore
which is you know clearly a hub for
startups also and tech agencies are
there you know lots of tech companies
and also there I think you know it's a
jewel to the startups also and the
sentiment that's right oh gosh when we
were looking at
actions of the people many of them were
saying that such such an impulsive band
also affects the mood of startups and it
also hurts businesses in you know the
businesses that are coming up because if
you're sending out this message that any
new technology you're going to meet with
a band because your policies are not
laid out for that then you are really
putting putting these startups
you're you're sending out the wrong
message for startups to actually
proliferate they will be you know they
will be they will think that this is not
the right place to perhaps to begin
their businesses if that's the kind of
approach policymakers take and not just
a hit to startup businesses such an
approach also hurts businesses because
all of a sudden if you're going to put a
blanket ban on the services of olla then
this is a bad compare competition you
know it's going to hurt the market
because for six months that was the
duration the band was going to be
imposed for so six months you don't have
Ola services then uber takes over so
this is just a wrong practice revolution
is a better option a complete ban that
is always the better option regulation a
proper polished thought-out policy
rather than this gut reaction rather
than this impulsive action to ban the
services of app cabs so if if cab
services if you're heavily reliant on
cap services if it's your habit to take
app cabs like Ola and uber let us know
what you think about these kind of bands

ARDGqlUcosk,"Crackdown On Terror: Pakistan Faces Heat, Shah Mehmood Qureshi On National Action Plan",Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi appealed all the opposition parties to come together on the National action ...,2019-03-22T11:09:14Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ARDGqlUcosk/hqdefault.jpg,"hello and welcome you are watching
musics and musics on YouTube there are
developments in Pakistan which are a
clear indicator that it is under immense
pressure not just from Indian side but
from the global community to act against
terror what's happening in the stars
right now as we speak is the fact that
chef Emeril Qureshi has appealed to all
the opposition parties to come together
on the National Action Plan now what is
this National Action Plan natural action
plan and massages all the Pakistani
political parties to come together to
discuss the way forward for the
development of the country not just
domestically but internationally also
this one clearly mentioned when Imran
Khan's government came into power they
spoke to all the opposition parties the
leading ones including a PPP and PM n L
asking them to come together and have a
mandate on how to crack down on terror
now suddenly it's not an overnight
change in Pakistan's mentality and they
are not shunning their dirty tactics as
they have been conducting for so long
but what's happening is right now the
diplomatic pressure that has been built
on Pakistan not just through UNSC but
through European Union also through our
super powers like Germany US UK France
all of them are coordinating Pakistan
asking them to act against terror
otherwise either the aid that the
diplomatic immunity that the Islam as
always enjoy that the bilateral ties
between the with Pakistan that travel
restrictions could come into picture all
these things are currently common in
Pakistan now and they're bound they have
been forced to think on this will affect
that they have to act against terror
so shall Mehmood Qureshi in a statement
says and I quote here it is not the
responsibility of the entire national
leadership to sit together and
deliberate on the difficult situation I
understand their political experiences
but I will respectfully request them the
opposition parties to review the
decision we are ready to discuss
everything one step at a time
let us make a beginning this is what mr.
queer she said and this statement comes
after the opposition parties were not
very happy with the ruling party's
stance
you know when they said that that Islam
that is taking two steps behind it is
facing flak from the international
community
hence the opposition party is blamed at
the ruling party
PTI is saying that they are not able to
handle the situation very well and hence
they chose not to come together on this
National Action Plan so clearly as you
can see here Pakistan is being cornered
and they're feeling the heat we are
under immense pressure and now it's time
that Pakistan is trying to do some
introspection and is trying to get its
opposition parties on board so that if
not you know in as many words if not in
action at least they want to show the
global community that yes Pakistan is
trying to do something about the terror
that emanates from itself remember
United States came up with a very clear
message to Pakistan a couple of days ago
saying that they want irreversible and
verifiable action against that terror
masterminds who had taken shelter in
Pakistan and us also mentioned that in
all these years previously when Pakistan
has have said that it has taken action
against those perpetrators those
masterminds of the terror attacks in
India like ju d and je and they have
been roaming free in pakistan they are
putting her under house arrest for some
time and after that they start roaming
free that contest elections and they
address rallies there so all these
things coming from either big brother
coming from Germany all these things are
cornering Pakistan and as of now as it
stands Pakistan is trying to scratch to
the bottom and see if it could actually
project itself as one of the forces
acting against terrorism thanks for

that were raising there a lush car
commander now Ali bhai has been killed
in an encounter in Kashmir five
terrorists including top foreign lush
corps commander alibi
killed since yesterday two terrorists in
Baramulla two in Hajin and one terrorist
in chipiya have been killed so far also
seven Security Force personnel have been
injured so far in these encounters the
gunfight in sopia and support are still
underway and in Hajin and Baramulla the
search operations are underway irish
barrel joining a slice on the broadcast
irish give us the latest on these
encounters that's been raging and of
course top foreign rush corps commander
alibi who's been killed
what would we know about the terrorists
who have been trapped in who have been
killed sofa
our alias in fact three simultaneous
encounters have been going on in the
Kashmir Valley since yesterday two of
them were reported from North fisheries
bottom line Monday for our districts
while as one encounter has been going on
in this European district in South Asian
aid in the in the kiri encounter we are
told that two militants have been
neutralized there one of them is a local
resident he has been identified as
Armour Kapoor of support while as the
second one is said to be a Pakistani
national and both of them were you know
affiliated with the JJ Muhammad outfit
in bandipur encounter where there was a
hostage crisis yesterday we are told
that one of the militants has been
identified as Ali bhai he's a Pakistani
national and has been operating in the
area for the last some time now and he
was on the most wanted list of the
security forces yesterday the forces got
inputs about the presence of these
militants in a residential house in
Hodgenville de Fora
after which this encounter started and
two civilians got trapped inside the
house where the militants were holed up
one of them war was released by the
militants due to the intervention of the
security forces and the local community
members but the fate of the second one
is still not known and two militants
have been neutralized in this operation
and the third one third operation has
been going on since midnight in the show
PR where one militant has been
neutralized so far the operation is
still continuing and the reports are
coming that clashes have erupted in many
villages of the show PR people are
trying to march to the encounter site
and they are giving a tough time to
these security forces there back to you
are you sure so there was a you know a
deliberate attempt perhaps to engage the
security forces on a day on a festival
day like holy yesterday when we saw much
many encounters and many ceasefire
violations also taking place in German
Kashmir
well absolutely and you know one of the
reasons for this simultaneous encounters
is that the security forces are planning
to you know keep a tab on the movement
of the militants they have you know
continuously trying to maintain pressure
on the on the militants and whenever
they get in puts about the presence of
militants anywhere bridge north or south
question today you know immediately
launch a cordon and search operation and
engage the military and this is one of
the reasons that three simultaneous
encounters have been going on in the
Kashmir Valley since yesterday morning
and you know first of all I would like
you to update on the Hajin identified we
are being told that one minor has also
lost his life in the gunfight in the
Hajin we are told that the body of a to
Arial bold a boy has been also recovered
from the encounter site as I mentioned
that yesterday there was a hostage
crisis in Rajan where two civilians were
trapped in the house where the gunfight
was going on and one of them you know
was rescued but unfortunately one minor
boy has lost his life in this gunfight
but that's that's a really sad news
oddish that you are sharing with us that
a twelve-year of a 12 year old boy who
was a hostage we understand has now lost
his life that's surely surely a very
very sad piece of news er do we know how
many terrorists are really holed up in
that house aware this hostage crisis was
unfolding and of course they've been
trapped which is they have been trapped
but we know the number of terrorists
there
well yes the update that is coming from
Hajin is that the bodies of two
militants along with arms and
ammunitions has been recovered from the
debris of the house that has collapsed
during the encounter and it seems that
only two militants were holed up there
and as we have been reporting that one
of them is a Pakistani national he has
been identified as Ali why but as I said
unfortunate news also coming from
Hajin encounter said that one civilian
boy who is a miner
too has lost his life in the exchange of
fire between the two sites all right so
the top commander Ali bhai was killed in
the Hajin encounters that is that
correct and how big a success is this
for as far as the Union security forces
are concerned to eliminate this
commander
well the elimination of our mother is
definitely a success for the security
forces because the security forces
believe that these are the commanders
who not only convinced the new recruits
to join the militants ranks but also
they are the people who lead the attacks
on the security forces and the Pakistani
militants who you know cross over to
this side of the line of control they
are hardened militants and some of them
have been responsible for some of the
deadly attacks on the security forces
and alibi you know as I mentioned that
he was one of the top militants was
wanted by the security forces in number
of the militant separated incidents in
north Kashmir and his elimination in
this encounter is definitely a success
for the security forces all right and as
of now then has the encounter as far as
Hajin and concerned ended or search
operations are still underway I believe
well yes the gunfight between the two
sides has ended with the recovery of two
bodies and some homicide emulation from
the encounter site and you know it is
now kind of a mopping up exercise that
these security forces are you know busy
with because before you know leaving
this sport they have to make sure that
they are there are no explosive litter
on the spot so this is called the
mopping up exercise and before leaving
the encumbrance site they will have to
clean up the entire space because the
civilians will thrombi police
immediately after the encounter and to
avoid any civilian casualty the mopping
up exercise is a part of the SOP that is
followed by the security forces all
rights as far as Hodgins is concerned
two terrorists have been eliminated and
a minor boy has unfortunately lost his
life in the crossfire
aresia we leave it there for now thanks
for the updates",True,en,1967,4,23

I expressed last case back in 2007-2008
we were seeing many of these cases being
painted as Safran terror cases let me
take you through a bit of history here
and tell you how exactly what exactly
happened in each of these cases now in
2007 there was a mock arrested blast
case all the eleven accused persons in
that case were acquitted 2007 there's
some Java Express last case that we were
just talking about now as early as
yesterday a seaman and and three others
accused were acquitted in the Ajmer
their God last case that happened in
2007 thirteen were accused and seven
were acquitted and the Molokai blast
case is so far the last alleged Hindu
terror case that is still under the
courts ambit and a judgment on that is
awaited but if we go by the track record
of these Hindu terror cases it appears
to be a sham because the court has you
know acquitted many of the accused as
far as these four kr3 cases are
concerned and the fourth is of course
still under investigation and that
doesn't stop our rogue neighbor from
questioning India for that matter
just yesterday Pakistan summoned Indian
High Commissioner to caucus on a JBoss
area asking him as to why were all the
accused acquitted in the Sonora Express
remember the NRA a court has put out
very very categorically that there was
not enough evidence against all the
accused in the some Java Express a blast

musics YouTube I am traitor Qatari and
with me is my senior colleague hunkers
and we are discussing a very significant
development pankaj emerging from u P we
are given to understand and a big
significant announcement my lathy made
very very you know recently she will not
be contesting the looks of elections
2019 oh yeah too many
Misaka Misaka but remember you know last
week only it was NCP chief Sharad Pawar
who dropped the bombshell saying that he
will be contesting elections and
likewise this time my ot the BSP supremo
has chosen not to contest
2019 Lok Sabha I would like to draw the
attention of our viewers to this very
fact that my ot has cited parties
reasons you know she doesn't want to be
divided between focusing on one
particular constituency we have Steve
contesting elections from and then being
the star campaigner for the party across
the country beat Maharashtra beat u P
beat elsewhere so citing parties reason
could be definitely you know way if if
you look at the face value of it
definitely it's a sound reason that she
has cited or she has to be on a
whirlwind tour also to improve the
performance from the last elections but
talking about last 2014 elections also
you know SP had filed can fielded
candidates on 503 seeds and most of us
have not forgotten the result was zero
he was not able to open the
ESP could not open its account back in
2014 many opposition parties are going
to read it as such punkish because the
opposition parties will obviously be
reading more into the announcement she
has of course come out to the said and
very significant announcement she's come
out and said that if I were to contest I
would win from any seat but we are not
to forget what happened in 2014 I went
you know bsv contested on five not three
seats did not win a single seats got
less than 5% words throughout the
country so in light of that many
opposition parties will of course be
saying that you know the BSP supremo got
a little too scared ahead of 2019 that's
how they're going to be reading it as
but obviously my buddy coming out to the
saying that I want to focus on the PSP
PSP alliance and I do not wanna focus on
one single constituency and that's the
reason why I'm not contesting the 2019
pose definitely you know politics is
obvious if there are two types of
politics if I may say so what is active
politics when they are actually
contesting elections we are going on
tours you are doing the voters making
promises giving speeches everything the
second one is wait and watch politics
here my methey is not is on a vantage
point in a way that she is a member of
Rajya Sabha but technically for the last
15 years she hasn't contested any pulls
directly all right the looks like
nations this time she is keeping her you
know she is not closing all the doors
her comment that yes she wants to focus
on the party and hence she can win from
any seat wherever it comes she can test
you know this reminds me of my ghetto
couple it from a song it says Bob sana
you say and jump that Lannon of a
bumpkin who say oops look more they
crash or not she's trying to leave it at
a point wait doesn't you know harm harm
her also she still is the same my evety
who can charge the opposition parties
with her with a charismatic in a
trademark style of a directive frontal
verbal attacks and in the same time you
know if the performance is not very rosy
then she would you know take a backseat

I did not test and this is what the
party has to you know settle better

chronic is with me and we've just
done an interview of music so with the
former UPA home minister Sushil Kumar
Shinde and he's had very interesting
things mega to say about Yakub Memon the
terrorist and of course on casabas well
yes a massive blast from the past if I
may say so because he has gone on and
Drake the issue of Yakub Memon yet again
he's gone on and said that the gum in
the NTA gum in battle 2015 had allowed
for a public rally a public funeral for
Yakub Memon in mumbai and that does not
hold in good stead because there were
these huge gatherings of people who had
come out in support of was like a huge
that now he is the person who's faced a
lot of criticism over creating this
Hindu terror Safran terror sort of
paradigm narrative that happened under
the UPA so when questioned on it he says
why talking about us it's the center the
NDA government the BJP government that
allowed these funeral rallies are to
take place in in Mumbai that had 70
80,000 people showing up and that in
fact led to more people who sort of
eulogizing and popularizing what was a
person who was convicted and held guilty
of a terror act and punished for it then
he also takes the example about cassavan
and it turns that into sort of a boast
yes exactly he does that but in it was
Kasab who had attacked the 26/11 the
dastardly attack said hundreds and
hundreds were killed and was under the
UPA government at that attack happened
and this is what happened but the UPA in
fact had a very soft stand there was no
action there was only the only
diplomatic talks that went on in the
international community but actually no
channel so despise the surgical strike
the balakov strike what a social Kumar
Shinde is saying that Bieber of course
also equally proactive when it came to
taking on terror the reason this
important days because national security
is an issue of concern all the polls
that we have taken the service that are
happening which you can see on musics
all appointing the national security
taken world Pakistani terror is an
important concern that is why even
though Sushil Kumar Shinde is not a
major player in these elections nor in
the Congress party at this point of time
but what happened then when it came to
this saffron terror narrative the
Samjhauta case remember is back there's
a Pakistani national who now claims to
have the proof of saffron terror
Anderson's not the case so this is why
what Sushil Kumar Shinde is saying is
important in terms of the political

election show State of the Union over
the course of next half an hour we will
break down all the complex data for you
into simple digestible now yesterday we
touched upon the state of the states
with the pradesh and today we are going
to focus to the south of India and what
better than starting with Karnataka a
state that exemplifies anti-incumbency I
am Shweta Qatari and joining us on this
journey is sanjay kumar from CSDs thank
you sir he is of course going to help us
understand the number game in Karnataka
so shall we begin first up let's take a
look at how the population graph has
played out over the course of last so
many years starting from you know
nineteen fifties onward if you compare
the population of India versus that of U
P which is the line in yellow to that
Oscar Nautica the India's population of
course the trajectory as you can see has
been growing consistently over the
course of last so many years until 2020
and is almost at 1.3 billion at this
point in time but if you look at
Karnataka as population the population
has not grown that much the population
remained consistent from 19 million back
in 1952 currently today at 68 million
which is about 6 K rows but what one
thing that we have seen mr. Kumar
consistently happening over the course
of last three decades is that the
anti-incumbency factor just as I told my
viewers has been exemplified in the
state of Karnataka not even once
over the last three decades has the
electorate in Karnataka voted for one
consecutive party over the next election
so that's something we saw happening in
Karnataka for last three decades mr.
Kumar 2 data points I would like to
focus on one about the population growth
it's not only about Karnataka if you
look at Tamil Nadu Kerala Andhra the
southern states the population growth
rate has been less compared to the
states in the north whether we talk
about U P Rajasthan multiple days so
there is a difference in terms of
population growth rate that is
the proportion of voters have also grown
much bigger in the northeastern states
of the north compared to the south the
second data you have already mentioned
and very rightly that the last two
decades three decades we have never seen
Karnataka electing the same government
again we know that we had a Congress
government before this government came
into power but if you look at if we
remember what was the Mandate of this
the recent Assembly election it was a
fractured mandate right it did not vote
back the Congress the way Congress was
ruling the state in the past so that is
what you rightly rightly mentioned it is
intent incumbency at universal
absolutely and I want to specifically go
back to 1980s and I'd like to point this
out for my viewers between 1980s to 1990
this was for the very first time that
junta party won elections in Karnataka
before that Congress you know
consistently won elections until of
course you know the movement as we know
the Jaypee movement hit Karnataka way
back in 1980s and that was for the very
first time that we saw Jennifer party
coming to power now of course we have a
congress JDS collision but it was in
1980 sir that we saw some change
happening in Karnataka yes I think there
is a you mentioned about 1980 is the
first time you have a gentle party
government coming to power in Karnataka
but again I would say that's the story
in many states in many states congress
ruled the state for a very long time and
this is post 1977 in 1977 it's the first
time that a non congress government in a
majority managed to form the government
at the center and that followed in many
states which went to pole after that and
that is what you pointed out that 1980
is the first time we have a non congress
government formed in karnataka
absolutely and i also want to talk about
an interesting phase which was between
1990s and 2000 because during that 10
years during that 1 decade we saw every
party coming to power without elections
that was unprecedented every time you
have change in governance throughout the
country you have to have elections but
cannot occur i perhaps is the only stage
where you saw all three major parties
you know taking the mantle of leadership
without elections but one government
falling after the other yes this is the
period when you have you know kind of
politics in flux in the state and you
rightly mentioned that this was the
change of government over a you know
frequent change of government during
this time and I've marked it out for our
viewers you have between nineteen ninety
two you have Bunga APPA serving as the
chief minister 92 to 94 you have
Veerappan oily who becomes the chief
minister in 94 you have again jonatha
dull win and they've gotta becomes the
chief minister he of course had to let
go of the chief ministership after he
became the prime minister later but this
is a very this is the period when you
have frequent chairs in change in the
chief ministers if a quick frequent
change in the government of course and
in 1996 you see they've gotta became the
prime minister and that's how the
politics has changed the politics in
Karnataka became more and more
interesting because this is one place
that does not vote any party
consecutively it's also a place where
you see Chief Minister is coming and
going very very frequently sir yes we
cannot compare Karnataka with a bigger
state but if you if we look at once we
travel to the states of the Northeast we
would find more or less same story in
some of the states so there are states
which has witnessed frequent change in
government but yes Karnataka today we
are discussing Karnataka and let's keep
the focus on Karnataka absolutely let's
shift our focus now because we have a
lot more to talk about and let's you
know go specifically into what happened
in 2014 as far as the looks of Elections
is concerned I want to talk about the
seat share here I mean when when you
talk about what happened as far as you
know Vijay PC chair is concerned as
compared to 2014 and 2009 in 2009 we saw
BJP winning 19 seats in 2014 it was 17
so there was a reduction as far as the
number of seats is concerned but I want
to also do you know how quickly take our
viewers so what happened as far as the
vote share is concerned the what sure if
you take a look here very interestingly
the word share in 2009 was at 41 point
six percent while in 2014 was at forty
three point four percent so while the
word share increased the number of seats
decreased you're mentioning about about
the looks of
elections 2009 versus 2014 7 what what
did you mention about the voting if you
if you take a look there in 2014 you
have you know 17 seats that went to BJP
as compared to 2009 when BJP got 19
seats but if you look at the data as far
as you know what share is concerned what
share date are very interesting because
the word share here is that 43.4% in
2017 as compared to 2006 Karnataka has
always presented a unique result look at
the latest assembly election vote share
of Congress went up and Congress seat
went down so even that was the case with
regard to BJP the vote share of BJP went
up in 2014 compared to 2009 but they
lost two more seats compared to 2009
this is only because the votes are
distributed Karnataka is a triangular
countries we have JD s we have Congress
and we have BJP while Congress vote is
spread all over the state so what you
need you can have higher work but the
votes are not concentrated but Bishop is
what are concentrated so what we call
strike rate you have presence in xx
constituency or 19 constituency so if
you get votes in those constituency you
are able to win more seats so it's not
only about as I said Lok Sabha elections
also remember 2008 assembly elections in
Karnataka BJP is what share was 1
percent less compared to Congress both
share but BJP seats we're 30 more seats
compared to Congress seat
so this is a this is because of the
pattern of distribution of votes across
the state if you have votes concentrated
in some region you will win all the
seats or most of the seats in that
region that's the explanation why did we
see BJP is what share going down up but
going down so that that's something this
I mean let's take a quick look at what
happened as far as International
Congress is concerned you know in 2014
they win 9 seats yeah in 20 2009 they
won 6 seats but if you look at the word
share watch share again as as you
rightly pointed out you know so vote
share is not really reflecting what's
happening as far as
chad is concerned because the war chair
of the congress party here 41.2% in 2014
while the seat share decreases and in
2009 the vote share is at thirty seven
point six percent so it's actually
repeating so what you're saying
essentially is repeating for all the
parties not just for the BJP but
although I think we are not talking
about JD s at the moment because if both
the parties what share is going up and
still they BJP is losing two seats then
definitely there is a third player which
is which may be losing votes because
these are the two parties which are
gaining words so if we talk about JD s
then we think the picture will be more
clear for the viewers okay so the JD s
is basically getting the check IDs and
maybe the other smaller independents and
regional other parties okay I will also
quickly take a look at the population
break up as far as the regional factor
is concerned if you look at the
population here you have seeks to the
tune of 0.1 percent Buddhists 0.0 0.8 or
about 6 and Buddhists okay you know
Sikhs and for this let's quickly jump to
Christians that form you know 1.9
percent Muslims 13 percent and if you
look at the Hindus the Hindus their
highest on the graph at 80 you know
basically at 84 percent so Hindus
obviously are the major deciding factor
as far as the Karnataka politics is
concerned but again Hindu vote is very
divided because God caste politics plays
at its best not just in you people also
in Karnataka that's very very very state
absolutely in every state in India but
let's quickly take a look at as far as
the cost breakup is concerned and you
know quickly going to what happens when
you look at the cost break up you have
vocally girls you know this is at 11%
because we are talking about data from
2011 that was the cost sensors that were
referring to today vocal IGAs is about
13% is what we are given to understand
and they are the water base of the JDS
first I think let's clarify the viewer
that there is no caste in since it 2011
as well I think these are estimates from
various sources right there was not put
on when the census takes place we only
count the census it's only the mandate
is to count the Dalits and within the
Dalits numerous caste within the
and also the tribals we do count the
census exercise do count religious
minorities religious communities but not
these cars but yes you are also right
that there was a caste census set up by
the government and I think the counting
was completed but the data was not made
public but yes in Karnataka's politics
vocally gambling guys are two dominant
political player within the Hindus we
know that Hindus are in very large
number and that's true for many states
in India we have to look at in Karnataka
as politics its Linga at and vocal vocal
again Linga at well vocally guys about
13% link ayats at this point in time
around 14% has now risen to 17% that
those are the figures we are getting but
let's also take a look at you know who
they vote for I want to quickly go to
BJP because BJP gets its vote from the
link ayat so this is of course a very
very important barrier and it talks
about the word share of the BJP BJP gets
about 63 percent of the votes that BJP
got way back in 2017 is primarily
because belongs to that community and he
has been able to hiss at all leader in
Karnataka and he has been able to pull
the Linga at works in its favor and so
this is the vote share obviously of the
BJP gets highest number of votes from a
link iith followed by of course the
upper caste the upper caste votes for
the BJP let's shift focus and let's
again I would say for the viewers that
upper caste vote for BJP is not unique
in Karnataka you travel to any state we
analyze data of any state that would be
true for any state that upper caste vote
is tilted in favor of BJP in a very
large number in all the states of this
country okay okay and let's also take a
look at the board Bank of the Congress
party we're talking about 2014 the vote
Bank of the Congress party is basically
Muslims also the second highest vote
bank is st so Congress gets its most
votes from Muslims as well as the mind
you know minority class or the minority
tends to vote more for the Congress
party but the Hindus and you know the
upper caste tends to vote for the BJP
that's the number game that we're
looking at again I would say yes it is
true though Karnataka witnessed a
triangular contest JDS Congress and BJP
but this is once
we're even in a triangular contest
Muslims have voted for Congress in a
very large number if I compare
triangular contest in other states with
sizable number of Muslim vote and I can
mention West Bengal Bihar yupi Assam in
that series in these states Congress
have lost Muslim support base to a great
extent and Muslims have shifted towards
the regional party that's not the story
of Karnataka even if Karnataka is a
triangular contest majority of the
Muslims have voted for Congress and they
have not voted in that big numbers for
JDS leave aside we should not keep
talking about important because the
vocalic of what we are talking about
since you were referring to it about 31%
of the vocally go vote went to the JDS
it appears that vocal IGAs are loyal to
the JDS loyal to h3 chromosome very
natural because Kumaraswamy and they
were gonna belong to that community so
and and you would see that both the
communities have hardly ever voted in
the same direction go Callaghan lineThe
you would never find both of them voting
in the same for the same part if that
happens one day the party would get a
huge majority incorrect so any party
that is able to both vocally and Ling
Guyot perhaps is going to stay that is
the party which may not you know I have
women may not be challenged by the
opposition may be able to stay
peacefully at the helm of affairs right
shifting focus to the regional
population of the regional population
break up and if you look at the highest
population here of course Hyderabad
Karnataka major population a number of
seats assembly seats is 40 parliamentary
constituency is three but you know the
the area that is in innocence focus of
all the parties including the BJP and
the JD s is the southern cannot declare
I am NOT wrong sir because it's also
known as the old mysuru region and this
is the area that both the parties are
going to be focusing on as far as 2019
is concerned no I'm not convinced that
the party will only be focusing on the
coastal Karnataka or the southern
karnataka
yes the discussion about certain
Carnatic and coastal Karnataka is only
also because this is the region where
you have the christendom population so
this is the region where BJP can
polarize the voters and BJP gains manage
to
not have seat in this region but if any
party want to do well in Karnataka you
have to focus on the entire state
Congress that asked for Congress is much
difficult compared to BJP because BJP as
I mentioned the votes of BJP are
concentrated so wherever BJP gets what
they manage to turn those words into
seeds Congress votes yet is spread so
they have a difficult task if they want
to win more feet so they have to
increase their vote share all over the
state okay but this time as we know that
there is alliance between Congress and
GDS so they are definitely in a far
better position compared to what they
wear in 2040 so also you know let's
quickly take a look at which region
votes for who because that's also
important you said Congress's vote share
is spread while BJP is concentrated if
you take a look at the Congress first
you know Congress gets a votes as you
rightly pointed out from nearly everyone
from southern karnataka every place
southern karnataka hyderabad karnataka
coastal Karnataka an equal number of
words but Hyderabad cannot go obviously
45 percent that's a significant number
about 45 percent of its votes came from
Hyderabad Karnataka Saudi Hyderabad
cannot occur region knows we don't look
at it like that we say in in Hyderabad
Karnataka region Congress got 45 percent
vote it's not that Congress 45 percent
yeah absolutely and but the word sure as
you pointed out it's it's equally spread
there's no one region that that is
voting Congress votes here is spread and
that is a disadvantage and an advantage
if I say advantage in a sense as soon as
Congress manages to increase its word
even by two three percent it gives them
a lot of dividend so he the party will
be able to win large number of seats but
a drawback because if you are just below
the threshold it's like you are you
appeared for large number of so you are
appearing for a tenth exam and you are
up you have appeared for 10 subjects and
you get 59 59 59 you don't get the first
division okay but as soon as you get 60
60 you yeah so your average increase
yeah all right and I also want to
understand BJP is goat bank you said
it's concentrated are we looking at the
right figures is it central Karnataka
that tends to vote for the BJP yeah you
can see BJP is what share would be you
will find differential vote fair for
both share for BJP in different region
and Costas
that matter tends to go high you look at
the coastal Karnataka 51% and central
Karnataka which is 50 with other regions
in other regions BJP is what share is
less compared to these two regions and
and let's quickly shift our focus to
Bangalore because to JD is because it
appears that only Bangalore region tends
to wood for the JD s so the electorate
in Bangalore favors JD s over Rico JV is
if your Congress because JD s has a very
strong base among southern karnataka so
30 percent and Bangalore would fall in
that category in a sense so that's why
JD s is getting a large number of what
in that 2 region okay so the radius
radius support which is largely
concentrated in that region and let's
also quickly talk about the demographics
as far as age and gender is concerned
because it's very important to point out
that if you talk about the the number of
men men obviously are lesser in
population as compared to females it's
it's a very interesting statistics were
given to understand about 51 percent are
women and 49 percent men in Karnataka
but if you look at the figures as far as
division is concerned we given to
understand in the age bracket of 25 to
34 you have 13.7 percent men similarly
in the age bracket of 25 to 34 you have
13.5 percent women this is the
population that that decides the fate of
Karnataka the age bracket of 25 to 34
this is the population that decides who
gets to be in the power or the helm of
affairs I was slightly disagree because
if you are mentioning about 35 25 to 34
these are only roughly 13 or 14 percent
of total population if any party managed
to want desires to do perform to perform
well in Carnatic or in any other state
they cannot they cannot just focus on
these 13 percent board they have to
focus on the entire population so I
would slightly disagree that party only
needs to fall to focus on these voters
in order to win an election in a state
okay so party would definitely focus on
different age groups of water yes there
is a recent trend of arting trying to
mobilize these young voters but but
those are not in the range of 30 24 to
30
35 to 44 because I would know I would
say the young voters the first time but
they sort of talk about first-timers so
these are about in the age group of 18
to that number so that stands at eleven
point three percent you know not a very
significant chunk but this is first time
voters decide the fate of how the belief
is that if you are already in the age of
40 if you are already the age of 45 you
become a traditional voter for party a B
or C so you have a tendency natural
tendency of voting for a party so you
have a political preference while those
voters were the first time voters they
are the doubter baggage they don't so
parties target these voters because they
think they are going to vote for the
first time so this is the time they have
to emphasize these voters that this is
the ideology of the party and wisely not
virtually why you should why you should
vote for this party or that party and
then perhaps continue to vote for that
honey and look at the all the parties
trying to shift focus on that you see
Rahul Gandhi visiting different colleges
addressing you know the students being
with the student and they're all
first-time voters absolutely I look at
Prime Minister Modi last couple of years
even addressing class tends to a 12th
student wishing them for you know his
best wishes for the exam very good
question but also this is these are the
voters these are the students who are
going to vote for the first time in 2019
right so you're sending out a message
with that you are trying to connect
you're trying to connect with is your
first time but it's trying to connect
and make sure that they they're loyal to
a particular part even amongst me I'm
not saying they want to make sure that
they're loyal but this is the first time
you establish a connect with these
voters who will be voting for the first
time in election okay okay shifting
focus now we want to also take a look at
the marginal meter as far as 2014 is
concerned these are the two
constituency's and these are important
constituency's of right sure and
chickadee because these two
constituencies were one one by what by
the Congress party with a very marginal
vote if you look at the vote by with
which they won in right you're about
fourteen fifteen and fifteen hundred
watts and in chukoti about three
thousand votes very very marginal are
these the constituency's that could be
the focus of the BJ
is that something we can see happening
because it appears that the voters are
not very certain on which party they
won't vote for well I'm not sure whether
otters are not certain which party to
vote for things have changed between
2014 and 2018
2014 was a triangular contest 2019 is a
pipe odor contest BJP on one side
Congress and JDS on one side yes
BJP has every reason to focus on these
two constituency because these
constraints is maybe referred as the
swing swing in a sense yeah because they
they can slip out of the hands of
Congress very easily but remember we
should also look at in these seats
what was the word share of JDS and I'm
sure if you add the words of JDS which
is because they are in alliance now I
don't think Congress would be in such a
bad situation as it looks like as it
looks like let's also take a look at the
constituency that were won by very very
high margin about 1 lakh 20,000 votes
and Shimoga of course here the Rafa's
constituency he won it with a
significant number of votes but also
Bangalore South you have bangalore north
and Bangalore rural it appears that
Bangalore is a decisive sir when it
comes to voting they know who they want
to vote and it looks like in this case
it is you know the BJP not surprising or
not only in Karnataka but if you look at
all the urban questions you have
mentioned these are all urban consumers
already hostages largely in Bangalore
city itself so BJP performs very well in
urban constituency and this is a
demonstration of this is an evidence of
that and you know moving on sir if you
look at the assembly elections that
happened way back in in 2018 I mean last
year if you look at the what percentage
we got we have BJP here which got 36.2%
put International Congress 39 genius 18
percent but if I add to juxtapose this
with you know how many vote people voted
for the BJP in 2014 that's 43 I&C
41 and radius 11 so it appears in
assembly lettering cannot occur votes
for Congress but when it comes to looks
of how elections cannot occur tends to
go for the BJP not necessarily we can
compare assembly election and looks over
in a different way in every state the
vote share of the National
part is slightly higher in the national
election as soon as there is a state
assembly election the vote gets spread
the both get more fragmented so BJP is
what share will go down Congress both
share also goes down and this is not
unique of carnet but this happens in
every state because there are larger
number of player independents are there
and smaller regional party gets work so
both you will see and not only about
Karnataka it happens in every Stoke so
it may not necessarily happen you know
that it's not about preference for BJP
and Congress in one election all right
I'm going to talk about a correlation
that we have drawn up an interesting
correlation if you correlate the
assembly elections in 2018 to looks of
her and the correlation index very very
interesting on our screens at this
moment
BJP all said to get 13 seats while
Congress party 11 JD's may have to
settle at 4 and what we are essentially
doing in Serbia correlating both the two
of them now this may or may not happen
but this throws out a very very
interesting figures if you look at what
happened in 2018 it was a fractured
mandate we saw you know Jarius and
congress coming together but if that was
to happen once again in the Lok Sabha
elections we could see you know both
Jarius as well as the Congress party
managing about 15 seats out of the 28 I
would slightly disagree with this number
because once JDS and Congress are in
alliance they are already in alliance
the seats for BJP will go down further
and my own sense is that they will be in
single digit in Karnataka maybe 5 7 or 8
seats not more than that because
Congress JDS together are in a bit in a
far more better position compared to BJP
if you merge the word share of Congress
and GDS yes it is a mathematical
exercise but even if you merge 80 80 80
85 percent of the vote they will be far
ahead of BJP 's workshare so I think my
own sense is BJP will be in single-digit
in Karnataka so we saw you know a lot of
talks about the transfer of war today
and we are also following the story very
very closely the the basically the
distribution with which Congress and
JD's has now come out the mathematics
2022 Congress 8 to JD s it appears of
the sea surge areas has got other seats
which have been dominated by BJP which
JP pastures are you certain given the
kind of politics that is happening at
this point in time that BJP will have to
settle down for single numbers because
it appears the BJP may just have the
upper hand and cannot occur today I
don't see that happening but you
mentioned about the seeds which have
been given to JD s where BJP has a very
strong hold see it is a three-way
contest in Karnataka as I said Congress
is presence all over but in some locale
in some region and that is the southern
region where Congress would share is low
but that in the southern region it is a
contest between JD s and and BJP
so if you see VIPs war share up there
it's also if you compare JD s and
Congress it's the bastion of JD s so JD
s have been given those seeds because JD
s has a stronghold in this constitution
not because in the sheet sharing
arrangement some mischief has been done
and seeds have been given to JD s
because they are likely to lose those
seeds no no party would accept that you
know yes these are for the two parties
but I think my own sense is that this is
a fair distance absolutely appreciate
you Sanjay Kumar for joining us and you
heard it first here on news let's and if
that happens BJP is all said to be
reduced to single digit as far as the
loafs of my elections in 2019 is
concerned that's the prediction coming
in Karnataka in Karnataka and that's the
prediction of course coming in from our
guest here sanjay kumar from CSDs thanks
very much for watching this is one of
the long editions of the State of the
Union we focus on each state every
passing day we focus today on cannot sit
are much more coming up in the next

Despite of stitching an alliance with the JDS in Karnataka - The transfer of ...,2019-03-19T09:07:17Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ouFlSCIyttY/hqdefault.jpg,"big story location where we just heard
about the coalition troubles which are
really existing between the Congress and
genius despite offer featuring a seat
sharing consensus take us through what's
happening in our nation Pelham Ghana
looks like this white of Chandrababu
Naidu attending each and every auntie
Modi rally finally they have decided to
go alone in Andhra Pradesh there is
absolutely no alliance as far as an
tradition Telangana
is concerned but surely is happening
with the gut abundant dreams there
aren't they seem to be you know does it
seem to become bling like or the rest of
the country yes the dreams of GDP and
Congress shattered in both in on the
possession in Telangana there is no
alliance between TDP and Congress
Congress party you already releases the
list of all the candidates and details
no any aliens with any political party
GDP also as far as on the purchases
concerned that gender of another state
is concerned the list was released and
they are going solely only jinsana party
a newly launched by cinema hero Pawan
Kalyan has alliance with Communist
Party's CPI CPM and BSP remaining
parties even busier he is going alone in
the state of Andhra Pradesh in the as
far as Telangana is concerned
TRS and visit we are yet to release they
missed their their lives are unexpected
soon since from yesterday itself the
nomination process has started
people are filing the other parties are
filing nominations very rapidly were
wisely also file nomination even though
there is no alliance between
ma a.m. and PRS various the friendly
contest only Vova sees is contesting
only I am Mariam is contesting only
Hyderabad c2 TRS is leaving to him that
said and he is going to campaign for
tiaras in the rest of the Telangana
it means that there are friendly
alliances means no friendly contest
between parties but officially there is
no alliance in Andhra also there is
something in some seats there are
friendly alliances between no contest
between a TDP and Jenna Sarah party but
officially there is no any alliance in
Andhra in Telangana also the same
situation follows
they managed to like you know Congress
party managed to get candidates and
filled it all candidates in all over and
it was a surprising issue even though it
lost two deposits in all the seats and
the last time in under four days it
decided to fight it alone well
absolutely and as part of the tvp's
concern they have released the finalists
of for not only the state election but
also the national elections isn't it
location making their absolutely clear
that there will be no alliance with the
Congress of any sort and if you look at
Casey our statements also statements
which he made as early as yesterday
there of course a while he signed a
national role he's criticized the
Congress and the BJP but it gave rise to
speculations that Casey ara will be more
open to align with the BJP poster of
course the post depending on the numbers
the beta P and the TRS managed to get
isn't it
yes definitely that is what the feeling
in Kalen ghana is that is the criticism
of congress party also you know case
here is very practical person it doesn't
have any illusions in the meeting house
except that is going to infuse national
politics and he wants to go to delhi and
a and stay in Delhi after the selections
depended depending on the results they
got he is aiming for all sixteen states
and he says that he yes they are support
of 100 and 120 I am peace he doesn't he
did not say that he is going to get what
250 are 300 amperes there he wants to
influence the national politics he wants
to be part of the next upcoming
government and he wants no pomp
portfolios like Oh agricultural ministry
irrigation our irrigation and water road
resources this kind of ministry ports he
wants he a railway and all these things
without ministries he wants to doll up
Telangana in the other know where the
regional parties are so powerful they
want to have a great say in Telangana I
in in in Delhi that's what the thinking
of kcra's even Congress also criticizing
that is the B team of for BJP but he is
equally a mentoring distance with
Congress from Congress and BJP but yes
whereas the political scenario is
concerned he will be part of the next
government whichever comes into the
power and delay managed to win dress two
seats as part of our relations concern
their vote Cheryl was about twenty
percent isn't at location or help us
understand really how you know a
triangular fight row with all these
parties are going alone the TDP of
course the Congress thirty RS and the
BJP
how it will end up playing out as far as
the BJP is concerned for the upcoming
elections
yes the BJP is eyeing for - two or three
seats only in as far as Telangana is
concerned it wanted to it is trying a
heart to the Tyne Secundrabad seat that
is a part of Hyderabad you know the
present MLA bun dr. Khatri MP the Tatra
our central mystery is there and a new
candidate is coming is is going to
contest from that seat from BJP because
you know in the last assembly elections
a BJP and Congress TDP all parties
failed miserably so that the Tia Tiaras
may get majority seats in as far as
Telangana is concerned he may get to
know I about 14 and 15 seats outer ones
out of 17 sits in Telangana because in
Opa but his airplane congress try to
make these electrons between Modi and
Rahul Gandhi both of the parties active
cells in case they have that even if
Kelsey R wins all the 16 seats in
Telangana he cannot influence Delhi
politics but Kelsey s was different he
he is aligning with Jagan Mohan Reddy in
the neighboring state or with
opposition party leader he wants to
influence with the regional parties in
Delhi right get to what he wants to tell
under now absolutely look used to stay
with us so did you scrape off the
Congress is so also joining us the uber
afternoon sir thank you for joining us
on music sir Sir if you speak about
Karnataka reports now suggest that
despite of the Congress radius reaching
a seat sharing consensus the transfer of
what really seems to be a problem that
the grassroot level workers of the
Congress and the genius are not working
in tandem with each other and it may end
up helping the Congress how do you react
to this sir
right we seem to have lost that line now
with the British collab of course we
will try and reconnect with him I mean
viola Lucas is still live with us a
location from two Nautica - of course
Andhra and Telangana help us understand
as far alright location of mr. Philip as
back with us to stay with us I'll come
back to you mr. Kellogg popgasa talking
about Karnataka reports now suggests the
despite of the Congress ingenious
reaching a safe sharing consensus the
grassroot level workers of the party
eventually working with each other
they're not working in tandem and the
transfer of votes really seems to be a
big issue in this alliance as far as
looks of our polls are concerned sir how
do you react to this you know news and
do you think it could dent you know the
Congress various electoral prospects
okay if you put yours have just repeat
my question the question was which
reports no success at the spite of the
Congress JD is being in an alliance
finalizing a seat sharing pact the
transfer of vote really seems to be a
huge problem between your party and
radius at your grassroot level workers
are working in tandem with each other do
you sing it could dent your electoral
prospects sir no no that's not true
because the via right that is not the
first time that you know election will
be seamless you divide elections in I
think any client constituency no problem
and the JDS talk leaders necessary maya
Kumaraswamy and devi bola and others
meeting but you know even while a
meeting of the coalition partners is on
you know the reports are coming in and
specially I speak about Monday because a
complaint has come from the Jay dias
workers who are now saying that many
there are there are many
Congress supporters despite of mondaya
of being a high
take battle they say is after the
Congress workers many of them are
sabotaging our the geniuses of prospect
so how do you respond to that sir would
you say would you concede that transfer
of votes really could be a problem so
you can see the local jail BCP sorry
because like I said those are the first
election which is taking place rewrite
elections earlier there's like three
parliamentary elections and we wash of
the BJP was joining us you know mile
because when a super just hear what -
Jessica laughs Baja to say reduce kalapa
saying the forum is now claiming that
the Congress radius Alliance could end
debt no - the BJP in Karnataka and that
any news of Alliance troubles of
transfer of both so it is not true how
do you react to this because really see
or Congress or genius alliance you know
as you know as a formidable force
something which you need to be worried
about
right we seem to be having some trouble
with Malvika finishes lines they're
about the jewish crap of course still
with us on the phone line you know
fusion spell upon when you're speaking
about these complaints that have been
coming from the Jarius aside a section
of local congress leaders and workers
this is what the various claim the scene
supporting a samantha who is her
contesting as an independent candidate
in mangia
as she was denied a ticket you know by
your party this is what j dias leader
and drew minister assad Mahesh show has
said in his mantra your party of
repercussions if there is any
misadventure or in this vocal eager
Bastion so certainly there are voices
sir as I just pointed out from the
Jarius who are now saying that your own
workers are trying to sabotage the JD s
as prospects you know it are these Nene
are these reports true would you concede
that there is some rift as far as the
ground level workers of the Congress and
JD's are concerned nobody see I can't
tell you that there is nobody at all
who's in the Indian National Congress
now who's supporting some another I
cannot tell you that at all thank you
but I can also tell you that once the
election process begins if any Congress
workers found supporting of you why you
saying it you take disciplinary action
but you're not dismissing reports that
there could be Congress leaders who are
supporting the sumalatha that is that of
course is the stand of the congressman's
you want denying that as well so in any
possibility not just in shimla Turkey
there are twenty eight constituency it
might be a congress worker most
importantly we will not supporting the
official candidate of the coalition
point a point a computer school Appa
thank you for joining us and users of
course that was a congress spokesperson
from karnataka saying that if any
Congress leader is found you know
sabotaging the party's prospect as far
as Alliance is concerned they will take
this premier action a leash of course on
the phone line with a Spanish you just
saw at the reaction of the Congress a
while the Congress and Allison
point that they will not accept on
national television that their own party
workers are sabotaging the campaign of
the Jarius of as far as at least Manya
is concerned they are not even denying
this so this clearly shows that
something is not right or with the
alliance partners their grassroot level
workers are not working together they
are not working in tandem clearly
Congress workers are miffed or with
genius are getting as many as eight
seats
right I'm not sure if you know Harish is
on the phone line we will try and
connect with the Harish but of course
there was a very important statement
coming from Malvika Avinash of the
Congress wouldn't deny news or reports
of the rift between the ground level
workers of the Congress in the janeers
remember as far as the radius is
concerned we had managed to win just
about you know two Lok Sabha seats in
the last election this time around they
have been offered eight seats something
or which had missed many Congress
workers and leaders in Karnataka there
had been many Congress workers who had
said that the Congress had ceded a large
number of seats to the radius and now of
course reports coming in that all's not
well between that alliance between other
JDS and the Congress and the grassroot
level workers are working are not
working in tandem with each other will
it really you know benefit the b2p or
harm the electoral prospects of the
Congress various lines of force or
something which remains to be seen and

has told us that Pakistan has used f-16s
sources says the U.S has taken note of
India's concerns
the U.S has sources tell us that the U.S
has said that f-16s were given earlier
U.S appreciates India giving information
this is the latest news break coming in
on the F-16 U.S use by Pakistan in their
operation against India
Ashish Singh is joining us live with
more details on this story Ashish what
more can you share with our sources
telling us that India has conveyed on
the highest levels the usage of that
F-16 and further proof of it as well by
Pakistan
correct I was speaking to uh a couple of
topmost sources in the minister of
external Affairs uh to understand about
what has been the outcome of the foreign
secretary Vijay gokhile's visit to U.S
remember he was in uh Washington for uh
for three four days and he has made
several columns and the uh meetings
including Secretary of State Mr Pompeo
now there have been couple of major
achievements and outcomes from this
particular visit of foreign secretary
Vijay go clay to U.S one is that U.S has
been taken on board as far as the entire
episode
including the balacute airstrike and
after that the F-16 usage by Pakistani
Air Force uh there's been a positive
reaction from U.S that they appreciate
the fact that Indian government has kept
the uh Americans real time updated after
pulama attack on every major development
taking place so that's where exactly you
see us has been supporting India and the
Indian government has been of the
opinion that keeping U.S in Loop is
always beneficial be diplomatically or
militarily second is just after the
unscd one two six seven uh committee
that uh
is the especially the global terrorists
that one aspect has been converted from
India in their side that Indian
government is happy that U.S became the
designated the main proposing country as
far as the entire uh process of listing
master that is concerned and the other
aspects like the usage of F-16 by
Pakistani Air Force has been very
strongly highlighted by
foreigns have resulted in a lot of
positive outcomes as far as the entire
uh visit of foreign
major uh strong allies including U.S and
UK and France on board and keep them
updated about it and one such a visit by
Foreign
will the Indian government plan the next
move at the unsc1267 committee uh to
ensure that this time we get China as
well on board so the Diplomatic domain
is going to be a fully occupied for the
Indian government uh specifically with
the Masood azer listing at unsc1267 and
U.S is again gonna play a crucial role
in the entire process so you have a lot
of
foreign secretaries bilateral meetings
taking place in the U.S in last four to
five days and that has given a lot of
positive outcome for India in fact
further news coming in at this point
sources telling uh news acts in India's
directory in touch with China
Delhi willing to give China time
this of course remember on the Masood
Azhar issue so sister said they
encouraged by the support we are
encouraged by the support of 14 members
India is confident on azer's listing we
are confident of course on others
listening and for further details on
this let me go back to Ashish Singh
Ashish what further details can you tell
us as far as the Masood Azhar issue is
concerned what are your sources telling
you
so when I when I ask this question to
our top diplomatics in the ministry of
external Affairs and to understand that
what's going to be the Indian
government's plan and in one word they
informed me that we are in no hurry we
are going to wait for China to realize
that's why the terrorism is concerned a
couple of sub points that were mentioned
by our sources in the mea is that the
terrorism is not going to be a factor
which will fall in the negotiation
domain by any of the uh UNSC permanent
members so uh terrorism is not going to
be one area where Indian government is
going to have any kind of uh cutting the
deal or having it swapped with some
other kind of uh trade or something like
that nothing of that sort is going to
happen terror is non-negotiable is
something that we have been conveyed
very clearly in addition to that I would
like to inform our viewers that there
were at three different level the direct
communication between India and China
was happening during the one two six
seven uh process the entire week and the
last week one uh the foreign secretary
spoke to the Chinese Ambassador here in
New Delhi we had Indian Ambassador
speaking to the Chinese Minister of
Foreign Affairs in Beijing and the uh
India's permanent representative Mrs
speaking to his his Chinese counterpart
the permanent representative of China at
the UNSC so multiple level conversations
were happening so when you have direct
established communication at multiple
levels between India and China we don't
need any other country to have any kind
of negotiation or convince in China for
uh
so this particular aspect has been very
strongly highlighted that one we are
gonna wait we are not uh in any kind of
hurry as far as Masood is concerned we
will again raise it after following the
due procedure of nine months as and when
we feel is the right time uh that is
going to be the consistent effort from
the Indian government side and there's
not going to be any cutting the deal
kind of aspect involved here and second
is that when you have India China
directly talking on this particular
aspect uh then certainly the involvement
of any other major country in this
becomes little less as compared to in a
situation where India China will not be
talking so in this particular case you
have seen India China establishing
direct communication at multiple levels
and uh this time the efforts have failed
I has not resulted in the positive
outcome but the sub product the
byproduct of the entire process is
extremely encouraging for India because
you have at least 14 out of 15 permanent
members of the UNSC supporting India on
listing of masudas so that's a very
valid point that you're saying Ashish
over 14 nations of course have supported
us it literally went down to the wire at
the last minute of course China blocked
this hole but India not taking this uh
uh you know as such a huge setback we're
looking at it uh you know we're
encouraged of course by the overwhelming
support and that's why we're ready for
the Long Haul India willing to give
China a time uh further efforts will be
made directly with China Ashish on this
issue this issue will be brought up
perhaps in dialogues that will happen
between our top diplomats in the Indian
and Chinese uh you know in in between
India and China
in the days ahead
between India and China our conversation
has been happening remember just after
purvama attacked just after a day after
uh balakote airstrike we had the
external affairs minister sushma swaraj
in China for the trilateral meeting
taking place between India China and
Russia and this has been one of the uh
Futures main features as well the entire
series of India China relations
concerned specifically after wohan
Summit between Prime Minister Modi and
Chinese Premier Xi Jinping and that has
been the constant feature which will
continue in the coming future as well

EdSG65Tnn8E,Operation Sunrise: Joint Operation Between Indian Army and Myanmar Army; Big NewsX Exclusive,Operation Sunrise: Joint Operation Between Indian Army and Myanmar Army; Big NewsX Exclusive - This is a NewsX exclusive.,2019-03-15T10:34:52Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EdSG65Tnn8E/hqdefault.jpg,"you're watching news X let's turn our
attention to the big news X exclusive we
broke for you just a short while back
the Indian Army has conducted operation
sunrise in the Northeast
these were joint operations between
India and Myanmar from the 17th of
February till the 2nd of March when the
world was focusing on India's response
to Park Terra Post poll Varma and for
further details on this I want to go
straight across to my colleagues Richard
Gulati and David Koch Oprah over to you
hi you're watching us on music's and
news X YouTube let's give you now a
graphical explanation of what this
operation sunrise was which is now going
to go down in history as one of the
biggest surgical strikes and joint
operations we ever conducted along with
their memories forces I have my
colleague David Carr with me let's now
take this up on a screen and give you a
map graphic explanation of what's going
on Devika take us through this
absolutely rush up so the strike was
carried out by the Indian Army as well
as the minor marami was a joint
operation
let's tell you what really was happening
what was the target the target right
here for our for the benefit of our
viewers was the caravan project the
colored on project is a multi-modal
infrastructure project that is
connecting Kolkata to the sittwe project
I will just mark it out right here for
our viewers it's connecting Kolkata to
situate remember that if we were to go
across the border this black line that
you see right here the distance is 2 6 7
2 kilometers yes however because of this
the Kerrigan project the distance
reduces to 539 kilometers therefore this
project is extremely important for India
and mine Ahmad as far as our
connectivity is concerned and this
particular project connecting Kolkata to
sit way became the target of the
insurgent groups as for the information
that we have we have been told that
insurgents actually traveled about
thousand kilometers from the unnatural
from areas bordering on Russia Pradesh
up to meas around so they came all the
way here and set up their base
in me surround this insurgent group is
the arcon army that is trained by VK I
am sure if you can tell us a little bit
more about the idea so let us let me
explain what they because actually
saying here so you have on your screens
as you well know that the Northeast
states if you have a look over here the
Northeast states when you're going into
Assam this is of course the border that
has been mapped out this is the border
off here of Bangladesh this is the
border of Nepal in the red and this is
the border of Bhutan Sikkim is here so
as you know to travel to the northeast
state right now which is landlocked you
have to go through something called the
chicken's neck it's called the security
corridor this is the Siliguri corridor
as most Indians would recognize this is
the only land access that India has into
the Northeast now this has a problem
both the strategic concerns and on and
for a trade and practical economic
concerns the strategic concerns at this
we know that China has an army a
mountain strike Corps based out of Tibet
we do know if all of you remember what
happened Indo clam that they are trying
to move into parts of Bhutan as well and
the reason they're moving doing all of
this is so that they can strategically
threaten the Siliguri corridor and
potentially if there are any hostilities
ever in the future cut off the chicken's
neck which would remove access land
access from India and to the Northeast
and that's the strategic problem the
economic problem david has already told
you is that if you want trade access
into the northeast only now are we
getting air ports that are opening in
several of these seven sister states but
the land access has to go through the
siliguri corridor and that's a distance
as she has pointed out of two six seven
two kilometers that's how much travel
time you have to get into misery so a
plan was conceived along with the manor
but his government remember India India
maintained relations even during the
time of the middle of the military junta
in Myanmar for this particular reason
was to give in sittwe which is here at
the bottom of your screens a port along
the river the 62 kilometers along the
river and then a 129 kilometer road
journey into mem into Missouri and this
entire project which is being which was
being constructed is being constructed
is meant to
use the travel time into my sarong into
a particular culmination point called
long fly in Mizoram to four days so from
four days from long to line is Iram
straight to the City Airport and then of
course you can open trade or via the
port with Kolkata in the rest of
mainland India or with the rest of the
world now the strategic concern of
course over here is before we come down
to what this our economy is and what
they were doing over there is if you
look at the City Airport just south of
the city airport right here is where the
Chinese have been looking to build a
port as well it's support that they have
been constructing with the manatees it's
in in kwok view is where the chinese are
trying to build a port and that was the
string of pearls now we know that this
our economy which has been operating on
the borders of Arunachala is a chinese
backed insurgency force all the
principal insurgency force that happened
at the activity secessionist activities
are taking place in northeast almost all
of them are backed by china both in
terms of arms and ammunition and in
terms of money now these people is very
clear to us from the intelligence
sources that we have managed to gather
over the course of the past few hours
that the China that these Chinese back
term insurgency shiney backed a militia
was trying to take out this very
important corridor that is connecting
Kolkata vias its way in Myanmar into
misery for the principal reason that
China wants to maintain a strategic
advantage which is to tie down India's
access to the Northeast by the Siliguri
corridor and of course to prevent the
development of the Northeast and the
best way of developing the northeast of
course is not just pumping in money is
through trade letting the people of
Indian citizens in India's northeast
have access to the sea and open routes
to trade I wall ready pointed out in
Kohaku where the Chinese are already
building a port that is just south of
situate the Chinese were hoping to build
a port in Chittagong which is in in
Bangladesh that now under the Sheikh
Hasina government is likely to be
further store the Chinese of course have
been building a port in humble tota
in in Sri Lanka which is in a billion
dollars of debt to the Chinese and
they've pretty much had to hand over
that port to the chine
in guava of course is the culmination
point in Pakistan of the CPEC corridor
so China wants to build ports all around
India in the Indian Ocean for one
principal reason the reason is most of
Chinese oil which is needed to power the
Chinese economy that comes from the
Middle East comes from Saudi Arabia and
other countries has to go through
something known as the Straits of
Malacca the Straits of Malacca are a
naval choke point near Indonesia and the
under man islands where the Indian Navy
and the u.s. Navy are the only
dominating forces the Chinese surface
ships find it difficult from their home
bases which are much further north and
east to have a presence in the Straits
of Malacca so that's the counter to have
ports everywhere they even tried to
build a port in the maldives but with
the recent government change in the
Maldives that's now unlikely to happen
the current Sri Lankan government has
also learned the error of its ways of
what happened Harman tota the mana
Mary's government has always been in
favor of China China was his only major
ally during the years of the military
junta so the fact that this is a
memories Indian joint operation is a
much bigger indicator that India has
managed to convince the ruling parties
in Myanmar and they will do it for their
own interests of course to balance China
and India that these particular
insurgent outfits can be taken out now
the information that we have that this
air economy which has been operating on
the Chinese side of the Arunachal of
Arunachal Pradesh remember the one major
battle that India and China for 162 was
basically fought on oxide Chin and
Arunachal which you see on the top of
your screens are followed by a
unilateral Chinese withdrawal from
Arunachala now this is where these
insurgents have been operating they have
been trying to whip up tensions in
Nagaland whip up tensions in misery whip
up tensions in Arunachal as well and we
did the first-ever surgical strike
conducted under the Modi government was
against one of these outfits who had
targeted
Indian security force convoy a bus
convoy leading to heavy casualties we
took them out and in fact for most
people watching this broadcast if you've
seen the movie arre it begins with the
surgical strike that took place on the
memories
in this surgical-strike we have been
told that the Special Forces were
involved along with the assam rifles and
other infantry sections of the Indian
Army we also have information that
drones were used as well as other
reconnaissance equipment that we have
along with helicopters to come in and
out this operation is an ongoing
operation so the operation is not over
but the principal part of the operation
is over and this callaghan project which
goes through the labor collar than 162
kilometers I'm over the river and then
120 kilometer road corridor that
connects it to miss Iran this has now
been protected and preserved which of
course has the advantageous effect that
not only have we sent a strategic
message to the Chinese who want don't
want India's northeast to have access to
a direct port buy of Manama we've sent a
second strategic message by having a
joint operation with the memories we
managed to take on these these jihadi
insurgents and teach them a lesson and
we have ensured that the Northeast's one
potential major lifeline is now going to
be preserved and be built and that will
have to be an ongoing operation to
continue this remember that what the
Chinese want to do in us pointing out
just here is for pew which is just just
the south of sittwe that's the cross I
put at the bottom of your screens this
is copy where the Chinese are building a
port now what the Chinese want to do is
they want to go through Myanmar and then
access the Chinese provinces through the
north and build they are trying to build
an a pipeline for oil and gas so this
will cut down and give them a second
option to what they're already building
in CPEC which is through guada and then
into into through gilgit-baltistan into
jingxian so this is what being the
Chinese plan has been and we have
successfully through a military
operation sent out a message that the
Chinese plan is going to be countered
the strategic message will be sent out
these insurgents who've been plaguing
the northeast chinese-backed have been
taught a lesson and is going to have to
be an ongoing operation to product to
protect this entire entire corridor
that's it whatever of course watching
this on news X on YouTube if you're
watching us on YouTube do leave your
comments below and make sure you
share this video so the maximum number
of people can know exactly what's
happened and get a full inside story
thanks for watching all right well
thanks elite for that live update
Rishabh and Derek I remember this of
course was one of the largest scale
operations along the Indo mine mark
border which was split into two phases
the deployment for the operation
included Special Forces of the Indian
Army the assam rifles and other infantry
units the operation of course was
conducted after inputs and mega
infrastructure projects as I was telling
you earlier in the northeast were under
threat particularly the Caledon project
as they Ricardo shop which is sharing
with you intelligence inputs were
received at the our economy which is an
insurgent group in Myanmar set up new
bases along the Missouri border
targeting the color than project the our
economy is trained by the cotton
independence independence army in the
north watering China the groups are said
to have Chinese backing insurgents have
traveled around a thousand kilometers
from areas are joining our natural to
the Mizoram border the transit product
that was being targeted in India would
connect Kolkata to the sittwe port in
mind Mart and finally end up linking
neither arm to this would have been a
gateway to the land lock northeast as
well so let me quickly of course bring
in Sumi Chaudhary on to the broadcast
now who of course broke this story for
us operation sunrise conducted
successfully sumit in the northeast it's
been done before we've had successful
strikes on insurgents you know along the
main Indo mindmap border but this was
perhaps a larger scale operation of its
kind joint operation which we've seen in
the recent past well you have rightly
pointed out this is the largest
operation but a joint operation on the
surveillance and the information sharing
because whatever the men McCartney or
Indian Army share with each other after
that these operations have been
concluded and most importantly oh they
there is a clear in their inputs coming
from thee from the both side that how
these insurgents groups not only trying
to disturb the manma but also trying to
disturb the mega-projects of Indian on
Indian side especially in the Northeast
and Caledon project is one of the most
prominent project in that particular
area and after that receiving all those
inputs in an army with the Special
Forces or some rifles have conducted
operation and this is started with I am
from 17th of a two-second of Martha
although this operation is still
continuing there but what is most
important that after getting each and
every input Indian Army I have not only
tightened their security in these at the
international border
I add the Menma but also then operation
so that they cannot do any work they
cannot cultivate themselves they cannot
do any harm to the to the mega-projects
and burn more important thing to
readjust we just would like to share
with our viewers is that that along the
main mark border is almost six hundred
sixteen hundred forty three kilometer
and that is very pair very important
place because densely forested area it's
very tough to do surveillance at that
particular place and along these Indo
mind Mac border but then these kind of
surveillance when these kind of inputs
came to the forces they try and do
operation immediately and that is what
this sunrise operation have the the one
of the big biggest example back to you
there
let me also bring in at this point
Rajesh Pandey on the broadcast British
while the entire nation's attention was
towards the indo-pakistan boda looking
at what sort of action would be taken
post pull Varma this was a swift
strategic strike that was conducted
along the Indo mine Mart border
successfully targeting the our economy
and successfully you know foiling the
risk that they were trying to pose to
infrastructure projects you know of
India and Manmadha
well absolutely and I think you know
this is how are all these a successful
surgical strikes are carried out when
you know whole world was completely
focused on on the indo-pakistan and
whether the India is going to retaliate
against Pakistan or not post-poll vomit
terror attack an Indian Army was busy
also busy
in carrying out a successful joint
operation along with a Miami pulley a
man bar army so it's very clear and that
you know India was not completely
focused only on on the this pulao artful
vomit attack but was also completely
focused on to make sure that strategic
interests are not compromised as far as
Miami border is concerned I remember
India faces to border to its two hostile
countries you know on one side is
Pakistan on the other side is China this
is the first time China has attempted to
you know to intimidate India first this
was no climb and now this time it was a
terror outfit it was an insurgency
outfit which was aided trained by China
to hit out it it's at installations
which were extremely vital to India
strategic interest but Indian Army along
with the Manoir army carried out a
successful surgical operation whereby
they made sure that they were able to
secure the strategic inside interest of
India while the entire world was focused
on you know on the Pakistan side over
there India was going ahead to launch
another surgical strike to avenge the
pol wama attack or not
absolutely and before I bring in Wing
Commander be Sheikh Marty man and
Colonel Sharon's sing as well on to the
broadcast let me quickly go back to sumh
Sumita
you know this just quickly recap for our
viewers what were the main projects the
main infrastructure projects that were
on the radar of this insurgent group
well the intelligence well the
intelligence have clearly indicated and
then inputs which you come to the forces
is that that they have their main target
is color than projected so almost 1,600
clones of project and one of the most
prominent and mega project in the
Northeast which will connect the
Northeast with the man Mac port and that
will be that will be easy for India to
to dispatch each and every to dispatch
the equipment's to dispatch the the main
raw materials to the northeast edge by
Amman mal so this is very
Fortin project and that too is in the
process of complication and that
particular time when this development is
going on that time they have received
the input that how the our economy is
going to target these infiltrators have
trying to target these the main projects
mega projects of India and after that
the mega operations operation some guys
have been concluded have been started
from 17th of till the 2nd of March and
that - very important when each of us is
looking after the after the LOC at the
LD at the different areas of Jammu and
that particular time also in their army
is doing although the operation in
northeast also absolutely let me bring
in our defense analyst girl shell in
Seng now to the broadcast Colonel in
saying you're hearing of course the
details of this operation sunrise
successful operation which was conducted
by the Indian Army and the mine marami
jointly the first details of which we
broken right here on news X what is your
first reaction sir I can only tell you
one thing congratulations to all the
political parties not to have paid
attention towards it maybe by ignorance
but the good part is that it proves that
India can do things where it matters if
we can show our will if we can show our
might to protect such a vital you know
infra of ours it can be done anywhere
that proves the point here here you you
see if now you were discussing I was
hearing the China has not said anything
so far you know why because this is what
China always does a third party they
tencel never get involved they'll always
involve somebody else this is the
ballgame which probably India has
understood with mine mark but somehow we
are not understanding it towards our
northern borders at Pakistan we are for
lost so many days we have been wondering
that why China is supporting Pakistan it
is all to do with business the way it is
to do with business in Myanmar good
thing is that yes we have woken up to
this requirement that whether it is mine
Mar or it is India we are prepared to
stop anything which we
affect our national strategic infra a
six that is what comes out of this and
it can be done so successfully with no
objections from anywhere this is this is
the learning this is the learning the
whole country is sleeping on northeast
VIII was other day interacting with the
ex chief minister of nagaland yes mr. Z
Leung mr. Celia was so categoric in
saying that then is the country going to
pay attention towards northeast for the
complete country northeast doesn't exist
we asked one of the Kashmiri separatist
that where is money for reference to our
mature he could not there is he's
becoming a expert on northeast by giving
a statement that army is a rapist there
you don't know what state is existing
where similarly I am trying to tell you
that here here is a very beautiful
example this is called as actual
surgical strike which goes unnoticed it
should stay unnoticed what we are doing
in north there is a learning to take
from northeast that yes similar things
ought to be done towards the north and
our northern borders absolutely and and
as far as of course these infrastructure
projects were concerned they were
extremely crucial which have been
protected by us Colonel shell in saying
you know at the end of the day
connecting the Northeast a developing
infrastructure there so that more
development can take place in those
regions improved access to remote areas
there and also more connectivity between
mine modern and India you and mine mar
is a strategic partner absolutely you
see that distance which was earlier
taking you nearly five to six days
probably you'll get covered in one to
two days maximum one number two whenever
you will make a road you can please see
it during the time of Punjab that is
Cairo
what is Cairo do do the Punjab he only
brought roads the complete credit of
Punjab development goes to roads you
connect places area will prosper
the locals will prosper prosperity will
come to that state this road is
important to us not only from the point
of view of business it is also important
that yes all throughout way
is going you are going to bring in a lot
of prosperity people will develop
themselves along these roads
it automatically uplifts their social
life you aren't going to do a business
you are going to earn but this is how
you also earn the locals and the people
and you give them that support if today
we have a problem in Northeast is
because of what because of accessibility
the kind of accessibility which exists
in Haryana Punjab if even 50% of it can
come towards Northeast then northeast is
a developed area it is so rich of
minerals it is so rich offer other
natural minerals which can be used but
you are not able to there's so much of
oil existing in nagaland
it is it is actually shocking that we
are not able to you know tap those
things why because of accessibility
because to go to that land you have to
walk I have physically walked I have
walked with that one of the ex ministers
from Nagaland that is mr. Thomas to see
that land this is how the prosperity
will come this is what we should
concentrate this should be our agenda
for elections if at all no but we will
not do this I am only trying to you know
feel very bad about it let's see today
you have brought out that there was a
surgical strike there is no politics
involved in it why that means that we
can stay away from such surgical strikes
and these surgical strains can do lot of
good without coming into prominence we
you think we have done it only for
ourself no we have not we have done it
for more of mine mark because they are
more affected by that insurgent group we
are we are also affected but they are
more affected they have a problem
Chinese are apparently supporting that
here is a example and still not so using
a word not saying a word of protest at
all and so much it all happened at the
end of the day silently and
strategically which is how it should
happen at the end of the day we don't
need to bows so we don't need to tell
people that this is what we're going to
do if you know these operations are done
with extreme precision but at the end of
the day with extreme confidentiality as
well and it was carried out over quite a
period
time was an instrument well definitely
oh there because every time then be
after this operation and cochon have
been raised every time the senior
official specially the army chief and we
have recently heard the air for chief
also which he clearly mention of a task
is to do the operation successful
operation without casualty and our focus
is only to safeguard the national
boundaries and that to prove again in
the in / the operation so a sunrise
because that to a silent operation a big
operation has been conducted when
everybody's looking at the at the north
then they have conducted a big operation
northeast just to save the boundaries of
North East and V we just bringing to our
viewers that how important is this is
that North is our North East boundary
with the male Mac because this is almost
sixteen hundred forty three kilometers
of international boundary which is most
important densely forested area and that
to how insurgents and trying to
infiltrate and not trying to inflate it
but also to destroy the main projects of
India and that particular time in dinar
me have to prove again that when they
have been 24/7 doing their work with the
with the pulled effectiveness back to
you
foreign let me also bring in at this
point Wing Commander avi Sheikh multi
man who is joining us from a
spokesperson Ministry of Defense Wing
Commander mataman sir your first
reaction to news and details which
you're hearing first write your news x
of this surgical strike which was
conducted along the Indo mine Mart
border northeast jihadi smashed our
economy smashed your first details
see what comes to the my mind right at
the forefront is when India has gone and
taken proactive steps to ensure the
security and safety of its strategic
interests all the skeletons come
tumbling out of the cupboard so far as
we were not very active we used to think
about all these concepts as a figment of
imagination or probably not in the real
realm of things now that we are
proactively countering China's a broad
banded strategy to surround India these
skeletons come tumbling out needless to
say what the steps taken by the
Government of India in the recent times
are absolutely on the right track we
have been proactive and that is what has
actually bring about a brought about
such significant change and a lot of
things have been exposed within the last
month or so what happened is after the
Pearl wama attack we took some proactive
action and and we showed the world what
what we can actually do we really mean
business and here we come to know today
through sources that there was a
simultaneous operation going on in the
Far Northeast these are two absolutely
critical areas from our point of view
strategically very important so it is a
welcome thing and what we must not
forget the entire conglomerate which is
trying and bring about these stability
inside the Indian subcontinent is at
work people what we must understand
there are a lot of nations with
geopolitical interests and and financial
interests in the Indian Ocean
so the paths that be are fighting really
hard probably in my mind to dislodge the
kind of proactive dispensation that
exists at the center today
absolutely and at the end of the day it
can be done with precision when
commander Matthew moon but it can be
done
in extreme confidentiality as well it
can be done when the entire nations
interests rather nations attention is
along the indo-pak border culture
aliasing want to come another point from
here yeah what does it bring out what
does it bring out to the world
we have been so worried about the
diplomacy we are so worried about China
we are so worried about what the other
countries will see nobody has said
anything why because you are protecting
your own assets simple absolute so what
is a lesson learned the lesson learnt is
whatever effects our interest will be
removed from the map the map of the
world that particular thing should cease
to exist this is what we can learn this
is what we can convey we can also tell
the whole world and our own country and
all terror group and all agencies which
are into India one thing we can do it we
will do it and we will continue to do it
whatever affects us we don't have to
look for anybody's permission we don't
want to beg for any support whether you
want to declare a leader as anti
terrorist list or not in the world or
you want to ban a group or not we will
handle it and we will continue to handle
it the way we feel it right because it
is affecting us that day we understand
that our government will understand that
our government will understand that it
will happen on ground
yes Wing Commander Boucher
see a broadly what we need to understand
is we fall back to Charles Darwin's
Origin of Species the basics the very
basics where which says struggle for
existence and survival of the fittest
so at the very basic might is right be
it military might be economic economic
wise so that is what has to take effect
now that the nation our nation over the
years had created some kind of a cloud
in the international forums especially
during the last preceding four to five
years that our prime minister has been
moving around the world so often and
especially with the Look East policy now
is the time to actually start reaping
the fruits of all that diplomatic effort
that go event on so vigorously for the
past few years and definitely unless we
show that we mean business which is
precisely what we are doing now yeah the
world wouldn't sit sit back and take
notice of hurt us so for us to get the
rightful place under the Sun this is the
way to go and it is highly appreciative
of the government the way it has handled
situation in the West simultaneously
while handling
incidentally inland or in the Far North
East remember and mind you this is not
an easy task but that speaks volumes
about our capabilities
whether diplomatically or militarily how
we can handle things when the need be
all right let me or quickly bring back
on the broadcast a report that was filed
earlier by my colleagues Richard Gulati
and David Koch Oprah breaking down for
you more details of this operation let's
pair up
[Music]
are you watching news X on youtube as
well as on music's television and we
have big breaking developments that
we're breaking on the channel and
simultaneously on YouTube
we've just been gotten information that
the Indian Army has conducted its
biggest ever joint operation along with
the Menominee's forces sometime and on
and about the February 17th to take on
one of the insurgent groups jihadi
groups operating out of Manama they
because my with me they become what
details do we have forces sometime on
and about the February 17th to take on
one of the insurgent groups jihadi
groups operating out of Manama day
because my with me they look up what
details do we have coming this insurgent
group is known as the erican army and
they were of course they were targeting
an infrastructure project that was
taking place along the into my nomadic
particularly the me sore arm a border
that area was being affected by this
insurgent group that's the information
that we have mega infrastructure project
yes yes that's what they were targeting
we had the information it was called
Operation sunrise the information that
we have is that it took place between
February 17th and massed the second all
of this time then of course there was
action happening in the Western theater
also in paloma and bonocore the
operation was split into two phases the
deployment for the operation included
the Special Forces of the Indian Army at
the assam rifles and other infantry
units drones helicopters and other
surveillance equipment was also used the
operation was conducted as they become
mentioned after the Caledon project
which was brought under threat by this
insurgent group that operates in the
north of Myanmar is called the our
economy and the ki a they were trying to
our target this project principally for
the reason that it is an infrastructure
project that connects the northeast of
India into Myanmar and we are being told
this army of course operates in the
north of Mohammed bordering China they
are said to be supported by China we are
also being told that these insurgents
are trying to enter Arunachal Pradesh
and the miserable areas the transit
project which was the archon project is
men
to connect Kolkata to the City Airport
in Manama and which eventually go
through Mizoram this was supposed to be
the access to the sea for the Northeast
why a man amar this chinese-backed group
was trying to target it but the joint
Manama Indian Army operation has wiped
it out this is the information we have
at this stage this is one of the biggest
if not the biggest military operation
that's taken place in recent years where
there was a surgical strike before the
one that took place in in Jammu and
Kashmir there was a certain surgical
strike that took place in Myanmar in the
weeks up to that this would be the
second major strike that's taken place
and if the information we have is
correct the scale of the strike has been
the largest yet that's the information
we have make sure you share this video
on YouTube and pass the information out
there we'll keep coming back for more
news and updates on this stay tuned for
more such videos subscribe to the new
sex YouTube channel it's the belly all
right I let me are quickly a drawback
Soumitra 3 on the broadcast so we just
tell us a bit about this insurgent group
that was targeted by the Indian Army in
the mine marami in this joint operation
well this group is active in the in the
northern part of man mag and they have
been there because various intelligence
input have also indicated that they get
a Chinese support from that particular
area to disturb the main mass but right
now but what information is getting
after after that they had this insurgent
group from the north part of man mark
have been moving to the south part and
specially towards the Mizoram area the
international border of in Mizoram and
that particular information is coming
back to the intelligence agencies on day
to day basis and after that the
operation has been conducted well what
is more important today is that if this
if they are able to target because if
the intelligence agencies are not able
to to share all those input with the
with the army then they will try and try
and destroy and try to harm these the
the mega-projects in northeast and what
is more important that the both the
countries Myanmar and India have
cultivated all those intelligence input
they did they start sharing each and
every input surveillance also locations
also and after that Indian Army has
conducted this operation along the
and in international border along the
international border at the main mark
and they have successfully and they
conducted a successfully completed this
operation first phase of operation
although this operation is still
continued at the at the at the various
level back to you and another big
question arises so mate as to why China
would be backing this insurgent groups
what is the strategic interest for China
in that region that's a very crucial
point so myth yeah so myth you take that
and then I'll get international in
saying on that point as well well what
is more important is that that China has
a vested interest in man mag and every
time because this is also continent how
China for their own vested interest is
try and influence the where various
groups in the man marks in this and that
that is the reason why this our economy
and these groups have been have been
have been getting a help and the and
they help at the various level and now
they are moving towards deep the south
and part is of the air of the of the man
mark and that is very crucial for India
because if they try and establish a base
of strong bases in the south and part
then they will definitely try and
destroy this makeup projects the the
projects which were was introduced by
the India and working in India is
developing all those projects so this is
very important and very importantly
operations at the at the Northeast
states back to you yes kind of financing
on that's a very crucial point yes
that's a very crucial point we must
understand why China would like to
support the arcon army there could be
only three reasons very simple with no
rocket science involved in it one keep
the Indian Army engage on the northeast
front also this is what the chief said
and everybody had that thing was
actually criticizing him when he said
that India has to be prepared for war on
two fronts though of course I would have
personally recommended to sir sir you
have to be ready on two and a half front
but there is a half front available
within the country also which has to be
dealt with because it appears that the
politicians itself won't be able to you
know satisfy each other so we need that
another half one to be ready that keep
accepting the criticism which comes to
army and carry on carry on - on
regardless
that is one part as
I said engage Indian Army on the
northeast side another one
China would never like that the economy
and the economic development of Myanmar
the India becomes a major partner they
would always want that India should stay
away from em why there's only way that
China can influence my at one another
one
whatever I'd like this infra which is
written why this is threatened it is
going to great greatest benefit so let
the benefit be denied to India make it
so expensive that India will start
having prohibitive losses if this infra
is broken in and root and may lose
interest in it this is why China this is
what has been China strategy always
without coming to front do something
which will engage that country into
things which are going to bleed them
that is why that is the interest of
China and you know at the end of the day
of course condition is saying we've not
stopped shy of targeting these
insurgents along the border you know
that's what Russia was pointing to as
well of course you know we knew the
attack that had taken place on our
forces in the northeast we avenge that
by wiping out you know a big fraction of
the insurgent group in the northeast
there and the NSC NK and that of course
was also shown in that popular film
hurry you know at the start of the
failures that successful operation so
it's not the first time but this of
course was large in its key and the
largest operation in its scale but it's
been done by by us before in the
Northeast oh yes yes very much very much
IIIi can't actually disclose it I was
one of them then we have done this yes I
I actually know what all we did but
there was no need to blow it up yeah
blow that trumpet all along not required
as I told you I was with that ex-chief
Minister of nagaland here that witnesses
in young this region is so good to say
you have to try and test who is actually
a Indian who is a support of an Indian
go across to these people get them they
are your main strain they are the one
who will get you everything all this
insurgency is absolutely negligible if
you are able to get them on
why you are fighting a minor insurgency
for simple reason economic gains there
are the economic games that road which
is made that is your economic game you
will bring in development that is how
everybody does it and China won't like
there to happen because they know it
that the moment India's concentration
starts to northeast and then northeast
starts developing China is losing a
economic battle on northeast that is
their strategic aim that is their
strategic vision that yes and when you
can't achieve it yourself you definitely
make sure that the other gentlemen
cannot do it that is India cannot get
that benefit that is what they are doing
and then first thing we have been awake
to it we have done it so successfully
and I wish we do it successfully all
around 360 degrees of our all borders
with no concern that who is looking in
our direction if we are justified we are
correct we admit something right we
don't have to worry we have to do it
this is a very living example a live
example of what best we could do
there can't be about one of the largest
possible you know attack on insurgency
goes unnoticed in the country why I I
think the answer is very well known to
everybody we have we have a responsible
media towards that their role is also
there that you bring it out after it has
up here to bring it out at a reasonable
time there after it has happened now
don't start naming the way the
politicians have started naming
criminals to reuse one operation mehta
or major Vikas these three operation
this is no way this is this is cheaper
nobody is known now that which SF was
used in this particular operation I know
it but we don't have to discuss it yes
okay before I get into my TSP commander
Bechet
yeah but uh as you asked
as Canosa just said I am fully in
agreement with him obviously the Belkin
Road initiative which actually China has
started years ago now they were the ones
who started to prepare the dough
obviously they won't be satisfied at
sharing the final final outcome that is
the file they are not ready to share a
piece of the pie in India because the
Bri initiative was this so that is where
their economic economic gains were what
they were looking at by yes by
establishing military bases and
surveillance centers all around India
which we popularly and since a long time
know has this string of pearls what has
happened in the last few years is
because of the definite international
overtures and a positive diploma
positive effort on the diplomatic front
we have been able to counter that to a
great extent by having created friendly
neighbors who would come very dependable
and to us when the need V for example on
the southern part the southern fringes
of China his Vietnam followed by
Singapore with which we have a recent in
the recent times created a kind of a
pact then coming to this this place and
coming into the Indian Ocean you have
cocoa islands which I must bring to
light that cocoa violence is part of the
yin Mary's territory where they the
Chinese have already established a
surveillance unit so this particular
place which we are talking about sit way
so it is absolutely crucial to our
interests in the region under Maha and
Nicobar Islands cocoa Islands is hardly
any distance it is within this
surveillance ranges of the network
stablished and the cocoa islands so this
is absolutely a proactive step also what
I want to bring to light another aspect
in the current context is wise we have
proved time and again that we are good
professionally equipped and very capable
of for ending our
interest what I suggest is it won't be a
bad thought to me of going on a little
bit of an offensive at least on the
cohort front well I'm so I'm so sorry
karate establishment is seized at that
point what points were taken and as
Colonel Shannon's saying pointed out
earlier that these operations are covert
and it's best that they remain at that
the details will come of course after
they are successful and get those
details also should be just disclosed
you know to a certain extent no need to
disclose every single fact for the
security of our you know Jevons and the
security of the people who carried out
the operation and as long as we know as
a country that the target has been of
achieved and the objective has been met
as I have for Steve had also said after
Bala code we should be satisfied all
right we'll have to leave it at that
Colonel Shannon sing when come and have
a shake Martha man and swim each other

just said that our aim is to keep the
BJP at bay and we will do whatever it
takes we are ready to play second fiddle
that's what we were talking about the
Rahul is gonna take a back step he's
gonna let all the region players come
together as long as they are keeping the
BJP out of power let's start with the
big estate Luther Pradesh 80 seats it's
gonna be a decision maker it always has
been what's happening in European akshay
well they let me start this with a
cliche the road to Delhi goes by a lock
now and in the finish the Congress has
got a major major snap from the SP and
BSP earlier remember the bonhomie
between Iowa C and Sonia Gandhi they
were seen in pictures together that head
bump moment made national headlines but
what happened in the end
Miami D has clearly said that she's not
going to ally with the Congress pan
India it's a major snap for the Congress
another big state West Bank ball
investment ball the local party Carter
had always been against aligned with the
TMC but even with the left which was
mostly choruses all-weather Ally had
even been in violation of forcing the
UPA first even there they're just
leaving a certain amount of seats out of
respect for each other they'll be no
mutual contest but is there a seed
sharing formula no and why don't you
tell us about what's happening in
Karnataka Tamil Nadu where they have
their a friends so-called allies but
nothing right absolutely so if we're
talking about allies a Karnataka of
course they're in in an alliance
government they've said that okay we
will be contesting together but no seed
sharing deal the elections have been
announced and no idea who's contesting
from how many seats so that is a major
indicator of whether the JDS is now
feeling a little jittery about going
ahead with the Congress and whether
they're also going to stick with the
Congress after the Lok Sabha elections
take place at the same time Tamil Nadu
that's the place where they've managed
to formalize an alliance with the DMK
they've said okay we will be fighting
together however again when Akshay no
seat sharing deals so they're not being
able to decide how how many seats each
person is going to be
testing if we were to compare that let's
say with the BJP right now they're
coming out with clear seed sharing
formulas if they're going alone they're
going solo they're telling you right to
the right to everyone's faces that okay
we're going to go solo in these
particular states but if they are going
with certain political parties they've
made sure that there's you know coming
out with a clear seed sharing plan if we
were to then shift her focus Meenakshi
let's say to a state like Delhi again
Congress has just Congress is the one
that said that we don't want an alliance
width up in Delhi but why don't you tell
us what happened with the Chandrababu
Naidu because it seems like Chandrababu
Naidu in Andhra Pradesh he remember has
been sort of backing mamta Banerjee in a
lot of ways when her big rally happened
and when she sat on the Donna he sort of
came ahead and became this middleman
that okay I will gather everyone all the
forces behind you so what's really
happening the problem it seems to be
bundled right now is that all these
regional sack traps are trying to really
project themself as some glue which is
binding these regional parties and then
and give it to be blocked together they
don't have one leader jump up on ideas
you're right here interesting dimension
has been seen at all the event ebgp
Larry's sitting right next to Rahul
Gandhi holding hands with him but what
happened no Alliance deal nothing in
Andhra Pradesh Telangana looks like all
the parties are going to go solo or solo
because they had a major drumming when
they allied with the TDP it's very
violent then completely absolutely so
for the Congress right now if we were to
sum it up it just seems like perhaps
they will be coming up with a seat
sharing deal as far as Bihar is
concerned our GD they just we other
seems like a level-headed sorted me
right now no see change from yeah it's a
sham you see a few days ago that if the
r3 doesn't stop posturing they may end
up going solo in Bihar as well so there
are differences which need to be ironed
down as far as the Congress is concerned
with all their allies absolutely so it
just seems like in Karnataka we right
now have an alliance yeah and in Tamil
Nadu they have an alliance but no seed
sharing deal anywhere else and nowhere
else like Meenakshi is also pointed out
that the Congress will not seems like
it's good not going to be going in an
alliance for these upcoming looks of
by-elections that of course was the
round up for the Congress as far as
there

apples we will be looking at some
much-needed electoral reforms and today
we will be talking about nota none of
the above option hi i'm anoxia pretty
with me is my colleague Uncle Albert hi
everyone so let's just begin with what
is nota first of all and when did the
need arise for this absolutely it's as
far as nota is concerned as we just told
to all of us no ties none of the above
option this is the option which you see
at the end of the evils when you go to
cast your ballot nota basically is not
true which is exercised by the voters
when they're not satisfied with any of
the candidate which have been offered to
us by the political parties now no
talked him into effect after the Supreme
Court told the Election Commission to
mandatorily include nota in the Evo
machines okay me not even my next
question would be as we all know that we
have more than eight rules for new
first-time voters this time so if I'm
not satisfied with any of the candidates
in my constituency what do I do
well if you do not like any of the
candidates which have been provided to
you or by the political parties at the
Evo machine look at the end your list of
candidates right at the end you have the
none of the above options earlier what
used to happen was if you didn't like
any of the candidates you have to go to
the presiding officer inform him that
you didn't like any of the candidates
right or not and that of course was to
ensure that transparency is maintained
that votes are not misused but not to do
none of that you just need to press the
nota button given of course in your EVM
which means itself and a number of
people are still confused what is the
need of nota well I'll give is you're
talking about the genesis of notable
needs really arose when the Supreme
Court directed as the Election
Commission to ensure that a noter option
is included but the Supreme Court said
five years ago when they gave this
ruling was that there is a need for
transparency look many candidates have
criminal records
many of them have written unaccounted
for assets why should I be forced to
vote for a criminal nita this is a right
has been given to us now or by the
Election Commission and let me give you
some figures as well in 2013 state polls
when they were simultaneous state polls
are in many states how many people
exercise not a 15 lakhs that is a
staggering number it shows that many
people are not satisfied by the option
which are given to us so it's been used
in the past elections as well it was
used in 2014 and then some skates
election is well absolutely young can we
speak of state election look at what
happened in Malta Pradesh in many
constituency's in Madhya Pradesh the
victory margin was actually lower than
the number of notable Benghazi in fact
more notables were cast than for
candidates of certain political parties
like the aam aadmi party and the
Samajwadi Party so this clearly shows
how many people are dissatisfied you
know with the candidates which have been
provided to them
of course the question which many are
asking is that why it should be really
forced to choose you know if a candidate
which have been given to us by our
political leaders why can we not choose
any of the above if we don't like them
and keeping that in mind or was when the
Supreme Court asked the Election
Commission to include this in the eve
use five years ago and what is impact it
has created in the last three or four
years an Oda option you know this is the
sad part on kids I'm still confused
whether it's practical or norden's so as
far as the impact is concerned it has
absolutely no impact okay this is really
the problem this is the problem that
Notah even though rightly intentioned is
almost toothless ever since it was in it
was introduced now what happens in Notah
let's say that the maximum votes cast in
a constituency are not Awards then what
happens does that mean that the parties
change the candidate doesn't mean
elections happen again absolutely not
from the remaining number of boats the
candidate who gets the maximum number of
votes wins so as far as Noda is
concerned it's symbolic but has
absolutely no impact on that okay I
think that's enough information for now
and well before we wind up I'd like to
give some suggestions which of
new sex we have been thinking and this
is exactly what I'm Karen Moore yes
that's what this is about
let's start this first suggestion we
feel and in fact this is already
happening in Maharashtra if the maximum
number of votes cast are nota in one
constituency then the elections are
recalled why should we be forced if we
don't like the candidate even exactly
exactly absolutely even if you press
nota then why should a candidate be
shoved down our throat a majority voter
a note about means people are not
satisfied not just that candidate
service seeds get majority number of
note of boats should not be given a
second chance by their parties and why
should it happen clearly people have
dissatisfied with them that's why they
didn't vote for any of them
not only that why don't politicize
candidates bodies candidates with
criminal you know records with these
shady records people don't want them
that's why they pressing nota
and finally we want that nota should be
extended to incorporate the right to
recall when someone is elected if we are
not satisfied with our leader then why
not have the right to recall or and why
not extend note about that is a
futuristic thought to begin with the
demand which we are making at new sex is
for nota to go beyond symbolism to have
some real match okay Meenakshi well I
think for our viewers this will be
enough information on nota from the
first video so I mean we are running a
campaign and election reforms sonoda was
the first part of it and we'll be
focusing on more other parts as well for

The Lok Sabha election 2019 will be held in seven phases from April 11 to ...,2019-03-12T14:36:01Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fnp1jbO2qVw/hqdefault.jpg,"hello and welcome you're watching us on
musics and news X YouTube I am Bishop
Gulati I have my colleague Devika with
me and we are about to tell you
something that we as Indians have
completely forgotten we always use the
figure 543 as the figure of the Lok
Sabha that's not the actual figure they
become reality it is 552 and there are
seven seats over there which have been
left vacant but provided in the
Constitution 4p okay absolutely reserved
and this is the time that we have we
revise that debate these are people who
are living in India but they have no
voice if we as Indians believe that the
whole of Jammu and Kashmir and the
entire map that it belongs to us then
why are those seats lying vacant why are
those seats like vacant and how do we
fill them is the big question the things
again we've forgotten is there are
36,000 families not 36,000 people 36,000
families of P okay refugees residing in
India as we speak there are six lakh
Kashmiri pundits who have been displaced
from Jammu and Kashmir forcibly removed
who all lost a voice and these people
can given the voice not only the seven
seats that are there in Lok Sabha but
the 24 seats in the Jammu and Kashmir
Assembly that's almost a third of the
assembly that is lying awakened for
those seats in P okay so the time has
come to fill them the question of course
is how do we fill them let's have a look
at the numbers on our screens over here
this is the number I've been telling you
about seven Lok Sabha seeds these are
available already constitutionally
provision nothing special needs to be
done to get these seats now filled in
terms of the Constitution actually
creating extra seats that part has
already been done so they Vika how do we
divide them up absolutely - up so like
you said seven seats available if we
were to just maybe apply some sort of
formula we say that why don't you give
two seats to nominated Kashmiri pundits
and give five seats to the P okay
refugees that's perhaps a logical way of
distributing the seven imagine for the
first time as per this formula you will
have Kashmiri pundits reflecting the
voice of their community in the Hall of
Parliament you will have P okay Rafi
imagine taking the oath to the
Constitution of India what kind of
message that will send out now just for
perspective for our viewers let's
explain this devika in a map explain
this we talked about sixties and
seventies explain this to us right so as
we know six seats in German Kashmir are
currently going to be going to polls for
the looks of by-elections and seven
seats we've told you are lying vacant in
pea okay let's have a look at the map
quickly the six seats of German Kashmir
currently are ba Ramona that's right
here Srinagar the Anan flower region the
German position Oh thump Oh Duda and the
duck so these are the six seats marked
in color that are currently going to
polls
however this gray area that you see
right here this P okay region these
seats are constitutionally available yet
they are lying vacant we can fill them
now let's have an examination they
recover what is required step by step
what is required to actually fill them
have a look absolutely so of course like
we've been saying the constitutionally
available however it's not going to be
that simple we will require
constitutional amendment to allow the
nominations as well as the special
elections of Kashmiri Pandits and the P
okay refugees after this constitutional
amendment there comes the issue of
political will that is of course the
second step right here that we are
talking about this constitutional
amendment will have to be ratified by
the gnk Assembly but the big question
here - of really is who really do you
think in a pause this right who can
oppose this particular step right here
why will anybody oppose this because
like we've been saying we believe that
the whole of J&K is ours and of course
if somebody is wanting to oppose this
for other than other than honest reasons
let us know let's find out which
political party does not want P okay
refugees in Kashmiri pundits either in
the diminishment assembly or in the
indian looks about that of course step
three after this right and of course
once it's been ratified then it becomes
a matter of the people going ahead and
really electing and selecting their
representatives getting the voice that
they deserve for all of those years and
last but not least this will of course
conclude with Kashmiri pundits and P
okay refugees actually getting
representation and take
the oath under the Indian hats imagine
the the sort of message that will send
out when you fill the 24 vacant seats in
the Des Moines kashmiri assembly and the
seven looks of our seats we just talked
to you about it's important that we have
this conversation because otherwise if
we don't change anything nothing will
change that's the only guarantee we've
put it out there our job is to get this

fleet of all the airlines operating in
that country
these have been banned from its airspace
this after of course the Ethiopian
Airlines crash that left all passengers
all 158 passengers on board that flight
dead just a couple of days ago close to
the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa my
colleague Manoj you joining us with more
on that story Meenakshi this is
something we are now witnessing
happening around the globe because you
know the Boeing 737 max has now been
involved in two major air crashes in
recent months first in Indonesia and now
in Ethiopia following which you have
several countries including China and
Australia taking this measure against
the Boeing 737 match the fleet being
grounded
however questions being raised about why
this is not being done in India yeah
that is a big question with everyone in
India is asking we also activity this
year it has not taken stringent actions
you know against the Boeing the 737 max
now as you were rightly mentioning there
about 10 countries in the world which
have already banned or rather bad Boeing
the 737 max from its airspace possible
latest now Australia earlier it was
China Singapore which had banned at the
Boeing 737 max or from the trade space
now we have a possible latest
information coming in that Australia has
also gone ahead and grounded the Boeing
or 737 max of course as there have been
two crashes and in both the cartridge
the fleet is impossible sir one being in
Ethiopia where there have been no
survivors and thence we speak about the
dvch so the big question everyone's
asking why is the DDCA
just asking a safety assessment of the
seven seas of an axial cop why can we
not like other countries so ban boiling
or seventy seven of them many fibre
clear especially a spice jet or which is
you know uses or these are Boeing 737
max please I
matter of fact several airlines in India
minashi worryingly for all of us have
many of these Boeing 737 max aircraft in
their fleets even though some of them
have issued statement saying that
they're currently not being used but
factors that we need stricter directives
to come from the duties here which
amusingly enough has issued an advisory
or a notification saying that only very
experienced pilots will be allowed to
fly these aircraft only goes with a
minimum of 1,000 hours of flying
experience but then there are many are
asking what has this got to do with
experience if the problem lies with the
aircraft itself then well the aircraft
needs to be simply withdrawn and
grounded that is the question now with
so many of what you are asking is
rightly mentioned or the only action
which DDCA has said one of course as far
as the pilots are concerned very senior
pilots with at least a thousand so are
the finest ceilings are the only one
which will be allowed to fly the 737 max
it considering that there have been true
or two extremely for a second
tragic accident which will happen sixth
sense and trees around the world have
gone ahead and banned the Boeing 737 max
of course including China and Singapore
so what is it that is stopping DDCA
from implementing the same norms so you
know as far as India is concerned and as
you rightly mentioned there are many
aircraft so many companies which of
course have the Boeing 737 max aircraft
and we've had you know something like a
spice it with an issue the statement
saying that it's a highly sophisticated
aircraft and you know at the match what
they'll do is implement life safety
norms is that enough of course that's a
question which many including some in
aviation and safety it's but absolutely
this is a question of the safety of
Indian passengers and surely more value
needs to be attached to Indian life
science very much Bonacci for getting us

what new can a brand do for itself to
make its products more desirable well
then you talk about smart phones what
can you think a better camera a better
battery life or faster processor and
nowadays as people like to game a large
and watch a lot of stuff on their mobile
phones do you want a larger screen a
good screen to body ratio so that's
exactly what we were taught about and
then they got the vivo way 15 pro well
how do you think accomplish this they
accomplished this by a very simple thing
they do this they get you a pop-up
camera over here the talking point about
this phone and that helps you get a
larger screen for you
[Music]
as far as the cameras are concerned the
vivo b15 Pro on the rare phatso 48
megapixel primary camera with a 1.8
aperture a second 8 megapixel camera
with a 2.2 aperture and a third 5
megapixel camera with a 2.4 aperture it
supports a thirty two megapixel camera
on the front for selfies with a 2.0
aperture with such great specs what more
you expect out of the phone you want
great photographs and that's exactly
what is living up to we create some
great pictures and we were very happy
with the results they were a shop they
were really bright and the pop-up selfie
camera proved itself well we enjoy
taking a lot of pictures in office of
people in and around and we found the
pictures to be very good they did not
pixelate at all and the brightness was
pretty decent a little thing that we
would peppered with low-light
photography it did not really live up to
its mark but it wasn't that bad either
[Music]
now the phone comes in six point three
nine inch touchscreen display and a
resolution of 1080 by twenty three forty
pixel and an aspect ratio of 19 by 5 is
2 9 v bovi 15 flow is fired by an
octa-core qualcomm snapdragon 675
processor it comes with a 6 GB of RAM
the vivo v15 12 runs on android 9.0 PI
and is powered by a 3700 mAh battery
the vivo V 15 Pro supports proprietary
fast charging the phone does feel
premium with it's very nice gradient
back which does look very mirror type
which is actually not mirror it is
glossy polycarbonate which has been used
in the middle of the frame which makes
it look the way it is it does look nice
and steady to hold certainly and give
you a premium feel and at this price it
is very very good
[Music]
vo b13 flow is a well-rounded cellphone
when we talk about designs features
camera it fares well in all departments
also the AMOLED display is pretty good
of the phone the camera has lived up to
its expectations and the possessor works
above teasing and of course the inch
screen fingerprint sensor works pretty
well and one thing that we have to give
to V Rho is the pub up camera you would
do consider that the camera being
popping up so many times
might get have an issue sooner or later
but that's not the case and that's
exactly what the company claims so
you're getting a lot of high-end
features on a major eight smartphone
with a b-bow v 14 pro

spokesperson the event is being
organized to discuss about the annual

we are broadcasting at this particular
bulletin our life on YouTube and news X
TV both a mushy saying and I haven't me
a Marshall Sinha who is who was the in
charge of the Internet forces but deputy
chiefs office and has been tackling this
entire aspect of operations and the
satellite images sir for over at for
decades 1 X 2 minutes we are going to
debunk the entire biggest Pakistan
information warfare propaganda the
satellite photos that claim the Jessie
Mohammed's
camp buildings are still there the world
first exclusive answers lie with fact
reality with fiction let's get started
imagine Sinha before we go to the
pictures I would like to tell avi was
exactly what we have gathered from our
sources in the from the Government of
India and the Air Force Headquarters Oh
says there were total five targets
before we go to the pictures and you
understand the satellite images the
pictures that have been already utilized
by the Western media and the Pakistani
government and media to spread their
lies the five targets were two men and
three secondary the first and the most
important target was the Jessie
Muhammad's training camp in Bala code
and after that the second main target
was the trainer's accommodation that was
adjacent to a mosque in Bala code and
the third target that again now we come
down to the secondary target list the
Marcus Jessie Mohammed base that was a
regional headquarter of Jessie Muhammad
in Bala code and the full target was
Massoud as a guest house which was again
adjacent to another mosque or madrasah
in Bala code and the fifth target was
smaller training ground the instructions
from Prime Minister Modi and associated
wiser to the Indian Air Force was clear
and direct one cause as much damage in
terms of killing people on ground the
terrorists that were being trained there
specifically terrorists of jihad as much
as you can and the second instruction
was ensure that no religious
comes in the line of fire no physical
damage is caused to the religious site
which are co-located just adjacent to
two out of five targets that were given
to the Indian Air Force at quarter and
and show no civilian casualty we'll try
and explain to you exactly in four
different segments let's get the first
picture on earth of the original
satellite photograph that have been
spread across mainstream media and
social media and last 48 hours Mr
Scecina help us understand why these
kind of satellite images of the same
site cannot ever reveal the extent of
damage on ground these satellite imagery
are not of the requisite resolution and
that can show small impact points that
are spiced 2,000 causes on the rooftop
it is a large area image with a smaller
resolution you require a resolution of
at least 30 centimeters or better to be
able to detect the pinholes which is
caused by a spice 2,000 entry into the
building okay
these images give you a general area
where you can see the building trees you
can see the ground I have in front of
the building you can see a road that has
been constructed freshly blacktop if you
see the earlier image before the strike
yeah which is you will find that this
road doesn't exist yeah you will find
that the ground is absolutely plain okay
the one on the right if you see the
ground is absolutely plain yes and there
is no road on the right edge of the
image yes and if you now move in you can
see the black strip which is a freshly
constructed Road startop Road yes
and you can also see the ground that has
been dug up this is almost 800 feet long
ground yeah and more than half length of
the ground has been dug up yes and you
can see undulations the way you see on a
graveyard in the graves yes you can also
see some vehicles which are ambulances
yes and
I believe that these ambulances were
probably to pick up the bodies of the
senior lot yes and the people who are
respected within this organization to
give them a decent burial but for the
rest of the people they have just done a
mass cremation and dug up the ground
there to keep this from normal
visibility so that nobody gets to know
what has happened so these are these are
signs I'm Asha Sina which basically
suggests that a lot has been done on
ground by the Pakistani authorities or
the JME in charge there to ensure that
everything possible can be covered and
I'm sure that media the international
media and the Pakistani media is not
taken to this particularly exact site
there is no ambiguity that Pakistan has
made all of hurts to seal this the
people staying in balla court on social
media have very categorically reported
that they have heard the bomb explosions
yeah between 3:30 4 o clock or whatever
was the local time there akin to it the
half an hour later than us yeah but when
they tried to go towards this camp yes
they were banned from moving forward by
the Pakistani army who had cordoned off
this area and entirety okay so nobody
was allowed to enter this area so
therefore there will be no eyewitnesses
to what is happening in this area yes
the fact is that Pakistan by choice has
taken its own media international media
and people from various embassies to
place of its own choice yes and said
that this is where the bombs have been
dropped yeah will anyone say that they
went here and they found no damage no
one has taken there nobody has been
taken there the younger brother of
Masood Azhar in a public meeting himself
has admitted he has used that word that
my marker is damaged yes and it has been
attacked yes so where is the ambiguity
the chief of the air staff has very
categorically said that the targets
assigned to Indian Air Force have been
targeted yes we have pinhole detection
of the spies 2000 entering into these
buildings that were earmarked to kill
the terrorists yes if you see a better
resolution picture which I have access
to I have seen it earlier you can see
burn marks on the outside of the
building because the flames have come
out a little bit and those
soot marks are there on those buildings
yes you know and before we go to the
spice mm the missile the very purpose of
fate the very reason why this was chosen
it's pretty evident that unless you have
a highest grade or military a satellite
that actually can have the resolution of
30 centimeters 30cm 30 centimeters you
cannot actually detect the physical
damage on ground but even in these
pictures which are accessed through the
normal commercial satellites we can
actually identify this a lot has been
done on ground there is a lot of
difference and this difference is in a
matter of just 48 hours the picture on
your bright side is off before the
strike the picture on the left side of
the screen is after the strike a lot has
changed on ground that basically
suggests the kind of work has been done
by the Pakistani authorities and the
gesture Mohammed the people there to
ensure that these kind of cover-up can
be done as as soon as possible I
remember of 48 hours after the strike
took place the local Pakistani media was
taken there but not to this particular
location probably that's the time it was
not taken the Pakistani government did
not take them right right at that time
not at the same day it took them for 24
hours because trust me there were a lot
of bodies there and this is based on the
satellite images that have been
submitted by the Indian Air Force to the
comment of India before we move to the
next segment add something you know when
we talk of this high resolution imagery
why is it that it is not so easily
available yes when you talk of satellite
imaging the verse the resolution the
bigger swath you have that is the width
of the area that a satellite covers on
ground yes that means if you are imaging
100 kilometer wide area yes you will get
an image where you can see general
terrain and things like that the better
the resolution this width keeps reducing
and because of this reduction in the
width you require repeated passes to be
able to capture it
yeah and that enhances the cost
phenomenally very very significantly
annexed
and that is why you can get such high
resolution imagery only through military
satellite which are primarily doing
military tasking or through commercial
at a very very high cost and that is why
what has been put in the general media
our resolutions of two or three meter
yes and that is where you cannot detect
this okay why why it can't be detected
the spice mm bomb in impact it's
something that we are going to figure
out in the next few sessions but before
we move to the next segment I would
inform of you was that what has been
submitted by the Indian Air Force in
terms of the proof to the Government of
India these are two sets of proofs that
have been submitted by the government by
the Indian Air Force of the Government
of India one the high-resolution
satellite images of confirmed precision
hit of four out of five targets this is
this has been informed to us by the top
sources in the ia headquarter and the
government the second set of proof that
has been submitted is the Indian a VAX
Embraer 145 the era's that was airborne
at that time when there a strike took
place their radar pictures of the
confirmed hit targets with precision so
these are the two sets of electronic and
visual proof that have been submitted to
the government of India by the Indian
Air Force now we are going to move to
the next segment of this particular
broadcast the madrasahs photos remember
I explained to you earlier for two out
of five targets were co-located with
medusa's and a couple of mosques and
that's reason why the physical damage
was not done to ensure that there is no
religious replication or any religious
angle given by Pakistan to this
particular strike the only purpose as a
marshal as in explain to us was to
eliminate terrorists and that's the
exact instruction that had come from
prime minister and necessary advisor to
Indian Air Force the mother's house
photo this is what was the reason why
the Indian Air Force in short that it
doesn't get destroyed the purpose the
choice of weapons spice 2000 is
something that we're going to splain
little late
but now we explain to you how these
structures could have been damaged if
Indian Air Force had chosen some other
weapon out the line of fire these these
structures could have come in line of
fire it certainly is not the aim of the
Indian Air Force emotional help us
understand you have a lot of these
terror training camps the trainer's
accommodation the guest house of Masood
as a co-located in this in these kind of
models and mosques you can't afford to
let these kind of targets and that's the
reason why the physical damage on ground
was not insured by the Indian Air Force
in terms of pictures and the post strike
impact see most of these terrorist camps
yeah they'll you're young boys and even
few girls on religious fundamentalism
okay and this entire thing revolves
around misleading them on religious
grounds and therefore all such
establishments are very closely
associated with religious sites and
places and therefore when you target
such places you have to be very very
careful that you do not do not damage a
religious institution
you only take on the perpetrators of
terrorism and the terrorists who are
residing there and therefore you have to
choose a weapon that can eliminate
maximum number of terrorists without
causing much damage to the structures
and the religious site that are there
and the the fight is against terrorism
not against a religion or a state the
civil population or the military okay
so that is why you have to be very
careful in choosing the right weapon
okay and based on what intelligence we
had of the structures and the
positioning of the terrorists and the
places that they sleep at night yes the
targets were chosen okay and that is why
the spice 2,000 was taken on so that it
can penetrate the buildings in which
people are sleeping at the timing when
they would be fast asleep and take them
on without any
lateral damage to any structure and
achieve our aim of eliminating maximum
number of terrorists which in my
estimation would be 350 plus okay so now
we'll move to the next segment and the
most important part there was a choice
of weapon there you see is the picture
exactly this is the picture imagina of
the exact 21st January 2014 when the
Indian Air Force had conducted the test
before the spies 2000 missiles were what
in the POE current range that basically
suggests how these kind of this
particular weapons by 2000 was chosen so
that it has minimum insertion point and
limited physical damage on ground see if
you see the boxed choir yeah that is the
structure that was it yeah and this is
how the weapon was tried before its
procurement okay and it shows a pinhole
yeah which if you go further left and
top that is a enlarged view of further
left and top the line go along the line
okay you will see this is the enlarged
view of that same image okay and you can
get this image only through a very
high-resolution satellite imagery and
even if I give this imagery to you and
me you will not be able to discern it
this has been discerned by image
interpreter okay and then it is
presented to us for us to be able to
read it like this okay and you can very
clearly make out this pin holes which
are 50 to 60 centimeters in diameter
okay and this is what the weapon was
tried tested and bought for and this is
what it has been used in bellacourt and
this is exactly the pin holes that have
been created over those five structures
that have been hit ladies and gentlemen
this is exactly this is the actual image
of the spy mm missile and that is
clearly an indication you can't figure
out see well I mean the normal civilians
can't figure out the difference between
the structure that was targeted by spice
mm and I again repeat this is the actual
image of the Indian Air Force test that
was conducted on spice mm in PO current
range and you can't differentiate
between the targeted structure and the
remaining structure that were not
targeted and it is difficult because
leave it to the military experts and the
military side
like to figure out these things everyone
who wants proof you can't have it
without the military satellites you
can't have these kind of technical and
specialist proof the proof I will
submitted by the Indian Air Force to the

RLD will be ...,2019-03-05T04:54:20Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-8gpeSrWB0Q/hqdefault.jpg,"welcome back starting this bulletin with
some breaking news coming in the first
conference about the other end
Vance Chaudhary will be held at 2 p.m.
in Lucknow today the rld will be
including BSP P Alliance our LD is all
set to get three seats in the SP BSP
Alliance the seats of course will be
that of Bach but Muzaffarnagar and
mathura the SP has already given our LD
their quota they are also to join the
mathura seat our LD has sought for Lok
Sabha seats the fourth seed prospect
will be held before the press conference
today
all right so our LD remember is all set
to get three seats as far as the BSP via
Lions in ups concerned my colleague
Martin is joining us on the broadcast 1
it's important press conference there
absolutely this is a really important
test conference today and you know this
will be an official announcement of our
LD joining hands with SP and bhp ahead
of nd 19 general elections and remember
as we have already you know several
times from acacia out of that he'll give
you know say the amount of seats to our
LD from his own quota so what we are
seeing is now at three feeds of Mathura
important seats of Mara Bach birth and
mother per Nagar will be given to you
know our LD so the talks are still on
for the four seats what we expecting is
that in in the two PM press conference
you know aphasia is a vengeance
Chaudhary will be announcing their
official you know joint venture for this
2019 general elections and there is a
possibility of announcement of the
fourth seat which might go with LD so
the respect nations are still on but we
have to still wait for an official
announcement made by both the leaders in
the 2 p.m. press conference and this
will be very crucial because you know LD
is having a good you know number of
votes here in the 20 in university
participation and we used the piece of
hair ana also in in full elections so
we expect that this alliance can do some
magic and there's a calculation going on
between the between a clash and
generosity and we have seen several
talks also held between both the leaders
and we have seen several times you know
Jen Chaudhary has come to Lucknow after
he had a meeting with each other in his
party office to pick some decision to be
made by today and that decision will be
you know forwarded to the media in the 2
p.m. press conference all right so just
to reiterate what if three seats are for
certain they're confirmed the fourth
seat remains uncertain whether rld is
going to get a fourth seat or not but
all the announcements of course will be
made at 2 p.m. in that crucial press
conference today yes absolutely and this
has to be made here in the to be a press
conference or only because you know the
several leaders III morning I'm trying
to get to work from several leaders of
our LD and Samajwadi Party to just get a
sense that what exactly is going to
happen in this 2 p.m. press conference
whether the four seat will be given to
our LT or not so the leaders also thing
just wait and watch and see what what
announcement will be made by the leaders
because what they are saying that for
this very you know announcement only the
two leaders are doing the press
conference and they want them to speak
more on this but what my sources are
telling me is that our LD you know was
continuously pushing for this both feet
in this 2019 elections and they are you
know very curious and optimistic that
the Sdn Bhd will consider this request
also change or the and will go for our
LT also in this particular line right
and but it's also important to point out
that our l DS influence in western you P
will also come in handy for SP BSP
Alliance oh yes absolutely
you know Jane Chaudhary or Espada II
think they are you know they have made a
ground in the western part of the
padishah they are you know about
connection with the farmers also so this
will definitely help this particular
lines because the farmers are really
cotton for you know BJP also and what we
what we know is that last time there was
a kind of wave of for motivates you can
see because of which each ApS got a good
number peace in every part of a super -
but this time it will be really crucial
for you know PDP also to you know gather
more cause to gather more you know to
galvanize the Carter also so they need
you know a good amounts of a good amount
of people also to walk on ground in the
West impossible to finish because you
know the RNG is having a good hold in
the western part like he's like backward
karana Muzaffarnagar and you know our
grammar so these are the important piece
where RL Jakarta will be helping you
know the SP and PHP alliances they will
be working and joining hands with the
cutter off for f3 and ESP to give more
poster and to take more vote for at this
particular lines all right when it

all right tributes being paid to the
Germans who were martyred the hon Vera
encounter yesterday the brave Jevons who
in fact lost in the Hun whare encounter
in German coming yesterday now being
given a feral alright tell my colleague
ER I do John you are joining us my
colleague
all right my colleague Irish Bilal with
us now Irish as a final goodbye is bid
to these Germans who were martyred in
yesterday's vara encounter tributes
being paid to them in Srinagar take us
through the details and in fact duty
personnel lost their lives in an
encounter which is still going on in
Handwara area for cocora to offer them
belong to the CRPF and to are from the
Germanisation release the two person
from the security a pardon from the
German national police they were hewn
guard of honour in Samara earlier and
their bodies have been dispatched to
their respective homes and now you can
see on those screens final two view to
being paid up to CRP everyone's one of
them is in - and there is another cost
you know they lost their lives in a
gunfight with the militants in a Nevada
area and awfully there the casualties on
the for suicide have been on the higher
side and though in this particular
encounter which which I said is still
going on there it was believed that the
militants have been utilized but
yesterday when the operation was almost
in its final stage one of the militants
heroes from the debris and the shower
blades on the security person in which
these these forces person was their
lives and right now the final tributes
being paid to these amounts after which
their bodies are going to be dispatched
to their respective half the entire
progress of the CRPF police and that the
representatives of the civilian
administration have assembled here in
Senegal to pay their floral troduce to
these Jevons right and erasure as you
were mentioning there the situation
continues to be tense in Handwara what
more can you tell us about that the
operation has now entered the 30 I told
you know it was on I think on Thursday
evening at about 9:00 p.m. when the
operation had started and yesterday the
reports came there to maintain seven new
tribes or today today the number of
casualties because of the security
personnel
to form this you have different two from
these two men krishna police lost their
lives and also clashes erupted in the
area in which monster berlin has lost
his life there also reported about one
dozen civilians they have been injured
in clashes in the area the operation is
still going on and is likely to continue
because these security forces are not
sure how many militants have been killed
there and before you know bring the area
for the civilian movement but they will
have to go for the mopping up and this
is you know going to take some more time
so the operation is still continuing all
right thanks very much for that irish
alright some breaking news now coming in
UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid has
ordered the extradition of alleged
bookies and G V Avila to Indian cricket
match fixing dating back to 2000 he's
accused in the cricket match fixing
scandal involving former South African
cricket captain Hansie Cronje this
scandal at first erupted in 2000 Senji
Avila has 14 days now - in fact appeal
against this order
my colleague Ashish joining us with more
at this point are sheesh a significant
order there but of course it means still
be a while before he can be brought back
to India
exactly now the UK Home Secretary Sajid
Javid
so ordered the extradition of the Indian
bookies and G's chebula
to India to face charges of a cricket
match fixing getting back to 2000
remember this is one case which I come
in landed because the involvement of the
former South African captain Hunter
hunter Cunha in 2000 but there's a
similar process that is applicable to
pajamaja
that will be given to us as if Chava the
Alice bookie Assange each others but now
after having signed this order but UK
home security sorry javi
he gets up 14 days from the date of
order to file an application to seek
leave to appeal against the order and
this is basically the Sessions Court
level if you compare in genetic terms
with the Indian judicial system and now
he gets the opportunity to appeal in the
higher code and then again a similar
decision will be followed to for him to
appeal in the Supreme Court in the UK
and that's reason why this level one has
been across as for the UK judiciary is
concerned but definitely a significant
and the major step can reveal a lot of
names and the entire match fixing mess
that was started in 2000 I came in the
land 819 years ago with the south of
chicken farmer Katherine tacones
involvement he may still being about
other Indian bookings or other didn't
knock players they fit all anyone was in
wall and that's reason why the CBI has
been seeking the traditional Sanjeev
chaga
and finally the step one has been a cost
with the signature of the UK Home
Secretary ordering the extradition of
Sanjeev Chopra to India alright we leave
it at that are she is thanks very much
for those details
after admitting that masood azhar was
indeed in Pakistan moccasins foreign
minister Sean moody she has made another
big admission in an interview to the BBC
a curry she accepted that his government
was in touch with the Jessie Mohammed
leadership curry she made the startling
admission after his product and asked
her why Pakistan has not acted against
the terror outfit despite the mountain
of undeniable evidence that exists
against Muhammad he went to the extent
of claiming that it is yet to be proven
that jesh was behind the pull Varma
terror attack that left 40 of our CRPF
German states despite the fact that the
jury Muhammad itself had claimed
responsibility for the attack despite
the video admission by jesh Pakistan
continues Posterous statements my
colleague Schwimmer joining us with more
submit first the Foreign Minister of
Pakistan tells CNN the gesture Mohammed
chief is too unwell to leave his house
next he tells the BBC that his
government is in touch with the
leadership of the JJ Muhammad but it is
yet to be established whether they are
involved in any terror activities now
one doesn't even know how to respond to
this because while it sounds like a joke
factors that this is beyond preposterous
because here's a terror outfit not only
taken full credit for the bill poleramma
terror attack but which the entire world
knows has been behind several terror
strike been carried out in India over
the last couple of decades and yet
Pakistan has the audacity to make a
statement like this
it is a joke coordinator for Pakistan
because and this is not the first time
when India is asking for for for Hamid

when India produced all those everything",True,en,234,0,1

hey good morning you're watching news X
with me Jessica burrata focus story were
tracking for you this morning
a day after holding note party meeting
of the successful internet for strikes
External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj
has reached China where she's attending
the Russia India China trilateral summit
so Raj is in Busan about 130 kilometers
from Shanghai for the Russia India China
ric trilateral meeting now she will hold
bilateral meetings with her Chinese and
Russian counterparts as well this even
as Pakistan intimated China of the
development of the past day and how
India entered its territory in attacted
China on the other hand has signed a
United Nations Security Council
statement condemning the strongest terms
the pol Varma attack in name
pakistan-based jaish-e-mohammad for the
heinous and cowardly suicide bombing
terrorism tops the list of the essential
threats that the world faces today we
are aware of the recent dastardly
terrorist attack on our security forces
in Kalama Jammu and Kashmir but
perpetrated by Jemima's a Pakistan based
and supported terrorist organization
prescribed by the United Nations and
other countries we lost more than 40
personnel from our Central Reserve
Police Force while several others are
injured such dastardly terrorist attacks
are a grim reminder for the need for all
the countries to show zero tolerance to
terrorism and take decisive actions
against it in the light of continual
diffusion of Pakistan technology and
activist terror groups on its territory
and based on credible information that
Keshe Mohammad was planning other
attacks in its various parts of India
the American had decided to take
pre-emptive action the largest and the
target was selected in order to avoid
civilian casualties
following the parameter elicited instead
of taking seriously the calls my
international community to it Elise
Jesse mama then other terror groups
based in Pakistan Pakistan denied any
knowledge of the effect and our
strategic affairs at Asha Singh joining
us live on the broadcast Ashish
extremely significant developments to
note that India is not just militarily
registered its protest retaliated in the
week of the pull vomer attack but at
that crucial trilateral that is
happening in China Sushma Swaraj pretty
unequivocally making her point there is
one that's right the attack has a
symbolic message sharp for the entire
world what is happening is you have
three of country's foreign ministers are
India Russia and China meeting in China
and you know that China is the best the
most supported a lion of Pakistan and
you have indication of a structure by
the incan airport in the inside of
Pakistan their territory
speaking about Pakistan and via
terrorism and that certainly suggests
the way indeed the government is going
with full wardeness and a loud message
to the entire world when there is not
any way apprehensive about people's our
strike strategy is really clear and this
is basically emerging from the fact that
the way we have seen diplomatic efforts
being made by the administration affairs
in the pre-strike time and the post side
time as well remember all the top on
words of major countries from p5 from
South from Europe in last week they all
had been talking about the way India has
retaliated
Australia has come in support France has
come and support and also the the US has
given a statement asking Pakistan to act
against federal quits on its soil and
Indian government has read both the
sides before the attack and after the
tire attacks
have been briefing all the on one so
that basically shows the clarity and the
boldness with which Indian government is
having this approach against Pakistan
and there's no qualms about informing
this to the entire world all right
Ashish take us you know through the
significance of this trilateral it is of
course a massive diplomatic offensive
the India's launched against Pakistan at
this trilateral but you know how
sensitive is this how how make or break
a deal is this diplomatically for India
given the proximity that Pakistan enjoys
with China not only a message to
Pakistan but also because to a China and
Pakistan must be extremely rattled the
way Indian Foreign Affairs Minister is
speaking against Pakistan on the Chinese
soil just 24 hours after the attacks
they must be watching it very closely
that how China is taking it and they
must be feeling extremely isolated that
China so anything utilised by India just
24 hours after box Pakistan
now this particular meeting the visit by
US response or at is basically a
trilateral meeting between China and the
Indian Foreign Affairs Minister and the
focus of this particular style at a
meeting is on the global situation
regional development and the business
aspects so terrorism has been one of the
highlighting points of this particular
the trilateral and we as we speak just
few minutes before they have been in
bilateral meeting between Sushma Swaraj
and the Chinese counterpart in Busan in
China and after that they'll be in
meeting between Sushma Swaraj and the
Russian foreign ministers of seven and
out Rome and the Chinese Foreign
Minister Wang Zhi that meeting has just
ended so in addition to the trilateral
there are going to be three bilaterals
one between Indian Russia India China
and China Russia all right very
interesting developments they're taking
place at that trilateral meat between
India China and Russia Ashish of course
breaking down the
who's meeting who what's on the agenda
India registering a significant point
there diplomatically cornering Pakistan
on Chinese saw something that is going
to send jitters across Pakistan needless
to say but our she's Leon with us
because the other important angle you
know of this story is of course the
United States now remember after
yesterday's attack the United States
assault India and Pakistan to exercise
restraint the US has asked Pakistan to
take meaningful action quote-unquote
against terrorists from its soil the
message a bit a bit late comes at a time
when India is on a diplomatic offensive
against Pakistan the United States too
has called out Pakistan to take decisive
action against terror emanating on its
soil remember it was just a few days ago
and President Donald Trump once again
justified his decision to cut or late to
Pakistan citing reasons that Islamabad
never helped the United States against
terror so this is you know Ashish once
again the reaction okay we're gonna try
and establish that line with our shishun
just a bit but this is of course a
reaction that is coming in from the
United States of America they have also
remember you know in their own we
launched a massive offensive against
China by cutting all aid to Islamabad
that was one of the decisions that was
taken by the Trump administration
clearly calling out Pakistan's in action
against terror that is emanating from
its own soil Ashish I believe is back
with us Ashish how are we looking at
this statement that is coming in from
the United States there are three major
takeaways from the particular statement
there that has come freely later from a
US secretary Pompeo one he has mentioned
that Pakistan must act in the meaningful
- Amanda must be taken for the terror
organization so that's operating from
its soil so that's basically a clear
message all those embedded in a seven
line statement we should buy a secretary
poncho but this is a highlighting in the
most operative part the second message
for Pakistan and the third statement is
about the escalation of military
domaine in future course of action
remember after India attracted Pakistan
in the Baloch or through airstrikes it
was it is expected now that Pakistan
will react in certain manner that's what
at least they have been claiming in
their Parliament and in their best
consensus by all the top initials of
Pakistani government but now since the
retaliation part is life life in the
domain of Pakistan the US government
asking what the countries to restrain
from yet militarily it is a clear
indication that they're asking the
Pakistanis to not escalate it further
remember last week there was a statement
from US President Donald Trump that they
are aware that India wants to do
something strong and very bad against
Pakistan at that time they did not issue
any such instructions or any such a
message that that I would say coming
from US president that the military
action should not be taken despite being
aware that India is gonna take some
strong military action against Pakistan
but now when you have Pakistan expected
to have some kind of court order
reaction to yesterday's fight the u.s.
asking about the countries not take
military interesting point that you
bring up one about restraint because you
know at a time when the ball pretty much
is in the code of Pakistan you know as
to how they choose to retaliate whether
they they acknowledge the fact that you
know terror camps on their soil have
been hit or whether they continue to
remain in denial because Pakistan at
this point are she shows who is speaking
in to voices you know on the one hand
they they claim that they reserve the
right to retaliate and on the other hand
very conveniently you know continue to
be in denial mode did any such attack
happened remember reports emanating from
that site suggested a couple of trees
fell and that's all that happens so then
what you know how does that in any way
call for retaliation to the United
States statement in a certain sense you
know assumes a lot of significance in
the light that they're basically you
know sending out a message
to Pakistan to reserve the right to
retaliate exactly but the other point
you mentioned educate has two layers one
when Pakistan is claiming that no such
major military action had been taken the
bombings were done in the mountains and
in the jungles yes what they are
objecting is to the airspace pollution
and that is something that they have
accepted on record that the Indian
fighter jets were in Pakistani airspace
for certain time the certain number of
Indian fighter jets so that's what they
are objecting although they are
completely in denial mode as far as the
counter-terror operation is concerned
they obviously cannot accept accepted
and expecting from Pakistan to accept
the Indian counted as a preemptive
strike on the gesture Mohammed and other
that their organization training camps
would be expecting too much from
Pakistan because they are never gonna
expect that they're not there but when
you have openly making brief statement
that there's no terrorism there's no
sterilization events on Pakistani soil
so they are not gonna accept it at all
so then it's a there are two layers of
it
what they are objecting to is Indian
passages objection after violating the
AC star nation and at the same time
claiming that there's not been a major
blow to Pakistan now that keeping in
mind when you have us at that political
time remember the timing is important
yes us is not a country that's gonna
sleep over question amid the development
at the international level between India
and Pakistan and issue a statement
thirty years after these strikes have
taken place I remember during surgical
strike just two to three hours after the
surgical sites were conducted the US
Secretary and the National Security
Advisor has called their Indian
counterpart this time they have
deliberately acted very very slow at the
time when Pakistan is trying to be bold
and have some kind of retaliation
towards India and that's why the timing
has been chosen by us to issue the
statement and they did not issue a
statement yesterday when actually the
strike took place so the timing is a is
a pretty important thing yeah to be a
lotus and
rate is indicating towards is pretty
clear us is basically asking Pakistan to
restrain yes and second but they're very
quickly before before we let you go you
know the European Union is reactive
China has reacted Frances reacted the US
has reacted Australia's reacted you know
there have been reactions that have come
in you know from across the world a you
know a responding to yesterday's attack
mostly of course you know asking and
urging both nations at this point to
show restraint but what's most crucial
at this juncture which is what is going
to be very keenly washed by the entire
world is the reaction coming in from
China what are we anticipating India to
do on the sidelines of the trilateral
what is what is going to be you know the
diplomatic point that India is going to
look to score today well this is a very
important point here remember out of all
the countries that later country that
have issued statement France has openly
back in their attempt to have
interpreted the counter-terror operation
anyone in u.s. statement the strike by
an air force has been termed the
counter-terrorist operation that
basically the clear message to Pakistan
after China is concerned I don't think
there's anything left now thirty hours
after the strike anything left for the
world to see about China they have not
reacted in the strongest manner against
India in fact as we speak we have our
External Affairs Minister having a
bilateral with the Chinese Foreign
Minister Wang Yi and that is a clear
message that China is not going to stand
first you of Pakistan in case India and
Pakistan clash what happened yesterday
it was not a war but it was a minor
conflict at that time as well we didn't
have China reacting or coming to rescue
of Pakistan all that that would be an
expecting today to happen between the
bilateral takes place between a Sushma
Swaraj and wonky is they might talk
little diplomatically but not do that
it's important the the China lends to
Pakistan and you know support in in in
all possible quarters the fact you know
the China to has just come out and he
showed a very
cautious statements saying that both
indian pakistan important countries you
know in south asia
a sound relationship in cooperation
between the two severes
the interests of both countries and
peace and stability is the reason it is
a very balanced statement asking once
again both countries to show restraint
this is going to be an extremely
important trilateral between India China
and and Russia of course so we're going
to continue to track all details and
developments that emerge from whose and
through the course of the depreciate you

phone line I urge our colors to just
stay on Lepik quickly get an award from
the Manchu Chaturvedi Manju howhow are
you looking at these developments CCI is
taking a call but as I've been speaking
on various unwelcome and let me fix all
so that it should not just be the BCCI
it should be the entire sports community
will not raise their arms for bisoder
the motel and we should ban them every
sport in any instruction in the sporting
field with Pakistan it's just not
cricket
I mean yes we religion not to watch
because Paula cricket but I think we
also have a lot of in the other games
we're doing so we should take a call and
see like the traders the entire country
should get together and specially the
minister who oneself is a body he should
announce a blanket ban of any kind of
activities whether coming or going to
Pakistan all participating or playing
the venue at a deal to Nationals all
right Himanshu Chaturvedi appreciate you
joining us with that perspective let me
go across to our callers have been
waiting on the phone line Navarone from
Bengaluru first go ahead
yes I think you know for now we don't
have much time for the World Cup it is
important for us to make a quick
decision because this will impact on the
practice and other preparations for
India is making and the second thing is
that if we cannot by court due to all
the detailed technical technicalities we
can have Rico where in variably could
have matches where we cannot face
Pakistan so that's my point of view for
now I'll try to preciate you one joining
us so with that perspective let me go
right back to him on to chatter wait you
still with us
you know how do you look at the idea and
the possibility of India seeking the
support of you know other countries in
moving for a ban on Pakistan you know is
that something which is a possibility
we've seen it happen there's precedence
to it when Africa was banned South
Africa was banned from from playing you
know in in the light of the appetite
loss so what really you know are the
possibilities how do you see the
scenario pan out I think the players
those who play international level are
mostly playing for professional reason
and that is for money and if I would
urge the I feel Council to ask both
countries that plays a part of the IPL
teams not to play the Pakistan all they
should ban players coming and playing in
IPL teams that should kind of and
standing sponsor and should come from
outside because what I will call for the
same we will do what government would
say I mean they're not taking McCallum
their own
I mean the IPL is the biggest money
charter for any kind of cricketer so we
should we should put a pressure on them
by telling that any player those were
coming or at least if not the country at
least those players should raise a voice
and say that we will not play against
Pakistan that would be a very very
tactical move if we can do that I'm sure
we can call me Pakistan
okay so you're seeing that in get in
technically needs to garner the support
of other players you know Frandsen you
see I feel we have so many things each
team has foreign players and there is a
lot of money from us in both players if
they say we will not be nice
analysis that that's an analysis that
carries a lot of weight I want you to
have to very stay on with us because you
know we'll also talk about what lobbying
with ICC means how are the scales tipped
when it comes to the ICC how does the
ICC work we've talked a little more
about that and I want to get in our next
call a lush man from Bengaluru go ahead
hello yes I'll go ahead sir it is a
pretty you know what our cricket stars
like searching none of them have come to
the studio and given their hoping him no
party Marty is no party they want some
heartfelt and they don't have any in
this thing see their become stars
because of this corporate no we have
been working there and we have been
there for shipping them and at these
people they don't have a simple heart to
condole whatever it is I don't think
it's about heart I think a lot of
players have come out condoned the
incident said that they would stand in
solidarity with our Jevons and that's
the whole reasons are that this issue
has in fact come to light so I don't
think it's fair to rest it's fair to
point fingers at this juncture it is of
course a country that stands in
solidarity with our Jevons unequivocally
doctor via jaws of magnitude also in the
phone line go ahead so thank you very
much I'm sorry surprised why this
half-hearted approach is there by Indian
government as well as BCC I know we know
Pakistan is affecting many countries and
three ticket plane countries in our
neighborhood India Bangladesh and
Afghanistan
all three are affected by the path
sponsor terror so why only approach the
ticket console for India I think we
should make little bit of coordination
between this among these three countries
and then strike ICF I see I want to be
second
certainly lot of parts have been going
on of late
why should India be so critical of
losing his testes because mind you
giving the World Cup ticket is a
prestige you
we have to place this inside and it will
original government is unable to come to
the ICJ for psychotic Pakistan just ease
up stick and it is not India vs.
Pakistan in India or Pakistan eg welcome
so let this be open I think this was
Musa against the streets at a stake BCC
is going to be consulting with the with
the minister step into fighting
terrorism
I guess - this could be LA there's no GU
terrorism in any country and from the
world cup of this legal law let them
realize their mistake she's a part of
all this I guess so it is very important
for taking this action in order to make
them realise that what is coming there
is the whole world standing against
terrorism right now right I think your
passions of actions is is extremely
pertinent banning Pakistan of boycotting
Pakistan may not have a direct
correlation you know with terrorism per
se but it is definitely sending out a
very strong message globally that India
will not engage with Pakistan as long as
it continues to sponsor terror on Indian
soil it also sends out a strong message
that India is a country entirely all all
different people from different walks of
life be treated as soldiers common men
they all stand in solidarity with our
Chavan so it sends out its ends are
pertinent message it also in
Venice's Pakistan on on a global world
stage so that's the other that's the
other thing that a boycott or a ban
would in fact achieve we have had a lot
of callers dialing in it's it's clearly
an extremely emotive issue cricket is a
religion and the pool Rama attacks have
also in a certain sense you know shaken
a lot of people a lot of people feel
very strongly for what happened our next
caller Praveen from a guru is also on
the phone and go ahead hello mama
actually you know we should boycott
Pakistan from another world cup itself
and you know India is you know has a
very good stand with ICC you know and we
can easily boycott them as far as you
know the endorsements and the money is
involved this is where you know I mean
India has a big sponsor so we have a big
say in ICC we should boycott Pakistan
not just from you know cricket from you
know Bollywood from music you know all
aspects we should stop sending relief
material when there is a earthquake in
Pakistan and we should stop giving them
helicopters as a rescue package when I
know they face earthquake and we should
boycott all goods from Pakistan we
should break all ties with them only
then they will learn the lesson and we
should also revisit the Indus Valley
Treaty so we should use you know the
water that source from India how is this
rather than giving it to Pakistan and
have face because all goods from
Pakistan we should break all ties with
them and only then they will learn the
lesson and we should also revisit the
Indus Valley Treaty
so we should use you know the water that
source from India ourselves rather than
giving it to Pakistan and have faced
terrorism no in this manner all right
there are several diplomatic options but
can you know humanitarian relief and
rescue be one of those is of course you
know that that that's that's a big
question that remains to be answered I
want to go back to him and you
Chaturvedi instead of just direct this
conversation back to the issue of
cricket Iman show how does the ICC work
and if India is to seek a ban on
Pakistan visibly a boycott how is it
going to
layout is typically at what one it is
made out of working in participating
companies continue those who play
cricket now the main point is that the
three countries play a mortal Australian
women yes we needed it in ITC by the
economy and the activities which we see
if the funnel leaves the biggest bundle
of this entire evening or financial game
which Isis evolved most of it comes out
of India if we start pressurizing ICP
now again I would like to say then I
will talk about the same shoe by coating
them with them sector because we share
the path also then in two of the World
Cups we had the teams by cutting and the
places where the masses happen of the
host company got the advantage of going
to one level but they were not worthy or
so I think the bigger campaign in there
should be is banning Pakistan not we
should have a campaign of I think that's
been established that of course India
should move for a for a ban on Pakistan
with the ICC instead of boycotting
Pakistan and giving them from oval
walkover in in the June 16 man I think
that's been established but I want to
understand from you you know you're
saying very interestingly that the host
nation please you know a very important
part how do you think you know England
would look at it I mean this is a World
Cup that's being hosted in England it is
you know Manchester which is going to be
hosting you know the June 16th match
which is currently in the realm of
question how do you think England is
going to respond I think I think we have
a few well-placed in the international
arena politically also what we should
see a living being on TV that lot of
countries have expended their support
and they have condemned the kind of
advocate because they're done so these
continue I think we can have England
coming and saying that we do not know
about time to play on our soil
unless the mountain bigger out of
this type of business address estate I
mean they are very tactical I mean the
host country can come up and say
something like this I understand the
sports and politics I should be
skeptical in in most of the aspects but
when it comes to this when you get
stablished and it's not just India the
the world which they see a lot of
Arabism Oliver's and most of it all of
us know that somewhere it's sharp
because you had one of we meant the rest
were killed by America this impossible
so you to spend stablish that Pakistan
tough for more television it is a hub of
this so why not these countries also
raise their arms within the US and say
that unless and until these people bend
them we will also not come there or
maybe if these countries those are not
showing Solarize disease with us or
maybe not supporting us we should start
even corner them at one point of place
or the second that we will not have
international equal with you diplomacy
and you know how how far can Indian
lobby with the ICC and how much
bargaining power does it really have
when it comes to the ICC that's the
other big question stay on without each
other maybe because we will talk a
little more about India's position at
the ICC but I want to bring in my

Directed by Anurag Singh, ...",2019-02-21T06:37:20Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qc3HXKzOeRw/hqdefault.jpg,"[Music]
hello guys i'm priyanka sharma you're
watching news X and today I'm joined by
Niharika Rastogi the big news in the
entertainment world today is that a much
awaited trailer of case 3 starring
Akshay Kumar and Parineeti Chopra has
finally released and before the trailer
launch itself the makers of the film had
been releases glimpses of Casely along
with intriguing posters of the film so I
personally think the trailer of Casely
is very impressive and it catches your
attention from the very beginning from
the first shot or itself so what do you
think about the trailer well I think the
trailer is capturing all the moments of
the Battle of Saturday in such a bit
askew manner that you have you feel that
what they that you have got a trip to a
history cm and it's such a beautiful way
to capture the whole Battle of Solomon
in the movie Akshay Kumar will be
playing the role of the 6th regiment
leader and you leave hiding at least
10,000 of consoles so the way the movie
is being featured and captured it just
feels so beautiful yeah the emotion of
bravery and courage has been shot so
beautifully and the emotions just make
you feel involved with the film from the
very minute go yeah you get goosebumps
while watching it and even though
Parineeti Chopra is in a very limited
role she captures your attention from
the first shot itself right like she's
Dresden DC attired and it's very
different from all the previous values

good evening you're watching nation at 9
with me buddy the way the as the nation
moans the sacrifice the supreme
sacrifice of our soldiers Modi
government has decided for a complete
change of tack to deal with a rogue
neighbor Pakistan instead of waiting for
Pakistan to act on terror after giving
proofs and dossiers India will now
instead name and shame the world's
biggest terror factory proofs will be
given to all except Pakistan remember
it's been 10 years since 26 11 and
countless dossiers about Pakistan
sponsored terrorism has been given have
been given to the country and no action
I repeat no action has been taken
till now by Pakistan even as a decade
has gone by since then after 26/11 there
was the Pathan quote attack that
happened again absolutely no action
taken by Pakistan now of course there
has been a complete change of strategy
and how big a success will the strategy
be is our big question on nation at 9 we
debate but first up the story so calm
after the rogue states rattled demand
yesterday our octopus co-axial
intelligence and the Pakistan in Boulder
warmer day now to guarantee Tom Yam
excellent sources now tell us that India
will not be sharing any evidence with
Pakistan India has made it clear that no
evidence is required as Jesse Muhammad
has already claimed the responsibility
for the dastardly pol Varma attack the
mastermind Masood Azhar is currently in
Pakistan living under the state's
patronage sources also tell us that in a
move to corner Pakistan India will be
preparing a dossier of evidence related
to the attack and will be sharing it
with other countries this comes at a
time when the entire world is coming
together to back India after the
dastardly attack on our forces in pull
Varma in a significant move diplomatic
adviser to French president Emmanuel
macron dialed NSA Ajit Doval to move a
resolution at the UNSC for enlisting
Masood Azhar as a global terrorist we
are in full solidarity with India and we
do believe that Masood Azhar should be
listed and we are working on that very
actively with us Israel UK among others
standing behind India in its fight
against terror the question remains with
Pakistan's all-weather friends China
will back India or be a roadblock in
this fight against the terror State
Bureau report music
are pissing representing the BJP with me
here in the studio Robin the such slave
who's an international affairs expert
general Sinha defense expert professor
Nalepa that eternal director of the
Sunday garden and mu nu carded political
commentator joining us on the Skype
connection from Pakistan good evening
gentlemen
I want to in fact take the first
question to RPC RP Singh you represent
the BJP let me ask you this there is a
complete change of tack that has
happened here till now every time there
was a park sponsor terror attack that
happened we would give dossiers in the
hope that all civilized countries like
all civilized countries Pakistan will
also act against these dossiers nothing
happened now there is a complete change
of tack naming and shaming everybody
will be provided a dossier except
Pakistan how hopeful are you that this
is the strategy that is going to work
against a rogue neighbor well we have
given them that dossier really also and
with all documents and evidence then
Pathan quote and yeah so but nothing
happened I mean they said they it
doesn't hold any ground in their system
now after what yashima mother's claim
and there have been two audio tapes
which are on record today on web being
done on various channels of other Masood
Azhar End and his brother now which
categorically state that it was all
planned in Pakistan by Pakistan and and
the gesture Mohammed was being used to
do so
so what other proof you need so we don't
need to give any evidence to Pakistan
today we need to shame Pakistan in front
of the world community and also all
those who support Pakistan to make them
realize that you can't continue
supporting Pakistan even if the Pakistan
is your client state when Pakistan can
be a plan said but you can't support
terrorism in Pakistan because of your
atomic benefits hmm okay professor
Malekith let me ask you this question
sir that Imran Khan yesterday in that
edited doctored video said give me proof
I am going to act these claims are so
hollow that nobody absolutely nobody
believes them
given Pakistan horrendous track record
is it time for India to change strategy
and now that it has are you confident
that this naming and shaming of Pakistan
is going to work
look gory let me point out that India
gave a huge amount of information to
Pakistan comprising of intercepts of
videos of telephone conversations I mean
but I would say a thousand five hundred
pages of documents to Pakistan about
Masood Azhar and the Pakistani simply
said no this is not enough give us more
first I think India gave about 200 pages
then it gave what 400 pages then it gave
thousand five hundred pages even if
India gives 1 million pages Pakistan
will say oh this is not enough give us
more Pakistan is not going to stop its
policy of denying that it is behind this
kind of terror
don't forget throughout the entire
Afghan operations in the 1980s
yes Pakistan always said we have nothing
to do with what's happening in
Afghanistan we have nothing at all to do
with this it said it right from the
start to the end so for heaven's sake I
mean if we are expecting Pakistan to do
anything about this I think we will be
living in a fool's paradise
oh absolutely Reena as we speak there's
more breaking news coming in and before
I get in another panelist let's quickly
tell our viewers that remember during
the day there was of course this lot of
confusion about whether or not India
would be forced to play Pakistan as you
know in those playoffs ahead of the
World Cup June 16 is when this match was
decided ICC came out with that statement
also though BCCI clarified none of that
is confirmed big big step taken from
BCCI's n we don't want to play Pakistan
because we wanted to ensure that
Pakistan is removed from the World Cup
that's the story we have viewers that's
flashing on the bottom of your screens
BCCI has demanded that Pakistan should
be removed from the World Cup because
that is how 10 of countries need to be
dealt with by civilized nations that is
the response that civilized nations need
to give to terror factories like
Pakistan you we are not going to have
any sporting ties with you you don't
deserve to be played anywhere in the
world
that is the treatment that should go up
and that's in fact the breaking news
that's coming in right now major news
you know let me come to you sir you know
time and time and again
have talked about how these tariff
factories exist on Pakistani soil we
have so much of proof as professional a
path has been saying all along no action
has been taken whatsoever
this is india's best bed reach out to
the friendly countries tell them this is
the dossier of pakistani involvement how
state patronage is given to people like
Maulana Masood Azhar and expect action I
think it's a good initial and move and
good initiative but tell me one thing
Gauri that isn't it a fact that world
should know and world knows the
character and DNA Pakistan isn't it a
fact that United State and the complete
other countries of the world know that
Osama bin Laden was Houston yes overt
aboard and behind army cantonment oh yes
and the Pakistan kept denying isn't it a
fact key Nawaz Sharif himself on 12th
May 2008 in his interview to Don
Pakistani newspaper he admitted that
yeah that 150 he asked army G yes please
tell us tell me how hundred fifty people
have been killed in Mumbai yes yes and
there the discomfort with Pakistan army
started and the the distance kept on
widening
so therefore the DNA of Pakistan
Pakistan is like that it is not going to
change so if you are giving talking of
evidence and you feel that Pakistan and
Iran Connie saying you know I will
highlight a very important thing he's
using the word actionable yeah
this is a typical RB language you need
opto-video sir look at the number of it
there are 2023 cuts did he cut in the
video it is a typical we use this word
typically in army actionable
intelligence and it tells us which can
be acted upon on which action is
possible so therefore the this goes to
prove that the entire script has been
cleared prompted by Pakistan Army and
ISI and he just like a total rating
everything so therefore it is not an air
Pakistan mokuba's says yeah India should
talk to
Imran Khan because he's a different
person damn it one a one can only talk
to actual Prime Minister
who can take decisions not even a puppet
so therefore Imran Khan is not capable
of taking a decision
can there be any change in the DNA for
Pakistan are we no no so therefore why
talk 11 packs have been signed between
in till since 47 between India and
Pakistan yes where are they
have they been implemented even one of
them unground no so why get into this
trap why allow Pakistan's space why give
him time breathing space why give him
space to you know plan his mischief
again abside has come
hey Gauri our parking lot I had this
time it should be do-or-die situation
and my feeling is that even if we suffer
certain losses let's go for war and
let's go for war and give a very very
strong message to Pakistan that you kill
our people result will be war absolutely
message needs to be given and you know
grobin to such they let me come to you
and then will get in a unique car there
as well that at the end of the day you
have countries now reaching out to India
and if India gives these voluminous
dossiers explaining its stance with
proper evidence details of what has been
the history as far as Park sponsored
terrorism is concerned obviously it will
ensure action given that you know we are
standing at a position where we've got
absolutely no action given 26/11 given
Pathan Kodo Sears now actually can be
expected world community will force
Pakistan absolutely I'll say two things
one general and one a specific
actionable point I would say rather I
would say one with regard to Indian
foreign policy one would assume that
such sharing of information with various
world capitals has been happening must
have been happening should have been
happening and if now we are going more
aggressive at it good now secondly how
can we make converted into actionable
items right now you're in Paris by
chance luckily for us right now the
Financial Action Task Force is meeting
yes to figure out whether Pakistan is in
compliance with its requirements
Pakistan is already on the gray list yes
now as per the current you know schedule
of this task force they're supposed to
have a next meeting in July and then a
final meeting in September or October to
finally decide whether Pakistan is in
comply
if not blacklist them now originally
what we should be acting upon is with
these 36 countries who make up the F ATF
and to international organizations let's
share these doses immediately with these
and ask them that right now in these
current meetings which are happening in
terrorist even if extend them and one or
two days decide whether Pakistan is in
compliance
otherwise blacklist Pakistan and every
black succeed in this within 10 days
Pakistan will be brought on its knees
it's all international banking will be
stopped
it could not be able to import or export
anything the billions of dollars which
the Saudi Crown Prince promised for the
investments in water port of cetera or
for even paying all the debts for
Pakistan reserves that money will not be
able to come into Pakistan Pakistan will
be on on the cliff right now it could be
done right now it could be done as early
as the next couple of days you need
carbon the world has seen through the
bluff that Pakistan stands for the
Pakistan piston stands for the Pakistani
Prime Minister is a living example of
the kind of bluff that Pakistan gives to
the world at the end of the day India
has now decided it doesn't want to talk
to you forget about any sporting ties
any cultural ties we don't even want to
give you evidence because we know you're
not even going to act on that evidence
it is the world that will ensure that
action is taken against you then you've
already made up your mind or so to bring
that about but if you resolve this
situation then you are going to you know
even today is it it would be you know
first century Pakistan got a long win
and saying was of the 1967 otherwise
unfortunately you know the kind of
process that you've suffered no nineport
in the mess office what I'm saying
business by not collaborating with the
only power you can have in the core of a
federal one literally occupy it are you
saying that we should partner with
Pakistan which is ensuring that
terrorism half
strictly limited no I can break down
those 21 billion dollars for you a lot
of it is actually deferred fueled
payments because you guys can't even
buyer imports that is a guy standing on
by our imports you don't have money to
buy three weeks of imports that is what
that is what your status is the fact is
only at that you can do is I in your
Singham that is also outdated you know
that is also not the era I don't think
what is DNA so you really need to update
yourselves of the way up like this aside
yesterday this t-shirt it is a dress
update your skills you need to treetop
ideology imperfect Moony brother
I think I think you should take a minute
you interest you in because I can see
the long loss a more drinks because
party span is controlled by a deep state
and that is Pakistan army
you know they have no logic they're
still part of the community of nations
that is our disappointing it is I mean
it doesn't hurt to know what their
arguments are so that the arguments
exposed as being felicity you know like
I mean hahahaha
I mean how silly in a sense the
arguments can be at the same time you
know being the Nationals of that state
everybody wants to you know work for the
interests of your own country they do
that but the point is that you know it's
so much known out there and he was
citing Donald Trump I think I heard him
right now saying that he went Donald
Trump is saying that they're studying
the reports fair enough America has
stopped aid to you sir
after picking through several changes
calling out Pakistan is no uncertain
voice is that you have not acted on
terror your tariffs havens continue to
exist that billions and billions of
dollars of US aid has been completely
titled or nothing has been done
it is sweet like Donald Trump had put up
Cory why has effect here put them in
there so clean wine girlist and you know
progressive alikum let me ask you this
you know that this man is going to
continue with the 17-year and
professional above let me ask you this
how realistic is what room into such
they've had suggested to ensure that
India puts Pakistan in the blacklist it
is in the grayness but there was also a
little bit of quid pro quo and creating
that happened as far as China is
concerned you know India bad China's
claim and which is why of course you
know that gray listing of happened of
Pakistan in the FA TF what can we do to
ensure that Pakistan is now blacklisted
in the next five days and gruesome
diplomacy if well you know gaudy one
thing we can do is to basically shame
any member of the f80 air right who
refuses to take action against Pakistan
exactly by by sharing the full
information that we have about what more
what Pakistan is doing frankly I mean
you know I think the Chinese are acting
against their own interest because they
are jeopardizing a very important market
currently it's a big market and the
futures have even bigger market and
frankly they are putting that in grave
danger by the blind trust that they have
in Pakistan so the reality of situation
is Goudy I feel it is clear that
Pakistan is going to keep terror attack
after terror attack my surprise is still
now we haven't got a contingency plan
yeah I would have expected a contingency
plan in which as soon as an attack like
Pulwama took place they'd been immediate
counter-attack by India I mean this kind
of a contingency plan should have been
planned years ago and I'm really
surprised it has not happened so far at
least now let us be prepared surface if
we are doing nothing in this attack I
don't know we couldn't do something at
least the next attack
let us immediately act and act in a way
that severely shows Pakistan this kind
of thing will not will not be allowed to
go unpunished absolutely I'd be saying
what's our contingency plan what's our
plan in
in a situation like this okay
the contingency plan can be only
military action it's just of the
diplomatic efforts which are being done
its consist of deep political effort
which have been made and as for military
action
leave it to army I mean I'm ahead dollar
pops up you are a such a seasoned person
it should be right here and it should be
done in such a fashion I go with you yet
Pakistan should remember it's one many
days to come many years to come so waits
for the time and then we at the free
hand is given to army to give a proper
retaliation on that okay yes mr. lorry
I left a hit thoughtfully mallanna to
call him tablet
don't call him mallanna hmm okay yes yes
Robin doughnut just two quick points
when I completely agree with what
professional about this saying he should
have had gaming scenarios of what
multiple scenarios can unfold whenever
such things happens and an immediate
response but coming back to the F ATF a
quick point you see the president of the
F ATF it's 36 member countries is a
one-year term and currently the
president is an American is the Treasury
Department's undersecretary his term
ends in July you know going to the next
president the current vice president is
a Chinese Chinese guy he's that of the
legal bank so he will be the president
of f8 here for the next one year of
beyond July 1 it's an India's interest
to right now quickly see if we can game
the system and as Professor developer
says we should may mention on name he
should actually shame or push me these
36 countries that guys you be with us
right now or otherwise remember we India
is also growing you know the power in a
way we have a long way to go with you
work with us on this matter right now
because after July if this guy becomes
president of course they can again game
the system delay bureaucratic procedures
and all which we all very well know so
right now it's an opportunity for us
that by chance the FA TF walls meeting
in Paris is meeting right now let's go
full blast and receive on it absolutely
I agree and in fact on that note I'm
going to slip into a very short break
and I want to come back and ask the big
question what do we do about China
one two six seven the application where
time and again India has asked for
Masood Azhar to be designated a UN
terrorist hasn't been happened because
of the you veto-wielding UN member which
is of course China solidly standing
behind Pakistan how and where are we
really going to find an answer to that
conundrum is a big question we're gonna
come back and a Pakistan the world has
now rallied and firmly behind India
Israel US UK France all are firmly
supporting India in fact France will
seek declaration of Masood Azhar as a UN
designated terrorist Pakistan stands
isolated and rattled how long will it
rely on its good friend China is the big
question because as we speak news coming
in after New Zealand Parliament it is
now the South African Parliament that
has passed a declaration in its
Parliament saying that it stands behind
India and condemns that dastardly attack
that's a big debate that we come back to
and in fact better goodbye we can't
defend is an obstacle now if I talk to
say that you have the guts to present
today
never would have sent them in yo
recommending me it is a matter of time
before you start speaking Mandarin or in
your life may be forced to learn
Mandarin sooner than you realize
so and animal let me ask this both wait
a point you have nothing to say I said
all right I'm going to ask some of the
other panelists and you know general
salon let me ask with you and then I'm
gonna go to the other panelists as well
as well as RP Singh representing the BJP
Cheryl Sinha we all know time and again
when you talk about that 1 to 6 and as 7
application 4 times is when China has
stalled it it's a veto-wielding member
of the UNSC it is not just one two six
seven whether it is the India's
application for NSG or any of the other
places it is China and China alone which
acts as an obstacle what should be
India's answer to three things Guri
firstly historically we did we committed
suicide when Niro did not accept us
suffer to become p5 member and we
instead we recommended China's number
ship that was a catastrophic first
absolutely so that is the first
catastrophe disastrous decision secondly
the problem is that there has to be
accountability and draw you know
responsible behavior on the part of p5
members if P for any P 5 member like
China supports terrorist and supports
Pakistan supports terrorism act
activities as and takes a very proactive
role in ensuring that people like Masood
Azhar are not blocked yes therefore
character of China comes into question
and therefore there are two three
options a let all members have General
Assembly be called and a proper voting
be done to ensure that China because of
its dubious role is removed from the
membership of p5 firstly secondly the
bylaws if the procedure is coming into
way the procedure bylaws and procedure
of United Nations should be modified and
changed thirdly instead of China we
should now lobby ourselves to get into
p5 and last but not the least one most
importantly that in any decision-making
there should be no key one hundred
percent all five p5 members have to
agree to observe certain decision no it
should be rule of majority if fourth say
yes that is yes and one one chap cannot
hold the entire world to ranch
one China cannot hold entire vault to
ransom so therefore these modifications
are required if we really want to stop
China from creating mischief and
nuisance in the entire world in future
and China has to be checkmated stop
absolutely how is the big question open
the state let me ask you your thoughts
on that Sansa said it's for a movement
application seeking the muscle does
there should be a UN designated
terrorist the point is we can all
anticipate almost that China will put a
spanner in the works again
well yes most probably we can anticipate
that though the possibility could be
anything but probability is that China
will you know block it yes so we leave
it at that will not get our hopes too
high though which would work very
adversely on that but a couple of points
one the UN system and the UNSC reform
are cetera doha so how much we wanted
that's not going to happen I mean this
we cannot see much reform happening in
the UN unless maybe someday India says
we walk out of the UN maybe but even
then we don't want to over over us so
let me let me didn't ask you the other
fact that you know if you talk about
walk out the UN I'll tell you I will
drop you there for a minute when it came
to the Taiwan issue China played on
brinksmanship they said if you recognize
Taiwan I am walking out of the UN yes I
lose the brinksmanship on which China
played what stops it never playing that
bring back yes ma'am that's what exactly
I'm kind of sinner to get out in the
realm of the possible that see this
world today especially after Trump's
presidency and the way the world is you
know moving on has become very much a
wheeling dealing world you make deals
let's make these this we take bring pass
you and give and take but I'll come to
another point on China itself those are
things which we should be doing and
playing see China you know every year
our economic deficit trade deficit with
them is about two two-and-a-half 2.4
percent of our GDP which is about sixty
five billion dollars which is about five
lakh crores so essentially every year
China is getting use that leverage we
should use that leverage we should
inform China guys look here you're
making so much money from us right now
you want to keep me in this money
actually most of the CPEC exactly
together and exactly shows annual gory
this money is funding CPAC this Hannie
funding your Miami maple deals its
funding Pakistan military so India
should say give a signal to China now
guys okay you're making so much money I
mean that's the language you want to be
using or the ugly way now if we want to
work with you
otherwise you see there are options and
I'm not talking trade tariffs I am NOT
saying that buy in China Chinese good
that's another story I am saying
non-tariff barriers what we can start
doing is Chinese goods which are coming
into India bring them into a port which
is overcrowded they get delayed for a
man yes add that Hindi language
documentation is a mast translated into
Hindi certified by our embassy or
consulate in Shanghai so give such
signals to China so that it arise that
it cannot keep making money from us yes
and funding CPEC that's one there are
other steps also but these are beginning
steps that we need professor helipad
respond to that first is the
brinksmanship issue that I talked about
can India not play that is India not in
a should not be flexing its muscle and
secondly the economic muscle is a time
for India to flex that as well
well curried the whole problem with
India is that you know the policymakers
in India are like hamlet they can't make
up their minds on anything for example
the Americans have been waiting four
years for that for all of the foundation
agreements to be signed the third
foundation we have signed to one more is
still pending we haven't signed it yet
the Americans have changed the
designation of their of their militaries
to the indo-pacific to give primacy to
India and to give primacy to to Hobart
to being dominant in the indo-pacific
that is the Pacific Ocean the Indian
Ocean India can't do it alone America
can't do it alone the two countries
together can do it yes so the point is
very simple in 1971 curry you remember
in the rigazzi very cleverly with the
help of be Peter signed an agreement
with the Soviet Union which enabled her
to go into Bangladesh and remove
Bangladesh from the clutches of Pakistan
yes frankly it's time now for us to sign
an agreement with the United States if
we do that it will give us the freedom
we need to act against Pakistan it will
give confidence to Afghanistan and may I
say Iran as well we don't agree with the
US policy on Iran we have friends of
Iran it will give confidence to
Afghanistan to stand with us so in my
view we need to take a very clear stand
we should not be Hamlet any longer we
need a strong defense deal with the
United States to confront Pakistan
absolutely okay RP Singh respond to that
of the NATO come sorry there are things
which can't be spelled on a TV channel
right now but we rest assured everything
has been calibrated into and everything
has been thought of and there so when
this new style of diplomacy when putting
Pakistan to shame worldwide instead of
giving the evidence new passes and
selling the evidence to work countries
worldwide so this is part of that new
style of diplomacy and then and then
just wait for some more time
some more time mean I mean not for years
and months just for few more weeks and
things unity since rapping as I was
China also so it's a process which is on
and then Government of India is very
aggressive on all this I tell you what
that you know when when the Dole clam
issue happened it was August 2017 and
there was a lot of clamor that it's time
to ban Chinese goods because no we're
out of pushover country nobody can come
and you know dictate terms to art and
there was a huge campaign and a clamor
for banning Chinese goods and we wanted
to make flex our economic muscle then as
well a year and a half is passed and we
are having the same debate all over
again
this is reckless the witness what
happened Oakland ultimately not
ultimately what happened in two o'clock
so issue is you don't need to at times
do things the way people try to push so
there are ways there are other
diplomatic norms and then the Prime
Minister Modi and so if mythology are
good enough to take care of that but I
am saying this time this time around the
things I've been dealt differently
we have heard step by step you will see
things changing and then putting
Pakistan to shame and also supporting
Pakistan there they will feel the heat
now okay all right so do you do you
think that you know what RP Singh is
saying that we will because of the grave
provocation not just stop at naming
shaming Pakistan ensuring retribution
but also take the step forward come to
the elephant in the room which is China
absolutely gory it's my personal
conviction and belief that wait for some
time you will find the bulldozers are
moving in right direction and Pakistan
will be crushed
i'm china will be taught a big lesson
China only believes in money where is
getting money from the best country is
India and therefore if be show frown and
we show arise China has to bend decline
is the example and let's twist China's
tell more let's twist China's tell
more and the people of I appeal to the
people of this country in just few days
back I complement the businessmen of Han
Jie fifty-five fifteen thousand crores
worth of supply order canceled yes so if
I will give you example ger if you just
give me 30 seconds
United States insisted on Japan
government to buy oranges from them they
were able to precise the government but
look at the national behavior and
national character of Japanese they
refused to buy it from the market yes
and second time no pressure was exerted
so therefore just grantee jal Shakti has
to decide the future of this country if
we really want to be a sovereign state
and the world biggest power absolutely
so therefore people of this country this
country have to play a proactive role
they have to discharge the
responsibility it is not good enough
only for the government to di it is not
good enough 24 Indian Army Ordnance
Forces to save the country it is on this
responsibility lies on the shoulders of
people of India to discharge their own
said yes because I sleep you want to
come in yeah I want to make two points
one of this China thing and the second
on the defense wheeler deals with the US
on the this thing you see US has a trade
deficit with China of about 1.9 percent
of its GDP and the US says it's a
national emergency for America that's
where the trade wars you know American
our trade deficit a 2.4 percent una 1.9
percent national emergency um we are
sleeping on it maybe yeah every year 5
lakh roads of our money is flowing into
China and going into wherever they're
sending to see takes and off this has
been happening it's an economic Dhokla
of India which has been happening yes
okay I'm not saying that now that said
so they have to be steps and messages
sent I'm not saying that banning of
Chinese goods and all we do need
investments and all but we got to figure
out some way and do some signaling with
China
what second coming to us and the point
of defense deal with Professor Alcazar
saying you know right now we had an
opportunity to have an opportunity of
the Saudi prince
the US has go to leverage with him right
now because of that journalist Khashoggi
murder case the US Senate is considering
sanctions on Saudi Arabia right his
image is messed up
yes we could make a deal with the you
you know Jared Kushner this best buddy
impress upon MBS to pressurise Imran
Khan it just get us Massoud other into
India yes in exchange the US will say
okay fine maybe I can pressurize the
Saudi prince but why would I do it for
you okay in exchange India says in the
next one year or two we have to buy
about 8090
fighter aircraft we will give you that
deal but on market standard terms what
we will bite from Lockheed or Boeing
whoever you say you get that business
deal work with Saudi MBS give-and-take
is what the foreign policy right now
it's an opportunity yes professor
neuropathy want to come in there well
I'd like to say that this resolution
against Masood Azhar who is an
identified global terrorist in the UN
Security Council is very important any
security council member who supports
asar will be supporting will be
supporting global terrorism and that
pull that power will have nowhere to
hide so I'm glad that France is now
presenting this resolution and it's
important for India to see who its
friends are and hoots enemies are and I
can assure you any country that is
supporting Masood Azhar will have to be
identified as an enemy of India
absolutely it has to be identified as an
enemy of India moon of garden at the end
of the day India is not gonna stop at
Pakistan this time around if you're
gonna come to China and when it comes to
our interest we will ensure that China
cannot at any point of time our interest
is as simple as that
you know how do you important factor
Jenna Sena you know you understand
defense preparedness very well explain
to me sir when a call is specifically
made to the National Security Adviser by
French counterparts saying that we are
willing to help we want that you know
there should be some sort of action
after this the friendship advisor has
extended that a to Ajit Doval where does
this take India from here on in also the
backdrop of the kind of help and
assistance that Israel wants to give us
you see look Gauri in army we are taught
about terminal objective the end
objective if you have to define in your
mind what is your end objective are you
achieving that it's very good we I
appreciate France the Francis gesture I
appreciate that but the question is we
are back to United UNSC yes we are back
to refi problem and and until as 100%
voting goes on a particular issue that
resistant doesn't go through yes
so on T unless you change this law
feel this procedure nothing's going to
happen
another thing I would like to say on
masood azhar itself last time China was
able to put it on technical hold yes for
lack of evidence
this time JM as expected yes I've done
it so where is that lacunae on a
deficiency in the evidence part it is
very clear the doer is saying out Danny
absolutely so therefore no technical
hold
so this technical whole issue should be
debated and objection should be raised
that you know there's no technical road
there's enough evidence and then our
China needs to overrule but until this
we have rule of majority UNSC this
problem is going to count the world at
large what do you what do you say to
this you know Oh many almost four see
how it's gonna pan out whether it's the
French application of whether it's the
Indian application and how China is
going to you know put a technique called
hold once again how should it Nia get
out of it how do we ensure the Chinese
see English aside as well and not just
their interest in their strategic
interest in in in Pakistan well you know
Cory I want to say that I hope India
will be invited to that UNSC meeting and
we will give a very clear presentation
as to what Masood Azhar is all about
there are thousands of pages of
documentation in India there are videos
there are photographs there are
intercepts there are all kinds of proof
against the gentleman and so far as any
country is a concern we who does not
acknowledge Masood Azhar as as a as a
terrorist well then the point is that
you know you have issues like Huawei the
United States has said ban Huawei India
is one of the biggest markets for Huawei
today and in the future now tomorrow if
China votes against India I think the
pressure on rp6 party is going to be
very very big to ban Huawei and to ban
the entire Chinese mobile phone industry
and I'll tell you what's a professor all
about since we are speaking on that
there have been many concerns raised
regarding you are in the past as well
I've been raised several red flags and
all those very legit concerns as some
may say may be back on the table to be
concern it is after all national
security concerns
no Tory yeah Gowri value you know if
they're backing Masood Azhar it is a
clear security problem it's a clear
security risk
yes then I don't think anybody will
doubt that hatsune Masood Azhar is a
test for China will China be on the side
of all the other countries in fighting
terror or just because Pakistan is
involved give it a pass if it gives it a
pass then I can tell you who away and
other Chinese mobile your units will be
a security threat to India absolutely
I'd be saying well India flex its muscle
will it tell the Chinese we are not a
pushover you don't see our side of the
story our side then we are sorry we will
make sure you learn and you understand
Indian side as well goring it is not
India alone is the countries worldwide
which will start
okay we seem to we seem to have lost
that connection with our fishing very
quickly I need to wrap it up by quickly
just make a point the point of huawei
you see other than the point of that is
going to signal on trade terms Huawei
really genuinely is not on your
ownership plus spying we're embedded in
their technologies the US has banded New
Zealand has banded Australia is banning
F so there must be something topics yeah
just quick quick closing comments and
then I want to wrap it up yeah Corey to
summit let me let me tell you this is a
do-or-die situation for our country if
we don't give a very very strong message
to Pakistan at this time this mischief
is going to be create you know duplicate
many times many of our sisters are going
to become video this situation is not
acceptable
I even V suffers slight loss Allah says
we should suffer and we should now go
going for war we should declare war on
Pakistan okay all right all right okay
gentlemen I have to wrap this up on that
note let's let's a quick thanks to all
my panelists on this edition of nation

I've arrested him in a hotel in Mumbai
and most probably they are on their way

help to India Israeli envoy to India has
said that Israel will give whatever help
in here needs to defend itself there is
no limit now that is a strong statement
coming in from Israel
it is absolutely crystal clear that
Pakistan is getting more and more
isolated internationally after the
United States had said that America
support India's rights to self-defense
now we have that strong statement coming
in from Israel now Israel in an
extremely strong condemnation of
Pakistan is the next statement coming
from the Israeli side they have said
that they are ready to offer
unconditional help to India salute
Rossby of course joining us live on that
big statement by Israel summit it is
extremely clear now that Pakistan has
been isolated in the world forum after
America said that the defendants right
to self-defense now we have Israel which
has offered unconditional help to in
Europe
well definitely this statement of
Israeli Khan why to Indian Indian side
will clearly not only desperate but
overt we'll take we'll take one further
step for in respect to the Pakistan also
because after hearing this a statement
from the Israeli convoy will definitely
the Prime Minister of Pakistan will it
will be in tension because Israelis one
of the Israelis one of the biggest
weapons supplied to India as far as
Israelis concerned and second moves for
India after Russia so this kind of
statement that Israeli will be where
will help India without any that
limitless will help to India will
definitely not only will create a
tension for Pakistan but also Indian it
will it will it will strengthen inside
that how the international community is
is in favor of in favor of Indian side
well absolutely I can also take us
through this strongly worded statement
which Israel has now given out and
Israel not only has given unconditional
support to India they've gone on to say
that whatever needs however help India
need to defend itself Israel will go the
next mile and there is no limit just
elaborate on that front a little bit
please
but the Indian is right the diplomatic
relationship started in 1992 in the and
that from that particular time to tell
now that that relation became so strong
that in every that India became this the
the the the biggest weapons supplier
biggest weapon buyer in Israel and I and
in India also India is this Israeli the
second weapons supplier for India after
Russia so these this military ties these
diplomatic rights are became of
strongest as coming days and Baba but as
Israeli clear clearly mentioning that
they will get give are limitless support
to India that clearly indicate they are
about the about the arms and weapons
because Israel is one of the finest
ammunition developers in whole world so
bear this is this will especially given
dia a good strength a good strand as far
as in in the in the international
community well absolutely and so much as
you speak about the international
community it is very clear isn't it at
the Pakistan is now getting completely
isolated earlier we had the United
States which clearly said that they
defend and they stand by India's right
to defend itself and now we have Israel
also which is coming forward and saying
that they are ready to go to any extent
and provide any help of which India
needs
well definitely not only us Israel Iran
also Iran also mentioned the same thing
that how the rest has been plotting
plotting terrorist attack on Iran and in
and they have been they have been
established in Pakistan soil so these
kind of support these kind of statements
from the international community
especially from the countries like us us
Israel will definitely definitely take a
take take Pakistan in that particular
danger danger zone and we can see
actually that particular hesitation
desperation and the fear on the on the
on the on the on the face of Imran Khan
when we heard him today that how he has
been giving all those statement in front
of Tamra and how he has been by playing
a victimized card that he has been
victim of of terrorism from last so many
years in his country so these kind of
statement will definitely we're
definitely make Indian Indian Indian
Indian as a country strong on the on the
fight against terrorism
well absolutely is rightly mentioned the
international community almost nearly

world stands United and stands behind

in Jammu and Kashmir this morning two
terrorists have been neutralized
including the mastermind of the Avanti
pura attack come Ron GM commander Kamran
plotted and orchestrated the Avanti for
attack in which 40 of our soldiers were
martyred moments after the encounter
locals descended on the encounter site
snow showed great restraint asking them
to disperse four of our soldiers
including an officer were martyred in
this encounter a civilian was also
killed in the crossfire
this casualty coming to stays after 40
CRP of Jevons lost their lives in a
suicide attack carried out by JM
operatives
parish pilar is joining us live on the
broadcast with more details are aja big
breakthrough for our security forces
days after that Pulwama terror strike
mr. mind neutralized today
well absolutely on tradition Muhammad
Carter's are on the top of the list of
the wanted
militants in javis question because this
is the group which awfully it has
inflicted heavy casualties on the
security forces the latest being the
lead for Kurama attack in which 40 CRPF
men lost their lives so after that the
security forces have been asked to go
after these girders and when the
security forces got a special input
about the presence of these militants in
implementing
they launched in the coordinate search
operations but in the initial exchange
of fire for armies Imams lost their
lives but the operation was carried on
till it till the elimination of the top
jesh commander Cam Ranh and I sigasi who
is said to be the mastermind behind the
February 14 attack on the CRPF convoy
with his elimination a setback has been
given to the JC Mohamed because he is
the guy who often it has been recruiting
a new route from the Kashmir Valley into
the Jima mercado's so along with him
another local Milton Hill on to has been
neutralized and from their position some
arms and ammunition too has been
recovered the house in which these
militants aware hold up that has been
razed to the ground and the bodies got
buried and the debris but it has now
been retrieved about this kota form and
the mopping up exercise is right now
going on because this is the SOP that is
to be followed by the forces who are
involved in such operation
well an Irish at the end of the day of
course it was a long encounters it was
an encounter that started out in the
middle of the night he kept for us what
really is taken place this morning at
the end of the day our Asia we also lost
forever Jevons for our officers were
martyred in that attack in their
encounter today
well the encumbrance started in England
our village of Palma district at about
3:00 in the morning when the security
forces what specific input about the
presence of two to three militants in
this village and the operation assumed
significance because the sources told
the the Indian sources told the security
agencies that the militants belong go to
the adjacent moment and the top hundred
commander comrade was also hiding there
any time these 40 forces laid a cordon
and in the initial exchange of fire the
casualties were suffered by the forces
side and for security personal for army
Jamar's from the 55 Raja rifles were
critically injured they were immediately
evacuated to the army of friends similar
but all of them succumbed to their
injuries one more was injured in this
subsequent exchange of fire and one
civilian has also you know lost his life
in the exchange of fire but after that
the operation to its logical conclusion
with the elimination of two militants of
the Jesse Mohammed one of them is said
to be the top commander comrade yes
Ghazi he is said to be from Pakistan
well as his accomplice is said to be a
local military and after the encounter
we believe Lucas has started gathering
in large numbers at that spot rh4 the
police exercised a lot of restraint the
security forces
urge them to disperse and and of course
discourage the gathering there but
exercise with the locals
well absolutely and this happens every
time there is an encounter in any part
of the selfish need and this has
happened once again we are told that
when the operation was going on and when
the news about the killing go for these
two militants spread in the area the
people coming out on the streets and
when the security forces try to stop
them they indulge into stone pelting on
the forces resulting in clashes between
the two sides but luckily no reports of
any casualties so far but yes the
overall situation in Finland and the
surrounding areas remains tense because
of the killing of these militants and
also the crash is going on there but as
a precautionary measure the authorities
had already suspended the internet
services in that area early in the
morning today because it was necessary
to keep a tab on the spread of the fake
news and also the rimmer morning by some
elements all right aarush Bilal stay
with us in fact we're getting more
reactions down this story coming in you
need to alter a strategy now we're very
busy with both on the line of control as
well as in turn and we've got to know
think through as to how to deal
effectively the IEDs like in the past
Allah says the border is concerned
you've got to make sure that there is
more infiltration success that is a
concern at all killing of the top
commanders is a big success to our
forces it has broken the backbone of the
Jessa Mahmud in Palama guru garment shop
en Ariel south Kashmir there are other
militants trained and equipped by
Pakistan who are local recruits who are
continuing to operate and I must say it
is the height of audacity that they have
they decided to strike in Pulwama again
they must be dealt with a heavy hand and
our forces must track down terrorists
without any compunction the Army is not
trying to wipe out all those who were
involved in the attack and this is one
of the continuing operations that will
take place over a few days to wipe out
all
terrorists Irish Malala still live with
our Suresh and we see now of course an
offensive by off a security
establishment obviously we need closure
now for the the victims of that terror
attack their families we need closure we
need justice and of course there is an
all-out offensive being planned against
Pakistan our age but also against terror
days the valley and this encounter today
was perhaps part of it well absolutely
and if you remember that the pure attack
took place not only the home of the
primes that's good our security forces
particularly there are two and then
choose their time and the place to take
a revenge for for those clings and the
soon after that the OT agencies who are
in order inter-country counterinsurgency
operations in Kashmir Valley they have
started to look for the inputs about the
presence of these Carters these
militants over in order in that attack
and this is one of the reasons that
early in the morning today this
operation was launched it in the Pingel
in a village and which these two
militants have been neutralized now and
both of them are from the JJ Muhammad
and one of them and when we are sharing
this news with our viewers there are
also reports coming in that security
forces have also laid a siege around a
village in show pianistic
which which is a sadistic adjacent to
the blow of artistic and these are
interconnected districts and the
military's very frequently causes things
from one place to another and when this
operation is still going on in the Provo
district another search operation has
been launched in the show P and this is
because the security forces also believe
that some militants could be hiding
there as well so yes the these security
forces are definitely going to go after
these militants particularly
after the recent attack because there is
only when one option left with them that
is go offensive and they have an
proactive approach to keep the militants
away from the security establishments
and stop them from carrying out such
dastardly attacks all that was done on
the 14th February alright Irish we'll
all believe it at that thanks indeed for
joining us with that live report moving
on now to some breaking news coming in
both India and Pakistan have reached the
ICJ in The Hague the proceedings on a
coal bush and Java are to begin shortly
this is the latest breaking news coming
in both the Indian and Pakistani
delegations have reached the ICJ in The
Hague the proceedings likely to begin
shortly remember core Bush and others
case will be heard today for consecutive
four days are shifting strategic affairs
editors joining us live on the broadcast
from The Hague in Netherlands are shisha
what's the latest you're tracking there
give us the latest live report we
believe the Indian and Pakistani
delegate have reached The Hague now and
the proceedings are likely to begin
shortly
well the process of the delegations
arriving here right here right behind me
is the Peace Palace the International
Court of Justice as began although the
full team has not arrived yet but we can
break this information to our viewers
with the documents that Pakistan has got
a much bigger delegation this time and I
would request my cameraman Ronald to
show the list of the Indian delegation
members there you see are the
representatives this is how the Indian
delegation is looking like so dr. Deepak
Mittal the joint secretary of the PI
division of the Ministry of External
Affairs he is heading the entire
delegation as agent from India then you
have mr. VD Sharma the additional a
secretary from Ministry of External
Affairs as Co agent there you have mr.
Harish Holloway as the counsel His
Excellency mr. Wei new Raj ammonium for
India to another lands you're mr. lute
Luther as the counselor the legal
counselor from the Indian Embassy as the
advisor at Nara The Advocate you have
miss out on the tea Kalka The Advocate a
junior counsel you have senthil Kumar
the legal officer from Ministry of
External Affairs mr. Sandeep Kumar
deputy secretary as wiser so there you
see the Indian team is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
member Indian team now let's have a look
at the Pakistani team I am told that
Pakistan has got a much bigger much
bigger team sure at the International
Court of Justice there you see this is
the submission that has been given from
the Pakistan side just look at the page
and you will realize that Pakistan has
got much bigger team here at the ICJ you
have mr. Anwar Mansoor Khan Attorney
General of Pakistan he's heading the
delegation and representing Pakistan as
agent then you have a doctor mr.
Mohammad presently director-general is
the co agent and then you have lot of
other pakistani members surprised to see
what are the couple of army men are
doing here the retired brigadier anthony
and you have colonel from retired
colonel as the legal experts are
surprising at the same time
very indicating of the fact that
Pakistani delegation consists of the
military men as well now look at
remember India had nine member
delegation let's count the Pakistani one
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
fifteen
so you you're gonna witness nine versus
15 member delegation legal battle here
right here at the International Court of
Justice it's up it's 12 past nine here
so in approximately a 50 minutes from
now we will witness the hearing begin
also I would like to inform our viewers
this this time you're gonna have a
sixteen judges bench that's one of the
biggest I've seen here at the ICJ let's
give our viewers a glimpse of how the
judges list looked like you're going to
have one Pakistani and one Indian judge
as well you have Judge Eva Sawa one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen
sixteen judge pandari is the Indian
judge and then you have one ad-hoc judge
ad-hoc justice jillani the former Chief
Justice of Pakistan as the ad-hoc judge
so you have one judge as a Indian judge
and since India has a judge a default
panel here you automatically get
Pakistan to a point one ad-hoc judge
which has been apologized so Jalan in
the former Chief Justice of Pakistan
Supreme Court these documents certainly
suggest that Pakistan has come prepared
has come really with a big team as I
mentioned you have 15 member Pakistani
delegation which include the military
men as well there is one retired
Brigadier there is one retired colonel
and from India side you have just see a
nine member team so certainly the Peace
Palace right here I would look as my
cameraman Ronald - just show our viewers
how does the peace palace look like and
this is going to be this building is
going to witness one of the biggest
battles between India and Pakistan right
here beginning in next 45 certainly
eagerly waiting to watch and report
about it remember
in 2017 when I was here this had
attracted the world's attention and as
we speak a lot of media has already gone
inside in the press room and this shows
us that the entire world is attracted
towards this particular case also just
to give our viewers a zeis talk about
the case to give our viewers a sense of
how the security has been kept here it's
pretty tight right at the entrance the
passports are being deposited without
accreditation beat the the normal
citizen who's registered and is coming
to sit in the gallery or the press or
the delegation member no one is being
allowed to enter this premises without
being a frisk properly so as I mentioned
this is going to be one of the closely
contested a legal battle that the world
has seen and United Nations legal
vertical the world code as it's called
is VD it's going to be the platform
where the final round so for hearing
will begin generally it takes
approximately a couple of months before
the final rounds of hearing end and
that's when we get the date from for the
the verdict from the International Court
of Justice remember it's only been a
couple of rounds of hearings on 8 May
2017 the Indian government approached
the ICJ on 18th May 2017 we saw the word
is the interim order coming out and then
in 2017 again we saw two rounds of
hearing in 2018 we witnessed two rounds
of hearing one Indian one from Pakistan
each and again here we are in 2019 when
I witnessed our two more rounds all for
hearing so today in just 45 minutes from
15 past 9 here Netherlands time around
10 o'clock is when the hearing would
begin so we are going to witness the
three-hour session from 10 o'clock the
local time that's going to be
approximately 2:30 p.m. india time for
three hours till 5:30 p.m. in their time
Indian government presenting its
ceremonial and after that tomorrow
the same time at the same duration will
be given to Pakistan where they will
present their country memorial again the
cycle will repeat
on 20th Feb the stray after tomorrow but
Indian government will get a couple of
hours in the afternoon and then a
similar time will be given to a Pakistan
on 21st row after two rounds of hearing
the International Court of Justice will
decide the verdict did this in case just
in case if either of the country
protester as far as the submissions are
from the other country is concerned then
in that case only we might witness
another round but so far going by the
way rounds of hearings have already
taken place the memorial the counterman
model from india and pakistan
respectively has resulted in the final
round of hearing between india and
pakistan on crew Bhushan giada case back
to you well yes you know our shisha but
clearly of course as you said the
hearing all set to begin today it will
go on for the next four days you were
telling us about how the Pakistani
delegation is actually bigger than India
is that a sign of worry I wonder does
Pakistan feel it has a weak case so
perhaps it's decided to send many more
individuals then of course the Indian
side but you know it's all of Pakistan
that's really on trial isn't a - eh
given the kind of national outrage and
the kind of global outrage we have seen
against Pakistan after avanti para this
trial becomes extremely significant
given the fact that this is Pakistan's
arbitrary yes this is Pakistan's once
again you know cheap tactics against
India on test
it certainly does further but let's I
mean I would inform our viewers that
it's gonna be the practical aspects of
legality here what happened in I went to
Pune in Ramah is not something that will
be witnessed I will kiss my cameraman
justice
Bhandari is coming here he's the Indian
judge from on the panel the Indian judge
disturb and re he will obviously not to
speak because the hearing is on but his
presence on the panel has led to the
Adhan judge appointment from Pakistan
this is but this is when daddy would
like to say something though he's not
gonna speak obviously as I mentioned
because he's part of the panel the
Indian judge entering the International
Court of Justice is certainly good yeah
key persons as far as the entire panel
is concerned as I mentioned the 16
member judge the 16 judge bench is going
to be one of the that the ICJ has
evidently c10 or a maximum up to a dozen
this I remember is not close to what we
are witness last time in 2017 in May
2017
they were just 12 of 10 or 12 member
judges but the peace palace here is
going to witness one of the biggest
legal battles coming back to a question
who the Paloma of the terror attack has
taken place for all the theoretical and
passion reasons yes is gonna be one of
the driving factors but let's be
practical here it's not gonna have a
director or legal implication on this
particular case I don't think Indian
government can go beyond mentioning
about Paloma attack a couple of lines
this can't form the basis of the entire
argument from the Indian government side
and that's the reason why we can't focus
much on Paloma but yes the as far as the
center of attention is concerned it has
attracted a lot of point of views and
the international attention now here at
the International Court of Justice but
if we one believes that that's going to
have a legal
and certainly not the case will be
focused just and just on the the
legality of the aspects and there you
have some of the members of the
Pakistani delegation arriving here as we
speak as I mentioned just 20 40 minutes
from now is when the hearing will begin
and you have the Pakistani delegation
already arriving here we will witness in
the next 10-15 minutes the Indian
delegation
arriving here but certainly this is
something that is going to have a lot of
impact they obviously have a bigger
delegation 15 member delegation
including the true retired army man I
would like to draw a viewers attention
once again towards the fact that
Pakistan has two retired military men
here I wonder what are they doing here
we who have brigaded Antony puffy tea
and then you have a retired colonel
Charles gurave what are these two
military retirement and as legal as
experts doing here this basically helps
us understand that they are going to
focus a lot on the retired in naval
aspect of coal Bhushan jawed oh I don't
see these kind of a delegation happening
very frequently here at the ICJ you
already have a lot of diplomats and the
legal advisors from the Pakistan side
but the two retired military men being
part of the Pakistani delegation is a
clear keener cut indication here for the
Indian government that the Pakistani
delegation is going to focus on the
arguments of the military aspect it's
just two more Pakistani delegations
members have started arriving here as I
mentioned there are 15 member legal team
certainly is going to take a lot of
drive-throughs as far as or bringing all
the members so we have seen the Indian
judge there the real Bhandari arrive at
the ICJ we are seeing now members of the
Pakistani delegation arrived as Tarshish
is responding our Ashish we have to slip
into a very quick break at this point
but continue to track these live
developments that will remain our big
focus through the day today are shifting
of course getting posts from The Hague
Netherlands the best coverage from on
ground there outside where the hearing
on coal bush and other
we'll be taking place will continue
through the day for now though stepping
into a very quick break

seven looks about tits and 24 Jammu and
Kashmir Assembly seats lying vacant it's
time to fill them with Kashmiri pundits
pukey refugees and PLT exhausts huge
debate sparked after news X takes up
four
while he would finally vans Pakistani
artists from performing an Indian film
in the wake of the Obama incident
[Music]
I don't work among with a Pratap Singh
you're watching news X our big focus
there are 36,000 P okay refugee families
in India and 6,000 Kashmiri Pandits
refugees while there are more than 4
million Kashmiri Zinn p oq' currently
live under the atrocities and
brutalities of park and its forces
moreover there are thousand others
staying in exile around the world over
30 seats live vacant collectively in the
Lok Sabha and the Jammu Kashmir assembly
4 P okay refugees and those in exile as
well as for Kashmiri pundits who were
true are torn out of their homes the
question then remains shouldn't disease
which already constitutional be feared
36,000 Pakistan Occupied Kashmir refugee
families are in India what we must do is
get them into the Jammu and Kashmir
assemblies 600,000 Kashmiri pundits are
in exile in their own country what we
can and must do is give them political
representation as many as four million
are residing in Pakistan Occupied
Kashmir India can send a big message by
nominating their exile
are you ready are joining us up with
tails on this story a Jay this is of
course a big debate that has been
stopped parked off after news except
taken up this course on why these weaken
seats for refugees and others from the
puke region are not filled immediately
we raised this issue data and we you
know spoke to the people those what that
really suffered and those who really
belongs to the PACU Pakistan Occupied
Kashmir and they are demanding things
last many years that they should be when
they do share and they should be but 50
should be filled now that may be their
input that the government is thinking of
filling that seed center snip they can
move ahead but the thing is that the
political parties of Jammu for taking
about this past week they are in support
of the thing that we should and with
this you should go ahead to a filthy
sheets because the people the number of
the people those have migrated from
Pakistan of Kashmir and living here in
Jammu and Kashmir is more than panic and
they are really they're ready the people
those who need to be you know given
their due then they should at least
select their representative for the
legislation absolutely and a Jay at the
end of the day because it's time perhaps
now to highlight this cause of Jammu and
Kashmir more and make it central to our
a focus at the end of the day P okay is
our you know it's perhaps it's time to
early claim to it you know by having
representatives from P okay who are in
exile were been forced to leave because
the atrocities committed by pocket in
that region into our into our Lok Sabha
into our Ramadan Sabha there well maybe
and if you see that how people are is in
this issue and how Pakistan are this
claim that they are being welfare
policies and other things for the purity
people but in a in a real there is
nothing and he for those of my from
top-2 Jammu and Kashmir that is more
than felt like people they basically by
little because they know that Pakistan
is harassing them and you going to be
here and even we have
people were those were married there
across the box none I call so line of
control in person occupied with me their
families their relatives over base is
that how much families are asking a
majesty with us we have social pundit
activist also joining us on the
broadcast social partners do you believe
that these seats which are vacant in the
Lok Sabha and the Vidhan Sabha then
Jammu and Kashmir which are for Refugees
which are for you know members of from
people from P okay region etc should be
filled at the end of the day it's time
to fill them up with Kashmiri pundits
it's time to perhaps fill them up with
other you know refugees from the P okay
region or Balochistan who have been
forced to flee from Pakistan I know just
a small aside don't call it Pakistan
Occupied Kashmir because not an inch of
Kashmir Valley is occupied by them what
they occupy is Jammu and Ladakh so it is
Pakistan Occupied Japan Ladakh J&L and
these seats are reserved for the
population of this region most of whom
are right now in Jammu as refugees from
Pakistan Occupied Territories of Jammu
and Ladakh so kindly fill them up
because Jammu Kashmir Assembly has done
a treachery in 2001 while entire country
has gone through the limitation egg roll
time they have postponed it by another
25 years and hence there is an intent
absolutely lopsided history of assembly
seats across regions so Valley has 46
seats
it doesn't deserve more than 40 Jammu
region where each constituency has
several times more voters has fewer
seats has only 37 feet so this lopsided
distribution can be neutralized by
filling up these vacant seats where the
representation is already available
a mechanism should be evolved maybe in
consultation with the Election
Commission and one man go and fill it up
so that a true representative character
of state could be reflected in the
assembly and the Parliament and using
that legislative strength
we must go forth and reform a completely
jihadi supporting legislative
constitutional and political structure
which has engendered this separatism
over the last 70 years absolutely mr.
pundit appreciate you joining that a
reaction there to this big story we also
have the poverty joining us live in the
broadcast with more details they
probably what can you share with us
right so I want to tell of you there are
thousands of people who are refugees and
exiles of the peoc a region who do not
find a voice in the political mainstream
now constitutionally there are seats
that have been left vacant for these
people seven looks of her seats are
available we say it is time to nominate
five P okay refugees or exiles to these
seats and to Kashmiri pundits in the
Jammu and Kashmir Assembly there are 24
seats that are symbolically left wakened
why not just nominate
20 of P okay exiles to these seats and
for Kashmiri pundits moreover there are
two seats that are women in the Jammu
and Kashmir Assembly now why not
nominate one Kashmiri Pandit woman
representative and another P okay
refugee or exile woman representative to
these seats and filled and all it
requires is a constitutional amendment
and strong political will all right and
the public appreciate you joining us
with those details and at the end of the
day RJ it is constitutionally available
these are seats which are
constitutionally mandated but they're
lying empty what's the point of them
lying empty that's the big question
isn't it
all right we seem to have lost our there
as well but this is of course the big
story that we are continuing to track
for you is it time to fill these seats
is of course the big question ok we are
to bring this out now to our viewers as
well our viewers who are watching this
broadcast can also call in with your
thoughts and opinions on this big story
our numbers flashing there on the bottom
of your screens colas tell us what you
feel on this big focus we are taking

story Mira our first viewer in fact is
joining us from Bangalore Meera go ahead

would really look forward to the pundits
from such meetings being included in in
our country they are not outsiders and I
feel very strongly about I have some
very very good hearted friends who have
been displaced from there and they need
to be represented and need to be focused
all right thank you
Meera joining us there with your view
from Bengaluru we have another viewer
now Jorge from Jammu Raj in the Rhine
economy and go ahead sir I am listening

our taqueria minimum is geometry undress
your mother call multiple be okay under
you Monique arranged
thank you all right Thank You Regina
right now joining us there from Jammu
with your view you're of course saying
it can stop from seats but much more is
needed to be done there is a need to
also give compensation there is a need
for more support for the Kashmiri
pundits and the people in living in this
region okay let me get in another viewer
now or a key joining us from Kashmir
Akhil go ahead yeah so what my opinion
is that I want to say is going to do
these things will it solve the problem
in Kashmir all right well that's a very
limited point that you're making there
akela thank you for joining us there
from Kashmir with your view at the end
of the day remember these are first
steps which also need to be taken and of
course follow-up steps are needed an
overall analysis of the situation of
course in m1 push meat is needed but
these are baby steps
at the end of the day remember these are
constitutionally mandated seats so it's
not that this will be something new that
you know this proposal will be mooted or
something like that but these are
constitutionally mandated seats which
obviously need to be filled and that's
why we're talking about this issue let
me get another viewer Premraj is joining
us from Kerala Prem go ahead but I think
those who from UK etc so those people
should vote those who are going to be
elected for LS Lok Sabha not somebody
like the government take them that's one
view you should identify who all are
those dislocation from those location
then they will elect those people seven
seats or whatever that's a good idea
not somebody really not somebody means
the government or maybe some other body
she's not appoint those that they can
see that's my view all right thank you
framed returning us there viewer from
Kerala in fact are now being joined on
the broadcast by mr. Rajeev Junie who
runs SOS H national and Organization for
P okay refugees mr. Cheney appreciate
you speaking with these X as the time
come for P okay refugees to be given a

us from Delhi Manish calling in money
squared
yes I am well I just wanted to make it
going here very brief and short well
Pakistan has Occupied Kashmir and we
have not given it to them right in fact
they have sold some of their focus on
Occupied Kashmir area to China and which
is called a side chain right so we we
should go
of community and we should pour them and
vgp she cannot play like light and you
know on this kind of issue we should
start doing it it's not that when gia
wants our attack plea then you have to
think about it we should always think
about it and we should do it every day
and that's how we are going to make it
so I think yeah this is a very good the
point that you have made it should have
been it should have come before and all
of all the Parliament throughout the
world should should be notified
regarding this and we should resolve
this including China China is you know a
kind of a hidden enemy and China is
playing smart and they want to Hindi
Jeanne bye bye and then they attacked us
we can't take this we we're not that
generation this generation has changed
and our attitude has changed we just
going to kill it if they mislead us yeah
an international community knows about
the Kashmiri is what they are going
through so III I think we it's going to
make a big difference we reach the
international community in a you know in
a way that you know a professional
professional anywhere to deal with them

okay fair enough thank you both nice
word thanks Andy for calling in there
with your view from Jammu onyx viewers
joining us from Jammu as well dr. Ganesh
Malhotra calling in dr. Ganesha also go
ahead
so my question is first of all I have
objection relating to the term P okay
okay hello yes sir
should I have objection from the town
which you are using P okay okay because
70% of the area is Jammu region why it
is not pure JK because she ok is the
separatist term it is showing the middie
mindset and it is showing the Pakistani
mindset why it is not pure JK okay
that's a fair enough point taken optimal
oh thank you for joining us I supposed
to shoot fun with also was saying that a
lot of the that region that Pakistan was
occupied was actually from Jammu and
Ladakh thank you for calling in let me
get in another view of major Samara
Johnny Gianna major so I'm gonna go
ahead policy of drift we keep blowing
hot blowing cold we don't have a
consistent policy governments come and
change the policies the state government
keeps changing the policies you know
this is this very serious problem which
means the very same position that the
jingoism is also not good there was no
reason for us to celebrate the strikes
which we did the surgical strikes
unnecessary because it all causes
irritation and it creates further
problems army should not be used as a
reason to all right Quantic point taken
sir thank you for joining us major samra
from Luciana then factor let's
understand what will be required for
this move let's play out for you a
detailed report on this issue there are
seven looks about seats and 24 assembly
seats in Jammu and Kashmir that are
constitutionally available and that are
currently lying vacant what India can do
is have a constitutional amendment that
allows all those Kashmiri pundits who
are living in exile and all those
Pakistan Occupied Kashmir refugee
families to specially nominate or have a
special election to these seats are
currently lying vacant next the
Kashmir Assembly will have to ratify
this constitutional amendment we can
actually keep a close watch on which
parties oppose this legislation as those
parties will then completely stand
exposed now a special body under the
election commission can monitor and set
up this entire procedure finally all
these Kashmiri pundits and POA refugee
families can then elect and select their
representatives and finally these
representatives who've been elected by
the families who are living in the
people and families were living in X
then taken oath under the Indian
Constitution all right we leave it at
that
on that note taking a very quick break
my thanks to our viewers for joining us
over the last time also thanks to mr.

India to explain why it's entitled to an
order from the ICJ which the ICJ is
never given in the past namely an order
for return of commanders of it to India
in the event that it's able to establish
he's entitled was entitled to consider
access we're looking forward to hearing
from mr. Salva and hopefully he will
explain how it is amongst many factors
that commander kulbhushan Jeddah was
able to obtain and use an authentic
Indian proverb in a false Muslim common

important question there are several
other questions and I'm looking forward

the ICJ well even if it is it's quality
not quantity that matches and so far as
our delegation is concerned there are
issues that India has raised concerning
the court system in Pakistan and two
very distinguished eminent independent
military law experts are here if mr.
Salvi wants to ask them questions he's

of Pakistan's military court system and
other related matters have been

submission to this Court this would be

I take this opportunity to once again
there is the issue of conduct of son
during the course of this case this
includes a breach of the letter and
spirit of the decision of the code and
the violation of confidentiality clause
and the article 53 paragraph 2 of the
rules of court that were brought out in
my letter to the court on 15 February

honorable mr. president and honorable
members and judges of this Court
I'm grateful for the privilege of
appearing in this court once again and
consider myself deeply honored at this
operation to present India's case before
you in this unfortunate matter relating
to the life of an innocent Indian this
case honorable mr. president and members
of the court arises out of an
application by India under Article 40
para graft one of the statute of the
court and r38 of the rules read along
with particle one of the optional
protocol concerning the compulsory
settlement of dispute at we are on 24th
April 1963 the basis for the application
on which India's pursuing the reliefs
which are articulated in its memorial is
an egregious violation of the Vienna
Convention on consular relations 1963
which I shall be referring to as the
Vienna Convention the case is simple
Shaun of the irrelevance is sought to be
injected there are two broad issues that
arise in this case the first issue
related
to the construction of the vienna
convention particularly article 36 of
the convention and its application to
the facts of the case on this the
admitted position being that consular
access was not granted if Pakistan's
strange defense of exclusion of such
cases is not accepted then it has to be
found
that Pakistan is an egregious breach of
the Vienna Convention
the second relevant issue then is the
relief to be granted in this case the
charge olfactory principle of
restitution in intagram is now the
settled basis for relief the only issue
is whether past precedents of this court
relating to a violation of the vision
which granted relief by way of review
and reconsideration have laid down law
an inflexible rule which has to be
followed in situations India says that
the court would have to decide whether
the rule can apply to military courts
like the Pakistan military court and we
do not rise to the standards of due
process can be the repository of faith
of the kind this court reposed in the
American criminal justice in Avena in
the grand finding itself bereft of any
substantive defense Pakistan has rose
raised a host of issues which do not
have any real relevance to these
proceedings on the issue of construction
Pakistan seeks to run one and only one
difference for diverse reasons it
suggests that despite the plain language
of article 36 it stands jettisoned when
the host state alleges that such and
national security its submissions run
counter even to the authorities it
chooses to cite Pakistan runs and
meritorious defenses under the chapeau
of abuse of process abuse of rights of
ex turkey causa it misses the law it
miss reads commentary's it relies on
material
is not recognized as having any
presidential value and finally having
propaganda against India as the feeble
attempt to counter global criticism of
its role in cross-border terrorism
Pakistan seeks to raise issues such as
India refusal to allow it to indulge in
a freewheeling inquiry into high
functionaries without even disclosing
the fundamental element offenses that
are to be investigated and of passports
that it allegedly has seized it is the
India's case that none of these issues
for dilution and decision by this in the
structure of my speech I will first
focus on the relevant issues the
relevant issues are the construct
construction of the Vienna Convention
the second is applying its language
conduct of Pakistan which leads us to
the step of deciding the appropriate
relief to be granted I will also make
submissions on the evolving
jurisprudence in this area of the law
and of the role of article 36 in the
rubric of due process
I will then deal with defenses run by
Pakistan
a problem with the microphones they have
got a large come on okay okay I will
resist the temptations are to engage
with the allegations being made as to
the passport issue and the legal
assistance issue beyond saying it would
really be for this court to decide in
the first instance whether part to what
extent Pakistan should be allowed to use
these hearings as a platform for
propaganda without establishing the
legal relevance of discontent
allegations Pakistan is obviously
embarrassed to disclose the judgment
given in the jar of case the specific
charges again prudence against him and
while the statement of the advisor on
foreign affairs to the prime minister's
office of Pakistan makes a slew of
allegations against John in relation to
the incidents that date back to 2014-15
the Pakistan story has always been
strong in rhetoric and blurring on facts
India therefore seeks relief by way of
declaring that the trial by the military
court in Pakistan in the fact certain
circumstances hopelessly fails to
satisfy even minimum standards of due
process and being violative of article
36 of the Vienna Convention it should be
done lawfully
Dada's continued custody without
consular access should be declared
unlawful and amongst other things
considering the trauma to which he has
been subjected for over three years it
would be in the interest of justice of
making human rights the reality to
direct his release India invokes the
jurisdiction of the court based on
article 36 paragraph 1 of the statute to
the court an article 1 of the optional
protocol India and Pakistan have
accepted the Vienna Convention and the
optional protocol without any
reservations and the hearing for the
request of provisional measure son
maintained that the jurisdiction of the
court is excluded by a number of
reservations in the party's declarations
under article 36 paragraph 2 of the
statute it does not pursue this in the
counter memoriam
the optional protocol read with article
36 paragraph 1 confers jurisdiction upon
court to remedy the violations of the
Vienna Convention one of the defenses
raised by Pakistan is that India's
failure to explore the remedy of
arbitration and conciliation under
article 2 an article 3 of the optional
protocol constitutes an abuse of process
India disagrees this court in the Tehran
case has held that article true and
article 3 are not preconditions for the
applicability of article 1 on the facts
of this case this defense is facially
farcical I shall first set out the facts
on which India claims relation has been
established and indicate the areas of
differences in their context Pakistan
asserts that an Indian national mr. Kaul
Bhushan sued each java was caught
arrested unquote on 3rd March 2016 this
is the publicly stated position taken by
Pakistan India claims that there is
evidence to suggest he was abducted and
found himself in the custody of Pakistan
security forces from at least the 3rd of
March 2016 a statement made by the
Honorable Minister for external affairs
in Parliament in India sets out India's
position in the matter and I shall refer
to with endocrinology for maintaining
simplicity in my narrative I shall use
the word arrest attempting the
lawfulness of his detention on 25th
March 2016 India was informed of this
so-called arrest when the foreign
secretary raised the matter with the
Indian High Commission in Islamabad
Pakistan issued ad Marsh indicate making
allegations of an illegal entry of our
aw officer and his alleged involvement
in subversive activities on that way in
25th March 2016
India sort consular access to Jadhav
Pakistan notified the p5 states of his
arrest very day and created a 12-page
document making allegations against
India it publicly add a video that
purported to be a recording of his
so-called confession by Jadhav some
significant tracks emerge from this
document produced by Pakistan
it states that security forces in Jadhav
it's a fair assumption that he has
continued since his detention in the
custody of Pakistan's security forces
the document doesn't indicate the date
of his apprehension it mentions first
week of March 2016 it states that the
agent has confessed Hancock it is
obvious that soon after his arrest and
in the custody of security forces the
confessionals extracting information
subsequently made available by Pakistan
establishes that a first information
report the acronym for which in Pakistan
is if I are under the Pakistan Code of
Criminal Procedure 1898 was registered
as late as 80 April 2016 and that under
the code marks the commenced and under
the code the FI ara marks the
commencement estivation into a crime but
the confession obtained on 25th March
2016 before the F IR was used as a
propaganda and it's paraphrase finds
place in the document circulated to the
p5 countries the document notes that
this gentleman has been operating as a
businessman in chahbahar with alleges
Java crossed over from Iran to
Balochistan and the document alleges
he's a commander in the Indian Navy he
concludes it concludes by making serious
allegations against India of
state-sponsored terrorism and of
repeating it efforts of 1971 in
Balochistan you will be surprised to
find despite all this towards the end of
their member
Memorial one of the defenses is that
India has not established his
nationality
there is no manner of doubt that
Pakistan was using this as a propaganda
tool Pakistan was bound to grant
consular access without delay
India's request for access did not evoke
any response in para nine of its
memorial India asserts that Pakistan's
conduct suggests that even Giada was not
informed of his right to consular access
and this is not contradicted in the
Contra memorial on 30th March 16 India
reminded Pakistan of its request for
consular access and received no reply to
its communication 13 reminders was sent
by India on various debts and I will
deal with them in my narrative Pakistan
acknowledges that as early as 30 March
2016 the Indian High Commission in
Islamabad sent a note were bulk to
Pakistan's Minister of Foreign Affairs
consular access Pakistan obviously had
no difficulty in recognizing that the
request related to the other India has
no papers or authentic information of
what happened in Pakistan the
information in public domain in relation
to Gerald's alleged arrest and trial was
first found in the statement of mr.
Sartaj Aziz made on 14th April 2017 the
public announcement by the advisor to
the Prime Minister sets out the steps
Jarrell's conviction in the award of a
death sentence assuming them to be
correct
my narrative will set out the course of
events which follow a to April 2016 as I
said an F IR was allegedly registered on
15 April 2016 Pakistan notified in voice
of the members of the Arab League and of
the Association of the South East Asian
nations the asean who were quote-unquote
briefed
after the registration of the FI our
data was supposedly interrogated on 2nd
May 2016 and again on 22nd May 20 India
sent a reminder the first reminder for
consular access on 6th May the second
reminder was sent on 10 June the third
reminder on 11th July proceedings appear
to have continued in the meanwhile in
Pakistan and on 12th July a jointed Cote
joint investigation team unquote was
allegedly constituted the steps taken by
the so called joint investigation team
including any further interrogation of
Java is not known the press statement
states that a quote confessional
statement unquote was recorded under
what is Section 164 of the Pakistan
Criminal Procedure in the meanwhile
India continued to remind Pakistan of
its request for consular access and sent
a fourth reminder on 26 July and a fifth
reminder on 22nd August 2016 on 6
September 2016 it appears that a
supplementary F IR was registered
purportedly basing itself on the alleged
confessional statement the supplementary
fi are named high functionaries in India
along with other persons connected to
smuggling syndicates on the allegation
that these were joggers caught handlers
organization person accomplices in
facilitators on 21st September 2016 it
appears that the first hearing of the
field general court-martial was held
from 24th September the summary of
evidence was recorded India sent
Pakistan a sixth reminder for consular
access on 3rd November 2016 even this
sieved no reply the next
filled general court-martial proceedings
appear to be have held on 29th of
November 2016 on 19th December 2016
India sent a 7th reminder to Pakistan
for consular access but there was again
no response on 2nd January 2017 the
advisor to the Prime Minister mr. Sartaj
Aziz wrote to the Secretary General of
the United Nations stating that the law
enforcement agencies had apprehended an
agent of Indian intelligence and that
Java had made a confessional statement
admitting his in one coat activities
aimed at destabilizing Pakistan uncock
it went on to add that the arrest of
kulbhushan Jada when his confessional
statement has vindicated
Pakistan's long-standing position that
India's involved in activities at
destabilizing Pakistan uncooked it
invites the United Nations and its
bodies to open court play the role in
restraining India from these activities
Hong Kong on 23rd January 17 Pakistan
sent a note were bar without seeking
assistance in what they called the
investigation of a case register try
ours 6 of 2016 of 8 April and 22 of 2016
of 6 September in police station CTD
Balochistan against Indian national the
letter of assistance that was attached
says stated that during the process of
investigation and interrogation gather
had revealed the name of a sow and it
sort India's assistance and obtaining
statements of high functionaries and
other named officials of the Indian
neighbors
surprisingly it also sought assistance
in obtaining the evidence of Jadhav wife
it's sort assistance in coercive steps
such as searching Gerald's house his
certified record of his cell last 10
years and certified copies of his bank
accounts in his and his family's name it
a trashed number of documents such as
the first formation reports etcetera
on 3rd February India by it's not verbal
reminded Pakistan for the 8th
time of its request to provide immediate
consular access it expressed concern
over the continued denial of consular
access and about Java treatment in
Pakistan custody we said especially
about his coerced purported confession
and the circumstances of his presence in
Pakistan which remain unexplained
it appears that the trial was concluded
on 12th February 2017 India Center nine
three man on 3rd march 2017 for consular
access on 21st March 2017 Pakistan
replied to the communication of 3rd
March stating that the case for consular
access to Indian National Coal Bhushan
Dada shall be considered in the light of
India sites response to Pakistan's
request for assistance in investigation
process dispensation of justice the
court would have noticed that the trial
already had concluded on 12 February
2017 on 31st March 2017 India replied
Pakistan's communication of 21st March
2017 pointing out that consular access
would be an essential principle to
verify the facts and understand the
circumstances of Java's presence in
Pakistan and for the 10 requested
immediate consular access a press
release was issued by the inter-services
public relations Pakistan on 10th April
21st that Jarrah had been tried by the F
GCM under the Pakistan Army Act and
awarded the death sentence and that on
that day the Chief of Army Staff had
confirmed the death sentence awarded to
him it stated that quote the accused was
provided with defending officer as the
legal provisions uncooked no lawyer
Pakistan by its 10th April 2017
responded to India's not verbal of 31st
March 2017 repeating that the case for
consular access shall be
considered in the light of India's
response to Pakistan's request for
assistance in the investigation process
which was spending with the Indian side
India responded by it's not verbal on
same date protesting that despite
repeated requests access had not been
permitted and pointed out that in any
event the offer of consular access after
his death said and what didn't confirmed
appeared possible a statement was made
in the Indian Parliament by the
Honorable External Affairs Minister on
11th April 2017 setting out the position
of the Government of India the statement
described him as a kidnapped Indian and
a victim of a plan that seeks to cast
aspersions on India to deflect
international attention from Pakistan's
well known record of sponsoring and
supporting terrorism on 14th April 2017
the adviser to Pakistan's prime minister
and foreign affairs mr. Sartaj Aziz
issued his press statement the
statements of significance to the
present case are as follows first he
said data caught his serving commander

he said he said Java confessed before a
magistrate and the court that he was
tasked by Indian Intelligence Agency our
a-w-two plan coordinate organized
espionage and sabotage activities aimed
at destabilizing and waging war against
path and surprisingly the court found
rather guilty as it has found many
others the espionage case against Jarrah
was tried by the F GCM and concluded
under the Pakistan Army Act and the
official secret Act his sentence for
espionage was endorsed on 10 April 2017
which as per this press statement were
taken to ensure Iran
Spruance were his confessional statement
was recorded before a magistrate under
164 of the CRP see this was of course
much after his first confession had
already been aired to the world a law
qualified officer was provided to defend
him throughout the court proceedings a
statement of witnesses was recorded
under oath in the presence of the
accused and in the court jadhav was
allowed to ask questions from the
witnesses during the trial a
fully-qualified
law officer of the Judge Advocate
General branch remained a part of the
court it went on to assert and something
which would be relevant for the final
relief that all political parties are
unanimous that the award of death
penalty awarded to a foreign spy is the
correct decision the whole nation is
solidly united against any threat to
Pakistan's security 14 table is in India
short consular access for the 14th time
and also start certified copies of
charge and the judgment of the military
court these have not ever been furnished
by Pakistan on 19th April keen the
government of India again requested the
government of pakistan for handing over
certified copies of the chargesheet
proceeding to the court of inquiry they
were requested to share the procedure
for appeal to the relevant court to
facilitate the appointment of a defense
law to facilitate the contact with the
High Commissioner High Commission of
India and Islamabad and to issue
appropriate visas to family members to
travel to Pakistan for the 13th time
Pakistan was again requested to provide
consular access
on 22 2017 a spokesperson for Pakistan
held a bell press briefing in which he
mentioned quote regarding consular
access we have said earlier also that we
have a bilateral agreement on consular
access and according to article 4 in all
such cases as the one of commander Col
Bhushan the request of the this nature
be decided on the basis of merits
uncle statement
by the spokesperson he's not reflected
in any of the communication sent by
Pakistan to India on 26th April 2017
India handed over an appeal and on
behalf of Java for being filed with the
concerned authorities in Pakistan on
27th April the Honorable minutes
External Affairs Minister of India wrote
to let adviser to the Prime Minister of
Pakistan requesting him for certified
copies of the charge sheets Proceedings
of the court of inquiry summary of
evidence the judgment section no reply
chief to this letter it wasn't these
circumstances I made its application on
8th to May making a request for
indication of proving trust on 18 May
this Court made the order indicating the
provisional measures on 19 June 17 India
responded to the request for assistance
in investigating he pointed out that not
only hadith have been denied consular
access but no credible credible evidence
had been provided by Pakistan to show
month yet and his purported confession
clearly appeared to be coerced the
details of the so-called trial being
made available Pakistan remind India
reminded Pakistan that it is the
government of Pakistan which has not
ratified the Sauk Convention on legal
assist Rahman Allah metals 2008 and had
not responded to initiatives in the past
to conclude bilateral mutual legal
assistance treaty India accordingly
returned the letter of 23rd January 2017
on 22nd June 17 a press release by
Pakistan Services Public Relation stated
the military appellate court had
rejected Gerald's appeal and Java had
made a mercy petition to the Chief of
Army Staff and if rejected he could
appeal to the Pakistan president for
clemency
yet another confessional video
purportedly made in April 17 was also
made public 30th August 17 Pakistan
responded to the communication of 19
June by which the request for mutual
legal assistance had been declined
being faced with no mutual legal
assistance strict resolution imposed
overriding obligations on member states
to afford one another
the grated measures of assistance in
connection with criminal investigations
India continues for consular access by
its letters of 20th September and 9th
October Pakistan's letter however
considers India's regrettable stance
quote-unquote in the International Court
of Justice which ignored what they say
repeated attempts by the government of
Pakistan to provide an opportunity for
the Government of India to give evidence
either exculpatory or in of commander
geography they fail to notice that
Pakistan's misadventure
in trying to publicly air the confession
and raise the issue relating to his
passport did not succeed in the court
the Pakistan letter requesting stated
that the request took the form that is
internationally recognized I will show
you why this is plainly wrong in due
course the letter stated that some of
the evidence underpinning the allegation
has been made available to India to be
clear Java is unlikely to have been
convicted and awarded the death sentence
merely because he had as alleged by
Pakistan a passport in a different name
which would hide his identity he was
presumably found guilty of serious
offenses which carried the death penalty
as a punishment Pakistan has steadfastly
refused to disclose which specific
events which specific offenses related
to which specific events in relation to
which Jadhav now stands convicted the
letter then ordered three states that it
was caught incumbent upon the Government
of India to explain uncor the passport
issue and it closed by saying open
saluted the Republic of India
compliance the request is provided again
uncle on 26th October 2017 Kant wrote to
India reiterating its stand which it had
taken in the communication of 30th
August but added and I caught without
prejudice to the proceedings so far
government of Pakistan is prepared to
consider any request for extradition
that the government of India may make in
the event that commander Java was
considered to be a criminal under the
law of India uncle
India responded to Pakistan's offer for
extradition it pointed out bites
communication of 11th December that
Pakistan's communications of 30th August
17 and 26th October 2017 were again yet
attempted propaganda and India was not
possessed of any material which would
give them to suspect the job of it
committed any crime for which he could
be tried in India Pakistan offered to
allow daga's family to visit him the
terms were agreed and the meeting was
held on 25th December 2017 India was
dismayed at the manner in which the
meeting was conducted and wrote a letter
on 27 December marking its protest at
the violation in the letter and spirit
of the understanding which had been
arrived at in relation to the meeting
Iran responded to India's communication
rights not verbal of 19 January 2018 on
the same date Pakistan responded to
India's communication of 27 December
contesting some of the allegations made
by India in relation to the meeting
India responded on 11th April 28 stands
communication of 19 January 2018
pointing out that the passport which had
allegedly recovered from the other was
characterized being fittingly false and
to investigate any such allegations
India would have to inquire into the
circumstances in which the passport to
recover having finished with the factual
narrative I now move sir to the first
issue of relevance the construction in a
conventional
article 36 of the vienna convention is
in language that admits of no ambiguity
paragraph 1b the 36 requires the
competent authority reinstate if
requested by the national ascending
state to inform the council of post of
the sending state that a national of
that state is arrest or committed to
prison or to custody pending trial or is
detained in any manner in addition to
this right conferred upon the arrested
national paragraph once he confers upon
the sending state the right to have its
consular officers visit national of the
sending state who is in prison custody
or detention to converse and correspond
with him and to arrange for his legal
representation
paragraph the treaty as places at it
were above net loss for it mandates that
rights to consular access shall be
recognized in conformity with the laws
and regulations of the receiving state
this is subject to the proviso that the
laws and regulations must enable full
effect to be given to the purposes for
which the rights under the article are
intending article 31 of the vienna
convention of the lawn treaties 1969
which i shall be referring to as the
vclt requires that the treaty be
interpreted in good faith in accordance
to the ordinary meaning to be given to
the treaty in the context and the light
of its object and purpose the expression
context is defined in article 31
paragraph two in relation to the vienna
convention it's in this case that it is
the text that would govern its
construction the first approach based on
little imprint interpretation of the
language is the objective approach as
against a subjective approach which
searches for the elusive intent of the
parties the teleological approach is a
wider perspective and emphasizes the
object and purpose of the treaty as a
black backdrop against which the treaty
should be construed these conflicting
principles the objective
Roche his subjective approach and the
object and purpose approach have been
codified in articles 31 to 33 of the
vclt I need labor this no more
because the construction of article 36
of the Vienna Convention is no longer
res in Tigre in the Letran case this
court construed article 36 and held and
I quote article 36 paragraph 1b spells
out the obligations of the receiving
state has towards the detained person
and the sending state the clarity of
these provisions viewed in their context
admits of no doubt it follows as has
been held on a number of occasions that
the court must apply these as they stand
in the 2004 Avena judgement this Court
held that the court would recall that it
has in any in any event essential to
have in mind the nature of the Vienna
Convention it lays down certain
standards to be observed by all state
parties with a view to the impeded
conduct of consular relations which as
the court observed in 1979 is so
important in present day international
law in promoting development of friendly
relations amongst Nations and and I have
taken the liberty of emphasizing this
ensuring protection assistance for
aliens
resident in the territories of other
states recognizing the duality of the
protection afforded by article 36 this
court in Para 40 of the Avena judgment
said that quote it would further observe
that the violations of the rights of the
individuals and article 36 may entail a
violation of the rights of the sending
state and that the violations of the
rights of the latter may entail a
violation of the rights of the
individual eric bjorgen his book the
evolutionary interpretation
of treaties sites Berman's community law
and international law which argues that
vclt and the rules when they were
adopted in 1969 and I quote slept away
at the same time all the supposed
special tenets of interpretation that
had enveloped the subject like cobwebs
and goes on to say one is today most
unlikely to see an international
tribunal repute deciding a disputed
point of interpretation by reference to
special styles of interpretation such as
a restrictive doctrine of interpretation
other supposed special doctrine thought
to be specially applicable to particular
types of cases the Jews of article 36 of
the Vienna Convention has evolved with
them of human rights and human rights
jurisprudence at various levels at the
international level the International
Covenant for non political rights the
ICCPR is a major milestone in the
articulation of principles that govern
basic civil and political ranking the
interpretation of article 36 of the
Vienna Convention must therefore be
informed by the contemporaneous state of
the law in relation to human rights and
in relation to the protection of the
rights of those accused of serious
crimes in the eye on Ryan arbitration
the tribunal interpreted article 31 para
3 C of the vclt as not requiring an
interpretation oblivious to all later
legal developments the tribunal went on
to note that and I quote there is a
general support amongst leading writers
today for evolutive interpretation of
treaties uncook it cites the ninth
edition of Oppenheim that court
notwithstanding the intertemporal rule
in some respects repetition of a
treaties provisions cannot be divorced
from developments in the law subsequent
to its adoption the concepts embodied in
a treaty may not be style but
evolutionary much of pakistan's
interpretation based on the overarching
arching right
of a sovereign nation to protect itself
against internal and external disruption
is a restatement ultimately of the
principle of serenity and is reminiscent
of the restrictive rule the travelin
iron
it's from free zone and SS Wimbledon
cases and extracts the latter from which
the following passage in which the
permanent court caution that it would
nonetheless and I quote feel obliged to
stop at the point where the so called
restrictive interpretation would be
contrary to the plain terms of the
article and would destroy what has
clearly been granted the iron drying
Tribunal goes on to hold that the
restrictive interpretation that has
particularly playing certain categories
of treaties such as for example human
rights treaties indeed some authors note
that the principle has not been relied
upon in recent jurisprudence of
international courts and tribunals and
that its contemporary relevance is in
fact doubt read article 36 does not
admit of any exceptions besides it would
erode significantly the reach of the
provisions if an exception is sought to
be made as sought by Pakistan article 36
requires consular access to be given
without delay upon arrest such access
has to be given before the case is
brought to trial at the state there
would merely be allegations of
wrongdoing which are under investigation
if at this stage on allegations levelled
by the host state it is relieved of the
obligation that article 36 and if
consular access is jettison it would
render article 36 a dead letter the more
serious allegations the greater the need
for ensuring that an accused has full
and meaningful right to defend himself
against charges brought against him to
exclude the operation of article 36 in
matters of serious charges of terrorism
that would fly in the face of criminal
jurisprudence there can be no doubt that
article 36 was engaged in the practice
an Indian was detained purportedly
arrested a confession extracted then he
was tried and convicted by a military
court awarded death sentence
and all along request solar access
rejected this quite plainly is an
egregious breach of article 36
Pakistan's fundamental approach where it
says that the Vienna Convention is not
engaged in such cases as erroneous for
it looks outside the treaty for state
practice to support consular access
which we say is an irrelevant exercise
it fails to engage with the cout
statement then the issue of espionage
was present to the minds of those who
negotiated the Vienna Convention and yet
no exception was made to the Vienna
Convention to deal with cases of
espionage India does not base its case
on customary international law or on
state practice but on the plain language
of article 36 Kirsten asserts that the
effect of the Cold War on the exercise
of codification of international law
cannot be overstated but again fails to
acknowledge that if despite this no
Express reservation was made in article
36 of the Vienna Convention for charges
of a spent espionage it establishes that
unsurprisingly states did not want a
vital safeguard recognized an article of
36 to be a hostage to allegations of
espionage made by the host state the
absence of such exceptions in the Vienna
Convention is unsurprising because the
fundamental principles of due process
recognized that the most serious the
charge the greater the need for
procedural safeguards besides there are
some basic rules that must prevail
between civilized nations and cannot be
displaced by unilevel by the receiving
x' recognizing that the needs of
security and efficacy of investigation
may require the receiving state to
withhold the notification of arrest by a
few days the draftsmen of the treaty
britain some play in the joints by using
the phrase open court without undue
delay
a state may be able to explain a few
days gap between the arrest and the
notification if time is spent Boone
Afridi in investigating matters relating
to espionage before the sending state of
the national is notified it is one thing
to explain the lapse of time between the
arrest and the notification to the home
state and quite another to suggest that
charges of espionage jettison article 36
Pakistan courts say author Watts QC in
his authoritative commentary explaining
the alcide draft convention in his
commentary so Watts explains the manner
in which the interest of a state in a
criminal investigation member with the
right to consular access in paragraph
six which is extracted he states and I
quote the expression without undue delay
used in paragraph one B allows for cases
where it is necessary to hold the person
incommunicado for a period for the
purposes of criminal investigation close
quote the commentry explains how
paragraph six six accommodates the need
of a state to converse conduct
investigations during which it may hold
the person in this would perhaps be
unnecessary if serious allegations of
espionage in terrorism would jettison
article 36 Pakistan draw the tension to
comments made by mr. Duncan the chairman
of the International Commission while he
was mentioning espionage cases he
suggested that it may be desirable that
local authority should not be obliged to
inform the council but the Chairman
remarked it if the Commission went into
the question with the cases of espionage
should be made an exception to the whole
principle of consular protection and
communication with nationals would have
to be reopened the extracts suggest that
the problems of espionage was very much
on the and yet no exception was made to
such allegations in the language to
article 36 Pakistan brings up the issue
of problems confront in implementing the
provisions of the Vienna Convention in
the context of pleas for asylum and in
situations of dual nationality both
these also establish that the Vienna
Convention is indeed the exhaustive
rubric of consular access it is
invariable
the provisions of the vienna convention
that provide the basis for resolving
situation finding solutions consistent
with the convention one of the matters
brought up by pakistan is an application
of article 36 to a person or dual
nationality which presents legal
challenges no doubt with us SWA generis
but they need not be explored in this
case Pakistan gives a series of example
which in its assertion are historic and
modern examples of espionage that states
often operated on the footing that they
were not entitled we're not going to be
able to gain access to the espionage
agents when they had been captured India
submits that the material relied upon
for what happened in those cases Kabul
for it is one thing in relevant detail
the plain language of a treaty if it is
contrary to the conduct of States cannot
be down by reference to state practice a
treaty in fact is set about at times to
bring about uniformity in state practice
so even assuming that the conduct of
States seeing a consistent conduct which
is sufficiently clear documented so as
to satisfy the rigorous standards of
what constitutes state practice it
cannot alter the played language of a
treaty the random example given by
Pakistan in any case do not assist the
court in coming to any such conclusion
of State on the contrary recent
instances of arrest by China and Russia
facts and public domain of per sessions
of espionage based on information in
public domain show that the conduct of
the receiving state was compliant with
article 36 these the court would find in
the judges folders at tab one and two
Pakistan in this misadventure does not
push it to the of suggesting that there
is an established practice to show that
consular access is invariably denied in
such cases individual incidents can then
add stablish that Pakistan may not be
the only state which has violated
article 36 of the Vienna Convention or
similar provisions and bilateral
treaties that preceded the Vienna
Convention there is no material place
that would establish that giving
consular access prior to extracting a
confession would have so imperiled its
national security of so hampered the
investigation that consular access was
denied there is no explanation for
giving consular access after that also
and now moves to a discrete issue the
2008 bilateral agreement in no official
communique to the Government of India
has Pakistan ever suggested that
consular access to Java was
circumscribed by the 2008 agreement
apart from a reference in a press
briefing by a spokesperson of Pakistan
gyum 28 April 2017 the bilateral
agreement of 2008 will never refer to
and rightly so the question of consular
access provided for article 36 is being
circumscribed on account of provisions
of a bilateral treaty does not arise
article 36 is the provision of a
multilateral treaty and bilateral
treaties covering the same subject
matter can be accommodated as long as
and I quote they are treaties confirming
or supplementing or extending or
amplifying the provisions of the Vienna
Convention this is the clear language of
article 73 of the Vienna Convention the
2008 agreement was entered into an act
code for furthering the objective of
humane treatment of Nationals of either
country arrested detained or imprisoned
in the other
country and by which the two signatory
states India and Pakistan agreed to
certain measures
these included the reves and
repatriation of persons within one month
of confirmation of their national status
and the completion of their sentences
the agreement recognized that in the
case of arrest detention of sentence
made on political or security grounds
each side may examine the case on its
own merits
and that in special cases which require
call for a required compassionate of
humanitarian considerations each side
may exercise discretion subject to its
laws and regulations to allow early
release and repatriation of persons
India does not seek any early release or
repatriation of data as contemplated by
the 2008 agreement the existence of a
bilateral agreement and some other but
one to the assertion of rights to
consular access under the article 36 of
the Vienna Convention this is also
consisted with article 41 of the vclt
which recognizes the principle that two
or more parties could modify the terms
of the treaty as long as the treaty
permits such modification or at least
does not prohibit such modification and
that any such modification cannot relate
to a provision the delegation of which
is incompatible with the effective
execution of the object and purpose of
the treaty as a whole the Vienna
Convention creates specific rights in
favor of those states and in favor of
national sending states in relation to
consular access creates corresponding
obligations upon receiving states that
they arrest detain or try and sentence
nationals of other member states in a
particular way bilateral treaties which
create obligations can only supplement
the provisions of the Vienna Convention
through treaties cannot modify these
rights and the corresponding obligations
which form the object and purpose of
article 36 there is nothing in the
language of the 2008 treaty which would
suggest that India or Pakistan ever
intended to derogate from article 36 of
the Vienna Convention but even if there
were such language it would yield
to the provisions of the Vienna
Convention considering that India and
Pakistan are neighbors both on land and
sea where people who live is frequently
strained to the other country and end up
in custody
it was sound necessary to have a
bilateral agreement that could on a
convention thus the matter is covered in
Paris subparagraphs one three four and
five will agree to and these are not
matters covered by the vienna convention
they supplement and extend the
provisions of the vienna convention
pakistan appears to rely on paragraphs
four and six
neither of them suggest that they
detract from the general provisions and
the overarching protection of article 36
the requirement that each government
shall provide consular access within
three months does not give an excuse to
delay consular access but even if it
does apply a supplementing or amplify at
the best it only fixes an outer limit of
three months in which consular access
must be provided it's not necessary to
decide the issue consular access has
never been provided even if paragraph
small roman for the 2008 agreement was
to apply pakistan should have provided a
substantial explanation for three months
of providing consular access and upon
which it could have claimed that it has
complied with treaty obligations even on
the erroneous premise that paragraph
four plans pakistan not complied with
the treaty obligation but was is that
case of reliance on paragraph six of the
bilateral agreement the phrase examine
the case on its merits makes apparent
that it applies to the agreement to
release and repatriate persons within
one month of the confirmation of the
national status and completion of the
sentences this indian pakistan reserved
the rights to examine on merits the
release and repatriation of persons upon
completion of the sentence where the
arrest detention of sentence was made on
college grants paragraph six
of the 2008 agreement also calls for
compassionate humanitarian
considerations in which each side may
exercise its discretion to allow early
release and repatriation of persons the

XmIHKvyzHr4,Pulwama Attack LIVE Updates: Salute to our martyrs,"Srinagar: In a major terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, at least 40 CRPF jawans were killed on Thursday afternoon. The attack ...",2019-02-16T07:43:27Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XmIHKvyzHr4/hqdefault.jpg,"vamos suicide attack where Jessie
Mohammed terrorist has rammed his car
into the CR why the preliminary report
has been set to the MHA as per this
report terrorists have entered the
highway from the link road through the
kakapo rally side and what we are
getting to know as of now is that this
SUV which rammed into the convoy of the
CRPF was laden with explosive explosive
lies the RDX urea ammonium nitrate and
it took over the corn wire from the left
side and rammed into the car and of
course we just had nothing remaining
offered Jevons but as the charring
debris of their vehicles further it is
being investigated whether the SUV which
rammed into the convoy or block the
vehicle did it detonate the vehicle
explosive after ramming or right before
that that is where the investigation
within Probst and as of now these are
some exclusive the details source base
information which Music's has managed to
get are as well uh my colleague of
course live from Srinagar on that big
story iris first of all tell us where do
the throw of an investigation stand as
of now we know that the NIU team is at
ground zero investigations of course
currently underway tell us only fact we
will be going across the two RS will all
extremely shortly on one hand of course
an oil party meet is currently underway
and on the other justice is a waited the
families India at the whole country is
waiting for justice and of course nie as
far as they are concerned they are
carrying on their investigations at
Ground Zero of course assume it is
they're joining us alive assume it's a
Grothman you've been getting us of
course all the exclusive details are
from the morning as far as
investigations in the nie is concerned
tell us sir where do the investigations
and Probst and as of now what has the ni
a found I believe as far as the material
or the explosive which was used to to
blow up that vehicle in the CRPF envoy
is concerned there is a breakthrough on
that front isn't it so myth well as the
all the investigations agencies was of
water in the show another have been
investigating initially and
but comes out what comes out from the
initial information they have the report
they have sent to the MHA it clearly
mentioned that they have used a mixture
of RDX and ammonium nitrate especially
they have managed all these all these
explosives from your RDX especially
around 20 to 30 kg of RDX has been used
explosion and but but NIJ has
investigated till now is that they have
used decocker pure Elaine to to rammed
into the into the corner PF and all the
reports have been sent to the Home
Ministry and after all these report the
hunt has been started a major hunt has
been started in the in the fourth
density forest area of Doral and Paul
vomit to to trace out to to trace out
the main culprit or a mastermind of this
attack that means the Ghazi back to you
right I should have been tell us a
little more about this person Ghazi who
you say is the mastermind of this attack
and currently of course information are
coming in that he's hiding in the forest
area enthrall what do we know about him
and has the pulley halves of the forces
zero to down on his location and a
massive hunt I believe it comes to nab
this particular person as we have been
told by these securities anybody our
sources they clearly mentioned the major
had had
last year in 2018 intelligences got an
input that gauzy has entered in belly
and he started mobilizing as youth he
started mobilizing and radicalizing the
youth for his around 70 to 80 youth have
been radicalized and they basically he
targeted the youth were in the age group
of 18 to 23 years and he Redick lies and
other Lasorda Lazar is also at the age
of 22 a 20 so he basically pinpoint all
those youth and started using these
youth for thee for the attack this month
the month of Fabri has been decided by
Jesse Mohammed as a as an a strike month
and that is the reason why they have
been spawning had they have been
targeted by Connor on the national
highway and most when we are talking
about Ghazi he is a specialized in IE d
his ID expert and he has a training he
has taken a training enough so all these
inputs have been happened have been
shared with the MHA also security forces
are hunting for him and as as we have
been told that very soon has been
brought he will be will be will be maybe
not it
yeah will be now then that would of
course we are all hoping for assume it
so much you know another thing could you
because there a couple of theories which
are emerging within a lone wolf attack
first of all were there other gunmen
presence with him and now of course
reports coming in exact sure it was just
one attack and it is not was not
followed by gun fighting from the side
of terrorists correct
well billachi the execute intelligence
agencies are working on the different
different information that was there
there they're still on oil they're still
finding on the fluid well filtering the
all the information which comes to UF
which comes to them initially all right
that information is being filtered
there's so much patellas about the
intelligence because there are many
reports emerging that there was some
sort of an intelligence failure as well
there were some facebook posts which had
been put up by jess itself were the Home
Ministry or the CRPF aware of it what is
the input signal could you give us some
more information as far as the
intelligence inputs are concerned before
in this particular attack
well the information now what say I will
but shared with the security agencies
intelligences have clear from last few
months have clearly mentioned that Ghazi
is planning a big attack but they have a
sense of information that they they're
that going to target the military
installation they don't have an idea
that they will be targeting the convoy
also and after the message after the
after the snowfall densely snowfall in
the Indian the areas so they have target
the convoys well both of the PHAB the
same that the such kind of convoy has
been moved from Jammu that that include
almost around 3,000 of Javan from this
yard I have sense of that information
and they target the Kanwar convoy after
all these Rickey's absolutely right and
also you know at this point they let's
go across you are just joining us from T
Nagar RS give us a sense of you know
what really is the situation in other
Valley as of now what do you know about
the proper which was being conducted
currently I believe ni officials of
course still present on the sports and
investigations are underway and a heavy
security cover of course was thrown in
and around the valley it is also on high
alert if I'm correct
well disco tea has been a put on record
following the recent terror attack in
Oklahoma and right now a big team of the
N is on the sport they are examining
this potent trying to cut out a plug as
what example on that particular day when
the when the suicide attacker targeted
the convoy of the CRPF in Lathrop Rama
as well and today as well they are there
on the spot trying to collect the
samples from the sport and trying to
restructure the entire about that there
was a purple plastic that there was a
proper plan and rocky conducted about DJ
some of the militants before carrying
out put a recce was conducted your plan
was in place this is what your sources
are telling you Irish
absolutely and since the suicide bomber
was himself a resident of the Palama so
he was well versed with the locals there
he was well versed with the movement of
other security forces through that area
and the preliminary investigation
suggested that he took the kakapo
religious force so these are the
preliminary findings that our sources
are in various security agencies are
telling us so apart from that the
security establishment all across the
Kashmir Valley Jammu region have been
put on mixed mamela and keeping up the
recent keeping in mind the recent
developments in the Jammu region there
has been a sharp reaction there have
been clashes in many parts of the Jammu
region so the curfew continues in Jammu
region and here in the Kashmir Valley
the security forces who are using
various highways to reach a different
destinations they have been asked to be
extra vigilant and be extra alert
well absolutely as far as your moves are
concerned we have been seeing a protest
for anti pakistan protest ever since
that horrific incident took place and
the value of course has been put on high
alert thank you assume it's an auditor
for bringing us all those updates of
course summit was also telling us that
this person of Google Raj's Ghazi he's a
GM terrorist and he has emerged as a
main conspirator in the attack his
location as we need to the forest of
bull Rama and our hunt is on to nab this
a person of course as far as the probe
and investigations are concerned we are
giving latest details in our studio of
course we have officially shot
representing the BJP we have a mid
general Rajan culture and also a
methanol thank you gentlemen for joining
us on music I'd like to start across
with Emma's first MSM and since you are
an expert in Kashmir and you I'm sure
you know this more than me RDX one in
the valley from correct we haven't seen
RDX being used in such a large quantity
in almost a decade once a secondly
suicide attacks a lone suicide attack
happening in the valley if I remember
was maybe 2001 force at this type of
modus operandi the size of the new
strategy which is being followed by the
militants
in the states now should its end now
alarm bells ringing for a security
forces now of course we know that
nothing has said that TRO and a convoy
of the CRPF of forces is passing
civilian cars will not be allowed but do
you feel that now the security forces
also maybe need to change the way they
tackle with militancy within the stage
and of Pakistan is one thing saying that
we give a free and dirty security forces
and one really implemented and following
what security forces are asking you to
do ah in Kashmir the heavy many lapses
or if you look at the figures were we
have been talking about we said last
year that there are 285 287 terrorists
in Kashmir we have almost a limited to
70 are we saying that only 17 is
creating so much of effect so there has
been new recruitment which has
constantly happening and replacing that
depleting numbers and we have not been
able to stop that we had not been able
to seal that I was hoping that yesterday
after the attack we will seal those four
districts we will do house-to-house
coming to identify the man and pull him
out Kashmir is not a big area going on
and I believe that by the time inspired
by this person
mr. this person Ghazi is hiding in the
forest but then Ghazi would be out you
are which is contiguous mountains when
three in two days you are in Pakistan in
two days you are in a lake in two days
you are somewhere else so times you need
to immediately and I was hoping they
will seal it there'll be a caso village
together and they will you need to
realize this this Ghazi has not only
attained one person he's trained about
70 yes so so where are the others
how much addicts has come in no one has
an idea how much Heidi is one is an idea
so we need to be varied that they could
be another attack and how are we
prevented but assured you know this is
there is no way that a local militant
has this type of this is the hand of
judge they have also accepted it I will
come to you sir first to the shaker it
is obvious that it is Pakistan behind it
their aiding abetting ship sheltering
tents
what is your plan of action
as far as Pakistan is concerned when us
can go all the nine miles smoke out
Osama bin Laden why can't we eliminate
this man Masood Azhar it going to send
the wrong message top nearest
elimination of the top leadership most
important always JTG has great clearly
stated in absolute evidence it is the
hand of Pakistan
and when team homework when it's
accepted by our funded by so this singer
we have done it so it's understood
Pakistan and that is no further debate
yeah it is a foggy start state-sponsored
when Jesse I agree but whatever whatever
plan of action to take on this plan is
coming from Pakistan official figures
show that the person just now said the
speed we will take appropriate action
yeah you're going full come on to the
military trust the Jevons of India trust
of military at the appropriate time a
chilling lesson I'm repeating the word
so the sense actually listen if pi-star
whatever for a lifetime
they'd be decimated so just have
patience India today nice just to be
United and the patient military the
prime ministers will free hand to the
forces to take the appropriate action be
deem hence it is a enemy sponsored at or
and India will take the revenge okay
just a second okay I think we need to
understand we are dealing with them was
not learn to lesson after losing four
people stuff as a nation not supported
enough population in our strategy in
Pakistan and that's that's not lacking
but I Cajun in Latin culture also let's
give them a chance to come in here yes
man general do you think policy you in
Pakistan is requiring a flashing first I
would like to comment on your opening
statement of this debate when you
mention about RDX and how such a larger
quantity has actually come yeah let me
you that I won't be surprised because a
car born on Eid s are a new concept we
are concerned
it has never happened in this way it
does happen yes and that is why I won't
be surprised if three for more car bound
IDs have already been prepared because
reason is you know me as isolated things
but go tell you we do what can we do to
tackle this this is a we know upload
story yes I agree with you we have a
border fencing in place but they are
tons of the border which actually are
vulnerable where border fencing cannot
be placed because you know they are
passes and all they are dominated but
they are not a foolproof because you
know we are all sort you manana and
whether minus degrees of temperature and
people you cannot remain 100% vigilant
at 24/7 it is not possible after you
know for these are also human beings so
the invitation does take place
the number of terrorists as you know me
you brought out but what do we do
figures are not correct because they are
a large number of both those figures
official figures are based on they last
port until hammer tightly center of
their minimum energy on this RDX is not
a thousand 300 kgs has been hundred
latest a we know what is 170 I'm saying
I have a fear same or very I it's very
high still very high it only comes from
connection in last month in Colombia
there was an similar attack only 70
cases was used so they wanted to make a
statement that we can hit you at well
now imagine hunt more than hundred cages
in Kashmir yeah it definitely has not
come through the infiltration routes it
has come from the from the post where
you're coming trading to happen you have
among say to which allows
you get a visual and it is a man when to
serve them evenly some value Lacan
famous you to me think of one family
going to I just have to take televiewers
which was we are playing dinners on the
old poor Rajasthan this is a job on who
rain supervisor means come back in a
coffin and that is why she should so
angry today and what do we need this a
month a boo-boo this attire is water
what do we mean by ordeal the water was
it to make it you are the sea about the
station the architecture to understand
these are all due to the support of the
Pakistani state computer Pakistani
listen all of this week up I have a
natural solution you have to understand
we will not a focus on the individual to
this year they will be wiped out by a
civil forces we are comparing to now
yeah I missed on the state of Pakistan
she is giving these bombs which is which
is support it as if they may be wiped
out and once they are wiped out
naturally in Kashmir the tourism will
come down so to understand it's a larger
perspective we will wipe out the
adductors
no no beyond rhetoric beyond rhetoric
major burns other regional arjun culture
the point we are making today is let's
go beyond this canceling of most favored
nation state as we know I know the prime
minister said be patient believe so we
will even there will be no militarily
something will happen we don't know what
covert overt operations of course but
many things cannot be discussion
discussed on television without will
discuss what by country clothes all this
Atari among say to what do we need this
one anymore why can't we just run down
the embassy stop our dialogue declare
Pakistan or terror state do it now why
not so yes you see the point is that
half-baked you know majors I don't go to
work it has to have a comprehensive
policy on Pakistan and all this say
thoose and retirees I know all these
things have to be stopped
yeah because that is the only way we can
choke this country and because he also
discussing the Indus Water Treaty yes in
this water treaty also interruption
I should be only right now yes if it is
international photocopies can be see
as an option it has been discussed
earlier also but it's only on the table
it has never been implemented because to
get it implemented also you know major
it will be grass to an international
yeah I am really saying on in this water
tell world bank we will honor this if
you commit a Pathan will not act against
us they will not send Terrace it cannot
be a one-sided one if World Bank comes
to you it goes to interest arbitration
our stand is clear we will honor the
agreement if Pakistan honors and does
not does not attack us does not indulge
in the things it is indulging it cannot
be a one-sided if I can be not yet the
international community I know
diplomatic me they're trying where we
have a very strong statement coming from
United State that India is acting in
self-defense I think it's a it's a very
very strong vindication of our stand
from United State maybe we can rally the
international community together to get
this manically to begin with call
muscles are a global terrorist call
Pakistan declare it an enemy state
declare it I would even go to an extent
that a special session of the United
Nations we should be asked for because
the housing actually no no this matter
once again this is not a time to go to
global for like UN and try to get
support why not you do not know what
suppose it was significant how come
Masood Azhar is a terrorist for us we
will wipe them out we do not want a
certificate of global terrorist Wow and
secondly can be an artist because you
are our source of lost lives families
are mourning we do not want certificates
from UN we do not want to go any way
certification look internally the world
opinion has to be on the premises
clearly said we will teach up
pre-fitting let me say no if you go to
UN so this is not a naruse time I make
it good abhishek we need to community
basically where what do you think well
ambassador here trying to change it a
global open yet redundant ID whoever is
it with a bigger for openness aggregate
a modular you public of human identity
provide the underlines of us
and if you read the online statement
India's acting in self-defense
nearly indicates to us a few attack
animus if this is what you think when
you think a national community we need
is that integrated we can all yoga mat

at a time like this when we have lost 40
of our Jevons in a terror attack a
complete unity is required on the
political front politicians need to rise
above natural gains and speak in a
united voice on one hand we have an old
party meat which is currently under way
and on the other visuals visuals which
literally tears this is from Google's
poor in Punjab and of course the remains
of one of the mortals now going back to
its own sound
these are the visuals which have made
the nation extremely angry this is
something which is putting us on the
edge services making us ask the
government again and again do something
do it now do something in the long term
we are patient we believe our army but
these visuals are something which no
Indian can accept as of now all we can
say is that we stand with the family of
those martyrs to them
salute not enough we stand by them we
stand by their families also another
heartening which was for a change even
though for a brief while even though
fill this meeting loss political class
sitting together we have the opposition
leaders where you can see uninsured ma
we can see from the Rd Rajah these are
people who have been at loggerheads and
have time and again criticized and are
infirm of the government today listening
to us nursing and he is briefing them
about the situation in Avanti pura and
submit of course is live with us on that
big story he has all the updates to make
the whole party meet of course underway
one hand we have those extremely
heart-wrenching visuals of the mortal
remains of soldiers reaching their
families some ray of hope at least
politicians sitting together on one
podium discussing this a situation which
is of course currently prevailing in
Avanti pura
tell us o still the small as that old
party meat is concerned what is being
discussed right now and are we expecting
some sort of a crucial announcement
poster that meeting
well we'll be lucky the sentiments of
whole nation is what they have they said
that we have to study united against
this act of terrorism and that sense of
sentiments have been have been also
understood by the by all these leaders
that is why the meeting is underway and
all parties put together and they have
been have been supporting the government
and they they have at the yesterday only
they have mentioned that whatever action
government will take all party will be
stand united so after all these access
that now the government main priority is
to is to is to is to is to is to club
how to how to handle Pakistan how to how
to how to here isolate Pakistan on
different levels on one level Pakistan
on one level we have already have
happened on one level we have already
called on upon upon high commission of
from Pakistan and most importantly not
only the military action but also the
diplomatic action we have to take
against Pakistan so that is the forward
a plan of action has been has been
discussed with all the party leaders so
that in whatever action will be taken
everybody will be keeping in keeping and
everybody in loop back to you manake
Lysander cementing on the other hand of
course we are getting those
heart-wrenching visuals the mortal
remains and bodies of all those who have
lost their lives reaching their families
we are expecting of course a battery of
top leadership of the BJP also to me you
know the hometowns offer those martyrs
that take us through the leaders who to
visit the families of the martyrs today
well did yesterday only the the cabinet
the comment that most of the leaders
will have to go to D D to be servin into
the criminais tion of the of all these
Martius so numeracy thurmond difference
Minister will be going to the South B
she will be visiting Tamil Nadu and
Karnataka and Raj Mohan Singh Rathore to
the Rajasthan and VK Singh to u P and
all these leader will be where we'll be
will be attending there all these
acclamation of the Martius so especially
when these kind of facts happens that
one thing is very important monarchy
that why the reason is that that we have
to stood united against this because
that is the reason why they take
advantage of all these acts they
basically create a rift between between
the section of society and use all this
rift for on their benefits so as India
has clearly given a message to
internationally that we have unitedly
united on this issue and whatever action
taken by the by the government we will
stood in favor of that well absolutely
I'd like to ask you one more question we
just confirmed the four ago core to my
panel submits this certainly is a
heartening visual to a we are seeing all
the parties United what are we expecting
does not sing or to inform older these
opposition leaders were gathered today
is it just going to be information as we
have seen in the past about the
situation prevailing in the valley or is
the Home Minister this I'm expected to
take the suggestions of all the
opposition leaders as well and come up
with a united charter you know which
India is now planning to take up to
really tackle and take on Pakistan as
far as these terror activities are
concerned well Meenakshi he will be
informed also and he will also take the
suggestions from the political / leaders
so especially when he yesterday he
visited with Willie he was accompanied
by the by the by the CRP of T G and
after after taking all these review he
also take a review early morning today
from the IB chief and Home Secretary and
after all these review and the recent
report not only informed the different
leaders of the political party but also
try try and take a suggestion from
that this is a plan of action from the
government side but for visa from the
all the party political leaders so after
after all these all these suggestions
they will the government will try and
execute all these plan of action was
right oh so may thank you for bringing
us up to speed with what really is
happening there are two the old party
meat of course we have the swirls of
drugs not saying who is that often to
all the opposition leaders of the shake
yes this is the time may pass need to
lump together what a ticking needs to
stop this is not a time to politics
around tonight right now the country is
united all political parties ignited
very happy that the country has a form
dissolved that this time we will not
discuss internal issues so I think
everybody is on board everybody same
vision at this time I mean you will
appreciate each other as conference is
nothing but our Gandhi at least he came
out and said that we need to stand
together and for a change it needs the
top leadership are not attacking your
father actually I don't recommend one
leader I think all political parties all
leaders have been united and one thing
before the break on the global issue
what the clear standings we will go to
the international community they've
invited all diplomats the global
community is supporting us but as on the
premise to also said that we will take
action on our own decision and we will
inform the global community to take the
support but we will not be dependent on
them so this little D market at that
point look at the visible Indian High
Commission you know there at a South
Block so diplomatically our government
is taking on muscles very important
muscles it will go to UN we try to do
whatever is required to make more global
terrace but I will not wait for that we
will take action against him
irrespective of mainly picture
automatically also diplomatic is no
battle do you also read Indian High
Commission of course and I hope you're
doing automatically so we are calling no
matically India India is showing and we
need to get the international community
to rally together I don't know why you
guys ought to you you don't seem to
agree with me I yeah but other has been
called
station we have not recorded so there is
a huge difference see you recalling
should be just recalled yeah we record
yes yes you are calling for a
concentration by maybe stop stop alchemy
why can't you just shut down this
embassy what what do we need are you
CUNY Capon embassy there are Indian
serving gir you keep a junior staff you
keep a typist I'm but shut down the
diplomatic relations minimal access at
both the sides I am saying even in
Pakistan
given the minimal X and I won't take it
a step ahead till all working permits
for all Pakistanis living in India shall
go to go back yes they do it what do you
think so what do you I was slightly
different you see it has to be prevented
response kind of a thing you can't
straight away shut down at the same time
you have to build up the pressure then
only that guy is going to succumb second
aspect is have a look at the military
doctrine of the Pakistan Army a bleed
India through a thousand cuts
is the bottom line it has been mentioned
in the military culture of the Pakistan
of it a Pakistan as a state we all know
but this should be answer them back in
their language we have that is why I'm
saying it let me take it ahead let's
maybe declare the government in exile
Volusia son what about a stopping also
see let's let you take them wear it out
of it what is it is it robbed or should
be if they have a more calibrated
apology I always would recommend a
calibrated approach because we should
not straight away actually show our
cards at the same time you know our
response has to be graduate earlier and
our cards must be open and appropriate
type because we don't we want to create
a situation where a state comes then we
bring the adversary to his knees because
that is important right you know I let
me take this to a shake up a shaker we
have these visuals the Union envoy or
Park is at end
any other society of course has been
called but what you can see it with
clear water method saying maybe just
stop talking to Pakistan it that any
there's any point of having diplomatic
relations with Pakistan at this point of
time maybe we need to go a step ahead
and I'm not saying that it's not
happening or your government is not
thinking it but do you think personally
that it's required now to stop
communications strong messages to
Pakistan calling either an envoy calling
their and what not enough actually the
government has already said will be a
isolating Pakistan one secondly these
are steps with wisdom institutional
Affairs they miss your home phrasing
governor windy a totality as to take so
decisive step by step so first we bring
we are the ambassador of India to
Pakistan to come back give us his
opinion give us feedback and these are
very sensitive issues to understand
government works you know in a manner
which is which is you know depends on
lot of other factors we have called
ambassador back he will give us the
opinion the ministers they will decide
so this is the procedural issues of the
Emmys what you get in the right ship
appointment on with you had made to this
right now we know he's being some mantra
and as the max will take an update a
strong message of course has been sent
or through the Pakistani ambassador but
is there a need to now shut down ties
with Pakistan I mean do you think that
is the need of the are calling on on why
it's okay to step in the right direction
I won't deny that I don't know
we need to lose before we decide that we
need to shut down relationships with
Pakistan they have a clear stated policy
thousand cuts operation topaz has been
in the execution from 84 they have they
have said with hollynjym occur in Doosan
Camacho range now is the time maybe and
also you know a man is mentioning all
party means we're getting a life of it
isn't the old party meat has concluded
the party need which currency taking
place in the national capital is over so
mister will be joining us shortly and
giving us all the updates on the things
on one hand well I have this was as why
Hindus are clear of this so I harvest
saying 40 lives we have we have lost you
have not lost forty legend it was 170
soldiers in Kashmir in 2018 so nobody
cut the CRPF casualty
they have not had these many casualties
in the valley in maybe years as they had
in a day because because then the
country has noticed it because fatigue
Jevons idea in one go
Seattle has been losing people regularly
so I'm talking around 67 so we'll just
have you you have lost in customer 867
soldiers in a valley in last year we
have we so how many are they like them
to see to lose how many of the security
personnel in a state and it is CRPF has
been targeted not only Jane kate has
also be targeted the North India and it
has suffered very heavy casualties and
it doesn't actually affect them or all
of the cups how about let me tell you
that who can which Indian is unmoved by
those visuals oh yes soldiers coming
back to their family absolutely children
orphans widows wailing who wants to
watch our Juwan like this nobody in as
the whole party meters over I have a
question for a reciprocal ask him on the
other side of this commercial break the
water your expectation over you think
would be the conclusion from the Royal
party Mead and we will discuss that
aspect in detail on the other side of
this commercial break

welcome back at a time like this cost
fifty of our Jevons in a chariot attack
a complete unity is requiring these so a
small extremely small glimpse of it of
course on the left side that whole party
meet currently does not sing presided
over that me to talk leadership of the
opposition parties did attend the meet
conspicuous by their absence are all
done even Prime Minister moody tendered
that all party meet but erm we of course
have those heart-wrenching visuals which
draw the nation's attention on the
extreme right of your screen visuals are
coming pouring in from the entire
country these Joe bonds were not from
one area they were from pan India
different religions different states
different regions unfortunately
extremely unfortunately United in death
death which they suffered at the hands
unfortunately queue size bumber and now
the nation is angry we want revenge
nobody is being jingoistic sir here
saying you know go all the way declare a
war but you have some be discussing a
strategic partnership we are using a
wrong word we don't want revenge we
don't want to avenge we want justice
justice for our Martius so let us get
out of mindset they want revenge
alright I use the word justice but
justice how and for that we were
discussing of course various aspects
avenues and options in front of me in
India and in the commercial because we
were discussing about the United States
it's a strategic partner we haven't won
to leverage it they are anti China they
are engaged in a trade war with China
they have a load of intelligence
maybe we can leverage that one to get
the u.s. to create pressure on China
which sources I have been telling us and
diplomatically India's trying and
secondly to use intelligent to find this
man Masuda world and why I actually
would like to amplify said with the US
we have a military exchange you to
program our armies are training together
yes you do what is the purpose of doing
all this the purpose of doing all this
is because you are
Alai when you we need your help who will
be there for us a large number of
weapons and equipments are also being
procured from the US which was not been
done earlier to the US as a strategic
partner now is the time to use that
leverage with ostrich a partner to give
response to Pakistan because if we don't
do it now it will be too late it will be
too late just a short term long term
measures needed are Matias he wants to
come in there singer we were also
discussing the an example of a nation
called Israel yes yeah and surrounded by
all any states in isolation an island in
isolation has and still no one dares to
touch them and we can't manage one small
country which is next to us can be
compared with Israel limited military
miter saw them will tree might is their
village bigger than them is what I was
saying will not only that is not very
much every citizen of Israel become
obviously go through compassion creating
here is compulsory training for every
citizen of Israel I am only saying it is

United States biggest supporter for us
is clearly told you I don't know what
language they will tell you that we
support Indian any act of self-defense
act of self-defense the operative word
oh how do you do it yeah you won't be
lost
dear serious about the political will
that's what I was think the entire
debate the will is strong they can be
they have loved the cutting it apart a
porous opponent Basara
rajaiah so what have you seen on the
court sir Mike I have come to see this
spot and as you have seen the teams are
already working here
the forensic teams the teams of Ni and
our old people are working here and the
investigation is going on and once the
investigation is concluded then only
more details can be given thank you not
revealing the must right now
investigations under an Oslo prime
minister had said earlier we need to
have faith in our forces which we do
when we are hoping that we will be
getting more details and before I go to
abyss shaker as far as investigations
are concerned we do know that the
mastermind for him the hunter zone he is
reportedly hiding in some forests in the
thrall region and the other update which
we have is the type of explosives which
were used it was a combination of RDX
and urea ammonium nitrate those are
right so those are the details which are
emerging and we are of course waiting up
for more you know details as far as the
probe is concerned to emerge on that but
up keeping the probe aside of the shake
yes you wanted to come in and seek a
balance on Israel as you said so
Benjamin Nathan what we can learn from
Israel is a small issue now Benjamin
Netanyahu Prime Minister Israel his
clear statement was whoa what tries to
hurt us we will hurt will not tolerate
tickles if the attackers we will return
fire and I hear I repeat he said whoever
hurts us we will hurt them Sevenfold and
because why don't be speaking we are
doing it so what Prime Minister said and
I will give a befitting reply and
secondly it is a clear policy of Israel
which has given them you know immense
strength across the globe and India is
for in the on the same principle Modi ji
is doing the same thing and we must be
rest assured this time in they will give
a response with the whole world will set
up and watch and Pakistan will be I
think after this the response will give
Pakistan alone will be able to stand up
again and I can confirm that general
aboriginal culture you know how many are
we speaking about diplomatic efforts
abstract is saying go after a bit
befitting reply Pakistan won't be able
to stand up we've seen it in the past as
well commercially we've tried too many
times you know try to attack Pakistan we
have from sanctions to is closing our
embassies completely ending a diplomatic
channels Pakistan does not seem to have
learned a lesson so what do we do now
what do you suggest her in the point is
we have gone through attack on our
Parliament at that point also be ready
to go to war but this point attack of
Parliament done who J a more modest yes
this man who be released after kendama
son living in Pakistan is giving to only
we have to have a single point agenda
and getting this man YES on extradited
from this Pakistan and he must come to
India and he behind our extradition is
the possibility we need to smoke here
right on that smoking you must have the
capability I must have the capability
spoke about right the US has a
capability let's use the US let
intelligence on did we have an expertise
or hate on so point taken let's use
advantage which we have as of not yes
let's get the international community
together isolate Pakistan smoke out this

cannot come inside us and rest capture
and hold it this is one of the points
the day what will they do they will
simply wait because the whole country
whole wall will not not not tell you
anything about it because they know the
Pakistan is a terrorist state and if
India goes and captures couple of their
border post and a direct there from
that's that from that point there will
be two barrier one is a post and one is
the natural barrier national CCFL all I
call for this factional right taken
right okay I don't want to discuss this
yeah all right I don't know what
operations much does in the domain of
you had the opulent fair and of course
let's not it was it you know discuss in
details I get your point of covert
operations but I think you've made a
very personal point and measurement
asana this is what mission Ganguly Singh
would you agree that it is time for
India to hit Pakistan border post as
much as we can until an extension
they're forced to make the surrender
when I said that there are large number
of overt options and I am sure we
volumes lot of options and I am sure the
people who are responsible they would be
looking at these options immediately now
yeah but at the same time I must tell
you that then since I am sure CCS also
must be deciding because they as far as
the or these options are tactical
options as well but these tactical
options have got strategic implications
so that is why everybody has to sit down
together
you have to finally decide it now come
certain other weaknesses which we have
well that's why these astray you
mentioned as to where we have not been
able to put that much of pressure on
Pakistan yeah one of the thing is that
you see their aim is very clear as far
as Kashmir is concerned lead turned
inwards
you know no doubt as far as we are
concerned
till date can you believe it no national
security strategy has been made public
questions do we have a policy on
Pakistan like a real policy to David
that is better than what I am saying
America has got a national security
strategy and they put it in the public
domain although what they want to hide
they do hide but when a strategy a
policy to absolutely say they give it
out yes same is the case with China they
give out their white paper now what
happens is it gives the intent of that
country yes like China has said that
okay will protect my lines of
communication anywhere in the world so
he has given the global ambition I am a
strategic analyst I know that China does
not have that capability what he has
given an intent okay similarly in our
case we have been we have not given a
national security strategy on the
platter so our national security
strategy is quite Amina so why is
required why the reason I'll tell you
why yeah all the ministries are working
in silos all the politicians are working
yes so if there is no concentrated
national strategy then what happens is
that in everybody like for example when
we want to make roads in China the
Environment Ministry says no no no our
animals will get disturbed and it
doesn't allow you to make the road yeah
so therefore if you have a strategy in
place that if Chinese have made the
roads right up to the border why country
why can't we what is stopping us
absolutely the well you know for any
another why everyone is so angry is
because there are 40 Jevons who have
lost well at this point and also like to
just just listen in to some reactions of
the family members of those llaman
because we need to see you know the shoe
touch what really has happened how its
wrecked havoc as far as the families of
those Jevons are also concerned and why
it is extremely important for India to
act now act strong and give a stern
message to Pakistan that this is
completely unacceptable if you want have
to tip a third you know disco for sale

just heard those reactions of the family
members and this is why is the new
tremely
angry today forty Jevons have lost their
lives we still have the most favored
nation status to Pakistan we still have
a water treaty with them should we just
revoke that water treaty should be now
exert pressure on Pakistan trade water
economic everywhere to send out a stern
Tim time hit their border pose as you
were suggesting sir and we are also
expecting some stern message to come
from the CCS meet before I go across to
measure and Ganguly we have those which
was owner screener those are of course
the latest visuals coming from the CCS
me to remember the CCS meters currently
underway it's being shared by none other
than the Prime Minister Defense Minister
did last season also are ending that
means we are expecting some stern
measures as far as India is concerned we
are expecting some crucial and critical
announcement from the CCS meet this is a
exactly what every Indian you know is
asking the mayor of Ganguly is it high
time that we shut down water supply
trade talks with Pakistan at the same
time hit their border poster exert as
much pressure on Pakistan as we can to
send out a strong and stern message that
India is not going to accept this and we
will retaliate back if we are provoked
in this completely unacceptable man ISM
absolutely absolutely we have to tell
them till this particular action that is
the terrorists are stopped from coming
into India all these particular
interstate relations should come to tan
still as we know players should come no
place would take place in cricket or
football anywhere in India between India
Pakistan or in Pakistan itself similarly
for this particular negotiation etcetera
should come to standstill Pakistan has
to given this message but we cannot take
it any more
their diversity their audacity is enough
for India to awake themselves cannot you
cannot just help preliminary for that
that that will have to still carry on
with them yeah and I know asana why is
China not condemn this attack at all
what from China yet I am a little
surprised with that EVR you're
discussing how we need to hit Pakistan
you know a [ __ ] them economically
ensure that we get shine on board they
haven't spoken a word they haven't even
condemned what happened in Peru mama sir
you see as far as China is concerned
there is a co system between China and
Pakistan you must have heard of 1
million Igor's being put in a jail come
reeducation camp whatever you call it
Pakistan has not spoken a word about it
the whole world has spoken a word
everybody has condemned that but
Pakistan has not spoken so it is a quid
pro quo that's how they have not spoken
anything now I have little different
view all the actions which we are
talking these are all defensive actions
these are all indicators and the
policies have to interrupt you and I'll
come back to you I believe you're
getting a live reaction offered

January 2 2016 India put for Amber a
proposal in February 2016 to designate
other as a terrorist under the aegis of
the UNSC one two six seven committee
china intervened at Pakistan Sri has to
remember and placed a technical hold on
India's move in March 2016 and again in
October it subsequently used its veto
power to block in December 2016 a day
before technical hold ended the big
question now we are asking today is how
we can get China to stop backing
Pakistan is it time to exert
international pressure on Pakistan to
cut their monetary funding to pressurize
Pakistan to act against terrorists in
China angle extremely crucial on that of
course my general Association of course
from our noida studio mention of Ganguly
also is with us from Kolkata Major
Nelson as we're discussing you know in
this commercial break as well as far as
China is concerned they haven't spoken a
word on this doctored Lee attack sir
3704 Jevons are dead and not a word of
condemnation not a word from China what
are we expecting from China D to be
scuttling our efforts to declare this
man Masood Azhar a global terror sir
you see strategically it suits China
if Indian army gets bogged down in
Kashmir at the same time if you see not
many people keep telling us that okay
all this terrorist movement is jihadi
movement ten things it has got religious
overtones and things like that I don't
believe all that it's a purely terror
industry now what has happened is that
Chinese as far as Chinese are concerned
there are lot of Pakistani people whose
wives have been put who we were wives
have been putting those terror camps or
those region camps which are in fact
actually prisons not a single word right
Pakistan has spoken against China
absolutely sir and so I'll come back to
you on that point we have some important
piece of information coming in right now
that the CCF meet which was underway
that meeting is over in vajacial joining
us with the latest details which is over

action surgical strike was a goodness
but there was no follow-up from an Malik

why have you think mr. car today is our
day peas in a pod

Indian establishment if you want to
pacify and if you want that you know
somehow you guys get a little less of
the word please hand over all the 11th
of people including office I and this
Rahim and all those just that you are
probably God and the Indian public makes
I have already let
but be rest assured what has happened
and transpired through your choice after
your puppet Prime Minister of Health
said that this wife would not be able to
be used for terror against any country
and especially India it has happened and
the anger is not controllable now so
please tell your part-time establishment
no one hates was of no no public I am
really tired of this humming Hawker pain
none of you miss Nimbus every in minutes
out of this talk about show business we
all say I think you know at the only
thing what you need to keep on react
yeah
mr. mr. I know it's Rena one second Amon
Malik you know that that leads me to the
question I was just going to ask you
before I you know I went to muñeca what
is the follow-up now this is an
extremely deadly incident this is the
deadliest attack we saw there were in
recent times in almost two decades
yes everyone tickle strike sir that
happened after worried
but what decisive steps are you going to
take after this you know what is there
going to be the government strategy at
the end of the day there should be
taking today but it's there's no two
ways about it you've spoken something
else in Delhi and you went to Jammu and
Kashmir you would speak something else
because you are in coalition with the
PDP there there's been no policy you say
University analyst has have let down
this issue
so go ahead mr. Manik okay what good is
going to be the follow-up steps now in
strategy what happens in local landmark
or with the nsa's office or the house
law would not be debated as from the
television nor with any other
functionaries
hurring he talked people who are
involved to take action on this and I
believe everybody would appreciate that
fact that it should only remain with
these people not disgusted with general
public like us so that the seriousness
of the issue and the gravity remains
their number one
nobody had any knowledge and I have a
bit of knowledge that probably something
like surgical size could happen after
hurry and lot of questions were asked
from us we kept quiet but we did what we
had to and I can tell you and I can
assure you the place is tiny are we
continuing that artists with all the
headaches in the laser strike no
terrorist attack has happened in India
notice that over how we now prepare a
response to we have it out there here
are we now prepared to go into Pakistan
and eliminate half a size and masood
azhar that's the big question we know in
Oracle parties including the Congress
and others unite on that needle in the
first place holistic where terrorism
Erik out of those fortresses will be
able to take terrorists out of one to
six three are left but yes okay what's
the word and we are ok before I go back
to Monique are there who obviously wants
to come back in and I'm coming too many
card have some patience I swear I am are
they above the Congress issue area what
is your first reaction to this extremely
heinous that has taken place in German
crush me today will Anita's and our
polity also stand as one in condemning
it and and asking for retribution it is
one of the most instances when you see
so many young soldiers being martyred in
an unprecedented attack because the last
we saw of such severity was in 2001 and
he believed that the situation had had
improved quite drastically but you see
that on the ground you still see the
same violence the same bloodshed and the
biggest problem is the politics of this
nation does not see it is not something
that should preclude a man with common
sense from asking why is this happening
everybody is saying that the Congress is
politicizing it you have your opinions
but I don't believe it is wrong for
people of this country to say why is
this happening again and again
especially in light of two things the mo
of the mos of mr. Kiren Rijiju recently
said there have been no attacks since
Rudy well we've said close to 30 attacks
will happen we're saying this is
systemic failure of India also to
basically fight back with the sort of
aggression
the sort of attacks that are happening
across the border the very simple fact
remains there that do what you say about
Pakistan our response are all these
tweets about how you know blood will be
shed they're like welcome back from the
break I'm gonna Pratap Singh you're
watching news X we're getting some
breaking news coming in on the
continuous focus on Avanti pura Prime
Minister Narendra Modi is to chair a
cabinet committee meeting on security at
9:00 a.m. tomorrow this is the big news
coming in this hour Prime Minister Modi
to chair a cabinet committee meet on
security at night the PM are also
tweeted that he had spoken with the Home
Minister and high-level officials this
evening and the fallout of the Avanti
para terror attack obviously the Prime
Minister and highest the government
looking at the fallout of that incident
and assessing the security situation the
PM to chair that Cabinet Committee meet
on security 9:00 a.m. tomorrow all right
so we will of course continue to get you
the latest developments coming in in the
fallout of that attack and the latest
inputs from on ground but let me quickly
go back across to Aishwarya Mahadev of
the Congress very Ahmadi we've seen what
relief Fujiwara tweeted earlier but you
know these things don't you feel can be
discussed on day two day three day four
after the attack is it fair on the first
day to play politics in this manner to
start a blame game isn't it unfortunate
to highlight gaping holes and policy
while dealing with this neighbor is not
politicizing rather stating the fact mr.
Sandeep Singh Surjewala has strongly
condemned this attack and also you know
control the bereaved and I believe that
was absolutely necessary in the Congress
party stands behind him on that however
I don't see any fault
in pointing out the fact that over the
years especially in light of we'll have
missed a clear energy to say that
nothing has happened at all but over the
years and more and more Jevons
are falling prey to you know acts such
as this and the government has not been
able to basically move forward and take
decisive action and I do not think
there's anything wrong even in a time
like this
to remind the fact that every other day
now that they're injured the death toll
is also rising this is one of the worst
attacks and you have to realize that if
there was decisive action over the years
and I am NOT talking about my regime or
anything I'm saying blank of basically
having stopping these attacks and you've
been unable to do it
I think Dominic Dom American Rehman
Malik quick intervention then and then
we move on beyond the politics because
who want to contribute too much in
politics Tony ya know I prayed and I'm
very sorry that I will have to get into
politics of it which I did not want to
get she is not forgotten and for
heaven's sake remember that Rahul Gandhi
was the idiot who was going and hugging
the parent bottles in Diagon he was a
guy sitting and hugging them why love
math I will give some people in the back
over JaJuan being martyred you let the I
assign to plot and code server the old
event you're making this political I
told you why we criticize Prime Minister
Modi
don't you dare for my Congress resident
in India because God knows what we could
see about yours you are working as a
combination okay okay let's go let's not
let me get it nicely you know I do I
don't want to get into this I don't want
to get into this at all remember okay
let's stop this I will stop this
immediately I will stop this immediately
no more politicking no more politicking
that's why I said earlier it's
unfortunate we can have it on the second
the third day and the fourth day when
inquiry start and and what rare lapse
was but not today but for Tito Giovanni
42 Jevons have lost their lives and it
seems that you know all their mothers
their families will be weeping for them
crying they don't want this today's
stories let's restrain when you caused
it when you caught it let me comes back
across to you Monique are there you're
you were you you started out you know
shedding crocodile tears and saying what
happened was very unfortunately but I am
denied you feel so pathetic okay will do
to you okay we all do but that's my
follow-up question then when you Valerie
please one second we need we need to
listen to the first question we listen
to the whole question
listen to the whole question Marie if
you feel so devastated about it and
about it then responsibility to listen
to it from the station Mooney closet who
need called it let's talk about offices
let's talk about office side the entire
world is established at half the size of
the service we sent you dossier if the F
ATF is actually blacklisted you put you
on a grey list cutting off sanctions to
you because of your support to proxies
like rates like our all-time favorite
proxy remote but why haven't you
sanctioned a filter if you put him under
house arrest you put him under house
arrest in a sham before your pockets and
elections now you have Imran Khan's
minutes I mean rallies what is this who
you trying to fool
I'll answer I'll answer but
Daniel service is my answer to you is
very simple and straightforward
my answer is death in Pakistan we the
voters rejected any port to such people
that you meaning here first why the
anonymous Parliament the fact that he
was even am feeling is well known when

usually follow it was a sham are you

Greta our India she is a very big
country it's a very big democratic
country and these kind of things which

series it is unbreaking heartbreaking it

ours in India and being an actor is much
and thank you - old able to learn again
in the 4th and I want to feel this all
the people who are against this my blood

barely speak you could see the emotion
in his in his voice when he was speaking
but I think every Indian is emotional
today every Indian is in theaters today
and every minute you pray that that toll
does not go up at the same time we are
also hoping that this the revenge
the attack on Pakistan is not a hidden
one it's a decisive one let the whole
world realize that we are not going to
take it anymore
that this nation realize that we have
power we can hit back let the enemy know
that enough is enough they can't escape
the wrath of Indians anymore that's the
problem you need color isn't it
you know you were talking about dialogue

curvature for Nawaz Sharif's you know

because you know started Moony causeth
the point is we have attempted dialogue
with you Prime Minister Modi in a
gesture of peace had gone to Nawaz
Sharif's you know daughter's marriage in
the past two we have had dialogues of a
General Musharraf and at a very watch
pie had gone to the Taj Mail we spoke
about Sharm el-sheikh earlier so
dialogue has been attempted but it
hasn't worked work because obviously we
are talking to the wrong person your
your decisions are being taken by up
India seems so you know your your
political masters are not capable of any
wheats with India seems what's example
I'm only saying I'm adding to it or that
it is not working
Henry everybody HTM Ted a talk with
Pamir God you have got betrayal let's

because of you I won't tolerate this is
this place because of you

they're going to get retribution for own
up to it I won't tolerate this crocodile
tears and this shouting ramen money some
money good memories I will not forget
Pakistan should not forget that whether
it is constant but whatever happened in
module because it obviously they have
been all requesting us again support and
Indian forces because we said you will
suffer that we did not give them support
do you have a concern they must
understand the jz / hunger care do you
there is not true in your field society
he bites form of breakfast and the
dangerous upon your own yeah let's get
in another viewer before we conclude my
move you are joining us some change a
parcel you know at the end of the day
after you remand Malik you made a valid
point but the problem is Pakistan is
wearing blinders they become ostriches
and they put their head in the sand
they don't know the reality that's
that's there to bite them at the end of
the day I'm talking about conscience
what a joke Mooney carded Pakistan
doesn't have a conscience if you did you
would have added over half a side
anyways carsick our necks you are
joining us from Chennai contiguity
very reading all of your files I know I
have two quick points of case and this
is regarding this go through 40 soldiers
that it was going to be there which is
very unfortunate and you know we will
give the metals everything which is very
very very unfortunate and I'm telling
you
optical strike has to start from a
demoon cash bail that separates
separatists has to be thrown out of this
country
okay them in the country it is very very
unfortunate they are only to do all that
and whatever the facility is doing it if
I had only you know all that happening
I know I'm no I don't know if what is
happening and with the man casually now
and we are moving a Java and I am living
here and recite from the no signal
constable and you know because of them I
am living here because of them my kids
out there and what is that I know JaJuan
Khanna family have
normally the one we are going to lose
absolute water kind of all got a valid
point that's a valid point you are
making from Chennai you know are just
stay away from their families so that we
can stay with our loved ones and we can
stay safe and today that's why we're so
upset as a nation that we've lost forty
Jevons in this deadly attack what will
be the decisive steps taken after that's
something we look at after the break as
well our continuous coverage on the
Avanti pora terror attack continues
after this break my thanks to our
panelists for joining us viewers stay
with us
[Music]
welcome back from the break I mother
Pratap Singh you're watching news excess
continuous coverage of the most deadly
attack in recent times that has been
seen in Jammu and Kashmir this is fresh
information now coming in regarding that
terror attack in Avanti puranjaya mukesh
made the advisor to the Jammu and
Kashmir governor has just stated that 39
Jevons have now been martyred that's the
latest information coming in the death
toll now rising to 39 in this horrific
and tragic attack that has taken place
in Avanti pura and Jammu Kashmir
cowardly terrorist exploding an AED in a
bus there it was an attack on a CR right
I took place on the highway there the
visuals telling the entire story which
you can see on your screens it was
followed though by a gun attack on the
soldiers there was in firing which is
obviously led to death toll rising
significantly 240 now and many others
injured the JJ Mohammed is taken the
responsibility of this attack the
injured soldiers have been rushed to a
nearby hospital a high alert of course
sounded in Jammu and Kashmir posts that
incident that is heavy patrolling now on
all highways and and a high alert across
the state of Jammu and Kashmir however
the Pakistan hand very clear the JM
remember is a group whose head bazoo
d'azyr is in Pakistan their camps are in
Pakistan but let me point out a complete
shocker had also come in just a few days
before this attack a facebook posted
emerge of Major General I said the food
the official DG of the is PR where he
had one of an attack by determined
Kashmiri s-- and just some days after
this bear threat we see this dastardly
attack on Indian forces the biggest ever
attack in two decades as I said it's so
deadly that it's that we've seen of
course the death toll drive steadily and
the only fear is that it could go up
even higher
quick question though how will this be
avenged
what should now be the military strategy
we saw a surgical strike to Avenger II
which did deliver a very powerful
message but was more follow-up made what
should be the strategy on ground now in
Jammu and Kashmir and what should be the
strategy of our security established
when those are some questions which we
will raise on the program this email and
we will also of course keep getting you
the latest updates from on ground even
as
of course they must be grieving in the
families of those injured and those
martyred in this incident but of course
there is always that we will not let
this go unchecked we will avenge this
the JME and Pakistan will have to pay
for this horrific attack we have opened
it out to you the viewer as well you can
continue to call in a number slashing
there on your screen what is your
thoughts on this story whatever your
opinion please share it with us we are
taking your calls live in the program
this evening as well i'm--it's Rana
Kashmiri Affairs expert live with us in
our studio we also have a social pundit
live with us activist and now Kashmiri
Pandit he is live in our studio with us
I want to go straight across to you
first so sheer Panetta what do you make
of this horrific attack that has taken
place it's the deadliest attack in
recent times you know we had seen a
surgical strike after which was called
an extremely deadly attack but just
putting the numbers and putting things
in context there I think 18 Jevons were
martyrs today we've already lost 39 of
our boys with the death toll expected to
rise further sushi as you were talking
another source mentioned 42 and it's it
still is climbing because those who have
survived so far are battling for their
lives you know sometimes the the
comparisons with what happened at URI
and what happened after that into mind
and it is really instructive to recall
that I believe whatever we did in
response to the URI attack was one-off
was not calculated to degrade the
capability of the NFA again or inflict
good enough loss for them to actually
rethink again attacking us in similar
manner it was probably to assuage and
angry nation because we were boiling
over with rage when 18 of our boys were
so brutally murdered in sleep this time
if there is just another reaction
then I am afraid few months down the
line you might again be thinking along
the same lines
it calls for a paradigm shift need to
redefine how you have read the Kashmir
problem so far Kashmir is inflicting a
thousand bleed cuts on us our response
has been thousand bandages and once in a
while a punch back it is not going to
work we have to seriously seriously do
things that not only brace the back of
those who plan this but also instill a
sense of fear in them that the
consequences that would visit them would
be far far bigger than the gains they
ever imagined such kind of acts would
deliver to them it is this kind of
strategy which is going to work and I
dare say people who are taking a call on
what to do are incapable don't have the
political will in fact we are paying for
the sins they committed in the last four
years in Kashmir they allowed terror
machine to regroup rearm retrain
re-recruit imagine they are not going
after soft targets they are targeting
our convoys they are targeting our
Constabulary they are targeting
paramilitary they are targeting army
which me and they are doing it at will
at the place of their choice at the time
of their choice and they are inflicting
big those who sit in the cozy comfort of
Delhi must realize what harm they are
putting their boys into when they send
them to Kashmir just talking big in
front of camera saying will deliver them
a lesson they would remember for their
lives
or will not celebrate Holi or Diwali
this time is not going to work it is
mere lip service and it's sounding very
insincere kindly do what it takes
to take them head-on and you know this
was a planned attack and I'm a China one
before I get you in we're getting
obviously more information coming in
which ship cleans their that a Tata Sumo
was used in this attack remember earlier
there was a vehicle suspected which
which could have possibly had those
explosive devices almost 100 kg munition
and RDX is what we heard well a Tata
Sumo is believed to have been used in
this attack and you know that's the
worry is an atomic Ayana that this was
not just a shoot and scoot attack this
was not just a one-off incident of a
grenade being logged this was a planned
terror attack this was obviously in the
terrorists intelligence which had been
building up for a while they knew that
there was going to be this multi vehicle
crpf convoy on this route at this
particular time on this day and they
chose to attack it they chose explode
this ID they had about hundred kilograms
of explosives that what we are learning
and then they fired indiscriminately
post that in a very field to impart to
inflict maximum damage the modus
operandi looks pretty worrying an
alarming doesn't it yes it is so there
has been an intelligence failure
unsurprisingly tails seem to have a
better intelligence that they were able
to track the movement of such a large
convoy of CLP of even if they got a late
information they were planning attack in
such a short period and doing this the
problem is in Kashmir if government has
been regularly saying that we have an
operation or loud lasting we were total
number of 280 terrorists operate out of
question may we have already killed 287
you still have attacks so so where are
these numbers coming from so there is no
clear plan my biggest worry is that in
three months and another two months you
may have a new government and in case
Modi is not reelected
we will again go back in the same cycle
of 70 years where the new Prime Minister
will believe that he has intelligence
twith in to be noble contender he can
solve the india-pakistan problem
forgetting the seven tiers of bat
happened to every Prime Minister 14
prime ministers from Nehru
- Shastri to Indra Gandhi to vag spy -
moody every Prime Minister has been
backstabbed but every Prime Minister
does not learn from his predecessor and
starts believing that he will now take
it forward and he is a contender for the
Nobel Peace Prize and that has been the
biggest problem I have a sincere feeling
that the next prime minister who comes
does not believe that he we're statesmen
he'll solve this problem Pakistan is a
state with thousand Gazoo I understand
this born to kill India that is the
state policy to the state policy and if
you are not going to acknowledge it you
are not going to fight against it if you
do not have a strategy against it then
these things we will continue to lose
our brothers sons in Kashmir and that is
unfortunate absolutely we also have
Rehman Malik joining us now in the
broadcast Amin Malaika of the BJP is
with us live Rehman Malik house the
government doing this we've seen a tweet
already by Prime Minister Modi
condemning the lutely despicable and
also saying that the sacrifices of our
brave Jovan and our brave soldiers will
not go in vain there have been a
high-level meetings high-level phone
calls we believe when viewing this
terror attack
very seriously
not the seriousness it is also very
clear in what it has to do the machinery
is under working and right now the
machine really is in motion things
cannot be discussed debated with people
like me or on television channels but
yes one thing I can assure you this
Prime Minister will not take it lying
down number one number two the entire
political paternity must talk
immediately any big battle today it is
the case of our nation for heaven's sake
understand this is a direct attack on
the Indian soil where 36 of our boys
have died 42 they have ties for this
nation and there are still people who
want to do petty politics with this I
would not refrain myself to name this
but at the same time it is not about
doing politics they are in above
politics
those people who can go and support the
terrific regard and the people who said
Absalom Chapman Thyatira Castle to that
observer who was a bloody well you know
a traitor who was born out of the same
ideology and you start and you go over
to support him or people who support him
for God's sake understands this is not
the time to do this petty politics to
gain votes it is about finding
relationship stand together and need me
whatever
if neatly you must any tries to reach
events this I personally also have
tweeted this to the Prime Minister
requesting is that all security from
these furious and stowed belt a
supporter and telling them their
displays you there you do not know that
misguided youth should we take advantage
in Italy because these papers have not
faced the courts of terrorism and the
terrorists killing their families none
of their children are under danger they
are all protected
so these engineer receives as everybody
did that means now have no secure so
that they must understand what is the
plight of an object fearing we have been
seen this that they do their bread and
the curry Kashmiri dyes but they do
their politics as the soldier dies this
is a grocer man and also there has been
definitely there is an intelligence
failure of some sort which cannot be a
row idiot which cannot be that it is not
an intelligence failure and they would
be definitely stopped moving
and those moves should be picked out
when absolutely and you know jambe from
the he made that phone that have
committees are needed by the government
of the day we've seen the prime minister
also tweet on this issue
ramen moroccan saying that the
sacrifices of our brave Jevons will not
go in vain
before I ask you you know what sort of
action we are planning now
retribution and we'll the government
gave once again a free hand to our
forces like we saw in the surgical
strike let me bring in Mooney Cather as
well on to the broadcast Pakistani
political analyst joining us on the
broadcast
Monica dear why are you doing this once
again were you not satisfied with the
less I hope you can taught you in up in
the aftermath of Horry are you not
satisfied with our coin of dialogue in
urging you to end terror why are we
seeing once again a pakistani hand in an
extremely deadly cowardly terror attack
alright principal i hope you can hear me
really
and then loud and clear loud and clear
go ahead alright yeah so the thing is
that this is something which i had
predicted right on this direction change
then think might escalate to a point we
want which you know there would be no
return and that is why I always
encourage that there should be talks
established between Pakistan and India
I'm sorry
who do we talk use at the point when
it's our there who do we talk to do we
talk to the ISI or we talk to your
Pakistani government who esteem they
become puppets of the ISI is I say stop
it already
I say stop creating meeting also
terrorists it's so unfortunate what
happened near future of zero innocent
I'm sorry I will non-indian 70s it's
unfortunate it's unfortunate but you're
shedding crocodile tears I will not
allow you to do that why aren't you
taking action

Jesse Mohammed chief Masood Azhar has
admitted responsibility for this attack
he has claimed responsibility for this
attack and it is well-established fact
that he is in Pakistan he is being
shielded by Rawal Pindi and he is in
Pakistan are you prepared if you are
genuinely if you are genuinely saddened
by this attack and if you believe it is
the unfortunate incident will you hand
him over to us let me ask you a rational
question Mooney because it if you are
genuinely saddened by this attack and
you believe is unfortunate as you just
told me
will you hand over Masood Azhar who has
claimed responsibility whose outfit
Jesse Mohammed has claimed
responsibility for this attack will you
animal this should be handed over anyone
who is awaiting for operation over so
please take everyone who is elevated how
do you actually stop fixing us our
terrorist which was released on Iran a
kidnapping on by hijacking would be
given back to India is that we are
trying to tell her no thoughts whatever
alien does and how they influence
killings nothing annoys the bees in

you the point here is if the point here
is why why why why are individuals like
up with a Raman malecon this coming to

known terrorists and perpetrators of
terror like hostage side Masood other

nonsense on Indian channels have the
guts to accept what is happening muscle
gathered has claimed responsibility

your soil and you are you are sharing
this pocket right here and asking us to
look inwards
I am sorry I will not allow money coming
it the more eloquent remand money go
awry you are cowardly you are definitely
and you expose before these I was and
perhaps now it's time for our government
to take decisive action surgical strike
was a goodness but there was no
follow-up Rehman Malik what are you
going to do now
okay let me speak to mr. come in first
why have you mr. carder day all day
faithfully in a course mr. Qadri
okay okay movement mr. Mooney cause it
mr. Mooney cause it please hear the
other panelist out we have any idea of
the Congress or the area at this point
and Rehman Malik of course is all day le
Duc Mooney cousin one ticket please
hang on listen out to the listen to the
other users were coming in remand ma
League West German wanna go ID we can
hear you yes my general suggestion to
Moni my simple suggestion human Edith
and please tell it to your cotton mouff
Indian establishment if you want to
pacify and if you want that you know
somehow you guys get a little less of
the war please hand over all the people
including offices and this Dow Abraham
and all those just that you are probably
God and the Indian public ways I have a
little less anger but be rest assured
what has happened and transpired through
your voice after your puppet prime
minister has said that this wife would
not be able to be used for terror
against
country especially India it has happened
and the anger is not controllable now so
please tell you've got an establishment
no mandate for the public I am really
tired of this how many Oscar payn
Commission in the severy in minutes out
of this talk about the hey no business
we also you know that I think you know
at the only thing what you need to keep
on mister I know I know one second
examine Malik you know that that leads
me to the question I was just going to
ask you before I you know I went to
Monique are there what is the follow-up
now this is an extremely incident this
is the deadliest terror attack we saw
there was in recent times in almost two
decades yes everyone commended the
surgical strike sir that happened after
worried but what this steps are you
going to take after this you know what
is there going to be the government
strategy at the end of the day there
should be no politicking today but it's
there's no two ways about it you've
spoken something else in Delhi and you
went to Jammu and Kashmir you would
speak something else because you are in
coalition with the PDP there there's
been no decisive policy you say
University analyst has have let down
this issue
so go ahead mr. Malik what good is going
to be the follow-up steps now in
strategy what happens in local Myanmar
or with the NS in his office or the
house block would not be debated ask us
from the television nor with any other
functionaries barring the top people who
are involved who take action on this and
I believe everybody would appreciate
that fact that it should only remain
with these people not discussed and
deliberated with general public so that
the seriousness of the issue and the
gravity remains there number one number
two nobody has any knowledge an iota bit
of knowledge that probably something
like surgical strikes would happen after
hurry and a lot of questions were asked
from us we kept but we did what we had
put and I can tell you and I can assure
you the place is tiny are we continuing
that with also editing the razor strike
no terrorist attack has happened in
India notice
but how we now are we now prepared a
response we have enough beer are we now
prepared to go into Pakistan and
eliminate houses size and Masood Azhar
that's the big question with all our
political parties including the Congress
and others unite on that then the
question is holistic where terrorism out
of those four things we will be able to
take terrorists out of what the security
are left but yet what's the word and we
are okay before I go back to Monique are
there who obviously wants to come back
in and I'm coming too many card have
some patience as for them are they've of
the Congress issue area what is your
first reaction to this extremely heinous
terror attack that has taken place in
German crush me today will Anita's and
our polity also stand as one condemning
it and asking for retribution it is one
of the most unfortunate instances when
you see so many young soldiers being
mocked in an unprecedented attack
because the last we saw of such severity
was in 2001 and he believed that the
situation had had improved quite
drastically but you see that the ground
you still see the same violence the same
bloodshed and the biggest problem is the
politics of this nation does not see it
is not something that should preclude a
man with common sense from asking why is
this happening everybody is saying that
the Congress is politicizing it you have
your opinions but I don't believe it is
wrong for people this country to say why
is this happening again and again
especially in light of two things the mo
of the mo s of mr. Kiren Rijiju recently
said attacks since Rudy well we've said
close to thirty attacks have happened
we're saying this is systemic failure of
India also to basically fight back with
the sort of aggression and the sort of
of attacks that are happening across the
border the very simple fact remains you
there that irrespective of what you say
about Pakistan our response are always
beats about how you know blood will be
shed their lives will not be lost in me
and how many times have we said it how
many times have we said it have you
taken any decisive action every time you
see every BJP Minister go on and say
how's the Josh it does not matter the
fact of the matter is we have completely
failed in a strong policy on Pakistan to
curb incursion
and to basically keep the ISI and the
Pakistan military in the Pakistan form
funding any sort of agency that is
absolutely an option okay but but
question will be if the guy if we see in
the next seven to ten days decided
strong surgical strike wrong surgical
strike decision to possibly going to
Pakistan will the Congress stand united
with the government because on surgical
strikes you know the Congress was also
disunited there were some who raised
questions on the surgical strike never
Sam who politicized it will we see a
united approach to this problem because
unfortunately you know we see a lot of
comments from PDP Netta's and national
conferences which are unfortunate and i
know that's not the problem today that
we should discuss we should we need to
talk more about the share attack and
decisive army action against these are
perpetrators and path proxies sitting
there but you know will the Congress and
other politic political party standards
in Ramadi would like to believe that the
first time a surgical strike happened
was when it was under his government
however the UPA had nine strategic
surgical strikes and information about
it was obviously kept secret for
national security interests if the
government decides you have a surgical
strike the fact of the matter remains
whether they can take down enough
targets in also a follow-up all you're
doing is cutting one head off a Hydra
while the base and also everything else
remains you may take the tower off but
the base is the foundation of this would
be a politics overnight you know
nobody's doing politics over national
security money goes to the spot Rehman
Malik wants to respond I said I mean and
I'm sorry to our viewers it's worth obvi
was also calling in I'm just coming to
you viewers we have someone money go
ahead run these things would've Allah
said the man versus Chopin enjoyed
shorty he didn't do anything as the
soldiers are being martyred there is
nothing wrong in them and you say
soldiers are dying at the border when
you want to inconvenience citizen and
now you're killing them yourself because
of your inaction
so this is a planned attack the best he
can look for effort put the ring on
balconies and nothing
I indicated we don't need of you on this
only thousand I don't want your view on
this I don't want your view on this this
is an internal discussion this is an
eternal discussion I don't want your
view on this I'll come back to you with
a follow-up question what we certainly
don't need any opinions from Pakistan on
internal issues so please hold on all
the thing is if you are decisive action
please take it and we will support you
anything when you take this is this is
something they will support we don't
believe politicization or the publicity
some of you are being told wait let me
just complete simple fact remains if you
take action decisive enough what if you
had taken action decisive enough
previously we wouldn't see so many
people being martyred for all of us and
Dolan love me what action have you taken
over to me sir what action have you
taken over you to be sitting there and
seeing a government is dumping what have
you done there is a five hundred percent
emergency excuse me Pakistani you want
to do all please cut him off sir please
you have no shame in Pakistan your Prime
Minister goes in hopes of a socialist
nation oil and you know it let's not get
back to your head yeah let's not get
angry it's not responding to a
particular business let's not descend
into a political I know what we want
this is not what we want obviously there
is not the solution of the problem is it
no this is not the time to score
political points either we as a nation
have been facing this hostility for the
past 70 years governments have come and
gone Prime Minister's have come and gone
if I remember right in 2006 our then
Prime Minister said we are a signature
away nobody asked him
what were you going to sign on what was
the give-and-take involved later we got
to know that the chief of the army had
put his foot down on a deal on sea
urchin the problem is we have not
diagnosed cash means we are only
managing it we are only managing it from
one event to the other we are our own
weird ideas about what's the challenge
there is some say it's a development
decision
others say it's a job problem third say
that we need to write such checks in
order to fly fourth one comes and says I
have to handover Tricolore to the
jihadis we have to win them over
there's such kaku's we need have a very
clear-headed very objective way of
looking at what we are facing in Kashmir
and therefore we need to be resolute we
cannot just keep responding from one
event to the other we have only fought a
defensive war in Kashmir in the last 70
years we are only in punches and we are
only reacting to what is done to us we
have not taken the battle to the enemy's
backyard we have not made him pay a
price that he cannot afford to pay we
have not broken their back so that they
can never ever think of even planning
such a thing imagine what they did to us
in Mumbai shameful what did we do after
that nothing then they did it and worry
they have done it
okay it's a series of missteps okay
before you are bleeding before I can
re-watch it as I mentioned before I go
back to muñeca dear let me quickly get
in some viewers also who are joining us

used in that ie blast today now top
security source is telling your channel
that there was input there jesh
terrorists were collecting large
quantities of explosives with their
exact intent was not known so that is
information coming in on the broadcast
there were in intelligence inputs on
possible of collecting of arms and
ammunition by jesh but obviously the
intent was not know let's quickly get in
another viewer calling in from Andhra
Pradesh out of Indra Babu joining us
Ravindra gu it is greening yes up wet so
first of all I would like to sell you by
the presence of the mother India who
made the supreme sacrifice entry for
Mother India
I am pledging them their supreme
sacrifice should not go in vain that we
should give the befitting reply to the
Pakistan and that we want the blood of
Pakistan no doubt it not only we can
specify our country that 134 people of
this country are behind
here is the Prime Minister of India
behind the Indian Army that no doubt at
all you please tell the Pakistani
journalists there they should give they
should suggest their primary red them
come to the direct wall that we will
decide what will happen that we have
already we have already raised it - or
what happened what is the result the
whole world has seen it no doubt at all
they know the example they know they
can't win a war sir they've been
battered by us numerous times that's why
they've resorted to these proxies of
theirs because they obviously have no
faith in their army is it Ravindra Babu
thanks for joining us from Andhra
Pradesh there I'm going to take a very
short break at this point back on the
other side our panel stays with us
welcome back from the break I'm gonna
Pratap Singh you're watching news X
we're getting some breaking news coming
in on the continuous focus on Avanti
pura Prime Minister Narendra Modi is to
chair a cabinet committee meeting on
security at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow this is
the big news coming in this hour Prime
Minister Modi to chair a cabinet
committee meet on security at 9:00 a.m.
tomorrow with the PM are also tweeted
that he had spoken with the Home
Minister and high-level officials this
evening and the fallout of the Avanti
pure terror attack obviously the Prime
Minister and highest levels of
government
looking at the fallout of that incident
and assessing the security situation the
PM to chair that Cabinet Committee meet
on security at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow all
right so we will of course continue to
get you the latest developments coming
in in the fallout of that attack and the
latest inputs from on ground but let me
quickly go back across to Aishwarya
Mahadev of the Congress - well your
mother we've seen water Lee Fujiwara
tweeted earlier but you know these
things don't you feel can be discussed
on day two day three day four after the
attack is it fair on the first day to
play politics in this manner to start a
blame game isn't that unfortunate to
highlight gaping holes in policy while
dealing with this neighbor is not
politicizing rather stating the fact Mr
on Deep Singh Surjewala has strongly
condemned this attack and also you know
dole the believe then I believe that was
absolutely necessary in the Congress
party stands behind him all that however
I don't see any Fault in pointing out
the fact that over the years especially
in Latin fact that you will have mr.
Kiren Rijiju say that nothing has
happened at all but over the years and
more and more Jevons are falling prey to
you know acts such as this and the
government has not been able to
basically move forward and take decisive
action and I don't think there's
anything wrong even in a time like this
to remind the fact that every other day
now that there the death toll is also
rising this is one of the worst attacks
and you have to realize that if there
was decisive action over the years and
I'm not talking about my regime or
anything I come on a plank of basically
having stopping these attacks and you've
been unable to do it
I think rubber monochrome American
rubber money quick intervention then and
then we move on beyond the politics
contribute too much in politics race
yeah right
Fred and I'm very sorry that I will have
to get it the politics of it which I did
not want to get Sherman Shh is not
forgotten and for heaven's sake remember
that Rahul Gandhi was the idiot who was
going and hugging the observed tearing
muscles in Diagon he was the guy sitting
and hugging them why the work of my
thighs with each other on the back over
JaJuan being martyred you let the ISI in
to plot encode serve at the event you
are making this political I told you why
we criticize Prime Minister Modi
don't you dare for my Congress president
in detail because God knows what we
could see about yours you are okay okay
let's say let's not let me no no I do I
don't want to get into this I don't want
to get into this at all remember
okay let's let's practice let's stop
this I will stop this immediately I will
stop this immediately
no more politicking no more politicking
that's why I said earlier it's
unfortunate we can have it on the second
the third day and the fourth day when in
peril a shot and a and what rare lapse
was but not today but 42 giovani 42
Jevons have lost their lives and it
seems that you know all their mothers
their families will be weeping for them
crying they don't want this today's
stories
let's restrain moon you've caused it we
need cause it let me come back across to
Munna car there you were you you started
out you know shedding crocodile tears
and saying what happened was very
unfortunate but I'm feel so pathetic
okay
don't you okay we all do but that's my
follow-up question then will you marry
me one second we need listened to the
first question we listen to the listen
to the whole question Mooney if you feel
so devastated about it and so
unfortunate about it then why don't you
hand over Masood Azhar to us since the
JME has claimed responsibility for this
attack
why don't you stash
forum where you can actually put
pressure on your neighbors to listen to
what address your concerns
I use what a perfectly serviceable
victim you entered a kiosk at least or
you attend a state where I am Donald
Trump is also treated on you cutting off
security but a 50 B shall move up

well our continuous coverage on the
Avanti pora terror attack continues
after this break my thanks to our
panelists for joining us viewers stay

I would say good evening but it isn't
one quickness is the essence of war the
art of war teaches us to rely not on the
likelihood of the enemy's coming but on
our own readiness to receive him that
soon zoo take time to deliberate but
when the time for action is arrived stop
thinking and going that's Napoleon the
wise man does it once what the fool does
finally that's Machiavelli if you make a
snake drink milk you increase its when
its nectar that's Chanakya it is not
enough that we do our best sometimes we
have to do what's required
that's Churchill in 1972 12 members of
the Israeli Olympic team were killed the
Israeli prime minister then authorized
an operation known later as the wrath of
God it went on for twenty years one by
one and Israeli Mossad team hunted down
all the killers one by one they were all
made to pay all over the world after the
Second World War the Israelis hunted
down one by one all the Nazis but even
escaped to South America under fake
names that was the measure of their
resolve in 172 BC the Roman Republic
sent a single man to prevent a war
between the Syrians Seleucid Empire in
Egypt that man Gaius for filius lanús
stood outside Alexandria before
Antiochus who was about to attack it
he drew a circle around him and told him
when you step out of this you had better
back the Syrians withdrew that was the
weight of Rome one man sent an army back
home was the fear of Roman retribution
imagine if 40 American soldiers had just
been butchered today the world would
have shaken but when 40 Indians have
been massacred by a suicidal madman with
a Tata Sumo full of 130 kilograms of
explosives
we are left wearing our important finger
an important range we talk about
measured approaches and not warmongering
some of us should read that to
Chamberlain when he landed back in
Britain waving a paper of a promise from
Hitler who stopped after invading
Czechoslovakia if you are a great power
then the value of the lives of every
Indian citizen has to be at par with the
Romans of all the Roth of India as

said that the the NDA government is
formed in 2019 Shiv Sena Akali Dal and
other major allies will have a role all
of the allies of the NDA are strong in
their statement if you want to have an
alliance with them at the center the CM
in that state should be from that party
so that is a big statement coming from
beach appease Ally Shiv Sena membership
Cena and the BJP have been at
loggerheads with each other for quite
some time and now we have Sanjay rot or
who has now said that in case the Indy
does come to power in 2019 Shiv Sena
Akali and others should have a major
role now all the allies he claims of the
NDA are strong in their states and if
you want to have an alliance with them
at the center the cm should be from that
Ally know this could make of course
things difficult for the BJP as far as
forging alliances ahead of 2019 is
concerned is it the ships in of
posturing before a 2019 trying to show
how strong they are to the BJP but
certainly it is an extremely significant
statement coming from the Sanjay Raut so
he says in case the BJP ends up forming
the government in 2019
then the allies should have a bigger
role she would be she a my colleague
oppose on the phone line on that big
story this is a big statement coming off
Romo Sanjay Raut of Shiv Sena saying not
only or should allies be given an
extremely important role but also that
the Chief Minister of the state should
be from the ally partner well yes and
this has being demand of shells and are
not only December than all the last time
but then they a minister of the state
should be from the ally bottle well
isn't this has being demand of Shenzhen
are not only December then also last
time but then they while they accepted
the way our chief minister was selected
the same around should sana who has been
I mean again are lashing out at me GP
for various topics and coming out and
trying to show that BJP is not the big
Russian sauna who's the big brother it's
now should say now who has come out and
said
that how if 20 a government that spawns
into or 19 then vjp should keep in mind
that the allies should be given their
own our faith should be given their own
position and the position should not be
near any number of seats or any number
of other good things but then it should
be the state head post that means to be
given after saying that they are the Big
Brother in Maharashtra
now the Shiv Sena clearly seems to be
increasing the pressure dropping the
ante on the BJP government which is of
course not trying to woo their allies
and the forge alliances before the 2019
elections well yes sir unless we see
that how there is a strong united
opposition that is are coming around the
NDA and are the party it's a now has
come out and said hey children and Akali
Dal and major allies have a very big
role in India and you know all these
alive need to be given some kind of
position and the position should be the
CM in the state and that should be some
satellite and then only how one can see
that how India grows more and more
stronger in front of united opposition
oh well absolutely obviously do stay
with us let's first listen in to what
Sun shineth had to say then I'll come
back to you I'll ask you by tomorrow sir
of Shiva who he named Mohammed Rafi do
sir K Omega be Rohini receive a party
word acharyas order to knobbler th state
may be dance Ibaka or sabisu topper let
Nicky bath the party Karthik though the
RoboCup on those particles of time Oh
God
right which is of course still with us
on the phone line or just look at the
equation between b2b ownership Salem
ever since you know they've had an
alliance from nineteen eighty nine and
always has been an understanding that
the BJP would end up contesting a larger
number of seats in the Lok Sabha whereas
in assembly ships wayna gets more seats
of course after the Modi wave catapulted
the BJP to the center this entire
equation was disrupted so what does the
Sena want it wants to now regain its a
Big Brother status as far as that
alliance in Maharashtra is concerned
isn't it
so in fact they indicate that by saying
so in fact we all know in the past there
was a time when when all joshi was some
ships another very senior and veteran
leader or was the chief minister of
state of Maharashtra and at that time it
was available within the country so this
is what the same feelings are echoed
this hang around also by Sanjay Raut is
a senior leader and anything trying to
save what Dana wants currently citizens
long the fight between the number of
peace is going on this is not accepted
the greater speeds up inside of BJP is
not accepted by Cigna and now when Tina
has no option or the way they are coming
out and giving a statement they they
want to fight alone is this something to
see ready ready to fight it out alone or
is it just posturing to try and gain
more number of seats as we were
discussing earlier mostly the larger
number of fair has gone to the BJP at
least when we speak of Lok Sabha
so what are they expecting from the BJP
when they say as you claim that even a
50/50 formula isn't acceptable to them
well if you see and talk about Xena here
is it has been time and again try to
maintain that how they are the big
leader and it's only because of them
that we see that we KP is somewhere on
an empire I didn't see it or in country
so somewhere that is what Xena has
always tried to do it and also it is
again a kind of fight that takes place
between regional parties and main
political parties
that is going on the fight ahead of
elections every elections we see you
know the regional versus the lion big
political parties has taken place and
that's what is seen in state of managed
well absolutely other interesting
statement coming up from Sandra outside
after the Shiv Sena said that they will
always be the big brother in Maharashtra
now
Cena says that they should get a larger
chunk off her seat and even the assembly
should be headed by a chief minister
from regional parties including face",True,en,212,0,1

good afternoon you're watching music
Simon ox you pretty me starting this
bulletin with some breaking news
well Rahul Gandhi has once again
sharpened his attack on the RSS this
time he said that the RSS spreads ahead
going a step further Rahul Gandhi said
that RSS spreads hate or through sticks
let's listen in to what Rahul Gandhi had
to say first of all RSS BJP or defeated
of Congress by to give each other
universality
we'll sue Beltran hospital activity or
hum disco - Lita Tom 30 from piadmin
mode but second 30 year and visited me
on the phone line with us on that big
story rather a strong statement are
coming from Rahul Gandhi side he is of
course that of shied away from attacking
where the RSS but this time he seems to
have taken it or not further by saying
that RSS members are a half pant wearing
stick-wielding hate mongers that's right
Congress president Rahul Gandhi today
again launched a scathing attack against
the RSS and he's saying the RSS is an
organization that spreads hatred in the
country in the commune in the you know
amongst the various community so
certainly you know it's not for the very
first time that Congress president is
taking he's talking in that tone and 10
or in past also he's attacked RSS for
having the divisive you know a policy
which really intends to divide divide
the people of the country on religious
lines so certainly today again he has at
at RSS saying that these are the people
who wear half pants and are spreading
hatred in our country and media clearly
looks like the narrative which mr.
Gandhi is trying to sell is that
Congress is a party will believe in
peace and prosperity and love
whereas RSS and BJP are spreading hatred
something which should we have seen mr.
Gandhi say or a repeated various podiums
isn't it mr. Gandhi is trying to sell if
the Congress is a party will believe in
peace and prosperity and love whereas
RSS and BJP are spreading hatred
something which should we have seen mr.
Gandhi say or a repeated various podiums
isn't it that's right in past also our
Gandhi has said that his politics is all
about spreading love and Congress party
is all about you know spreading love
they don't believe in spreading the
politics of hatred and that's something
that today again we saw our Gandhi
reiterating their in Ajmer certainly and
in fact Priyanka Gandhi water after
becoming the general secretary
charge for the eastern region of what's
up - she also said that she wants to do
a different kind of politics - certainly
Congress party overhead is trying to put
across you know their you know idea
about the politics that how they are the
one who really wants to do politics you
know that really that spread love rather
than doing politics that spreads hatred
among various various communities in our
country and that's yeah and it's not
happening for the very first time as
I've told you that's something that has
been happening ever since the NDA
government has come to power Congress
president Rahul Gandhi has been
attacking specifically RSS for spreading
hatred amongst various communities our
country and today when he was there you
know at one of the events say whether he
went in as mayor he again reiterated
what he'd been saying in pass about RSS
and how they are the ones an
organization which is trying to spread
hatred in various communities in our
country all right a little early in
those comments where our Gandhi has just
come in but the faculty called RSS
members half pant wearing hooligans any
reaction coming from the ISIS over the
BJP you know site so far we've not got
any reaction but certainly you know the
kind of statement that has been made by
Congress present it's something that
we'll get some more the other sort of
reaction from BJP and RSS so he's just
made the speech there in arch made and
we expecting BJP and RSS to react or
respond to that treatment of Congress
president we'll have to wait for some
time for them to react or respond you
know express this particular issue
concern to say with us once again
listening to that fresh joy pitch mr.
Gandhi has taken against the RSS
RSS BJP all these return of Congress
party give each other
Nutella tea
whose supercar half-bath painted black
unity or hum they scuttled it Assam
today from the Arad met Bob that second
30 year this is like a fossil far as
Rahul Gandhi's concern he is known now
for his comments against the RSS of
course he'd once even compared them to
Muslim Brotherhood in this time he's
taken a fresh dry bad RSS calling them
half pant wearing stick-wielding
hooligans remains to be seen now what
type of reaction viruses and the PHP
gives to those comments by mr. Gandhi

good morning you're watching you I am
sure the qatari in a dramatic turn of
events pondicherry chief minister neuron
is Swami is protesting outside the
residence of the governor kiran bedi the
protests began yesterday all the cabinet
ministers as well as DMK and Congress
ministers joined the protest with the
Chief Minister sporting a black shirt
and dhoti Chief Minister claims that the
peaceful protest is against kiran vedas
attempt to stall developmental and
welfare schemes by the central
government it also began when he a few
days back decided to turn traffic cop
when she took to streets for the
implementation of her order demanding
all the wheelers two-wheelers users
should helmet now a AIADMK lawmakers
could then be seen smashing helmets
later in a protest while the Chief
Minister is now sitting on a peaceful
Donna or what he claims is interference
by the left hand governor it is believed
that kiran bedi wanted her helmets order
to be implemented instantly but the
Chief Minister wanted it to be
implemented in phases
all right my colleague Mughal and
joining us on the broadcast with more
details
Mughal on this of course is
unprecedented a chief minister sitting
outside
LG's office in her now she has used a
new level a steady from its early
morning because it's very right after
meeting with the cabinet we saw amassing
promised a Christmas to Rostov up and
sitting right outside the rodney was
from Italy is early morning and he has
announced that the people that the
governor should come and leave the
cabinet and ran to speak because things
with him regarding the demands because
it's his minister said that there are
more than 54 file pending before the
lieutenant governor all these files are
related to various interested as the
governor has not sanctioned and he also
said that the action of the ground of
children governor is acting as a very
big hindrance for the welfare of the
king and more importantly we know the
son of the son of the governor and his
chief minister is going for some time
now and many recently also live 11 the
governor lieutenant governor's have has
ordered all the police officials to
wearing order in this mystical city but
on the other hand whereas the chief
minister has said as in from the police
department does the Polish then
awareness awareness campaign for next
few months and only then they are the
other supreme court order on until on
your helmet compulsory should be mayor
should be input so this is the standoff
which has led to bandana now explain
night we have seen League of the chief
minister holding the does not like in
front of the Rodney was and the engines
are no governor to leave out of the
Rodney was but today morning we are
governed leptin governor given lady has
called the central forces and with the
help of the central forces no kiddin
baby has left Rodney was now
she's travel to Chile and for the
holidays she'll be going to Delhi for
tech tradie
right mu : and this sort of power tussle
is not new to Pondicherry is it back in
April 2017 we saw both Narayan Swami and
Kiran Bedi locking horns over what was
then the rice distribution scheme of the
government this of course you know plays
out every second there as far as
Pondicherry is concerned no because we
have seen irrespective of any political
party
almost all the political parties in the
union territory of quantitative demand
that the kiran bedi should be a call
back they are that the identity is
acting as a see a super chief minister
and and and they'll even come and her
way of functioning as authoritarian
Authority so definitely none of the
parties in the union of canary like baby
the way how she functions and how she
handles the opposite and this debug that
she trashes to be recalled from Delhi
and we have even seen the references
from various political parties even went
to the Home Minister and submitted a
memorandum to him regarding calling back
up till then he saw such a kind of
standoff that glad that has been seen in
the union territory between the
treatment and political parties and the
left hand governor and we have seen
whenever a file is being moved from the
Secretary to Raghavan we have seen was
demanding number of file clarifications
from the chief minister from this
interrupted regarding the wealth given
fast kingdom bees are known and not only
done very recently we have seen that if
you have elected and governor taking
inspection in various departments in the
union state over for a military and
that's have attracted in from almost all
these valid military cabinet all right
so power tussle there continues in the
union territory of Puducherry mughal and
appreciate your joining us with all the
details on that story and moving on now
NFI our has been filed against cannot
occur BJP chief BS european are the
leaders in the state in an audio tape
controversy the mla saran an Angora who
was allegedly
rude by the BJP has filed the fi our
remember the Congress radius collision
released a purported audio clip in which
other a PI is allegedly heard trying to
buy a JD s Emily the state BJP chief
denied the allegations admitting that he
had in fact met the MLA concern but the
audio clip was actually doctored now
following the controversy audio clip
release the Karnataka Speaker ordered a
probe into the matter chief minister
kumara Swamy then constituted an SI t to
investigate the audio tape this said
that is quitting the politics
after two days in Hubli made a statement
it is true that shall totem it to me and
had a discussion with him and it is my
eyes and the contents are not true yeah
it is can come what does it mean
partially a sad booty all right my
colleague Jaya Prakash joining us on the
broadcast with more details replicas
while BAC ba has accepted that it's his
voice what he continues to deny is the
fact that the conversation actually took
place he maintains that his voice was in
fact the entire audio clip was doctored
three days of pandemonium in the
Connecticut plea for the clearing of
Finance Bill yesterday around the four
o'clock Sharon gonna the son of the
Jarius MLA from Gore Mitchell has in
fact filed an FA are at the David rule
of police station limits in that fi are
clearly states that how a dutiful
henchman which also included three MLS
freeedom zelda is one and Sharon Rhoda
is the other one and a former journalist
my uncle how they contacted him made
several phone calls before he went and
met Pia Zadora pop up in fact eighty
minute audio clip or was released
yesterday in which of the conversation
are clearly held between Sharon Dora and
the earth in Europe are in which you can
hear how he is being n tired and rupees
spent Rose was offered to deflect off
from the ideas and make his father
resign
even as because he is a trying to work
out our
approachment between the ruling radius
coalition Jay discover coalition and the
BJP the standoff or still continues not
a single hour of business was transacted
in the assembly philosophy defending
this a pandemonium
however Kumaraswamy is very clear that
he wants an aside you prove it to this
entire matter
and yesterday Sarang Sarang Goethe in
fact are filing an fi are trouble mounts
for psy and love to wait
how Home Ministry of complaint and will
later about the Gordon for questioning
on Empire orally or a GP and amid all of
this as you rightly pointed out the
pandemonium in the assembly continues
absolutely no business at all it's been
three days well that's right this entire
systems from the fact that the BJP was
trying to topple the government in fact
for also the Congress and Malays we were
camping in Mumbai on that day when we
were expecting the BJP to go on the
offensive and get these MLS resigned
Kumaraswamy in fact drop the audio bomb
and of this in fact you know divert that
this issue of operation Lotus 2.0
putting the BJP on the back foot
now efforts are all and to see to it
that psy is implicated in this case even
as this dangle MLAs are trying to defeat
the finance bill now today and tomorrow
are the last two days of the assembly
session it remains to be seen whether
this audio gate will still continue to
dominate dominate the atomization or
will Kumaraswamy successfully scrape
through this finance will given the
number game that are at play Jai Prakash
are we expecting the finance bill to be
taken up by the assembly tomorrow is
that something on the agenda
well the BJP has issued a bit and it is
asked all its MLA to be present
yesterday and today yesterday in the
assembly business logs it was mentioned
that the government will move to clear
up the finance bill however it didn't
happen because the BJP resorted to a
Dharma inside assembly well and the
house was adjourned to this morning now
the Congress and JDS partners will again
move to clear the finance bill today but
given the fact that the BJP is not
interested in continuing any kind of
business in the house it all depends on
how the speaker moves to get permanent
will clear and before I let you go Jaya
Prakash what happens to the speaker he
himself is Umbro
the entire controversy No so let's said
he was in fact got on the wrong foot
when he made a very determined how
either they put them and that he is the
bill again McGann dragged into the
entire controversy now the speaker
brought up this issue on Monday after it
was found in the tape that the media T
claimed that it had paid off fifty
crores for speaker to accept the
resignation letter of the front
eliminate the speaker now interesting
honorable
well the BJP is hell-bent on a House
panel global select panel group or a
judicial inquiry the government is very
clear stating that it will go for an SI
Depot jirafa has maintained that Omar is
the accused number one in this because
he laid a trap to get the bsy brigade
into this entire controversy not at all
remains how the speaker will take it
forward but the speaker wants to see to
it that his name is cleared in just 15
days time which is not possible he sits
the Select panel or a judicial inquiry
society around he is the function that
in 15 days time his name will be cleared
another conduit all right Jay appreciate
you joining us with all the details on
that story so rumbles in the Karnataka
Assembly continue remember a finance
bill is most likely to be taken up
tomorrow and that's when Congress and JD
s combined will have to show its might
if it wants why the upcoming storm
shiftingfocus now the Supreme Court is
likely to pronounce its verdict and a
batch of petitions challenging various
notifications including control of
services and power of the
anti-corruption Bureau in the endless
power tussle between Delhi government
and the center the top court had on July
4th last year drawn a line saying that
the LG has no independent
decision-making power and has to act on
the advice of the elected government
now Delhi government told the top stair
that at want to reach petitions to be
heard soon claiming that a stalemate in
administration is all and the Delhi
government in fact wants to move various
schemes for the benefit of the people of
Delhi
all right so the Supreme Court
pronounced its verdict today that could
finally put an end to the ongoing tussle
between the center and the state as far
as Delhi is concerned my colleague
eshwara us on the broadcast with more
details aishwarya when can we expect the
verdict
whether on 10:30 a.m. is what we are
expecting is that you know the bench
will sit and deliver this verdict to
remember on July 4 2018
you know the judgment was passed by the
five-judge bench clearly stating that
the LG and the Vella government has to
work with the collaborative federalism
structure but you know after that on
November 1 2018 last year you know this
particular verdict was reserved you know
the videos with the mediation between
today between the Delhi moment and the
Lebanon governor is that who will be you
know taking up the powers off you know
the the anti-corruption Bureau as well
as the transfers of the bureaucrats and
also you know it remains to be seen that
you know the tussle which was going on
since last four years when the Delhi
government came into the power when
there was in a jeep Jeong as the left
hand governor and also his procedure and
it'll be a little burial now you know
that the person of the power between
these two question now it is to be seen
that what are you know verdict the
supreme court will deliver on the power
tussle between these two all right so
that of course is going to put to rest
all the ongoing confrontation as far as
you know central government and Delhi
government is concerned in Delhi
we are expecting that worded to come out
today at about 10:30 but quickly run us
through the history of this tussle
you know we saw in July last year a
historic verdict aishwarya where the
court said that both the central
government and the state government in
Delhi will have to work in tandem they
cannot work independently for the
benefit of the people
oh well that's right you know the coach
really stated that you know both the
powers have to work interdependence to
each other he has to you know to be the
advice to be the superior and and has to
you know work in tandem with the
ministers with the state ministers of
the Delhi government and buthey both the
you know powers have to work hand in
hand and also you know the Supreme Court
laid down some very important measures
you know the left hand governor will
have only the powers Israel regarding
the land you know the land and the state
and the Polish so clearly you know these
three were the independent parts that
were given to the LG other than that all
the powers were shifted to the to the
unitary government but now the bench of
you know the bunch of petitions that was
now you know went into the Supreme Court
in the Supreme Court later on on
November 1 reserves its order and today
the delegatee the Supreme Court will
deliver his verdict what esle many of
the things you know which were intending
will be today clarified between these
two and it has to be seen that what that
you know who will ultimately lead the
power of Delhi all right of course that
crucial decision will come out from the
Supreme Court today aishwarya stay with
us we will get you back on the broad in
just a bit but breaking news coming in a
fire has broken out
my tenders are on the spot that the
first call to fire station was made 7:10
this morning which is about one hour
back Fire Department says it's a medium
class fire 25 tenders as I mentioned
have been rushed to the spot the fire
has not been doused just as yet all
right my colleague Aishwarya is standing
by with more details of that fire
Aishwarya
oh well that's right you know a massive
fire broke out it in arena area in a
factory you know the initial reports
have suggested that the first call to
the fire station was made at around 7:00
it's a median class fire that's been you
know confirmed by the fire station
officials to us more than 25 tenders
have been rushed to the spot there have
been no case that has been reported yet
yeah but also it has been said that you
know still you know the rescue operation
is underway there must be some you know
a specifier you know the officers it has
been cleared that you know that you know
the search operation is still underway
the rescue operation you know which
which the fire officers along with the
team of NDRF is at the spot and they are
searching that no one is there but on
the fourth floor which we are on the
only second floor but after we have been
told that the fire is still still on and
it has not been done
that's very very dramatic visuals on our
screens of smoke billowing from the
factory very dramatic visuals coming in
there this comes just a day after a
massive fire broke out in Delhi now a
second consecutive day we're seeing
another fire that is broken out give us
a sense of whether there any people were
trapped inside the factory are there any
reports coming in of people being
rescued were there any people are told
in the factory when the fire broke out
well that's that's right as you can see
individuals is the second floor from a
window where the fire is coming out and
it's been clearly told to fire to the to
us by the fire officials that no
confirmation of any casualty yet but yes
this work three walls operational and
there there could be someone who could
be trapped inside after only after this
fire will become treat adult of the NDRF
teams and the fire officers will go
inside and search you know about anyone
who could be trapped inside but still at
this point of time there has been no
reports of fire officials cannot confirm
to us about any of the coach rarity or
the injured people but yes the fire is
still on and the fire officers are
trying to those of the fire as soon as
possible hmm all right so no fixed
number as far as casualty is concerned
but we're given to understand that the
fire started early this morning the fire
department was called 7 o clock
Aishwarya that's that's what he'd be
learning at this point and the fire
broke out in the second floor of the
building that's right it has to be seen
that you know how much delay you know
the fire the first call to the the fire
unit station was made just because what
we have seen in the recent you know fire
that was - that took place at the
caroule by the hotel and pit Belen broke
out it around 2 a.m. and then you know
after 2 hours the fire the first call
was made to the fire unit stationed and
till that time the fire had took a major
you know a major face and later on you
know it was very difficult for the fire
officials to those of the fire now in
this case it has to be seen that how
much delay the the call was made and how
big the fire is this is to be seen in
the investigation later on but you know
in you know in these kind of scenarios
you know the D code should be made as
early as possible just because the
people who are there you know they try
to those of the fire provide themselves
but as for the fire officers they have
been clearly stated that at around 7:10
a.m. this call was made now it is to be
seen in this investigation that how that
at what time the fire
and and and and in how many and and how
much time the first call was made yes
there are more than 25 tenders have
already rushed to the spot that means
the fire is massive but you know as per
the fire officers it has been clearly to
loose a middle class fire but you know
the factory was operational is the
bigger you know the bigger you know in
query and also you know the if anyone
could be trapped inside that's also a
bigger question to be seen in the
investigation later on all right so the
fire it is telling us that it's a Class
C fire a middle class fire which is a
Class C fire in the terminology as far
as the fire department is concerned
Aishwarya I also want to get a sense
from you you know for the benefit of
those who are tuning in right now what
time did the fire start we're talking
about a fire that is broken out in the
visuals on your screens the telling
visuals on your screens of fire
billowing from the factory there 20 fire
tenders have been rushed to the spot my
colleague Aishwarya continue that story
25 tenders as I told you have been
rushed to the spot at this point no
numbers coming out as far as casualties
concerned but as well give us a sense of
what is the rescue operation looking
like at this point
but as we can clearly see in this
visuals you know this is the second
floor where the fire fire it's currently
at and you know this is a place in
Ariana you know this area we have been
told is the place where a lot of
factories are in and around and you know
there have been a see plans that was
also put up on the ground floor as well
as there on the top floor you know 20 or
more fire tenders have been rushed to
the spot in the RF teams are at the spot
the biggest worry
in this particular case is that this for
this particular factory was operational
and you know the fear the the workers of
this factory could have been inside in
this factory now you know if anyone is
inside or is being trapped is the bigger
you know before all those you know
officers and the rescue team of NDRF - -
as soon as cows of this fire and - you
know rescue those people if they're if
they could be inside but still the fire
officers at this point of time has is
not willing to confirm to us any of the
equation LT but you know the initial
call that was made to the fire officers
that has been clearly said that you know
still at this point of time no casualty
has been reported after the after the
fire will be doused off only at that
particular time the investigation
officers or the NDRF teams can confirm
us the actual positioning and the actual
situation of this particular fire and
Aishwarya just - we trade the fire
started early this morning it started
from the second floor of the building
well that's right you know and as we can
see clearly in these visuals you know
there have been nearby factories as well
this is this is an area which is a
little area in Ariana and you know the
fire started in the vias what 40 fire
officers have confirmed how much delay
the first call was the fire broke out is
again the part of the investigation but
the fire officials confirmed us that
it's at around 7:10 a.m. when the first
call was made to the fire station after
which you you know as soon as possible
the the nearby fire from the nearby fire
stations 20 or more fire tenders have
been rushed to this spot the rescue
operation is still under way but
currently the fire is still on at the
second floor of this particular factory
the factory was operational that's also
the information that we are getting you
know now the biggest worry for the Opera
for the rescue team says that you know
if anyone could be trapped inside and
and they could rescue them as soon as
possible just because the factory was
operational and there were some some
plastics and also the the the previous
sheet that was put up on the second
floor that's all to the information that
is just coming in so because of that you
know the fire started and you know the
engulfed the entire second floor of this
particular building the the first and
the the first in the major
Europe part of this rescue operation and
the NDRF teams and the fire you know
officials will be those of the fire and
to know the D pertaining reason of why
this fire broke out as I was telling our
viewers on your screens of the fire that
is correct on the second floor of the
building remember it's a paper card
factory the information the preliminary
information we have with us is that the
factory was operational when the fire
but no information with respect to
casualty is out just as yet but very
very dramatic visuals on your screens of
a fire that is broken out in a
multi-story factory in Arana
20 fire tenders have been rushed to the
spot
we are tracking that story very very
closely but no information remember
coming out of any casualty just as yet
and we will of course keep tracking that
story very very closely after this very

alright on to a story that we've been
tracking here since last huh
I broke out at a paper Factory in
Delhi's now I know 20 fire tenders have
been rushed to the sport joining me on
the broadcast now I'm saying fire
officer who has been attending to fire
us thank you for speaking to news X I
want to understand from you how big is
the fire can you give us a sense of how
many people are trapped inside and me is
the fire going to be doused
all right we will get Singh back on the
broadcast in just a bit
but remember that massive fire broke out
in a multi-story factory in Iran aware
25 tenders have too distraught they have
been pressed into action were given to
understand that no casualty has been
reported so far but the visuals they're
very very dramatic visuals of smoke and
fire bellowing from the second and the
third floor of the building also
remember the factory was operational
when the fire broke out the entire
building is a place and it is in fact a
paper card factory it was working it was
operational fully functional when the
fire broke out early this morning fire
reached the building at about 7 o'clock
and the fire is still on it has not been
doused the entire bill is and those
visuals of course on your screens
telling a very horrific tale
remember according to fire department
this is a Class C fire no casualty as I
said has been reported so the fire is
not yet known
we've been tracking the story very very
closely and those visuals of course on
your screens of the factory which is
currently on fire the fire has not been
doused it's been more than an hour and a
half since the fire started fire tenders
reached the fire building the building
that's on fire but the fire has not been
doused and those are live visuals very
very dramatic live visuals coming on
your screens at this point in time from
Nahanni where a building is on fire 20
fire tenders are currently attending to
that fire but the building is still on
fire it's been 1 and a half hours since
the fire tenders reached the spot
remember that of course is a paper card
factory which fire as we speak the fire
department was called in at about seven
o'clock this morning we are of course
tracking all the details of that fire
and very very dramatic visuals they're
coming in from the National Capitol this
morning
all right we're getting those visuals to
you from nirvana at this point where the
building is on fire a paper card factory
which was operational when the fire
started this morning fire tenders were
called in at about 7 o clock they are
trying to douse the fire they haven't
been successful so far and the fire of
course started on the third floor and as
you hear screams the smoke billowing
from the third and the fourth floor of
that paper card Factory
my colleague Aishwarya join joining us
on the broadcast with the latest
aishwarya any numbers coming in as far
as casualties concerned any information
coming in as far as casualties concerned
no no one I think in terms of casualties
you know at around 6:00 a.m. in the
morning and the first call was later
made at home 7:10 a.m. to the fire
station just nearby Narayana industry
Arab decor to know that this is this
factory is located in the still area and
there are no factories nearby this place
and indeed it's now becoming both of the
particular area and congested the
factories are you know there in this
particular industrial area but still
nothing has been terroristic as will it
concerned in this particular incident
you know as you pointed out this is an
industrial area the fire has not been
doused but have the fire is the fire
department now successful in containing
the fire is that something that we can
report at this point oh well there have
been 20 or more 20 now the fire tenders
which are elsewhere spot the rescue the
NDRF rescue teams are also at this spot
the Reaper has involved the entire
second floor the trouble for the Poli
rescue for the NDRF team the d-pad
officers are that you know there are
industries which are also the factories
which are also just next to these this
particular factory which caught fire
and the trouble is that you know if if
the if the fire reaches out to the other
buildings as well just near this
particular factory now you know and so
that it will take a massive you know a
massive pace so clearly now just for
pointed 2005 at the second floor and
later on speaking still go inside for
the search operation there have been no
reports so far no office no
chiropractors is willing to talk to us
regarding heat casualty just because now
- body part of it does is mm fire and
you can breathe faster I think it has
guilty or if there is anyone trapped
inside this particular Factory
alright so the first attempt of the fire
department will be to ensure that the
fire is contained in that factory does
not spread to our other factories in and
around the area and then of course -
does the fire entirely completely we've
not been able to ascertain whether there
any people trapped in that building but
it's important to point out a shredder
that the factory was operational then
that fire started you know
all right we seem to have some trouble
with that line there but we get a
shorter back in just a bit
buts quickly listening to some reactions
that have come in of the site greeting

all right there you heard from the
manager of the company emerge eat sing
of course talked about the fact that
many employees tried to douse the fire
when the fire could not be doused the
fire department was called in at about 7
o clock
it appears that people have safely moved
out from that statement Aishwarya the
manager of that factory says that they
tried to douse the fire but since they
were unsuccessful Fire Department was
called in which was located 4 a.m. until
when you know the fire took a massive
you know massive piece and also the
entire Odin follow and girl fire of
clearly has mentioned that whenever
that's why I take place you know the
first thing for those people is to call
the file station and not 2000 they're on
their own you know the same incident
happened this time as well in this
factory yes the workers wanted to those
of the fire by themselves but later on
was unsuccessful and the fire watch Hall
fire station was called after one hour
until the time the fire you know the
enter fire engulfed the entire second
floor of this particular factory now you
know according to the statement of this
particular manager of this company
it is it has been seen that you know
whether all were inside this factory
moved out successfully or not after the
search operation by the Indian teams it
will be only stuff you know it can be
only confirm at this particular time you

this because rushing to this spot 2005
as soon as possible for the benefit of
our viewers Aishwarya are very very
important to point out we just heard
from the manager of the factory he said
that number of employees tried to douse

of Amarjeet Singh the manager of the
factory we heard him just a short while
back he particularly mentioned that the
owners along with all the other
employees tried to douse the fire when
the fire started with the pie quickly
spread to second and the third floor as
a result of which fire department was
called in at about seven o'clock and the

welcome back you're watching news X I'm
Shwetha Qatari big breaking news coming
in at the top of the broadcast
prepetition samajwadi party may enter
into a collision with the Congress so
say that Priyanka Gandhi will be
announcing this today all right it
appears that chef Paul Yadav led
Pragathi she'll samajwadi party may
enter into a collision window with the
Congress party for 2019 Lok Sabha polls
the announcement is expected to be made
today
my colleague Barnett Gupta podcast with
more details one let's take it away you
know the other was already in touch with
Congress party and we each other's
actions many tea party and now what we
are learning from our team then after we
see that at this particular line so
definitely help Congress also as well as
the PSP you'll also that is then taken
you know me on the area of Western
interpretations and we apparently are
you know looking after for Congress
party and this because she also has an
experience Paul Weston of the potato
also because he was the person to you
know gather to galvanize the party
workers also in the western part of the
position of Samajwadi Party his past and
he has a lot of experience you know what
Martha the part has also definitely this
really came in it to the Congress party
in men who eat our you know on which
Congress and burn it until now it was
reported that you know schifflet yada
may have pro BJP perception there was a
perception that chappal Yadav the
estranged uncle of Akhilesh Yadav is Pro
BJP and that's the reason why Congress
party was staying away from him
yeah perceptions there are false views
that that we are you know think that he
is inclined to make shafa'a doesn't
trying to elected what we are learning
is that now running ads with the
Congress party and this will be kind of
a joke if you keep you also the case
that if he is going with you know the
Congress pocket indefinitely Congress
party will try and paint into the both
bank of
which is also the major part of you okay
and how many seats are we looking to go
to ship all the other if at all you know
this announcement has made what sources
of course are telling us that the
announcement will be made today how many
sheets will come will come in Kitty of
ship Bali others well I believe that she
will be asked in nothing less than five
or six weeks because the region of the
doors are because what we are learning
is that she will be resting Rose about
so not bound so these are the kind of
sweets on which he will be you know like
candidates the Congress party but the
position will be cleared after the press
conference shortly because these are
just speculations and we are still
waiting for an official from the
competency
okay and when can we expect that
official word to come in well I guess by
the evening we are learning doctor you
know I walk around will be talking much
about campaigning which she has already
started her walk which she has already
started and also by the evening she'll
be a press conference and repeat that in
that Petrobras conference only she'll
also announced this particular alliance
with the presentations of majority party
yeah okay and this of course means that
the Congress party will let go of at
least five to four seats you know this
goes against what the Congress party
announced earlier that they will be
continued laity seeds
well that is still remain to this in
that what will be the symbol because you
know passing the others the party has
already bought the symbol now the party
symbol is a key so we have to see that
on which symbol the candidates of will
for the elections of 2019 still village
so still the picture is not that mascara
but waiting for an official and this of
course is a boost to the Congress party
isn't at Varna the head of 2019 so an
affirmation of the fact that you know
regional parties small parties although
like that of you know poverty shield
Samajwadi Party are okay or are happy to
ally with the colonies in the past also
that already you know what the smaller
parties to get in touch with the complex
party and now we are seeing that you
know the other was already approaching
now the army also and now here the
worker definitely their negotiations are
done they have signed a pact also and
now we see an official announcement of
this very soon and this of course will
give some sort of moral boost to the
Congress party if not electoral well
basically it will help appreciate some
of the content is as you know that this
is a very new party and they will be you
know they will be needing a help of any
if they are getting any any kind of
cells from the National Party then
definitely the chances are much higher
now and you know they occur on the water
will also get an experience also a ship
passing the other which is very
important because we ship all has an
experience of more than twenty years you
know walking you know fighting
relationships for
so majority party and you know working
for the for the Carter how the card it
has to work how they are the champion so
he is having a very good experience in
the western part of the population and
as for the petitioners well and you know
the Congress party has to prepare for
the Legislative Assembly elections which
is going to be happen in 2022 has
already set by Rahul Gandhi so they will
be needing this experience and you know
Parramatta water as we know that she's
really new but if she'll get in help
from chappal together than the Hindu
magic in this 3019 general election and
2019 as villas 2022 assembly elections

and despite the CAG report claiming that
the NDA deal was 2.86 percent cheaper a
political storm continues over the ref
aisle with opposition escalating their
attack on the Modi government this
despite the IAF also repeatedly
confirming that they are completely
satisfied with both the aircraft and the
negotiations now that the Congress has
questioned what the SC verdict and the
CAG report will they do the same with
the Indian Air Force
a CIT report that does not mention this
document that does not mention the
dissent that the negotiating team itself
made on price on timing I don't think
it's worth the paper
this was Rahul Gandhi's response to
today's CAG report after believe the
clean sheet provided by the Supreme
Court Rahul did not believe this report
either in a detailed interview two
musics the eastern air command chief
looted for both Rafael aircraft and the
deal he's not the first high F voice to
back row file all you do an emergency
purchase when your squad numbers are
coming down and so we did an emergency
purchase it is like a booster dose 400
like a booster goes to the if' whose
numbers are coming now this is a
government-to-government deal and it was
between two sovereign nations July
something which was not possible to be
realized way back in 2008 so therefore
it was a much better deal and we really
require these aircraft they're critical
to our s most ask the IAF is fully
satisfied with how the negotiations
ended and with what we are getting in
this particular file aircraft for
comment so the question now is will the
authenticity of the IAF the questions to
your report musics and shiftingfocus now

completely engulfed by the body fire and
it's still you know the fire has been
not being doused off the fire tenders
have been rushed to the spot the NDRF
teams are at the spot and also now you
know it has to be seen that how much
time it will move take - you know - to
these fire officers to those of the fire
but as you can see clearly as we have
been people told that you know there
have been no one who works in the night
shift over here but and and as he as a
manager also pointed out that you know
the workers initially tried to douse off
fire by themselves but but they were
unsuccessful later on the call was made
to the fire or fire officers and the
fire tenders have been rushed to the
spot now it has been said he fire
officers have been rushed to the spot
but really as you can see in the visual
the fire has not been doused off it has
been also said that there have been
chemicals which were used you know which
we use to you know make the greeting
cards for the printing machines as for
the purposes and that was the reason
the chemicals caught fire and there's a
fire 213 massive you know massive phase

has been reported we can confirm to our
viewers that at this point of time there
has been nothing that towards that any
worker has been trapped inside or not
but till the time the fire will not
completely round off nothing can be said
just because after that gain they are a
team will go inside this building to
search to search for any of the or idea
of the credibility if you would like to
like to go ahead and I would like to you
know try to talk to someone from the
fire department you know over here

have been fire officers that have been
clearly working out there they are not
willing to talk to us about the fire
department and the members continue can
I request you to get in a reaction from
the locals in fact were standing by if
they can give us a sense of the fire how
massive the fire resistance how long
it's been continuing let fire department
do its work please speak to a few people
around you get a reaction from the
people around you give us a sense of how
massive the fire is how many flows are
caught in the fire and since how long it
has been ablaze

barricaded just because they're just
being said you know by the police
department also that no one can you know
come between you know the fire
department officials should do their
work just because they are now trying to
those of this possible
I have been joined by three of the
locals over here that's me hey uh
paramedics at a kiosk fuzzy factory they

came in and works in the nearby
factories too from this particular place
but they are not willing to you know as
by the fire officers that yes which were

and you know you know if I can tell my
camera person to hold the the right side
of this particular building where you
can see the entire right side of this

earlier on which was which is now as we
can see in the windows off backed up but
on the left side of this building there
is being still on the second floor the
fire is still on and the fire officials
are trying to doors of the Pirates soon
as possible all right so the efforts to
douse the fire are on we are given to
understand twenty fire tenders have been
rushed to the spot also remember no
figures out as to whether there is any
casualty in that fire but very very
telling and dramatic visuals on your
screen bellowing from that building
those live visuals of course coming in
even as Fire Department is trying to
douse that fire also Aishwarya give us
sense of whether there was a delay you
know between the accident and the
incident actually happened when the fire
actually started and by the time the
fire department was called in the fire
department of course was called in at
about 7 o clock but the locals are
telling us that the fire started at
about 6 o'clock in the morning we heard
the manager of the building there he
said that they actually tried to douse
the fire themselves the employees and
the administration tried to douse the
fire and then they could not douse the
fire that's when they called the fire
department
well very very important point here you
know and we have seen this just
shouldn't not in this particular
incident but also in other incidents as
well that you know the locals try to
doll of the fire by themselves and when
they are when they become unsuccessful
off for dosing off later on they call
the fire station till that time you know
the fire takes a massive phase in this
particular incident also it has been
told that the fire took place at around
6:00 a.m. in the morning the first call
that come to us is what they got at
around 7 10 for at least one hour in 10
minutes the fire officers you know for
at least one are 10 minutes see the call
was not made after the the fire broke
out and later on you know the fire
tenders rushed to the spot to to douse
of this fire here we can see now the the

At least 20 fire tenders were present at the spot as the ...,2019-02-14T03:18:36Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/al8oLc8PrqY/hqdefault.jpg,"first call to fire station was made at
about 710 this morning which is about
one hour back Fire Department says it's
a medium class fire 25 tenders as I
mentioned have been rushed to the spot
the fire has not been doused just as yet
all right my colleague Aishwarya is
standing by with more details of that
fire Aishwarya
oh well that's right you know a massive
fire broke out at dinner and I area in a
factory you know the initial reports
have suggested that the first call to
the fire station was made at around 7:10
a.m. it's a median class fire that's
been you know confirmed by the fire
station officers to us are more than 20
fire tenders have been rushed to the
spot there have been no casualty that
has been reported yet yeah but also it
has been said that you know still you
know the the rescue operation is to us
are more than 20 fire tenders have been
rushed to the spot there have been no
casualty that has been reported yet yeah
but also it has been said that you know
still you know the the rescue operation
is underway there must be some you know
a specifier you know officers it has
been cleared that you know that you know
the search operation is still underway
the rescue operation you know which
which the fire officers along with the
team of NDRF is at the spot and they're
searching that no one is there but on
the fourth floor which were on the only
second floor but after we have been told
that the fire is still still on and it
has not been done
that's very very dramatic visuals on our
screens of smoke billowing from the
factory very dramatic visuals coming in
there this comes just a day after a
massive fire broke out in Delhi
now a second consecutive day we're
seeing another fire that is broken out
give us a sense of whether there any
people who were trapped inside the
factory are there any reports coming in
of people being rescued were there any
people are told in the factory when the
fire broke out
well that's that's right as you can see
individuals is the second floor from a
window where the fire is coming out and
it's been clearly told to fire to D to
us by the fire officers that no
confirmation of any casualty yet but yes
this luxury vault operational and there
there could be someone who could be
trapped inside after only after this
fire will be completely adult of the
NDRF beams and the fire officials will
go inside and search you know about
anyone who could be trapped inside but
still at this point of time there has
been no reports of casualty
fire officials cannot confirm to us
about any of the coach charity or the
injured people but yes the fire is still
on and the fire officers are trying to
those of the fire as soon as possible
hmm all right so no fixed number as far
as casualty is concerned but we're given
to understand that the fire started
early this morning the fire department
was called in at about seven o clock
Aishwarya that's that's what he'd be
learning at this point and the fire
broke out in the second floor of the
building
well that's right it has to be seen that
you know how much delay you know the
fire the first call to the fire of the
fire unit station was made just because
what we have seen in the recent you know
file that was took that took place at
the coal bag hotel and pit palace that
you know the fire broke out at around
2:00 a.m. and then you know after two
hours the fire the first call was made
to the fire
you know station and till that time the
fire had took a major you know a major
face and later on you know it was very
difficult for the fire officials to
douse of the fire now in this case it
has to be seen that how much delay the
the call was made and how big the fire
is this is to be seen in the
investigation later on but you know in
you know in these kind of scenarios you
know the call should be made as early as
possible just because the people who are
there you know they tried to those of
the fire provide themselves but after
the fire officers they feel clearly
stated that at around 7:10 a.m. this
call was made now just to be seen in
this investigation that how that at what
time the fire broke out and it and and
and in how many and how much time the
first call was made
yes more than 25 tenders have already
rushed to the spot that means the fire
is massive but you know as per the fire
offices it has been clearly told it's a
middle-class fire but you know the
factory was operational is the bigger
you know bigger you know in query and
also you know the if anyone could be
trapped inside that's also a bigger
question to be seen in the investigation
later on all right so the fire
department is telling us that it's a
Class C fire a middle-class fire which
is a Class C fire in the terminology as
far as the fire department is concerned
as well I also want to want to get a
sense from you you know for the benefit
of those who are tuning in right now
what time did the fire start we're
talking about a fire that is broken out
in now I know the visuals on your
screens the telling visuals on your
screens of fire billowing from the
factory there 20 fire tenders have been
rushed to the spot my colleague
Aishwarya
continues to track that story 25 tenders
as I told you have been rushed to the
spot at this point no numbers coming out
for as casualties concerned but as well
give us a sense of what is the rescue
operation looking like at this point you
can clearly see in this visuals you know
this is the second floor where the fire
fire is currently at and you know this
is a place in Ariana you know this area
we have been told is the place where a
lot of factories are in and around and
you know there have been a see plans
that was also put up on the ground floor
as well as on the top floor you know
twenty or more fire tenders have been
rushed to the spot in the RF teams are
at the spot the biggest worry
in this particular case is that this for
this particular factory was operational
and you know the pier the the workers of
this factory could have been inside in
this factory now you know if anyone is
inside or is being trapped is the bigger
you know Hawaii for all those you know
officers and the rescue team of India
are f-22 as soon as those of this fire
and - you know rescue those people if
there if they could be inside but still
the fire officials at this point of time
has is not willing to confirm to us any
of the equation LT but you know the
initial call that was made to the fire
officers that has been clearly said that
you know still at this point of time no
casualty has been reported after the
amplifier will be doused off only at
that particular time the investigation
officers or the NDRF teams can confirm
us the actual positioning and the actual
situation of this particular fire and
Aishwarya just - we trade the fire
started early this morning it started
from the second floor of the building
well that's right you know and as we can
see clearly in these visuals you know
there have been nearby factories as well
this is this is an area which is an
industrial area in Narayana and a you
know the fire started in the vias what
forty fire officers have confirmed how
much delay the first call was after the
fire broke out is again the part of the
investigation but the fire officials
confirmed us that it's at around 7:10
a.m. when the first call was made to the
fire station after which you know as
soon as possible the the nearby fire
from the nearby fire stations 20 or more
fire tenders have been dressed to this
spot the rescue operation is still under
way but currently the fire is still on
at the second floor of this particular
factory the factory was operational
that's also the information that we are
getting you know now the biggest worry
for the Opera for the rescue team says
that you know if anyone could be trapped
inside and and they could rescue them as
soon as possible just because the
factory was operational and there were
some some plastics and also the the the
previous sheet that was put up on the
second floor that told you the
information that is just coming in so
because of that you know the fire
started and you know the engulf the
entire second floor of this particular
building you know now the the first and
the the first in the major you know part
of this rescue operation and the NDRF
came and the fire
you know officials will be those of the
fire and to know the the pertaining
reason of why this fire broke out as I
was telling our viewers on your screens
of the fire that is currently raging on
on the second floor of the building
remember it's a paper card factory the
information the preliminary information
we have with us is that the factory was
operational when the fire broke out no
information with respect to casualty is
out just as yet but very very dramatic
visuals on your screens of a fire that
has broken out in a multi-story factory
in Rana 20 fire tenders have been rushed
to the spot
we are tracking that story very very
closely but no information remember

Prime Minister moody again very
interesting problem Singh in Parliament
has made a very strange statement that
he wishes Prime Minister Modi to be the
Prime Minister once again in 2019 and
Ram Singh has chosen to praise Prime
Minister Modi on the floor of the House
in Lok Sabha and says that Modi should
once again get the mandate in 2019
saying that would he gets work done
quickly now that's very interesting as I
said given that of course his son who's
the president of samajwadi party has
pretty much been at the forefront of the
anti-bjp ante moody blocker for 2019 now
so as I said a very interesting and a
extremely significant set of commentary
coming in from balancing yadah where
he's pitched for Prime Minister Modi to
once again get the mandate in 2019
become the prime minister for the second
time and he says the reason for that is
that he's worked for everyone's welfare
and what's most conspicuous is Lam Singh
Yadav said this when Sonia Gandhi was
actually sitting next to him okay I want
to get him punished Pandey for more on
this Rajesh what exactly did Milan Singh
Yadav said did he actually praise the
Prime Minister was Sonia Gandhi actually
sitting there when this committee was
being done well absolutely you know what
I'm saying other said that you know that
premise and that in moody has never said
no to any of his voice and he went on to
say that mr. Prime Minister I hope that
next time also you come as a prime
minister this must have riled
Congress president Sonia Gandhi to no
end and it must have also embarrassed
Mohammed and then in which his son is
trouble leading players at this
particular remark by by former SP so
provable I'm singing other must have you
know been music to the years of the BJP
and who was logged as the discomfiture
of the former congressman so irani and
also a Europe of cause major
embarrassment for each other
absolutely I mean you know if this is
the exact wording of verbal I'm singing
other I wonder why he said what he did
because you write equations his son is
pretty much at the forefront of bridging
and putting together that anti-bjp block
now how will SP defend this well I think
I think of English a shadow must've
extremely embarrassed by this DiMarco
for or for his father
Malaya together because I remember in
the most crucial state of Uttar Pradesh
his son is the one who you know forming
a one of the most formidable challenge
as far as the BGP is concerned in 2019
and when his father makes this kind of
remark that it is that here but Narendra
Modi returns as the prime minister of
this country it's it's it must have been
extremely embarrassing as far as I was
concerned and and you know the fact is
is this a precursor to whole there may
be serious
pure division of opinion within the SP
itself and is that something that's
gonna have an electoral impact for the
BJP much of an electoral impact as far
as a server dish is concerned because
you know one thing we have to keep in
mind is that actually another right now
is the Supreme Leader as far as
samajwadi party is concerned we have
seen you know what happened to his uncle
xu pali other was called the nuts and
bolts man of samajwadi party but he went
alone and he tried to chart a separate
course you know he was made to by death
so I think as we speak now logically
shadow is the most formidable leader the
undisputed leader of the Samajwadi Party
and this particular remark other than
embarrassing ugly shadow and also being
used by the BJP to rile him more will
not serve any more purpose okay but you
know which brings me to us that is there
going to be a justification and
explanation coming on from Samajwadi
Party on this looks like because I think
I mean BJP as a political party would
definitely use this statement which has
been made by by Melanson other so needle
the Samajwadi Party and I think a very
soon will get to know get to hear our
justification of why Milan said what he
said and you know we've got to play off
that soundbite of Lansing in in just a
bit but British what are your sources in
the BJP is saying I'm so they must be
equally stunned
I mean your resolve and belong together
with this statement there are many
dimensions who had a smile on their face
because you know there's this particular
statement when I'm aligning with Sonia
Ali was seated right next to him and and
you know with her seated right next to
him also the fact that a gentleman sir
opposition is coming up with one big
rally you know this particular statement
wouldn't have been more real time if for
the opposition if I may say so as far as
no lancing other is concerned and the
BJP these hippie leaders when the BJP
MPs were extremely happy at this turn of
illness they must most certainly have
every reason to be the Treasury benches
have a reason to smile we're gonna play
off that soundbite in just a bit but you
know British let me ask you this that
you know specifically he spoke about the
welfare schemes and that has pretty much
been at the center of what the BJP and
the Prime Minister have said time and
again how history or you know the
hallmark has been the increase in the
welfare schemes also that you know when
you are ceiling politician as he's and
Elma Lansing other who have seen far the
most turbulent time and made a mark for
himself in the topsy-turvy land officer
position Oh for him to make a statement
when his own son is you know stitching
all the most formidable alliance in
Uttar Pradesh irrespective of how he
wants to you know praise Prime Minister
Narendra Modi his statement must not
have caused considerable embarrassment
as far as at least other is concerned
and he would have hoped that this is one
statement which his father would have
avoided at all and what is most
interesting is disease where it says
that p.m. combat Hydra Nakata ok p.m.
Ness sub Cossack liquor szeliga koshish
Kia and that has been one of the biggest
critiques that has come in from the
opposition how the BJP and how the Prime
Minister has you know played divisive
politics that's hot at the heart of what
the maja got Mandans allegations are
absolutely if you remember you know I
mean this particular statement coming
daily 24 when alkylation other was
denied permission by BJP government to
fly to Allahabad and go to heal our the
university where you know the
swearing-in of the new student union was
concerned and in the entire Samajwadi
Party are took to street protesting
against what they call
tutorial behavior of the BJP his father
you know in Parliament on the last day
of the budget session praising mr. Nair
in the movie and saying that he takes
everybody along with them I was myself
when one of the most ill-timed statement
ever by any poll for any politician oh
yes most certainly this is obviously
going to mean a lot of embarrassment for
the Samajwadi Party and not just SP this
impacts BSP as well because you know
there is going to be a lot of explaining
that has to be done by the entire
opposition plank because when I am
saying either you're right is one of the
most seasoned politicians in the
opposition camp for him to be making
this statement at the you know at the
last day of the budget session last
session sitting off this Lok Sabha sends
out serious and many ramifications and
then I think I mean you know someone was
about VSC about the watch party also
understand that right now you know the
person who is most powerful as far as SP
is concerned is none other than actual
each other and that they also are
because my ot has personally seen how a
mole I'm seeing other you know has
behaved in Oxley how he has been seen on
both sides you know on the side of his
brother show passing the other or also
on the side of his son actually shadow
so she knows and I'm most of the senior
leadership of you also know that how he
is trying to play a balance act all from
all side if you remember you know after
2017 when the BJP came up with was the
biggest electoral majority you know in
up in a rally in in lejano a hellacious
oh and samajwadi party and balancing
other were invited during the
swearing-in of offer yogi Adityanath and
in that particular meeting okay it was
seen that balancing adult fortunately
pulled his son and and you know started
speaking something in the air of a prime
minister in Modi so that particular
gesture was construed by many political
experts as you know as an attempt by
Milan together to keep all five happy
this particular statement is to also
being seen in that context he feels that
if the BJP comes back to power
you know they completely not alienate
samajwadi party and this could be you
know one of the reasons why he spoke
what is so you're saying that elbow room
for negotiations is what is at that room
for negotiations is being kept Obon
with this kind of commentary well it
could be it could be one other reason
but I think you know I mean in the in
the in the to get that I'll go whom what
he has basically done is give BJP
certain smiley then one a cover
embarrassing his son to know
embarrassing his son to no end
absolutely in fact do we have that
soundbite of Milan Singh Yadav when he
said that in Parliament okay before
before we go to that soundbite progestin
let me ask you this obviously the BJP
and the Prime Minister would look to
exploit this and remains to be seen
whether or not it you know they are able
to reap dividends out of this or not but
they would choose to exploit this to the
hilt",True,en,873,2,14

lunch it's the day to of questioning
remember of Robert Vadra and Jaipur the
question in the morning lasted for three
hours so this is the latest information
coming in this hour
Robert Vadra has left the IDI office for
lunch he was questioned for three hours
this morning
Roberts day two of questioning of Robert
Vadra and Jaipur over allegations in a
beacon a land deal
I don't know joining us with more
details on this story I don't one of the
breaking updates coming it well they're
Raja has just left the Erie over there
in and Jaipur for the lunch and remember
that he has a come here at 10:30 a.m.
and it's been three hours since he was
being interrogated by the IDI officials
and it's the second day of the
interrogation yesterday he was
interrogated for close to nine hours and
I remember those two nine hours and I
remember his mother morning water was
also there for interrogation yesterday
for two hours and later on she cited
some health issues and therefore the
official you know after in fact we gave
her the permission to to go back to the
hotel but as far as the Robert Watrous
interrogation license and that's
something which is under which is going
on and he will be returning at 2:30 from
that lantern I think we are also
expecting a longer day for Robert Vadra
today here in DT of it right and what
has been the line of questioning our own
sofa it's day two of questioning of
Robert Vadra what has been the line of
questioning so far what are you learning
from your any sources we know it's been
it's been the second day for over two
are dry and because yesterday what we
got to know some our thoughts is that
big questions which which posed by the
IDI before Robert Vadra they were not
satisfied from the answers because the
Edie Edie asked Robert water about the
transactions and howdy how did he get
the money to actually buy that land in
Beacon Aid and what were what was what
was the decision of the other directors
what was the role of the other directors
in the entire what was the function of
functioning of the skylight hospitality
and that's it here did he know mahesh
lager or show Kumar so these are the
questions which he asked him we
yesterday I spoke about the 55 questions
that he had prepared for Robert Vadra
and of course you know yesterday we saw
you know the marine what Ryan Robert
Vadra being interrogated separately and
then together as well so Edie officials
are trying to
extract as much as possible from Robert
Vadra and that we may see the
interrogation in coming few days as well
because they also know that in Delhi
he's being interrogated for his
properties in London here in the hair is
being interrogated in the pika near land
camp his relationship which because in
this case he has already arrested - -
accused in this case in 2017 and they
have their statement reported as well so
but it yesterday and even today they are
going to confront Robert Vadra with
those a statement of those accused
because now this issue is getting
murkier name of CC stumpy and Punjab and
that is also appearing in this case
because some of the witnesses were
proposed before sayyidi they said that
no God Mahesh Nagar has also bought
properties for for PT sample was been
has been involved in that London
property as well so we have to see that
how much it is going through extract on
this interrogation or they may speak
another day of the interrogation of
Robert was that something which will be
much clearer at P by the end of the day
right Aruna and of course he has left in
the office for lunch but is it expected
that he will return in a short while
from now and then his questioning will
begin possibly till late evening once
again given to Robert yesterday he also
went at the 1:30 and returned today also
we are expecting him back at the IDI
office 2:30 and then the interrogation
will proceed further all right yeah well
I don't know clearly of course you are
pointing out that Robert Vadra expected
to come back in about half an hour post
which is questioning will resume and you
know even as this grilling of Robert
Vadra continues in Jaipur there's been
of course a big political slugfest over
it is well the Communist levelling a
political vendetta charge meanwhile the
BJP of course saying that the noose is
tightening around the corruption done by
a Gandhi family member the Congress
party and the Robert water I have been
maintaining there saying that this is
which and
and when data politics which is being
resorted by the BJP I remember yesterday
before he reached the the operator and
therefore he wrote a Facebook post where
he spoke about the way vgp is you know
trying to trying to utilize this issue
especially when when we are at very
close to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
and therefore they are in their own
factor raising this issue why didn't
they do anything for four and half years
why only they are coming up with these
things right now but still I'll confront
them I'll give all the answers and I'll
cooperate with enforcement officials
that's what their litigation is BTS VSP
heard Rahul Gandhi we heard playing
candy water we heard robust water all
our things this is completely when data
politics which is BJP is talking to all
right now we're clearly of course I
don't know you know as you're telling us
the political ramifications of this case
are being seen as well given the fact
this is Robert Vadra who's of course a
businessman were also Sonia Gandhi's
son-in-law Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as
husband who is in you know the IDI
office was being created over there
today though we've seen interestingly I
don't only a Robert Vadra pair for
questioning yesterday his mother also
was questioned that's something that of
course Robert Vadra hit out over the you
know on Facebook he had said that it's
unfortunate that his mother is being ill
treated in this manner and he's been
used as a political pawn despite the
fact that she is old and she is unwell
but today only Robert Vadra appeared for
questioning not his mother as yet well
yesterday when the interrogation got
over of Robert Vadra we spoke to the
lawyer of out water he said edy
officials at the Mira query clear that
the interrogation from Robert Vadra

it is 2.8 percent up percentage cheaper
then what was offered in the UPA regime
suddenly has come as a shot in the arm
for the BJP but at the same time the CAG
has also said that the deal could have
been cheaper than the final deal of
course which was negated by the NDA
government but certainly in an electoral
charged environment the BJP will see it
has a vindication of their stand isn't a
jessalyn
well that's right you know I mean both
of them wouldn't want to believe
whichever suits them so in the case of
the BJP I mean they believe that the CAG
of course is given them a clean sheet
even though it does not back their
version it has even rejected the
assertion of the Congress so in a way
it's a kind of a win-win situation for
the BJP so we'll have to see how the
Congress reacts to it especially Rahul
Gandhi because the Congress leaders whom
we spoke to here in Parliament have
rejected the CAG report outright and
they I just I mean persisting with
whatever they have been saying all along
and that the Modi government of course
is corrupt and that the he really acted
as a middleman and he helped is business
a friend Anil Ambani to really make
money out of it you know especially
thirty thousand crores so you know these
of course will continue because
elections around the corner this is the
only issue on which the Congress is
banking to really paint the Modi
government as a very corrupt one we'll
have to see him in what happens next and
he is not using any opportunity to
attack the Congress just see done isn't
it
he'll now goes want to say looks like
history is repeating itself and Congress
of course is destroying institutions
even invoking you know Rajiv Gandhi era
as far as this entire controversy is
concerned be to be certainly not losing
any opportunity to attack you know the
Congress as far as the CG reporters
concern
well he sees a similarity between what
is happening now and what happened when
in 1899 if you remember between 84 and
89 Rajiv Gandhi was the Prime Minister
with an absolute majority on his part no
government of course got mired in that
Bofors scandal I know after which they
completely lost the majority and to this
day they have not been able to remove
themselves themselves all over the
country and if you remember I know that
was a time when VP Singh of course then
on his political graph was on the rise
and he of course became a kind of a glue
for all the opposition parties who were
cunning for Rajiv Gandhi and that was
well know this send kids for Jenny case
came to the fore and later it was
revealed that the government in fact
planted that you know somehow cooked a
kind of a story in which it was shown
that you know be pissing himself had an
account elsewhere so basically you know
he is brew an analogy and they don't
have anything else to and now that the
Modi government is very clean they would
want to of course you know attack the
government and show that it is corrupt
and therefore they I'm coming up with
all these manufactured kind of you know
information with regard to that a fall
deal so he was basically drawing
comparisons between the two and I don't
try basically trying to drive home the
point that the Congress has not changed
over the years this quite you know
thirty years of you know passage well no
surprise yet Ceylon as far as the peach
appease concern certainly this report
has come as a wind occasion of this
stand if not nine percent at least the
CAG stays that the India our deal was
about two point eight six percent
cheaper than what was offered in the UPA

are the questions which
Tim we yesterday I spoke about the 55
questions that he had prepared for
Robert Vadra and of course you know
yesterday we saw you know the marine
what Brian Robert Vadra being
interrogated separately and then
together as well so the officials are
trying to extract as much as possible
from Robert Vadra and that we may see
the interrogation in coming few days as
we also know that in Delhi he's being
interrogated for his properties in
London here in the hair is being

his relationship with because in this

fJ7_bBn0haM,How to Make Marshmallows at Home | Easy Homemade Marshmallows Recipe | Academy of Pastry Arts India,How to Make Marshmallows at Home - We usually buy Marshmallows from stores but you will be surprised that it is very easy to ...,2019-02-12T18:34:10Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fJ7_bBn0haM/hqdefault.jpg,"[Music]
hi everyone welcome to the show I'm chef
Michelle I'm going to teach you how to
make marshmallows today you usually find
them in stores but I'll show you how you
can make them at home for the
ingredients we have 150 grams of sugar
there is 12 grams of gelatin 64 grams of
water 49 grams of dextrose powder 49
grams of glucose and 1 cap of vanilla
essence the flavor we're going to start
making the marshmallow now we combine
the first four ingredients so we will
take sugar water dextrose powder and the
glucose we're going to slightly warm it
up in the microwave and then add it you
can turn the pan on in the meantime
and let it be on a really low flame warm
up the glucose for about 15 seconds and
add it into the pan with the other
ingredients make sure all the
ingredients are dissolved before you
turn up the flame really high you need
to let the mixture come to a boil and
then we transfer it to a KitchenAid Bowl
ensure all the sugars that you've added
and the glucose are all dissolved
completely we have a KitchenAid boy
already on the side as soon as the
mixture comes to a boil we are going to
pour it into the KitchenAid bowl and let
it whip on a high speed so now that this
is come to a boil we are going to pour
it into the machine
let the mixture whip on a high-speed
so I've added all of these ingredients
after they came to a boil and we're
going to let it beep on a very high
speed
on the side I'm going to take the
gelatin we're going to melt it the
gelatin has already been dissolved in
water we soaked it in five times the
water so I have 12 grams of gelatin I've
taken sixty grams of water melt the
gelatin for about 10 to 15 seconds until
it is completely dissolved and you have
it in a liquid boiling state it's very
important that you pour the gelatin
hooked into the mixture my gelatin is
melted it's absolutely hot I am going to
pour it into the mixture that is
whipping over here
the final ingredient the vanilla sells
just to bring out a little flavor and we
take away the flavor from the gelatin
you can just add it in and sure this is
whipping on a very high speed
what happens in a marshmallow is that
the sugar is getting whipped up thanks
to the gelatin it forms strands and this
holds the entire sugar together okay so
now you can see your mixtures turn into
a beautiful white mixture you have to
ensure that the marshmallow whips up
completely and it needs to hold a peak
very important that the gelatin whips
are completely only then your
marshmallow will be able to be piped or
put into a frame so ensure that you get
a good peak out of the marshmallow
mixture
now my mixtures ready I'll show you how
it looks so that you know when to stop
the mixture from beating this is a
medium peak so you ensure that when you
pipe it holds its shape my mixture is
not liquidy it's not flowing but it's
holding its shape this is what we refer
to as a medium peak this is a very
important stage and making your
Marshmallow what we're going to do next
is we're going to pour it into a frame
or I can pipe it if I wish to I have a
frame ready with a silicon mat below you
can choose to put it into a acrylic
frame like we call it or you can put it
into a piping bag if you wish to pipe it
and then shape it up later I have two
ingredients with me here one is dextrose
powder dextrose powder is helpful so
that the marshmallow does not stick and
it also sets quickly I'm just going to
sprinkle a little on the silicon Matt
dextrose powder is also known as glue
con D so you will readily have get it
get it readily available in stores if
you do not have dextrose powder you can
use a little corn flour mixed with icing
sugar but it's very important that you
sprinkle some on the surface on which
you will put the marshmallow so it does
not stick to fill the mixture in the
frame take a little of the marshmallow
mixture drop it into the frame you can
use any frame any high depending on how
big or small you want the cubes of
marshmallow to be if you wish to add
color you can add it before you take the
marshmallow out of the bowl use a
spatula and spread the mixture evenly
the whole purpose of using a frame is so
that you get an even height for your
marshmallow
you do not have very long to work with
the marshmallow mixture remember it as
gelatin as the gelatin cools down your
marshmallow is going to set so ensure
you have all your tools all your
equipment ready the frame anything that
you want to set your marshmallow in
needs to be ready before you start
making it now that I've even this out
I'll keep it on the side and I can
sprinkle dextrose powder on top
this ensures that the product dries out
and I'm able to cut it out tomorrow this
product needs to rest for a couple of
hours till it dries out so the gelatin
cools down and it sets form so I also
have some desiccated coconut here this
is just to flavor it
I've already dusted the dextrose powder
I'm sprinkling this just for flavor this
is completely optional if you wish to
you can roast the coconut this just
gives a nice texture and a little flavor
to the marshmallow I have a piping bag
right here with a round tip with the
remaining marshmallow mixture fill up
your piping bag so fill up the piping
bag with whatever remaining marshmallow
mixture you have again depending on the
thickness or thinness of the product you
use of nozzle accordingly now we're
going to pipe straight lines and show
you have constant pressure over the
piping bag guided with your other hand
and pipe nice long lines of the
marshmallow
I'm going to sprinkle a little there's
carrot coconut powder on top of it again
you don't want to sprinkle it completely
this is just so it dries out and sticks
to it so now I'd like I told you coconut
powder is an option if you wish to this
adds a nice flavor if you wish to add
any color you add it before you take the
bowl out of the machine if you wish to
add any flavor you can use extracts
extracts will reduce the amount of
liquid that is going into the product so
you can match the flavor with the with
the color that you're using offending or
strawberry extract I'll do a pink color
from doing a raspberry I'll do a red
color of mango yellow similarly but
extracts work the best if not you can
also reduce a mango puree or a raspberry
puree and added for flavor we're going
to let this mixture rest overnight over
a couple of hours in a chilled AC room
it'll take at least 4 to 5 hours so
ensure you let it rest efficiently
before you then use the product
now that we've sprinkled our coconut
powder and dextrose powder we're going
to let this dry very important to ensure
that we let this dry in a cold room not
in the refrigerator in an in a chilled
area where it can dry for a minimum of 5
hours
only when the product is not sticky then
it's ready to consume ready to roll or
ready to cut if you've put into a frame
I'm going to let this rest and we'll
check it after a couple of hours so now
I've rested this for about five hours
and you can see it's dried out it's
releasing from the mat very easily also
over here now we can release it from the
frame and then cut it into cubes ok now
this is ready to cut we're just going to
take our chopping board and show that
this is released properly from the
silicon mat it's dry on both sides place
it on the chopping board I have a knife
and a little oil you can grease third
knife with a little oil so going to
place it on the chopping board I have a
knife with me and a bowl of oil this
will help us cut very easily
so ensure you have greased hands that
way it won't stick to your hands as well
you can see the marshmallow is set not
sticky on either sides the sides where
there was no dextrose that's the little
sticky part now that it's released from
the frame we're going to cut it into
small cubes again you can cut it into
the size that you want and show that
you've greased your knife really well
hold it firm and just cut through the
marshmallow put a little pressure till
it slices so you can see I have a nice
long strip cut it into smaller cubes
based on the size that you want remember
the knife is greased that's why it's not
sticking ensure that you grease this way
put a little pressure in a sawing motion
cut it okay ensure that each marshmallow
gets coated so it's not sticky anymore
now it's not sticky on any side this
ensures that the product does not retain
any moisture so while my marshmallow is
still nice and fluffy it's coated on the
sides ok now that these are coated we're
going to keep them aside and show you
our gloves or you dust a little dextrose
on your hand so doesn't stick okay if
you feel like your product is a little
sticky you can either sprinkle a little
more coconut or you can sprinkle a
little dextrose and then lift it and you
can make it into a nice twist and sure
these are coated nicely so that there's
no moisture and it's not sticky and then
you can knot it up so these are
marshmallow knots they look attractive
and they can be eaten just by themselves
can also twist it like this to make them
into marshmallow twists any extra part
you can remove okay so make it into a
twist so these are the two shapes that
I've showed you you can do a marshmallow
twist again or not rather this is the
twist you can use two different colors
make it colorful you can do it a
different toppings different flavors and
you can also cut them into cubes now
that we have our marshmallows ready they
are dusted in sufficient textures
they're dry we can just plate them you
can serve them in glass bowls or in a
plate whichever you like and sure these
are sufficiently dusted so that if
someone has to lift them up it's not
going to stick to their hands and you
can lightly place them in your glass jar
so these are your marshmallows you can
put them into jars into glass
homemade no preservatives your kids are
going to love them adults are going to
love them flavor them with whatever
flavor you want color they could you
look beautiful so if you enjoyed

fvg7Et7y10A,"Robert Vadra, mother Maureen Vadra to be questioned by ED today in Jaipur; Land Deals Case",Congress President Rahul Gandhi's brother-in-law Robert Vadra came to Jaipur on Monday for addressing by the Enforcement ...,2019-02-12T05:01:08Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fvg7Et7y10A/hqdefault.jpg,"on the broadcast Vadra has cried foul
alleging political vendetta Vadra claims
he is being harassed by the government
alleging political vendetta by the
government he has put out a post there
that is on your screens he's questioned
the role of the government and he said
that he is being targeted by the ruling
dispensation
my colleague Arun hunter joining us on
the broadcast with more details on what
exactly has Robert Vadra written well as
the night before his question
immediately should we just saw the piece
book reports of Robert was aware he
claimed that he will give all the
answers of the important electorate
absurd questions but they are dragging
his mother into the entire case and
therefore he has written this emotional
post on Facebook where he talks about
his father the 75 year old mother me and
my mother are good people in fact of the
resurrected officer not understanding
the laws of the twinkacetti's government
to be arresting a senior citizen who the
world knows has lost a daughter in a car
crash Arlington Arlington to diabetes
and her husband as well so you know he's
completely you know writing this thing
to send out to get some sort of a
sympathy because what she claims is that
are - mothers which has been dragged
into it just because she is she is a
departure in that valid hospitality and
she is saying that she was just to spend
some time with her she was part of our
company because she was the moon and
therefore I know I have to spend time
with another four I told her in my
company so that she could come to office
but just because of this indicated
politics of the BJP they're dragging my
mother into it but still I'll give all
the answers of those or GB officials
with full food and food spent and TV you
know in the last three days I have be
pressed with the national capital why
the BJP government is coming out which
is get so many when they are very close
to 2009 election so but it's most years
written right before the interrogation
here and therefore and what they are
expecting that Robert was along with his
mother will be reaching who each office
at around 10:30 from from now and we are
expecting that the investigating officer
who's investigating that you thorin
and direct 50 will you know transplant
Robert Vadra fits all the documents
which they have and also the statement
which they have recorded or for other
people whom they have arrested in the
past and let's also quickly take a look
through the operative part of that post
that Robert Vadra has put out and he
said if there was any issue or any
illegality which was found by the
government why did it take them four
years and eight months to call me a
month before campaigning begins to the
general elections so Robert water of
course is linking this entire case to
the fact that general elections are
around the corner that's right and you
know this is not a very first time even
in the past he has been maintaining that
it's a witch hunt it the vendetta
politics which BJP government is
resorting to but today he has also
mentioned about his mother in this post
where he says that she is not doing well
still she's being asked to you know
appear before the Enforcement
Directorate is like an enforcement
Electra's office and that too especially
when we are heading towards 2019 general
election so on one account he's trying
to get that emotional touch and sympathy
and also he's you know taking onto the
BJP stating that just keeping the
elections in mind they are resorting to
this witch witch hunt and wind occurs so
and he also talks about the way to yield
standing standing tough in front of you
I'm investigating he's in phase a phase
that why the BJP government was silent
for the for close to four years why they
are opening up these issues now why they
are calling me to interrogate again at
this time when you know they know that
if they are there in a very difficult
state and therefore they want to
actually put pressure and to send out a
message against the Congress party at
large to open up all these people for
the interrogation so we know he is
really trying to extract some you know
empathy or came from this case report
interesting to see Arun this comes right
a day after Priyanka
the Vadra made her big debut in yupi she
was on a big campaign mode she was
actually traveling from airport to a ICC
headquarters and this even as her
husband is appearing before the
Enforcement Directorate in kubinka sandy
what rise also in the night and she will
be accompanying Robert Vadra
to the IDI officer because we saw even
in the tell you in Robert Vadra was
appeared before the entire Atlanta
Gandhi what rod came to drop him to that
office and in seasons Airport along with
the Raja Robert Vadra and his mother she
is expected I can't leave them to the
enforcement and Boston director its
focus and this is something which is
which is bring Kazan D is sending out
very strongly a strong message rather
that she is behind Robert to apply and
in that way Congress party is fully
behind Robert Vadra and that's what they
are showing it openly beauties around it
because we heard already two days ago
stating that you know if they want
arrogate they can maintain the
interrogate or they can investigate
Robert Vadra or anyone but you know why
they are not speaking about their own
issues while I'm speaking about her file
and other issues why they are not
investigating those issues so Congress
party is fully backing this and we saw
yesterday pentagon d did that members
really in Lucknow and then straight away
she had it to Jaipur yesterday to
accompany her husband and who note so
that tell the solidarity and also to
send out a message at large that yes we
are fully backing Robert Vadra hand this
is just a witch-hunt or when data
politics which is a beautiful absolutely
Congress they're trying to you know a
certain that this is nothing but
vendetta politics they're trying to
reinforce that narrative that this is
nothing but men data politics but also
you know quickly run of you was through
what are the charges on Robert Vadra
what charges is he facing he was
appearing in foreign you know he was in
front of Enforcement Directorate just a
couple of days back he appeared four
more
in 24 hours is once again appearing in
Jaipur today what are the charges are
well you know Robert Vadra company
skylight hospitality has bought some
land in Canada in 2010-11 and
subsequently when Rajasthan police
investigated that matter they filed fi
as and also charge a justice in the case
and therefore the Enforcement
Directorate erect rate with the
cognizance of those empires and charges
in 2015 because since skylight
Hospitality's name is there in that
beacon areas land can or there were it
was essential on the path of enforcement
directorate to actually interrogator of
the Quadra because be someone who i was
a shareholder in that company along with
his mother and therefore because you
know there are people who who have been
arrested by the Enforcement Directorate
in the past they have connections with
Robert Walker also too just to confront
Robert Vadra with those the statements
given by those people because few of
them are the employees of skylight
hospitality whom whom enforcement
electorate has interrogated in the past
or they have paraded many offices of
valid hospitality in Delhi and Jaipur so
they are you know in they've only been
to interrogating Robert Walker in that
regard they will confront him with those
statements given by those people and
also the documents which they have in
their possession but as of now Robert
Vadra has not been mentioned in that
they are Witcher and was often
Directorate registered in 2013 and
remember that even in the past
Enforcement Directorate has asked Robert
Vadra appeals before eb-2 to take three
take the interrogation power kerchief
did not appear many summons were issued
to him his lawyers appeared for those
interrogations but he wanted
specifically the president Robert water
which did not happen but later on when
Robert Carter realized that now the
chances offer easy to arrest him
high gear force therefore to be
one High Court and by the time High
Court after Robert Vadra
and his mother to cooperate in the
interrogation and there were asked them
to appear before the IDI office here in
a chapel and that both of them are
appearing today and we saw about what
some maintaining this fact that it's
completely you know when that a
political speech it is doing because not
all right ever get that they want to
correct them nothing else
absolutely so Congress party there
continues to reinforce its narrative but
that this is nothing but when data
politics just days ahead of the general
elections 2019",True,en,1416,4,10

Priyanka Gandhi who's just taken on the

in charge of U P East has now demanded
that those responsible for this
large-scale tragedy in a thorough

darica Chopra joining us on the phone
line Devika Priyanka Gandhi is just

coming out for our newly taking up that
a role of herself as a general secretary

remember that a load of the Congress's
hopes now rely on Priyanka Gandhi for
her to come up as the minister as the

lying in the public eye coming out in a
public in a press conference but of
course that hasn't been done by Priyanka
Gandhi like I said we have to also focus
on the fact that she has released a
press statement rather than coming out
and sitting for a formal press
conference where she addresses this
particular issue because while her entry
into politics has been announced with
people I get to see her really take up
the role really come out and be a part
of the public as you know her brother

and now the Apollo Hospital is saying or
rather they're claiming they've
approached to the High Court row and
they are seeking an intense stay on the
Proceedings of the jaya death probe
panel apollo or has claimed that the
probe panel is prejudiced and the
hospital will be subjected to ejected to
grave hardships and irreparable harm if
these proceedings are not state petition
says and I'd like to quote to the danger
of prejudice and bias is apparent in the
manner in which probe panel is
conducting the examination of witnesses
Mogollon is joining us on the phone line
on that to a big breaking story Mugen
take us through what Apollo Hospital is
saying and its petition and why do they
exactly want the proceedings in the jaya
DET probes did moody mattress re code
faking an interim stay for the
proceedings of our vows on the
commission because it is very important
to note that almost all the opera
doctors who have peteandjayne alyssa has
already deposed before the armor
commission and they have given by a
statement but there was apprehension
raised by the apollo hospital stating
that lack of medical knowledge or lack
of team which has the proper medical
knowledge to take down the devotion from
the doctors is missing and then even
even also a lease does various term the
medical terms and these treatment given
to the jail alyssa was taken wrongly or
recorded wrongly by these charts of the
armorer called swamy commission so that
there is a need of 21 members dog
doctors board in the are mojave
commission but the r-mo asami Commission
has out I totally reject a rejected the
demand by the Apollo Apollo Hospital for
setting up a 21 member Medical Board so
right after that
now the Apollo Hospital has of course in
Madras High Court stating
there is a high possibility off of this
uh our boys army coming up with a
prejudice and I am discussing a very
harm to the Apollo Hospital for their
lack of medical knowledge and expertise
in the medical field so now at the
Apollo Hospital has of course Europe
might recycle and in the recent of
injuries when very recently when other
doctors were summoned by the almost on
the commission Apollo Hospitals very
clearly said that they are moving a
petition before the matter cycle and
they will not allow any doctors to
appear before the arguing call me
commission without any legal clarity so
on that note now the Apollo Hospital has
opposed to multi-site Court seeking
intensity and more importantly so far
openness album has not been comment for
the inquiry if he easy what he's the
first person who was right many doubts
regarding generators we might so far he
has not been summoned by the Armel Samba
Commission now it is only opiates left
without summoning so anytime we can
expect our balsamic Commission to summon
opiates but now Apollo Hospital has
seeking an imprint state on the
proceedings is a very interesting turn
of events we have to wait and watch
oh my gosh I could gonna take up this
case we have to wait watch whether they
will give an interim stay or not
if encryption is not given we have to
wait to watch whether our Masami
Commission will at least now summon
opening salvo party position right the
big question is moving on what really is
a contention of the Apollo Hospital
what is the Apollo Hospital fearing when
they say that they will not send their
doctors to the r-mo Goswami Pro panel
without legal help do they feel that the
Commission itself is prejudiced against
the hospital is that an allegation which
they're making yes exactly the Apollo
Hospital may is making such an
allegation because they say they say
that the our balsamic Commission does
not have a necessary expertise on
medical knowledge to record the
statement given by the doctors and they
also said there are various mistakes
being found in the deep ocean given by
the doctors and the way in which they
have the Argos Army Commission has
required recorded by a statement so only
after
this allegation the Apollo Hospital
sought for 21-member Medical Board but
Armas army Commission out lately has
rejected any such demands so now seeking
a medical board and also seeking an
interim stage for the Proceedings of the
Apollo Hospital has we supposed to
matter of a code right so they have
approached the Madras High Court Mugen
tell us how will this case the street
from chiron legally definitely because
it's more than 14 months and our move
Asami Commission has started its work so
far they have there they have inquired
almost all the persons who relating to
General Hospital Ison hospitalization
except opening salvo but now on the very
end of the last minute now the Apollo
Hospital has reached Madras High Court
and there is a already there's an order
pending before the Madras High Court
which very categorically state that any
commission picked up by the by the state
government of tamil nadu should be
wounded up in a time bound manner but
now harm of Assam a commission have
sought more extensions and it's almost
15 months that the r-mo asami Commission
has lost by us not completed its inquiry
so it will be very interesting to see
how Madras High Court handles this issue
because after the r-mo asami commission
they have almost completed all the
enquiry only opiates and two doctors are
remaining but there's the time taken by
the our most immediate commission is the
question we have to wait and watch
whether
Metis I will take this also in
cognizance and she has a case on they
simply go by the merits of the petition
and enquire fax petition is something
which has to be waited was right we need
to wait and watch so for more clarity on
that Ripley which has been filed by the
pool of hospital and whether the Madras
High could accepts it or not but the
Apollo Hospital when they say that they
want to stay on the Proceedings of the
jaya probe panel just make us understand
so they have a problem with the r-mo
goswami commission but not with the fact
that a probe is taking place in her
death right yes they have the they have
an issue with the r-mo asami commission
they have the problem with the way how
our Mousavi commission records the
statement given by
those and medical experts so we as I
said earlier Apollo Hospital feels that
the animals are make Commission does not
have any medical expertise to record the
statement given by doctors and medical
experts and there's a high chance of
prejudice by the our Masonic Order what
basis are they saying that the
Commission can be prejudiced what is the
premise for making these grave
allegations the Apollo Hospital feels
that the statement given by the doctors
and the other experts are wrongly
recorded by the ARB u.s. army commission
so if the portion by the doctors and
other medical experts are recorded
wrongly that the when the Army's Army
Commission takes up this case for
submitting its report the NT and the
authenticity of the entire report report
will be twisted or will not be in a
plane in a to form so the arm of the
Apollo Hospital feels that the statement
given by the doctors and other expertise
has been God not been recorded properly
by the or both of my commission of
course absolutely so far as a polo
hospital is concerned they feel the
Commission is prejudiced of course needs
to be seen by the the Madras High Court
accepts that we by the Apollo Hospital
or not thank you moving on for now

tKdulhlT5vw,Rafale Note War: Why is Rahul Gandhi silent on the 2 pilots killed in a haltest last week?,"Congress President Rahul Gandhi today launched a fresh attack on the PM, accusing him of running ""parallel negotiations"" with ...",2019-02-08T16:12:51Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tKdulhlT5vw/hqdefault.jpg,"exception will you heard a bombastic
speech from the Prime Minister yesterday
in Parliament while he was delivering it
Brown wasn't there he was outside
talking about the conversation tonight
is hinging around one note prepared by a
junior officer in the Ministry of
Defence in 2015 he raised objections to
the PMO interfering in the negotiations
the part of the note was leaked created
a political storm but if you look down
and delve a bit deeper there is a note
on the same page from then Minister
Parker calling it an overreaction the
matter was resolved the deal concluded
with the same officers who wrote these
notes present in the room change a
little bit of context we slightly
selective in what you see and bias will
kick in for our land company this is the
smoking gun of the PM's personal
culpability for the BJP it's a
half-baked lie smacking of bottom
fishing when all else has run out so
let's examine the facts as they have
emerged then leave it to you tonight to
decide what you believe but amid that
spirit talk to this to Indian pilots
died in a mirage test crash just a few
days ago would it be better for India to
be wondering how to save the ire and
having an equally raucous political
debate of a real and present danger or
is the smoke around rafael better have
you heard from Rahul and company any
sort condolences for the IAF pilots have
they gone to meet their families why not
if it doesn't suit your politics is it
better to just islets crash and burn
it's a very serious question with
serious ramifications for our defence
air superiority and for what we do in
humanity politics and the future of the
country let's have that conversation
here first are the headlines
pradhan mantri me swam airforce cut this
has our crew paid to recur k anil ambani
coded wire if you keep saying it often
enough perhaps it'll become the truth
and that's the tactics behind Rahul
Gandhi and the Congress as they latch on
to a 2015 defense ministry note which
had raised objections to the PMO
interfering in the negotiations ignore
everything else they have published hot
so lies says the defense minister as she
asks India to go through the facts of
the case which have nothing to do either
with the pronounciations or the
conclusion of the d7 level in a
libertarian
particles are territorial even though it
was supposed to be budget day in
Karnataka but it's been overshadowed
with six Congress MLAs missing and HD
Kumaraswamy the Chief Minister leaking
an audio tape he says is over yet Europe
father former cm says he'll quit if you
can prove it the Kolkata Police now
raids two properties
amid rumors that they are somehow linked
to the ex CBI chief the CBI chief issue
says the properties have nothing to do
with him or his wife simply one company
that in the past gave a loan to his vice
firm
pay for statues the Supreme Court tells
the BSF beast BSP chief Mayawati to
return all the public monies spent on
her statues and party symbols alright
let us start this off by laying the
facts literally on the table tonight it
all hinges on a note have a look at it
here is the Defense Ministry note dated
November 24th 2015 this note has been
signed by the then Deputy Secretary mr.
aske Sharma it is on this note that the
entire smoke around row file has been
growing today let's get that note on our
screens if my producers can snap to it
please point number five of this note is
the crucial point it reads it is
therefore clear such parallel
discussions by the PMO have weakened the
negotiating position of the mo Dee and
the Indian negotiating team we may
advise the PMO that any officers who are
not part of the Indian negotiating team
may refrain from having parallel parlays
with the officers of the French
government in case the PMO is not
confident about the outcome of
negotiations being carried out by the mo
D a revised penalty of negotiations to
be led by the PMO at appropriate levels
may be adopted in the case so a junior
officer SK Sharma here deputies on 24th
November files this objection now this
has become the basis of all the politics
that you see happening in this country
now what we've seen thus far is this
much of the note what has now emerged if
my cameraman can throw zoom out a little
bit okay we've seen this much of the
note okay now has emerged the remaining
part because if you look down there are
file noting and if you just ask a more
cautious eye to what the file noting say
this is signed by G Mohan Kumar the den
defence secretary the defence sector e
raised it to the rock shaman three he
says RM
please see to it it is desirable that in
such discussions be avoided by the PMO
and as it undermines our negotiating
position right this is the defense
secretary now asking the rock shaman 3
then Manohar Parrikar to look at this
particular note this is happening on the
1st of December 2015 about six days
later then this nature here on your
screens of Manohar Parrikar he sees the
note on the 11th of January 2016 what he
writes a very clear script it is that
the PMO in the French president's office
are maintaining the progress are
monitoring the progress of the issue
which was an outcome of the summit
meeting para 5 paraphrase referral to
this para 5 ok he is saying this para 5
appears to be an overreaction
he then further asked the defense
secretary mr. Mohan G Mohan Kumar please
resolve the issue and saltation with the
personal secretary to the Prime Minister
the chapter then closes how do we know
the chapter then closes because this man
Mohan Kumar we spoke to him this
afternoon this is what he had to say
[Music]
not a little lovin with the presentation
fountain condition commodity different
committee by the ministry it was purely
done by men there was nobody ok so that
was the then former defense secretary
the man who has got the first file
noting here who has just spoken to us
this afternoon you heard his
clarification nothing to do with price
nothing to be negotiation in this matter
was resolved now how do we know the
matter was resolved because something
called the Cabinet Committee on security
when the CCS finally cleared the deal
and present in the room were the two
people the defense secretary and the
deputy secretary who signed this note so
this should have been chapter closed but
it wasn't now let's add the background
context here is the statement the joint
statement that was issued by the
minister of External Affairs this is
what the Prime Minister and the french
president francois hollande agreed to in
that trip between April 9th and 11 2015
it all begins with this point number 14
of the joint statement deals with her
file the Government of India conveyed to
the government of France that in VO the
critical operational necessity for a
multi-role combat aircraft for the
Indian Air Force the Government of India
would like to acquire
36 Rafael jets in a fly away condition
as quickly as possible
the two leaders are conclude the
intergovernmental agreement and this is
the crucial line that this was not an
agreement between two companies or
between India and the song this was a
government agreement between the
government of India and the government
of France that would be better conveyed
on terms that would be better conveyed
by the saw aviation
asking this all aviation for the terms
as part of a separate process underway
the delivery would be in timeframe that
would be compatible with the operational
requirements of the IAF so this is where
it all begins the Prime Minister comes
and says something similar in the joint
statement and then all begins then this
of course is happening in the April of
2015 this note then comes out in the
November of 2015 and finally the next
year is this letter sent by the French
president in fact September 2016 and it
talks about that the government of the
French Republic is fully committed in
doing whatever show that industrial they
saw aviation and the MBDA France each
and their own respect do their utmost to
fully respect their obligations in
accordance with the inter-government
agreement so what is this letter about
this letter is showing that the French
PMO was doing roughly what the Indian
PMO was doing which was piloting this
agreement which was an intergovernmental
agreement now let's open up this
conversation the broadcast scienza for
Islam representing the Marquis and the
party Muhammad Khan of the Congress a
former vice chief BK Barbara is joining
us from Gurgaon mother Nala but the
internal director the sunday Guardian
and Saab Joshi this is in our Studios
before I come to all of you gentlemen
let me quickly reopen a person who knows
a lot more about this than any of us
sitting on this broadcast air marshal
SPP Sinha he happens to be leading the
negotiating team of these Rafael talks
that were going on with from Assam
France and the saw a Marshal's in our
very good evening to you and thank you
for joining us on the broadcast let me
just kick it off with a straight
question in your opinion and to the best
of your knowledge air marshal Sinha was
the Indian Air Force satisfied with the
final deal that came through that of
which the negotiations you were party to
the IAF is fully satisfied with how the
negotiations ended and with what we are
getting in this extra fire aircraft to
come on then then what is this entire
concept of a political issue regarding
which I'm sure you are aware of now so
this 2015 defense ministry note there is
a campaign to malign this procurement
and prevent the Rafale aircraft from
entering Indian Air Force and it will
defeat the very purpose for which this
act out of being procured that is to
arrest the rapidly declining strength of
fighter air force you say can be here by
non induction of this aircraft will
compromise national security to a very
large extent using campaign it's become
a political ash point for the opposition
it almost seems like a number one agenda
why do you think that's happening where
so much politics happening around this
so you use the word campaign what does
that actually mean
my first time came to know of this
noting today when I saw the article in
Hindu newspaper hmm this deputy
secretary air to 3sk Sharma was not part
of the Indian negotiating team Indian
negotiating team consisted of two Air
Force officers one other than me and
five joint secretary from a Modi and he
had nothing to do with the negotiations
I do not know for what reasons and on
whose BST has initiated this note but it
is a note within a Modi on a Modi files
and it has been closed on a Modi files
okay we were not aware of it and it was
not an issue that was a matter of
concern for the Indian Ocean so you're
saying in the final negotiations you
weren't even aware of it it was
something that happened internally in
the a Modi and as the then defense
minister wrote was sorted out there and
then but okay let me let me take it on a
different track I Marshall the Congress
has said that it would renegotiate the
deal if it comes to power
how many months or years would we lose
sir if that were to happen and how would
that actually affect the Indian Air
Force the issue is not of negotiation
after cancellation of this deal there
will be very few countries and companies
that would like to enter into contracts
with you but how would the I have suffer
sir what impact would happen to the IAF
in terms of its operation ability no is
not in the best of states the issue is
not of the operational capability of I
err it is a question of the security of
the nation what you buy is operated by
IAF but it is operated for securing the
nation yes so rather than looking at the
operational capability of the IAF we all
130 million people the hunt 30 crore
Indians need to ask that is our country
secure and if it is we need to get what
needs to secure Michael we've seen and
fighter planes on an urgent necessity we
just seen just a Marshall just hardly a
few days ago these two pilots test
pilots try to fly this Mirage at the
higher airfield they crashed the plane
they died on the spot we haven't seen
much political scrutiny about this why
do you
think that these kind of raucous debates
are not happening about the debts that
have taken place and the flying coffins
that we are creating it troubles
everybody if you see what is happening
in the special media negative trouble is
all Indians hmm it is something which
it's a national cause which says to be
thing do we need a reality check that
level am I shall do we need a reality
check sir when it comes to wind we are
giving our voyage to flying the
equipment all equipment that have been
inducted into the Air Force have been
assessed and validated by the Air Force
the issue is that there is a requirement
for proper long term maintenance in
which a chair has a major role and we
need to review the way we are doing
things for last 75 years with a chair
now the strategic partnership model will
open up new avenues for fighter aircraft
procurement and maintenance ok hopefully
this will arrest the rate the way things
are yo you're being nomadic so then
hopefully it would arrest that they
decline so let me let me sum up sum it
up on a larger picture Air Marshal if
the planes themselves are a phial
aircraft I've got nobody disputing that
you are saying that the Indian Air Force
was satisfied and the time come to close
this chapter close this matter the issue
is as far as the government the IAF and
the Supreme Court is concerned it is a
closed deal it is what is happening
outside that needs to stop and my job is
to bring out facts ok facts on the table
we will Utley pulls em on the table a
marshal they stay on with us let me open
this larger conversation Mohammed Khan
you've just heard the former deputy
chief of the Indian Air Force the man
who led these refil negotiations that
neither this note nor anything else
coming from it had any they were not
even aware of it because it didn't
affect the negotiation at all so why do
you think all these people are liars
okay
but nobody thinks they're liars Richard
and let me begin by clarifying two
points mr xu saab speaks with the voice
of experience and reason so it is
imperative that i clarify two things the
congress is not against that appellee
deal in fact it was the Congress
government that initiated and finalized
deal for the purchase of these jets from
the salt it what we are against his
crony capitalism and a lack of
transparency in a procurement of this
size because public might spend now
let's come to the facts it is a fact
that on today you change the quantum of
a deal from five point something billion
to seven point seven billion that's a
huge jump
you paid effectively three times the
price that was negotiated by aircraft
you bought fewer aircrafts in the name
of exigencies an urgent circumstances
you replaced HL a company in the
government-owned company with seventy
years of experience in the sector with a
private company that was formed fifteen
days prior to your meeting there are
several questions of crony capitalism
that have arisen then they say people
read media negotiate the deal Rishabh
don't get us wrong we will renegotiate
it only to the extent of the aberrations
of the BJP has inserted into it now in
this context these letters that you have
presented acquire enormous significance
the fact is it very board's exact it
very vindicates and validates exactly
what we've been saying that the PMO was
hell negotiations it shouldn't have you
have a negotiations team under the
Ministry of Defense and in that very
same letter it also talks of a sovereign
guarantee if I'm not mistaken and how
the purpose of a sovereign guarantee was
because of the government's argument
Mohammed Khan yeah that this was an
intergovernmental agreement yeah an
intergovernmental agreement was not
between the mo D and somebody else
between two governments it was signed at
the level of the heads of those new
governments happens to be our prime
minister and the French president in
this intergovernmental agreement there
is one junior babu who's raising
objections this junior babu is o defence
minister the matter is sorted out and
closed at a selective leak is then done
about one particular paragraph and that
note doesn't come in to mention of what
the document rewrote the man sold these
same officers a part of the final deal
which is cleared by the cabinet and the
chapter is closed
right where is this immersion about any
honest I'll explain first of all I'm
glad that you're putting the note out
it's in its entire context mr. Manohar
Parrikar's
subsequent explanation only adds to the
degree of under confidence that we have
with regard to what the government has
done I would also say that the officer
regardless of what junior rank he or she
may hold the truth is he or she is an
officer of the Union of India and their
objections are very well isn't it it
normal in a conversation with a people
to really and then settle them I'm sure
it happens it happens in my newsroom I'm
sure it happens within the Congress
party in the BJP in most organizations
and then a final view is taken is that
normal or is that abnormal in that
context Rishabh that may very well be
normal but then you must look at the
gravity of the objection being raised
the very fact that the PMO is carrying
on parallel negotiations is itself of
worrying sign protocols and procedures
which your channel has gone at lends to
explain okay let us come to the gravity
of this magnet boundless love what are
you already are you alleging that less
were negotiations
therefore imputes that the Prime
Minister of the Prime Minister's office
was somehow arm-twisting the French
government directly to get offset
contract you claim 30,000 corrodes but
it's a percentage of that to under money
is that's your is that your direct
imputation that is exactly a direct
computation it is borne out by two facts
one a mr. Bunny's company has put out
their annual report which we've debated
on your channel where they have conceded
to the amount and the second thing is
Francois Villon statement Franco a line
is the sandwich to not fully learn
Desiree Rishabh that he will have a dog
in this fight he has said that he was
compelled by the Indian side and you
know that the Prime Minister's team of
the hearing in negotiations those two
conclusions point to larger okay
mamakara for the questions were you
investigate but we will miss your
argument we put the facts as we have
them you'd establish a augment let's get
a rebuttal from science offer Islam of
the market Intifada SIA for Islam now it
is this word which has been raised of a
parallel negotiation and interference
that whether the facts prove it right
the finality proves it right the
Congress is latching out on to how do
you silence that argument
well let me tell you one thing very
candidly that mr. Val Ramsey's should be
given the trophy for concocting stories
were for manufacturing a story I know
there is a bankruptcy of issues that's
why they have he has to resort to
telling lies spreading lies but let me
tell you these about this note
particularly these things should be put
to rest this should be things should be
put to bed purely because every thing
has gone through the Supreme Court the
Honorable Supreme Court had asked for
all the information paper related
relevant information document and the
process there which is has been followed
and there the the verdict of the Supreme
Court on reciprocal Killiney suggests
there is absolute transparency which has
been followed and there is no scope of
any deviation even minor deviation is
intent interests of the nation now
second thing which I want to say that
the journalist who had wrote this report
ended mr. Rowley like he has been given
a trophy it started thumping jumping
over and above only to suggest that
there is God he should have seen what
the defense minister who is the ultimate
authority in the ministry who is the
ultimate is defense minister of the
defense secretary and if if the ultimate
authority has seen and made an
observation I said that these are over
reaction that observation which is which
he knows how do you battle the Battle of
realm of perceptions oh no no no let me
just just give me ten seconds
hello there is no perception is this
perception is in only the minds of the
corrupt people like Rahul Gandhi there
is no concern people of India knows then
there is a party which is known for
corruption watermill heroes there more
than thousand two hundred crore to the
income tax department
his mother is on bail on corruption
charges a brother-in-law's bail on bail
on corruption father who will believe
them they know that there they have
asked for power that's why they are
resorting to even just now mister mister
cop just ii just agree mr. Khan just now
said they have no problem with the
aircraft
their problem with the price and with
the price it was and the
hang on with me a second Mahmoud I'll
give you a chance to respond to more
than just a second let me quickly here
vice TPK Barbara so we've been having
these conversations that nauseam it
seems for weeks and months and now that
this is come out has it changed your
perception at all about anything
let me start by saying that I feel I
personally feel that there is an outside
interference in this whole game of
procurements the two aircraft that was
selected RCA one was and the file made
it Eurofighter didn't and I recollect
someone mentioning to me in the Paris
Air Show that the Eurofighter had almost
published everywhere in the air show
that they have got the contract before
even the deal was announced that their
one-day contract so I feel there is a
personal there is an involvement of some
foreign company here
the second issue now have you seen it is
so very clear that how bureaucracy can
play up so much of problems for any deal
a deputy secretary puts up a note who's
not even in the procurement process in
the sense that he is not even in the
negotiating committee the defense
secretary coolly passes it off to the RM
hmm the RM then passes it down to a
defense secretary this route with PMO
hmm have you realized how much of
bureaucracy can screw our country it's a
you know and visita and now yes the
opposition is impacted please please I
have got two or three now the opposition
impacting on national security which has
I just don't understand they sleep so
well at night without the services
providing them that national security
they were to really good you know how
long renegotiation will take well 12 to
14 months is what I've been told and the
minimum do they have any idea of the
timelines yeah it don't screw up the
timelines you right about that I am
does the same repeat this I'm sorry for
the introduction all I just come right
back now the Hindu Hindu paper no please
please please
rom is a very reputed person in yeah
unfortunately about two or three weeks
back he something was published by
Ingram which was again picked and cut
and pasted to show that these deal was
wrong now how come he's getting all this
information to support well that's for
him to an said he's not here to hide
himself that's for him to answer I don't
I get a better facts on the table as we
as we have them so let me quickly go
across the table before I give mama the
Quran so respond and ask him a couple of
other questions madam allopath do you
agree with with the former ayc PK
Barbara's illusion that now this is
smacking perhaps or more than just
politics so I'm not an expert in this
kind of matter but let me talk about
something that I know which is the
politics of it now the fact is that
Prime Minister corruption is going to be
a big issue in this march/april Lok
Sabha polls it is a big issue in 2014
it's going to be a big issue in 19 and
Prime Minister Modi has a tough task of
showing that you know I've Stalin in
Chennai Mamta in Bengal Mariah in you P
lalu in Bihar and frankly Rahul Gandhi
and and his family in Delhi are corrupt
they have a much simpler task all they
have to do zero in on one person there
in the moody because it is very clear
that the BJP is histor in dhoti
so they are all aiming their fired at
Narendra Modi and they want to they want
to try and tell the Indian people and
try and make the Indian people believe
that that moody
is guilty of corruption so Modi has got
to fire at about 10 targets they won't
leave a single target what's going on
and worship you and I can argue we can
discuss we can rationalize
but this is not going to stalk the
politics okay race you to the poll b-but
but the rationalization will have to
continue it leads to the sake of the
public girl let me quickly get in sort
of sort of have you found anything in
what you read about this node in the
public domain for many hours now that
changes the argument at all anywhere
well let me start by saying that the
node itself what's emerged is is not a
great look it's a bad look firstly the
question of parallel parlays the fact
that it's it's been brought up in this
manner in a note and has been
acknowledged as such by the defense
secretary and even the defense minister
has not has hit any of these facts he's
merely called para five and overreaction
and he certainly hasn't talked about
para for the proceeding para I wish the
complete notarized we've had more
context and better in perspective then
there's the question of you know the
defense minister responded to the
defense secretary is a file noting only
after 40 40 42 days what was happening
in those 40 days and even in his
response he said that is all the issue
the the matter still wasn't resolved I
have questions what is the question that
it entered in inter governmental
agreement with the the boss of the
government which is the prime minister's
office the PMO should have had no role
to play and some junior defense officer
and deputy acceptable which were
people's information very junior officer
is actually in a better decision-making
authority than the PMO look processes
are there for a reason but we've just
heard from the guy who led the
negotiating team right he said this
never even beats them yes
and on is rather about some duty level
sir no but clearly the defense secretary
and the defense minister heaven had been
responding to this issue who saw the
fact that it didn't reach the if'
leads me to the question as to whether
they were fully informed of what",True,en,75,1,1

we could hear a BS it adapt our
rejecting all the charges which have
been made by Kumaraswamy remember today
Kumaraswamy didn't explosive press
conference pointed fingers directly at
BSA to apply in fact directly attacking
the prime minister as well
mr. kumara Swamy in the press conference
sir released an audiotape
claiming that vacat rapper was trying to
lure or was trying to push their Emily
isn't straight your puff was the
rejecting all those charges are
currently holding a press conference he
claims that he went to a temple and came
back and he did not indulge in any Wars
trading off any sort that is a
clarification coming from ba said you
are pacified but certainly whether the
veracity of these tapes you know is
clarified that clarity comes on later
certain it could be a huge embarrassment
or for the BJP honey show joining us on
the phone line with more details Harish
take us through what ba said you know
pop was saying right now released by HC
Kumar Swami claiming that you decided of
power has become to be son of kuru
masculin Delhi and offered him huge sums
of money to come over and join them and
Mumbai and also they are assuring them
that there'd be no problem from either
the speaker or the judiciary is
completely like he hasn't spoken to
anyone he went to this door got to go to
a temple I mean he went can you come
this morning
we take all the space life and it was in
fact Kumar Swami who claimed that they
feel they've got his government so she
issued a lot ignored on what he meant by
that
he hasn't approached any mannalie it is
like that was confirmed by the acidified
who could not what about the government
and the failure and not much about the
oddities that have been released by eh
people much one leafless be that I
haven't spoken to any Emily I'm not
aware of what I see released by his
people watch Romney and I haven't spoken
to this particular person challenge
order the son of goodness girl Emily
right so basically up as far as he is
concerned he is rejecting all the
charges and he claims if I believe that
he was not indulging in any coordination
of talks with any MLA and he
one two or a temple visit right
absolutely you see the audio is big he's
also saying that say he hasn't met
anyone at all and he had just gone there
for temple and not to the temple visit
he's come back
but rejecting that there was any attempt
Isis and to be or any Emily that's what
he's claiming right now or right nor
defending himself and is also saying
that he will take part of the budget and
also the budget discussion why don't you
stay with us are we getting you know
pass some white that's listenin joining
us on the phone lines of what do you
have to say about what's going on in
Karnataka allegations and counter
allegations flying on one hand we have
mister Kumaraswamy who says that
beautify was trying to portion why
they're Emily's be a set up for right
now holding a press conference rejecting
all the starters very smart politician
who definitely reject it because nobody
after getting caught even after
presenting the right back in front of
media if you replace denying the fight
really shows that these drama of
poaching the mls and coming into power
is pain the only thing he would do is
crocodile tears it apart so point let me
take it for what mister you love passing
the stranger per se is an even internal
issues between your party and the
Congress and the mls and disgruntle
before because of internal developments
and because you're not able to keep your
flow together that's why you're pointing
fingers at mr. Yeddyurappa and the BJP
party how do you respond to these
allegations we presume that we are not
able to keep our chops together do you
think he's a fox he's old and he is
going to jump on the flock and eat
everything this is not about the
democracy was democracy has certain
parameter certain pieces these certain
criteria if at all he has power
forgotten the basic decency of democracy
I have to really believe is it entitled
be the lessons of more decent democracy
just because he's the old man who's
getting out of her age and want to be in
power you can't really do movie right
and we get BJ's kind of poles on the
phone line with us do Savior Samira I'm
a critical of also joining us biggest
fan APPA if you could yogurt indeed m
and have to say he said that you're part
here the BJP is indulging in
horse-trading is trying to buy amylase
and today after those audio tapes so the
BJP has been poorly exposed in the state
absolutely as far as the BJP concerns
have been trying to buy our remedies not
from now or a lot a big one continuously
and the one question which every single
water with us now is whether there is is
the amount of money right because it
embodies promising to provide a very
clean and honest and transparent
government how is he able to raise this
amount of money that he was able to you
know offer that expose a press
conference he our pointer finger
directly and the prime minister asking
the prime minister to intervene you know
as far as all the political developments
in karnataka are happening would you
also consider agree with the mister HD
caved months of course because you know
if he's promising a clean transparent
and honest government then it's
impossible that he's able to raise this
amount of money to buy anything and you
think bought and managed so far from in
Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh go
Manipur Meghalaya in Qatar everywhere
every part of the country is being run
of free of buying in today so where is
the P raising this money in his press
conference he's dismissing all the
charges in fact he's saying that the
Congress is not able to keep its lock
together and that is why you are
releasing these tapes which mister in
Europe are claims are extreme computing
ports this basic issue is that author
and protection has come this basic
premise that you're not able to keep
your enemies intact all that goes out of
the window because the anti-defection is
the base
is that Emily's have the basic you know
the feeling that we can move from side
to side so the basic premise is that
Emily's are they have a basic tendency
to move from side to side and when that
is the basic tendency how can you say
that you want equal to t4 Emily's
together on incidence of you know huge
amount of money being offered on the
other side why would an M&A shift all
right so you're saying it's a
face-saving exercised by the bishop in
his press conference which mr. you have
purchased health and rejected all the
charges which were made by the JDS yeah
of course you know the development not a
concern I mean today is a budget session
this is a time and people should
generally be talking about what's
cheaper what's more expensive do you not
think that it is a common man which is
suffering or because of all the politics
which is going on in the state bickering
also between the JDS and the Congress
earlier and now of course these charges
which I've come out against obviously I
get you drop off yeah I know but
ultimately the BCP we just realized
so everybody is gaming then the man on
the street is blaming the media tree the
blaming any report blaming the mr. Modi
for this continuous I tend to Porter
anyways rock for the last each month
continuously so that the Biff is being
very mysterious I tend to Porter anyways
rocks for the last month continuously so
that it is being very becoming in the
tix look your own Emily is we're missing
do you know where your Emily's are are
you in touch with them do you have your
flock your numbers together you have no
problem with us David
but if they always use divided Jeremiah
have to issue an ultimatum and of course
despite all the picture issued earlier
which we many of them now skip the
budget session no that's okay
sure yeah otherwise why would anybody
should realign with the democratic
process but the despite of despite of
the whip when you're Emily's do not show
or to the assembly is
something which are not one in your
party at all parties not worried about
and you have the numbers you claim you
have the number you will show up I asked
you this because mr. Europe but
categorically made that charge against
your party is saying that you are not
able to keep your flock together
that is why according to the story and
you have power you are floating these
conspiracy theories that's why I'm
asking you this this or the charge made
by mr. nadir path to make all kinds of
new statements but the ultimate issue is
this that if you know if you are not
able to keep up together why is
necessary I get is about getting Li
excited unless you speak them off some
money again again boiling down to the
number game so the big question which
will come towards the Congress towards
your party is that do you have your
flock together do you have the numbers
that is a big question here as well so
yes yes yes yes we have our flock
together
yes we have the number and that will be
proved today and I know you've moved it
in you're confident that you are Emily I
am going to show up to the assembly
today but I'd like to I'd like to ask if
the BJP is confident if there be able to
keep their flock together that means
when you say if the BJP is confident if
they'll be able to keep for this flock
together could you elaborate on that
no I would not like to elaborate on that
I think the PDF will understand what I'm
saying alright which is kalapa thank you
for joining us all new sects and of
course are giving us your views on that
a big story that was a British caliper
the Congress of course has gone
ammunition to attack the BJP after
they've released those explosive tapes
we're repeating time and again that new
sets cannot identify or vouch for the
authenticity or the veracity of those
audio tapes but yes one thing is clear
that the JDS and the communist alliance
feel that they have got an upper hand
over mr. BS eyedropper and the BJP let's
listen to what mr. Yadira password right

hello and welcome to policy and politics
with me Tarun Anya today we are
discussing a very special subject and
why is it special it is the last budget
in the current tenure of the NDA
government which is the fifth budget if
I may so 14 15 16 17 and 18 so this is
the fifth budget in that sense and the
interim budget which was presented for
the year 2019 2020 had many what if I
may say so
front page newspaper headline points we
had the tax exemption increased to
rupees five lakh which this party which
is the BJP had in fact said before
coming to power that this is one of the
things it is going to do there was a
completely different kind of scheme in
the form of the pradhan mantri
christianity which i am saying it right
in which the farmers are going to be
paid rupees 6000 in one year as a kind
of a income support system and so on and
so forth so there was so much in this
budget but we'll get to know in detail
of this budget what are the highlights
and before this way I have with me the
Economic Affairs spokesperson of the
party Ajanta party a chartered
accountant mr. Gopal Agarwal so thank
you so much mr. Agarwal for sparing your
time for this episode of policy and
politics and so you know in India there
are very few politicians who can also
talk with kind of authority on policy
who can frame policy and if I may say so
you are one of such persons who can
despite doing politics also write policy
which is very necessary for any ministry
so when somebody like you looks at the
budget what all did you see I want to
say first of all I would like to thank
you for the kind
that yourself I would like to say that
the budget cannot should not be seen in
isolation budget is one part of the
whole policies day of economic policies
thinking of the government and it has to
be seen in light of what initiatives the
government has taken over the last four
and half years of our current regime
that's very important and how the
economy has fared from where we started
in 2014 when we were a part of the
fragile 5 economies in the world all
macroeconomic parameters were very bad
inflation was high fiscal deficit was
4.5 percent of GDP the average growth
rate was 6.5 percent over the last five
years so from there we have moved and we
have consolidated Modiji has
consolidated we have changed into the
system infrastructure of social sector
delivery mechanism leakages were there X
collection there were gaps people who
are paying indirect tax not the
resources were not reaching to the
government corruption every day there
was a headlines every day there was a
headline that some scam corruption all
these scenario had created a situation
where there was huge concentration of
wealth and 1% of the population was
having wealth of accumulated wealth of
58 percent of the national wealth so
from there in four and a half years the
economy is moved to a very good position
all macroeconomic parameters have become
very good inflation which is the one
self parameter which hurts the common
man each individual in the country where
large population is below poverty line
where large population is economically
weaker though their inflation is the
most important parameter and from almost
nine point five percent of inflation
highest inflation in 2014 we have come
to a position where it is 2.2 percent
okay so
thing which is Benny benefiting everyman
is inflation the second economic
parameter though will not affect
individual individual people that was
fiscal deficit which has also been
brought from three or four point five
percent to three point four percent and
it's a very healthy sign current account
deficits are also under check and GDP
growth rate is also an important
parameter which helps the overall growth
in the economy and that is around seven
point five percent so if you compare two
things which affect the common man at
present and compare it with five years
of ten years from 1947 since
independence the combination of
inflation and GDP growth rate is best
within this current regime Narendra Modi
ji has done wonderful work on the
macroeconomic parameters and the
inflation with two point two percent a
very good for the common man and this
grew GDP growth rate at an average of
7.5% in the five years in these two
combinations have created a good space
in the economic segments and also the
interim finance minister mr. faroush
Quayle he had made a point in his speech
that the loans between 2009 to 14 went
up from 18 lakh row 252 lat
do you think in a sense that was a drag
when you took over that became a problem
because those loans couldn't be repaid
because the economy then was not doing
well and many of these loans turned out
to be NPS was that a problem
this is one part of the major problem
there are several problems at that point
of time this was one important problem
because they showed a growth in the
economy and that was fuelled by what we
are saying is the private public money
which was in the bank was given to
private corporate houses yes
that became the debt for those companies
and when they do not pay it becomes a
NPA equity for them almost a capital vsi
for them it is a public money in the
form of debt given to private corporate
houses the end not ever banking banking
sector not able to recover yes he came
up equity or a roll out for them we have
been able to tackle that problem that
identification and that resolution with
IBC NC LT those are a part of the story
but the important part is that that debt
led growth was not the real growth that
was not only needs that was a debt led
growth which which I was harming the
economy and that was not the private
capital formation and government and
even in this project is he is sticking
to its fiscal deficit targets do you
think that will in a way be responsible
for what you can say that you
restraining yourself from spending in a
way what light will you see it in no I
don't think the government has very
clearly said and PEGI said anyone mr.
Arun Jaitley before the budget also he
gave a statement that the government
will look into the ground realities okay
and macroeconomic parameter generally is
not what we chase as a government we
chase economic growth we chase those
sectors we saw those who need support
ultimately growth in the economy and
grow growth in there is economic in the
overall that is what which is on the way
towards that growth these macroeconomic
parameters are just a milestones and
stepping stones for moving it but with
the combination of his skull deficit and
inflation both being in a healthy
position the government found the space
for F is fiscal expansion and that's
what has been done innovatively I must
congratulate mr. pews girl and Prime
Minister for that matter that they have
very
slee expire fiscal space and created a
benefit for supportive system for those
segments of economy which needed a big
support at the current Jiang China from
the government now this budget if I may
say so had very big announcements the PM
Kisan or the pradhan mantri ki-sun
salmonidae was one such very very big
announcement because it directly puts
money into the pocket of the farmer you
are actually giving this farmer six
thousand rupees in here in in three
installments so it becomes two thousand
rupees the installment and you are
actually in telling an expenditure if
which says about 75,000 korone now this
is everybody knows this what is the
thought behind this scheme according to
you and how does it fit into the farmer
welfare idealogue g of this government
because there must have been some
thinking gone into this kind of scene
because there was what I would like to
say everybody was telling that the
farming sector agriculture sector needs
a big support push from the government
though in order the four and half years
Modi government has done lot for the
farmers with regard to MSP being
increased to 1.5 percent of the cost
name quoted urea interest subversion
insurance fossil be pradhan mantri fasal
Bhima Eugenia increasing infrastructure
investment into Agra irrigation land all
these were done and introduction of enum
etcetera and GST creating one national
one market but still farmers were in
that is some sort of challenging
situation they needed support there was
a debate on whether there should be a
farm loan or a income transfer which we
have done p.m. kiss on yogena what I
would like to see is that if you compare
them still some people are saying that
we should have gone for a loan waiver
scheme for the farmers yes so they did
if I will do
clearly put out that if you compare farm
loan with this income transfer scheme
that we have put out
it is comparing oranges to their pulse
because you should very well understand
and your viewers also should understand
that
what happens in the farm loan waivers if
we compare that farm loan waiver was
done in 2009 by the UPA government the
total quantum of formula1 waiver was 50
to 52 thousand crores and that they did
once in there 10 years tenure and it
their figures say that it benefited 3.5
Koror farmers so in 10 years you give 50
mm corrodes 23.5 corrode promise and
what we have done is we are giving to
approximately 12 crore population
farmers velcro tears that's what it is
between 12 to 15 corrodes anything any
number of farmers one thing second thing
is every year the amount is 75 thousand
corrode at one point of time this year
and that is for every year that was
fifty two thousand corrode for one time
in ten years this is 75 thousand
corrodes every year this will be given
so there is a big difference in between
and it is going in their account farm
loan waiver is generally helping only
those banks or institutions who have an
outstanding in that case so this is a
income supportive scheme and it is
moving towards that direction where we
say that we want to double the farmers
incur income by 2022 so this is a big
help in to the small farmers and one
thing other important thing is if you
see in all our schemes we have tried to
help those sections of the those
particular segments which are
economically weaker here also the
ceiling is land holding up to 2 hectares
of land even in other schemes also we
can take one by one anybody there
we are only targeting the weaker
segments of those particular sections of
before we take a break there are two
points which mr. Popple Agarwal cleared
that this is not a one-time scheme where
farmers are paid 6000 rupees a year
small and marginal farmers owning up to
two hectares of land he said this is a
perpetual scheme every year these many
farmers which is 12 crore farmers are
going to be paid an average and well
budget is 75,000 and at a cost of 75
thousand crore now different people with
different schools of thought will have
different interpretations somebody will
say the waiver that would have been a
good measure mr. Gopal Agarwal says no
income supplementation directly into
bank accounts is a good measure of
course the people would in the
eventually eventually decide what is
good for them by responding and voting
for it and but we'll take a short break
and we'll discuss this more
welcome back just before the break we
had mr. Gopal Agarwal sharing with us
that how income supplementation to
farmers would be a better measure than
one-time loan waivers per se and so
you've targeted about small and medium
farmers in that sense about twelve Koror
if we take the lesser estimate but let
us go ahead you for the first time we
see the fisheries sector getting a boost
because you say about as many as one and
a half crore people are employed in the
fisheries and you're providing 2%
interest sub mentions to the farmers who
are in fisheries and animal husbandry so
you going in that sense more than simple
farming you're going into fisheries
which is allied industry it's a lot of a
lot of our exports come from fishing yes
fishery is an important area then
ultimately another major benefit that
this budget is there there are three
major policy statement in this budget
one was the kiss on that you said then
second is the infrastructure GST
entertainment industry so many things
have been done under the years to enter
ten years history but the second
important policy statement here is for
the unorganized sectors labor that is
the pradhan mantri so I am yogi yoga
Samad on okay that is providing benefit
pension scheme to almost ten crore
population and labor force which is in
the unorganized sector and that to
pension monthly pension scheme of three
thousand rupees per month after they
attain the age of suppose it very simply
under the pradhan mantri Schramm yogi
Munden anybody who deposits 100 rupees a
month when he say at the age of thirty
after sixty will get three thousand
everyone yes at the till in the age of
29 to 40 29 to 40 years not to 16 no 20
years to pay the person entry ages upper
limited to 40 entry ages yes after that
he cannot come into 18 will also pay
equal amount if he is a
age group of 18 then he only have to pay
55 rupees per month and he will at the
age after attainment of age of 60 they
will get a monthly pension also this is
a thousand last time new scheme yes sir
and another important point may be
missed by somebody or some people is
that this will also include include the
landless laborers who are working in the
farm sectors so anybody any benefit of
3,000 from if they are landless laborers
working in the agricultural sector and
working is voluntary scheme for an organ
yes it's a voluntary scheme if they
contribute the government will equal put
up in equal amount but I think with such
a low amount and having a good pension
scheme this is one important area where
the unorganized sector will be benefited
well and this should be taken with along
with all the initiatives under GST where
the government has been able to reduce
indirect taxes to across all commodities
that has helped a lot for the common man
and therefore what a common man sees
what is his outcome expenditure in a
month
so if you ask anybody across India he
will say that the monthly our
expenditure of out come on essential
commodities like food etc cumulatively
he the overall budget expenditure for
individual has come down no I want that
disbanding I want to ask you but you
have said yourself that you don't have
to pay tax for an income up to nine
point five lakh rupees a year now of
course women like us who are not that
you don't understand you know all this
as good as Chartered Accountants - or
somebody like you do can you share with
us the tax breaks that this government
has provided a and how will it help and
how to avail them I told you there are
three policy statements in this budget
important which can be taken a flagged
off and can be taken as a landmark is
one was to the farmers second was
unorganized sectors pension for that and
third is the text can
session what is explaining to us that
the government what government had done
PG has done the Modi government has done
that anybody having an income up to 5
lakh okay xa bollocky that is the thing
we should understand if he has a taxable
income up to 5 lakh there is a nil tax
on his zero tax your money - yes
earlier this slab was 2.5 lakh so it has
almost double double fully double and
anybody having a taxable income up to 5
lakh has to pay neat X what is important
thing is that you have also asked that
how you can do a tax planning or how you
can benefit above if you have a
additional income will I be will that
individual I have to pay higher tax or
what is there so what has been explained
by us is that there is a benefit of ATC
it is anybody investing in savings
schemes radius K saving scheme there are
various schemes which qualify for a TC
benefit he invest about 1.5 lakh there
is a per-capita 5 lakh if he invest from
his income anything up to 1.5 lakh that
also comes his taxable income becomes
less than 5 suppose he has a six and a
half lakhs income he interest 1.5 lakh
his taxable incomes become less than 5
lakh so he has to pay nil tax PA second
thing is if he is having he there is
another scheme and concession that the
government says if he goes for a
National Pension Scheme NPS he can
invest up to fifty thousand in that that
also is exempt from Texas so suppose he
has a seven lakh income he invest fifty
thousand and and psn 1.5 in 8 TC so up
to seven lakh his taxable income becomes
5 lakh he pays 0 tech the another
important thing is that if he is a
salaried person because ultimately
salaried persons are more worried yes so
if he is a salaried person that he get
earlier he was getting a forty thousand
standard deduction that has been
increased to 50 thousand so if he is
getting a salary so fifty thousand
additional exemption he gets under the
standard deduction so till 7.5 Lex
he gets space nil text nil text and
further to boost even these are the
innovations that were finance minister
and PM Modi ji has done that they at one
point of time they have tried to boost
the real estate sector housing sector
create good houses for the common man
yes could bring investment into
construction industry if they have there
is an exemption of any loan repayment
and on housing loan and interest repaid
into that component up to two lengths if
anybody has taken a housing land and he
repays that becomes then if he pays an
interest of up to two legs so that is
also exempt from sort of nine points
like till nine point five lacked anybody
having income paying two legs as an
annual interest rate on housing loan
fifty thousand standard deduction fifty
thousand and PS and one point five in
ATC so if he has a gross income of nine
point five lakh he pays zero tax so
that's a remarkable innovation that's a
very interesting thing for all our
viewers because I know a lot of people
would you would want to know about it
that as mr. Gopal Agarwal explain till
about nine point five lakh rupees your
earning is gross income per you have to
pay no tax as he said about your
investments under ATC up to two like
standard deduction of 50,000 and house
long interest exemption or from paying
tax up to two lakhs that makes it nine
point five lakhs and what would be a
closing comment for this discussion on
the budget I would like to tell you that
we have beside these three important
factors macroeconomic patter effect
parameters being good there's a roadmap
vision the PUE of a finance minister has
given a 10-point vision statement also
which are the areas which we will focus
prime minister has said that this is an
interim budget we will come out with the
final budget where some of the text
structures that we want to put in to
simplify this reduction on text lab
etcetera can be looked forward people
should wait we will give more Bannister
there is more to ask for I would like to
say is that tax
assessment was a big problem in the
country there were a lot of corruption
there was lot of harassment virtual
assessment has been announced where the
individual taxpayer and the assessing
officer individually there is a complete
firewall between both of them with
virtual assessment assess he will not
know who is going to assess my income
and assessment officer will not know
whose income tax return I am assessing
so there there is completely no
subjectivity or no linkages between the
them so all harassment and tech that
some corruption etcetera bribe etcetera
issues come out they will also be sorted
out so there is completely
simplification of directx also along
with indirect tax under GST so it's a
dream budget I can tell you it's a dream
budget people are talking whether it is
the interim and final budget these are
simply nomenclature in Constitution
there is no differentiation between in
interim or final budget the government
with within its government is within its
power it to put up a budget in the last
year very very interestingly mr. Gopal
general said that first of all this
point on income tax I may also add
therefore even for scrutiny I think
you'll be picking up I am yes that was
one thing which was noticed by everyone
24 hours refund will compliment but we
are holding on to promise which he says
that the government will further reduce
but we will hold we will we will ask him
in further interviews but if I may say
so thank you so much mr. Gopal Agarwal
for sharing these points within the
budget your point on 9.5 black pack
exemption was actually important to a
lot of our middle class movers would
want to know such things but thank you
so much for the sparing your time for
this episode of policy and politics we
look forward to having you on our future
shows - thank you so much thank you for
joining us thank

day and call the disciplinary action
against poor offset them by now geez
offices include that of the DGP West
Bengal the EDG as well as the directors
decree of charity and another love this
other police officers who had been seen
in and around month of energy while
Donna was going on and calling in for
disciplinary action they have the chills
through the All India IPS officer to
take action against the IPS officer
okay so action has to be taken against
these IPS officers which are these
officers against whom now strict action
could be taken against whom they
actually should be taking she is very
who is the TTP single to me a DG
directed charity a neutral mouth a dg9
orders Jan maan Singh was the people of
Chanukah as well as also the Home
Ministry had written through the West
Bengal government to take an action
against the coldest Police Commissioner
it as to which month our Banerjee had
responded that he had not joined that
her now that was there on duty protocol
to provide security so this is the
latest action that has happened from the
three against the police officers who
had been seen
participating in there now that was
being done by the West Bengal Chief
Minister
but you know the argument that he was
really there on duty and not part of the
protest is difficult to digest as simply
because you know some of those officers
were sitting next to these politicians
these natha's
when that Donna was taking so how much
of the document will be bought by the
home Carter or the Ministry of Home
Affairs really remains to be seen you
trying to be bought because remember not
only does the police commissioner I
myself have seen the state security
advisers of this work are also to be
present in that Barry's are not sitting
beside months of honesty so there has to
be a very well explanation on what
grounds in the
security protocol could well be managed
by for the process themselves gain
people like these of the higher ranks
could have avoided at least sitting on
the teams or not or even appearing while
in their uniform so that is the same
reason why we are seeing the whole
ministry taking this action and writing
and city All India bullets so this is to
take an action against in fair point
indeed that these officers voided were
in uniform and were supposed to fulfill
their duty instead they were part of a
political protest more importantly AI
information also coming in is that they
made these these officers may be barred
from central deputation as well well yes
possibility that we could see that these
officials are being bad from the centre
deputation also because remember it was
a violation against their duty to
actually in any political event while
they were under the duty as the third
official most conduct so that here's the
reason why we esteem disciplinary action
be to recant them very significant also
that the center may strip the medals of
some of these officers it's the harshest
possible punishment or the action that
is being taken well absolutely and you
know this is something that is much
needed because we have these things for
quite some time even during that when
that is investiture ceremony that took
place meant that clearly keeps the
figure that you know we do see that how
political immunity is often given by
these later the top cops is actually the
most immediate thing especially to
ensure that you see the properly
followed other than by late say that
protocol which is well initiated under
that rule book right and you know as of
course we continue to focus of this this
raises also significant questions that
at a time when there are questions being
raised about the politicization of the
police forces in state after state code
such tough action by the center send out
a very strong message to the IPS
officers at large that you know you have
to have duty as your primary concern not
politics absolutely that but it is
whether
I'm descending out of the whole ministry
is the setting out by art in theology I
saw actually taken initiate reaction
against them because remember this time
is some talk of menses that they would
not get this new for they were not this
form that could not be functionary
debate that would Santa que the first
woman she had written to the West Bengal
government itself to take disciplinary
action against so Ajith Kumar himself to
which Montag clearly said that she would
not take any action against her favorite
prophet is she feels that they were not
violating duty but only giving security
are very sad claims that means right
it's good to be portion of a ministry as
well as right absolutely difficult to
buy that argument and how soon could
these entire you know measures be taken
stripping off the medals sending out a
message that they will be barred from
central deputation how how soon will all
these action be taken against these
police officers well it is proper
documentation of all the photos as well
al now the witnesses that they were
present on that very stage out in public
it could well be that by tomorrow we
could see where that action is softly
taken against the officials that have
been named by the Home Ministry so ahead
of Rajiv Kumar's questioning by CBI in
Sri Lanka on Saturday measures would be
taken against some of the senior most
officers in West Bengal police sending
out a very strong message
well absolutely so it was a much-needed
move also on the ground because remember
we have been teasing or picking up some
opposes that was planning to move along
he along with him one of their
additional deputy commissioners as well
as the Deputy Commissioner was being
planned to be sent by the Maharaja's
commercial on so this comes at a time
when the message is not needed that at
the end of the day no matter how much
you enjoy your political immunity
you cannot violate the protocol of your
duty that is bounded by same political
immunity for officers shreya is simply
that they will not be at the receiving
end of politicization of bureaucracy but
it cannot be one-sided so if they are
also in
in criticize ation of bureaucracy of the
IPA Officers Association so to say then
obviously action has to be taken against
these police officers and you but you're
in Kolkata you're you've got your ear to
the ground tell us what is it that some
of these officers are telling you some
of the officials who are there in the
Katsopolis now of course they obviously
enjoy the shielding that is beyond thing
because we saw that happening on that
day when the conference was taking place
the way monster Banerjee actually
avoided the audio that was taken by the
reaction she could well in place say
that she would actually conduct in the
occasional procedure and then see that
whether the measure could be taken on
whether our Kumar was there a part of
the or not but she did not write she
completely hushed it away and said that
we will not take any action the humanity
is completely on the lines that they
want to send out a message that the ID
field blank officials cannot violate
that you thesis protocol and that's what
a motley is move right stay with Austria
because I want to get in one of these
mandalas well joining us on the
broadcast mr. Mundell your first
reaction to a very strong message that
is being sent out by the Home Ministry
to the police officers of West Bengal
that they have to be above political
interests data led by the BJP and not
against I mean how can the police
officers be response over this kind of
zonna let me tell you
Chief Minister was sitting in that Nara
in Kumar was under the Jeep or all the
police officials they walk under the
Chief Minister and it was the kind of
spontaneous instant decision and there
is no stage stage at a point in time so
for the security reasons they have to go
there I mean I mean now if they want to
take action again is just come or
another this could be the most laughable
to Nehemiah panel for under the Sun even
the Prime Minister is having political
rallies the ability of officials around
him will Bob Williams should there be
action against these people
I mean this this bill government has
totally become bankrupt in you know man
G and but give me a minute I'm
come back and ask you those questions
but first I want to address more
breaking news coming in looking for
faster CBI has formed the team to grill
Rajeev Kumar remember in Sri Lanka is
when Raja kumara has to be grilled by
the CBI on your screens are those that
image that we have which talks about the
details of the officers that are
attached to the CBI for ensuring that
drilling of Rajeev Kumar takes place
there you can see temporarily attached
to CBI's office in Kolkata are about 10
odd officers let's quickly get an shreya
first all eyes now on that interrogation
that questioning of Rajeev Kumar that
will take place in Shillong on Saturday
is already 10 officials who include
bankotsu Rostova was design director of
severe cold guitar they've already
reached Kolkata today and you know we
expected that time around 11 to 12 we
will be seeing Rajkumar be questioned by
this newly formed team which has 10 CBI
officials working no down from their
leave already reached the CBI office and
now they will be traveling to Shillong
where they will be meeting Rajesh Kumar
for questioning him regarding the chit
fund camp mm-hmm okay
and this of course the team that has
been formed that does also include PK
Shrivastav the man and the officer who
was being manhandled that was the
allegation well yes definitely you know
his family members of us who allege that
they were being harassed pure by police
officials because you know that was on
their on camera we saw how the CBI
officials including the IO of the case
was manhandled the way they were picked
up and taken to a specially sauna I was
there myself had they could have easily
avoided the kind of fearful that they
saw behave there was a TV audition at
the end of the day those where officials
of India's premium investigating agency
like that was definitely not taken from
from any sport as such right and this
questioning of course just to tell our
viewers who are tuning in right now will
take place on Saturday
a as per of course that court directive
that came out right well it is expected
to be happening around the eleventh or
twelfth we have still not got the
official date the CBI will be officially
responding to the Kolkata political
commissioners request of appearing
before them on the 8th back today is
what we're learning but what is Rajeev
Kumar as the broker live in the morning
we'll be reading along by Tara day all
right
that of course is an important update
that shreya is giving us said that on
Saturday in Shillong is where Rajeev
Kumar questioning will take place and on
your screens are those officers who've
part of CBI's team for questioning of
Rajeev Kumar do we still have more as
each bundle with us okay yes Margit
Mandel then let me come back and ask you
the two questions one of course is that
the action that is being taken by the
center against these police officers at
some level it is important to send out a
message that officers they need to all
their allegiance to the oath they took
as officers and not to any political
master
so how they're violated these I don't
understand the chief minister in
sleepiness 110 years garna the officer
had to go therefore to protect our core
for the initial he was sitting there sir
Indrajith London he was sitting there of
course to sit down on the chair doesn't
be it was for all to see
I mean I mean haha this is again I'm
saying this is absolutely laughable in
that case why the Prime Minister or any
other Minister is on a rally and they're
around I mean will there be auctioning
is a discriminatory esteem I mean this
is what I'm saying
absolutely there is a difference there
Rajeev Kumar
isn't it so everybody knows the entire
genesis of the dharna you have already
we already proven the classic power is
being green an accommodation at you does
in comparison it is already proven
guilty
some media I'm not asking that the use
omnia have already declared Rajkumar
absconder know what we thought the
tilling abode you understand the meaning
of you know she RPG 160 and I had not
made immunity at all what I'm saying is
he will be questioned he will be
questioned on Saturdays all that I am
saying but what everybody is questioning
is why Posey is sitting next to the
chief that a clearly and and also the
TMC natha's that day clearly as part of
a political protest that is what many
people have an objection to that is
saying come on what is it model don't
extend your argument to such a laughable
extent you know it yourself that isn't
any rally that happens anywhere yes the
DM is is responsive running is the
protocol officer but is the protocol
officer also sharing the diets is he
also sitting next to all the political
leaders of any particular party when a
rally is taking place come on Tony in
your argument to such a laughable extent
reply you lie to me otherwise you have
your melodramatic replies apply I'm
asking you a question
all the time you orell you have the
undivided attention boy replying if you
have called me you need to listen
applaud you have your melodrama take
monologue all by yourself
you are not you are you a CBI officer I
can't kill me like this question what
you're not allowed me to answer because
he decided what to do come on playing
don't waste my time like life you don't
want to listen to me then please don't
call me and I'll reply I'm giving you
all the time the question is that why
Minister took this decision
spontaneously that she will go on a tour
now she is a chief minister Rajeev Kumar
is the box and aha
because she is also the home he has to
go and see whether the security of this
place is absolutely peaceful
did mr. Khanna was declared on everybody
can understand if that in foreign any
police officials need to go further on
which is not obviously I'm it according
to the certitude
they'd have studied the kumaras not
sitting continuously for the next 2-3
years up to the hours or the next day it
was it will be has to be done it was not
even ready their security was not even
ready it was an open space you are not
aware of this play place probably you
media persons one this this was done
this was being done yeah it was a
spontaneous decision okay all right
let's see if that argument fight with
the Home Ministry or not appreciate you
joining us who knows with Mandal we
clearly have a difference of opinion as
far as the role of Rajeev Kumar is
concerned let's go back to shreya with
us on this story now shreya of course
that is the view that you know the TMC
or Rajeev Kumar will have but the fact
of the matter is he could have if he was
just doing his duty he needn't have
decided to share the tires and sit next
to all the TMC natha's which he chose to
do Daria I have exactly two questions on
the cold ground that month our energy is
saying that Rajeev Kumar was there for
her security question it is Rajesh Kumar
a path of month of energy security team
how do we see the Kolkata Police
Commissioner travelling with mom
giving her security everywhere she goes
no we don't then that argument falls
completely flat when she says that the
Commissioner was there to give security
the second question that they keep
saying that they were ready to go ahead
and actually hear the cause of TBI it
was ready to actually go ahead and
object for the CBI might it be peak the
high cost to activity incident
protection to commissioner when
questioned them so when they actually
say a bee sting both crowds refute their
argument incompletely these false lat
absolutely thanks Ralph for those
details coming in let's shift our focus
now to more breaking news coming in on
the broadcast news is accessed
sumit chatez email but what rot the
email in fact mentions the money that
was sent on refurnishing London
apartment remember there are questions
being raised as far as a the email that
took place between Robert Vadra sundar
pandari and sumit chatter let's quickly
get in our Infanta joining us for the
very latest on this I don't take us
through what exists it's a male of 2010
soomi's data has written a meal to
Robert Vadra and some of that this male
has also come you know have have come
into public domain in 2016
some experts of this mailing so much
data actually talking about the house
which Robert Vadra has there in London
he's talking about which was the taking
place at at that point in time when so
much data was looking after the entire
refurbishing work house with in sooth
DVDs the work wouldn't work off for that
house very clearly mentioned in that
mail about the work which was the done
by like a rated 2d floor work you know
which tiles should be used and how hard
should be the texture of a bathroom and
what the paintings in the house and many
other details which have been mentioned
in this mail it has been written by so
much data to
Robert Vadra because you know robot has
completely denied that these charges by
Enforcement Directorate yesterday even
today when he was confronted with these
emails by the Enforcement Directorate he
was completely invasive on those charges
being that his daughter you do not he
does not know any one of them except
Manoj Arora because he was who was
working with him for for a while but
about Sanjay Pandaria mr. seta
he's not aware of these people and he
also does not own that email address
which is a written that made right you
know this is of course pertaining to
that Bronston Square mansion which was
purchased by proxy in 2009 and E and
sold in 2010 for the same amount so
obviously the questions have been that
if there was so much of money that was
spent as far as refurbishing is
concerned close to about sixty six
thousand pounds about 60 or lakh DS then
why was it actually sold at the same
amount that's that's correct because if
you see these main three is the first
main which is so Matata
tenth out Robert Vadra it's about the
detailing that what word sir was
required to actually refurbish the
entire house there that was the first
memory was talking about these details
these requirements and secondly when he
talked about about the expenditure which
is needed and he also spoke about that
funds he did not receive which was the
which he supposed to get from Manoj
Arora and then after thereafter he is
the response of Robert Vadra where he
says that he was not aware of these
things he will talk to Aurora in this
regard so all these conversations which
happened in 2010 between sue Matata and
Robert Vadra but Robert Vadra statement
is completely contrary to it he's the
he's not giving satisfactory answers to
he be saying that it is not his main
address he does not know any one of them
but now it remains to be seen because if
these email main fields now in the
public domain and
how it is going to take this forward
because remember baby has already you
know confronted Robert Vadra with all
other you know documentary evidence
evidence which they have which they in
fact got during the during the great
time in capital in other areas and they
have confronted over to être with these
details remains to be seen that because
even as we speak
a big questioning of Robert Vadra is
still on his inside the Enforcement
Directorate office yesterday we saw six
hours long and today again it's been
close to three hours since Robert what
was inside yes for half an hour he went
out for lunch and then again he came
back and you know that is exactly what I
was going to ask you that Edie
confrontative in some of these emails
yesterday some of them today what's been
the response of Robert Vadra because
yesterday in six hours all he said was
he denied any of these charges he's
doing today because what we have learned
from IEDs thoughts is that initially
when these senior officials of
Enforcement Directorate which includes
the joint director of EB and deputy
director and they asked him about the
documentary evidence which IDI has in
their possession and for those those
questions his answers were not
satisfactory and he was evasive and
secondly when the Enforcement
Directorate after the Robert Vadra about
the transaction and the access and the
possession you know on that regard he
merely stated that he does not own any
property in London Neil
neither neither directly not through any
soft sea so these are the responses
which orbit has been maintaining this
thing in yesterday that it does not have
any connection the money laundering case
is contained all right believe it there
appreciate you joining us on that story
and on that note a quick break on the
show we returned on the other side with
more news stay tuned

breaking news coming in right now on
your screen you can see Rahul Gandhi in
fact a Congress president remembers
there was a convention that he was to
attend earlier in the day and in fact
also address our life visuals coming in
off Congress president Rahul Gandhi even
as Robert Vadra continues to be
questioned by the Enforcement
Directorate he has in fact reach for the
general secretary meeting that will take
place and of course strategy to be
decided for the upcoming local elections
remember Priyanka Gandhi is also present
as part of these crucial meeting of the
general secretaries of the Congress
party let's get her as a truck
registered and for more of this Rajat it
was expected that this would be a
crucial meeting of the general
secretaries of the Congress party and
the strategy may be decided for the
upcoming elections
call this meeting of all general
circuitries at significant charges of
the signature of the strategy for 2019
general election and whoever that is
which is an unformatted reduction of
general security Priyanka Gandhi and
general secretary total of East India to
rest of the general secretaries and the
leaders of the party Priyanka Gandhi and
Jyoti lobbyists and they are to their
office yesterday ICC but to introduce
these periods to our other leaders
against these and organisation French
hey this is this is a place for me I'll
go to introduce their two new general
secretaries who will work and uh to the
rest of the Congress parties and
moreover they're going to separation
penka round on the end Judy Robinson
yeah they were taking feedback so much
another genetic at ease to what to do
with the alliances partners in other
states what should be the issues for
2019 general elections what should be
the style of campaign they should follow
and most will be the fact that Priyanka
Gandhi would be part of these meetings
formal introduction of Priyanka Gandhi
to the party she was appointed as a
journalist I guess she and the charge of
defense you feed the she took over our
office yesterday but to introduce
formally to the party to take part in
that we think she saw her for the
Priyanka Valley
it's the Debu meeting for to chase
around and he would be sharing this
meeting of general circuit design she
was part of the quitting let's see what
round you she is going to be the formal
introduction to the Congress parties
whose with this meeting she's taken over
her office yesterday but introducing
beyond car to the Congress party to the
other generals Piketty is the suit with
the platform and my eyes will be there
that yes what what what when car is
going to change this meeting how old
will deduce how other leaders are going
to welcome Priyanka on board on Congress
party yes absolutely and a broad
strategy as far as 2019 is concerned
would be decided or discussed rather in
this meeting isn't it a larger larger
picture can be clear for 2019 general
excise moreover for the Congress party
for the for the funeral
leaders who decide but moreover it's a
formal introduction I think for Priyanka
Gandhi to the party leader to introduce
Bianca as a journalistic 80 she has a
production of sister to Rahul and the
daughter to Sonia Gandhi but as a
general secretary of the parties except
first official meeting Congress
headquarters that would be Church by the
Congress president Rao who is his
brother all right absolutely in it this
happens at a time when her husband is
being grilled by Enforcement Directorate
see pink pink face with Robert Vadra
hatred also when she stepped into
Congress
she said that yes she stand by her
husband Robert water let's see if this
meeting is if someone raises some
questions some queries some suggestions
on Robert Vadra what's what being faced
by a companying Robert water to the ID
office it would be interesting then when
the meeting ends and DVD we shall get
something out of it that what being
concerned about Robert she's going to
say that yes it's my family I'll satisfy
her family what she said yesterday will
Congress leaders say that what what you
did yesterday was very right and we
appreciate as a family you did so this
would be interesting fact no classes
this meeting in yes absolutely remains
to be seen what's the word coming in
from some of the other general
secretaries now yes of course after the
president of the party it is the
organizational secretary as far as gel
secretaries is concerned who is going to
play an extremely crucial role as far as
these meetings are concern in your sense
you've been speaking to your sources
what are they telling you what could be
the broad shape that this meeting may
take Casey when you abolish the
generosity of fashion would induce this
new general you general second is that
that experience Agassi vatra and to
Jyothi resistant to rest of the general
spaghetti the second part of the meeting
ask and don't to be would be that would
be the strategy for 2019 general
election so what is the plan for the
Communist Party what are the issues
there have been some holbox given to the
general secretaries
gretel-ann stance for the skates I think
the coverage president would be
listening to the issues to the plan to
alliance partners this is all issues
discussed there right absolutely these
broad issues are likely to be discussed
in that meeting and do you expect a lot
of focus on otha Pradesh as well given
that his sister primary focus and
primary role is that of ensuring better
performance of the Congress and you be
used lights on there you PR not not only
you peel it's always you POV because a
theses of the looks about the largest
chunk of seats that comes from India
that suffered a so even charge to mister
Cynthia and all eyes will be on you P
you have given your two most important
pieces of the Congress party after after
a long time to separate except
difficulty stage you don't have leaders
who don't have all nations you don't
have drop levels worker how p.m. can
simply action turns out that tough of
all this party it would be interesting
to see him coming in leaving it there as
it appreciate you joining us on that
story okay those are live visuals coming
in as Rajat was pointing out that
organizational secretary kc venugopal of
course would initiate the proceedings
Priyanka Gandhi Joe therethis and they
are very much there as part of the
meeting of General of the Congress live
images coming in from the a ICC office
and all eyes of course the kind of
commentary that comes out after this
meeting ends broad contours of 2019
strategy may be put in place with this
sort of focus on other projects given
that for his sister though of course you
would have a national role the primary
role of course is around who the pradesh
on your strengths the Palama Vyasa
Mallikarjun car gay then of course Rahul
Gandhi
as well as far as this meeting of
general secretaries is concerned at the
AICC office two days back of course is
when trampled on Dee's nameplate also
went up she now occupies the room that
was given to her brother before he
became the president of the Congress
party as I said those are live visuals
meeting of general secretaries under
wave he was know exactly what comes out
any specifics that the Congress would
focus on there was a lot of expectation
that even both level management or there
could be some focus on that as well from
from Rahul Gandhi's side let's get in
with Lakshmi for more on this sir Vijay
also tracks the Congress very closely
for us which all lies of course on this
meeting and more importantly one cannot
miss the fact that all eyes on Priyanka
Gandhi who would be attending this
meeting
okay so we're having trouble connecting
with which I Laxmi right now as I said
all eyes now on not just the meeting
tree but on Priyanka Gandhi with us you
put in a suggestion whether she'll say
anything on this first meeting
would she have some ideas given that
interpretations likely to be a key focus
area for the party as Rahul Gandhi has
said time and again that that is where
the 440 volt jhatka would be given by
the Congress to the opposition parties
including Ally partners former ally
partners SP and BSP Kasich Reena Gopal
Mallikarjun Kali Ghulam Nabi Azad there
at that meeting presiding over the
meeting of general secretaries and Joe
characters and they remembered his
responsibility has been given the key
responsibilities of U P vest I believe
we have with Lakshmi back with us Vijay
as I said all I shown what comes out of
this meeting but also on Priyanka Gandhi
this is her first big meeting at a ICC
that's right and it's an important
meeting Gauri
because Congress party you know all the
general secretary charges of Congress
party are attending this meeting and
Congress is strategizing for its 2019
Lok Sabha election she and that's for
that this meeting has been calling so
it's Priyanka Gandhi watch was first
meeting as the general secretary in
charge with the eastern region of of
this so now we'll have to see what are
the meeting but of course you know one
will get to know what were her ideas as
press party strategy going forward for
2019 Lok Sabha election is concerned
till you know till now she's only
working for the party behind the curtain
but for the very first time she'll be
there along with the other general
secretary in charge of the Congress
party will be putting forth her ideas
how should party be fighting the next
election so once this meeting gets over
maybe we'll have a clearer you know
picture about what all has happened in
this meeting and what all did Priyanka
say and what all did Congress you know
what all will Congress party be
discussing meeting is concerned but
certainly this meeting has been called -
you know strategize but 2019
dr. by-election what are your sources
telling you we did the possibility of
Priyanka Gandhi coming out with some
broad suggestions in this are they
telling you that yes there are chances
that Priyanka may come up with some
specific ideas or would she you know
sort of take this slow and steady given
that she's just taken charge you know
she's been active as well as Congress's
the internal organization goes in past
also in the you know in the previous
assembly she was the one who did take
some decisions for the Congress party so
it's not something you know it's not
that the Priyanka is not a blank I was
not active earlier she was pretty much
active but she's not taken a role so now
after taking a role is going to be our
first meeting so we we are expecting her
to you know disgust us and things or you
know because she really you know broader
idea about the things as data
fortifications confirm so start speak or
once this meeting gets over then only we
will have a clear picture what all
happen what all will be transpiring in
this meeting so certainly but we'll have
to see what sort of ideas will she be
coming up as well as this meeting goes
because meeting currently is underway at
ICC at quatro where international
capital plan is there a palpable
excitement
given that the Carters for of the
Congress party were for long asking
Priyanka Gandhi to be inducted formally
you know yesterday when she took charge
there was literally chaos and commotion
at Congress headquarters because you had
so many Calcutta's who came to Congress
headquarters some of them wanted to meet
her some of them come came with their
own ideas and wanted Priyanka you know
to take these things forward but since
it's raining over here in Delhi today so
we couldn't see many Caracappa so there
were many people that many to greet
especially Priyanka before the meeting
began but since it's raining you don't
have many karakurt Azur hair but
personally has it not been raining in
more congress workers you know over here
at our congress headquarter
to see her or to meet you all right
living it there
joining us on that story as we talk
about Priyanka Gandhi well her husband
is being interrogated at the IDI office
documents in possession of the
Enforcement Directorate appear to put
Robert Vadra in the talk at these
documents in fact essentially email
extent exchanges in which Robert Watrous
name has appeared and the conversations
are of course being linked to the
restoration work of London properties
specifically there Branson Square 12
Branson Square mansion where a sale and
a resale happened even as extra
expenditure was incurred none of that
was taken into account when the resale
took place
Robert water has emails with assume the
person the Pandora's nephew as well as
Zuma cha-da
all of those are being investigated
questioned by the agency remains to be
seen whether or not there will be some
response coming in from Robert Vadra

[Music]
welcome back you're watching music's
with me to 18-hour day after the BJP
mentioned the Sunday garden story I'm
plotting of a pool now that then army
chief General Vijay Singh has hit back
specifically to news ex-general VK Singh
said that's here he had written to the
prime minister seeking uproar he said
those behind defaming the army needs to
be fun music sister publication revealed
that the top leadership of the UPA two
government back in 2011 had hatched of
attempted coup to divert the nation's
attention away from the massive
corruption charges the BJP has slammed
the Congress and the kanji family for
spreading these kind of malicious rumors
in fact we have accessed the letters
which were written by the ten army chief
VK Singh to the then home minister
Sushil Kumar Shinde in his letter it was
made clear that serious charges on how
the UPA government didn't act on his
complaint were made by VK Singh he these
letters remember show how despite Singh
in others claiming with the report of
the coup was false some elements in the
UPA were in fact stalling investigations
the letter in it say VK Singh there was
inaction complicity on the part of the
government all right let's get an
Afrikaner on this story and we also have
joining us we are here in the studio but
you know after to you first
explosive bit of information in the
exclusive story that we are putting out
that there was a communication that was
ticked that took place between the army
chief and Home Minister after that story
came out in 2012 no action was taken
well absolutely you see when general
mika singh was serving as the army chief
and obviously he couldn't come out and
open and speak his mind because he being
up in force and has to lead the lakhs
and lakhs of armament
he was at a very responsible position
but these communications which are
exclusively in opposition do clearly
indicate that even after he had retired
he did not let go and he wanted his name
to be cleared all you know aro
suspicions are surrounding him needed to
be cleared and that's why he had
aggressively written to the then
government the you paid to government
wherein the correspondence is clearly
stated which were addressed to the
Ministry of Home Affairs and also to the
Home Minister specifically Home Minister
Shinde which we have a copy of that
letter as well but this letter which was
written to the Ministry specifically
talks about inaction and complicity of
you know white collar criminals who were
trying to defame him and raise questions
about his integrity the army chief in a
democratic country trying to carry out
some rumors of carrying out some sort of
coup and also he says that previous
issue pertaining to the national
security and not just his but also the
integrity of the Armed Forces so this is
the communication which was initiated in
9th December 2013 we have many such
letters my colleague devika will give
you more details about these letters we
also know that he'd also taken recourse
of the legal notice which was written to
be then home minister mr. Shinde saying
that he had written several letters to
the defence minister to the prime
minister at that point of time but
nothing had happened there was not even
a reply to his communication and that's
why he had sent a legal notice to mr.
Shinde that why why he should not you
know not only was an inquiry not taken
the fact is we case in general we
kissing's letters also didn't get a
response from the UPA to monthlies okay
Derrick are not take us through what
exactly is it that as as arthur was
saying the
you'll notice that was also sent out by
Gen V kissing we have the letter here
with us and the lawyer here clearly says
that he has in fact a lot of times these
complaints were made to clients however
to his utter shock in dismay you've
chosen to disregard the said complaint
and reminder thereof by my client his
client was being the former chief of the
Army Staff of India which is VK Singh
and he has addressed these letters to
the Minister of Home Affairs so he says
that you have look at the words used
here
Gouri utter shock and to the dismay of
my client you have chosen to disregard
the complaints and of course this is a
very long legal notice it was sent out
then Home Minister
he further goes on to say that it
appears that you have willfully chosen
to ignore my clients complain so as to
deliberately stall and inquire in an
investigation against the offender's
named by my client in his complaint so
this becomes a very important aspect of
what really was in that legal notice
here we kissing of course alleging
through here is the Tony that you know
there was willful ignorance of what we
kissing had claimed then as well and of
course the lawyer then goes on to say
that this further discloses your
culpability in the abetment of such
offences by unconscious elements by not
acting against such elements in spite of
being a prized asked to the commission
of such offences so like he like Arthur
also pointed out several letters gory
were written by we casing but because he
did not get a response then he had to
take this legal recourse in which the
attorney has gone ahead and said that
you know they have of course in a way
raised an allegation against the Home
Minister as well that he willfully chose
to ignore all the the complaints that
were made by VK Singh and of course you
know the fact that it discloses the home
then home Minister's culpability in the
abet
of such offenses as well so these become
very serious allegations that were
raised by the former army chief in fact
stay with us David Carter I want to
quickly play out try to offer be kissing
your weakest being spoke to us let's
listen in
now your wall exposed this and I have
asked for inquiry into the whole thing
I've written to the prime minister so
that the whole thing can be enquired
into and all those will actually indulge
himself in prison by accusing the Armed
Forces of India need to be punished okay
so that a first was there will be
kissing responding to news X remember we
were the ones who broke this story as
far as the fake that was peddle the
narrative that was peddled under the UPA
era and you know after let me come back
to you that the 2013 exchange of letters
that we are putting out for our viewers
to see it very clearly shows how general
we kissing did try to get an inquiry
into this entire incident but none of
that happened well yes and we can very
well imagine the kind of frustration he
must be going through you know and it
was his fight back after having retired
as the army chief holding such a
sensitive and most powerful position in
the country he was in he was not able to
speak his mind at that point of time
when these rumors were being circulated
and none other than top before you PM
ministers were allegedly involved in
this sort of rumor mongering faking are
sort of you know story but you know
these letters also show his his his
conviction
you know he's convicted to ensure that
there's no blemish there's no spot on
his career even after he retired
remember an army you have the is most
paramount and that is what he was trying
to do fight back and write to the
ministry needn't concern you know
ministers he
Indian government to carry out a
full-fledged inquiry but for reasons
best known to t-then dispensation then
Quarry was not carried out then he had
to send a legal notice and despite that
we didn't see much happening and today
after the sunday Guardian has broken
this report there's a clamor for enquiry
the BJP is asking that the Parliamentary
Committee on defense should carry out in
full fledge inquiry now we are also
learning from thing that he's written a
letter to the prime minister
so now we can hope that the truth will
come out and and some sort of inquiry
into this matter will be carried oh yes
of course and you know there are some
questions that have also been raised as
to why did the BJP not of course
initiate inquiry into this should it
have these be classified the ID which
categorically denied any of those
possibility of a coup that narrative
that was peddled in 2012 by those
reports and of course that troop
movement which was called extraordinary
but was actually ordinary and very
routine is what general VK Singh had
said you know and before I move ahead
and talk about some of the other angles
and exclusive bit of information David
Carr let me also come back to you as far
as what really did the notice say that
general VK Singh put out through his
advocate and interest did it get a
response let me first ask you that and
then of course we go through some of the
other important points in that letter
right Gauri I think Arthur might be in a
better position to of course briefer
what really happened to a legal notice
because like I said this is when the
former army chief decided to take legal
recourse so he is bound by law to get a
response from the person he's serving a
legal notice to but in this legal notice
itself he does question you know as to
why legal action initiated against you
so they have gone ahead and like we've
shown of givers as well they really
spelled out whatever has happened over
the course of seven several complain
letters were written by the former army
chief himself which of course were
ignored over and over again and that's
precisely what led him to serving the
legal notice so writing all of this they
do ask the question the
you know they are wondering as to why
they shouldn't go ahead and just take
legal action against other than Home
Minister to whom this legal notice was
served but you know so many other things
that have also been spelt out he says
that you know all of this conduct by the
Home Minister
it just it shows that several elements
powerful arm dealers who have been known
to make frequent you know the corridors
of decision-making is well are all
involved all of their names would have
also been brought out if they would have
been disclosed if an impartial inquiry
was conducted with all of these pleas
off the army chief then Army chief were
ignored and therefore like I said gory I
think our third would be in a much
better position to brief us about what
really happened as far as the legal
recourse of the legal route is concerned
but they do question that you know we've
spelt out everything for you plus give
us one good reason as to why we
shouldn't go ahead and initiate a proper
legal inquiry into whatever was
happening and it didn't happen no
portent no court-martial happen as far
as you know the Army is concerned
remember army can also take some action
if there was any that didn't happen the
Home Ministry didn't take any action did
any action take wasn't initiated at the
level of the Prime Minister all those
are lingering questions that need to be
answered and in fact outside let me come
back to you before we go any further and
talk about you know some of the points
as far as you know the notice to the
then Home Minister but the fact is
general mika singh actually reached a
dead end didn't he yes absolutely that
appears to be the case you see there's
still no suspense as to what eventually
happened this must be you know confined
to the corridors of North Block and cell
block we do not know what actually
transpired but going by the kind of
communication which was initiated and
the kind of you know the process which
was followed up by general because
seeing it clearly goes on to show his
intention his intention was to get his
name clear in a democratic country like
India is very important to clear any
suspicion which surrounds the army
and especially where you have an
armature so obedient and has been
blemishless or all this right this was
an effort on his part to clear his name
but as you saying that even even when
the BJP came into power there was no
inquiry one reason could be that the
government didn't want to appear to be
opportunists and initial inquiry
surrounding its own Minister and then
target the opposition but now now that
after the reports have come out in the
sunday Guardian and there's a clamor for
an absolutely essential than in a
country like India India is not Pakistan
where army Jones carry out coup now and
then it's a country where the Army has
had a spotless you know sort of
illustrates bad wrong and it's it's
absolutely essential that a full-fledged
inquiry is carried out and more so when
the when the retired Army General
himself wants to enquiry to be initiated
right absolutely and that is that is the
big question and as I said if there was
any truth to any of those allegations
then why wasn't inquiry not ordered from
the Army's side as well there was no
action that was taken whatsoever and
also more importantly this was something
a story a report or a narrative that was
colored essentially that impacted the
morale of the world's second largest
army 13 lakh large force of patriotic
people their intentions were questioned
in one stroke by a reporter so quickly
in fact I listed into what exactly
version we kissing for news X in this
exclusive conversation listening to that
and then we move forward with me
External Affairs Minister general VK
Singh sir in music since sunday Guardian
have carried out an exposing that at
that point of time you know despite an
IB report giving a key to you a certain
ministers wanted this school story to be
carried out against you or you to say on
that say at that time also art said very
clearly
Indian army can never think of such a
thing and all those who are accusing the
Indian Army need to be proved I'd
written to the Ministry of Home Affairs
at that time and to the Home Minister at
that time my sentiments were echoed the
then rock shaman three and 3G in his
statements that there was nothing like
this which had happened yet such a thing
was played up now you all exposed this
and I have asked for inquiry into the
whole thing I have written to the Prime
Minister so that the whole required in -
and all those who actually indulge
himself in treason by accusing the Armed
Forces of India need to be punished to
be one of the most disciplined and
professional army in the world and you
know why do you think that you know that
this attempt was made at you and you
know this the entire cool story was made
against you what do you have to think
about that exposure has been taken out
by you you all find out we had said very
clearly there is nothing I've looked
into the eyes of everybody and said
there is nothing I'm saying so today
there was nothing no you will find out
why this has happened a rule of two UPA
ministers also come into picture I have
got no clue as to who was involved was
not involved from my side I asked the
Home Minister at that time to do inquiry
they should have done it last question
you know the Congress is now saying that
you know that this is an effort on the
part of the government to kind of as a
face simmer measure and they said if
there was such merit in this in this
particular exposure then you know the
government should have proved in the
last quarter if I did this exposure come
up in 2014 so why are you going by what
they are saying they will try to defend
themselves let them keep defending
themselves Vijay Singh with cameraperson
Jena British pop music's all right let's
listen in to some more reactions coming
in on the big story that we've been on

dear jack let's in fact also tell our
viewers that Congress has been brushing
off these allegations MP Tony Joker has
spoken out all the controversy let's
listen in to that as well there are no
coop taking place there is no any
substances I think the BJP in his
desperation is trying to rake up these
stories trying to plant these stories
there was never a coup nor anything
because at that time also it was
explained that all these movements which
happened were all within the standard
operating procedures of the army there
are those of course are reactions coming
in from the Congress ethically me come
back to you not the Congress brushing
aside these allegations they said did so
yesterday as well when we broke that
story and you know when we were talking
about it today also they continue to say
that there was nothing true as far as
the coup is concerned but the fact is
those lingering questions still say why
a probe wasn't ordered why is it that
general because things repeated letters
got absolutely no
yes Marilla you know these the dreamers
or rather a conspiracy to create a story
that
aku's to be carried out the is needed to
be cleared around it even after the
Intelligence Bureau had given its report
saying that nothing of that sort had
happened but if you recall at that point
of time there was great panic and and a
situation was created where in which one
would one was like that the Army is
going to descend over Delhi from various
places and take over the control of
entire capital that had created a
situation 8 it can't be called just an
aberration but even after the
Intelligence Bureau had submitted its
report the government should have looked
the role of people who were involved in
its top ministers why were they trying
to do it was it just to divert the
attention from the anti-corruption
crusade which was taken on the
government I do not believe that the
government should have had compelling
reasons not to carry out such an inquiry
which was required which was absolutely
essential to clear all doubts and you
know let's quickly address the other
breaking angle to the story as these
wind up troubling every angle of this
big story right here first on music
let's also tell our viewers that musics
has accessed Vika sings advocates notice
to then home minister Sushil Kumar
Shinde and he did make some very
explosive charges in that notice and be
kissing said that and he pointed
directly at the Home Minister claiming
that it was Shinde who willfully chose
to ignore and utter shock and dismay as
he was deliberately stalling inquiry
Arthur that has very very serious set of
charges that are being leveled by a
general Vika saying that it was the Home
Minister of that time who ensured that
knowing took place you see Gauri this is
that notice which was sent to Sushil
Kumar Shinde by by General V Casey
we should sing and look at the date it
was on 28th of February 2014
oh we're in his plane it's a show-cause
notice notice to show call as to why
legal action may not be initiated
against you the aforementioned addressee
in lieu of your failure to act upon a
complaint complaint a representative
presentation dated 13 November 2013
given to you by my client regarding
grave offenses of sedition christen and
violations of the Official Secrets Act
by certain individuals as also by you no
judicial intervention should not be
sought in the matter against you for
dereliction of duty in such a serious
matter that has direct implicates
implications on India's naturally well
if you go by this notice he had all the
reasons to send up a send this notice to
mr. Sushil Kumar Shinde
as you know in the past we've sent
several letters for enquiry but he also
writes and also as also in a blatant
disregard for national interest which as
the Minister for Home Affairs are under
oath to protect you have willfully
ignored such complaint and reminder
thereof given to you by my client which
is generally kissing now as we speak
Gauri a little while ago a colleague who
she had tried to contact mr. shishio
Kumar Shinde in Mumbai but unwilling to
comment on this
so clearly this something which the UPA
wants to hide I mean all they are saying
is that in all these allegations are
baseless and you know they are just
trying to defame the the Congress and
this I had of Lok Sabha elections but
they have some serious answering to do
to do absolutely all right on that note
we do need to slip into a very very
quick breather but we come back to the
story and as opted was pointing out
those explosive set of allegations and
charges leveled by Jen will be kissing
we continue to track those and be on top
of the story stay tuned we come back
after this very short break

will scrap the triple thalaaq law
interestingly the comments were made
with Rahul Gandhi being present on the
diocese meat ax throwing how Mr Gandhi
himself is backing this move and it's
interesting this is a move this is a
bill about gender justice and it is no
less than the Congress's women's being
president making that comment as the
2019 polls are inching closer BJP hit
out of the Congress for trying to
appease minorities even as gender

Kirk a or school occur there our point
of view is that during the election all
the political parties must try to
emphasize on the ground level issue that
is related to the common man and
religion I should play no role as far as
the election is concerned so sustain
your channel that a miffed Congress
party has issued notices to the missing
Congress Emily is to show up tomorrow at
the budget session or face expulsion
from the primary membership of the party
6 Congress Emily's have stayed away from
the opening tip budget session
triggering fresh speculations of
instability in the Congress radius
coalition government taking in fact at a
press conference Congress JDS have said
that BJP has in fact bought some of
their MLAs the parties claimed that BJP
is offering 50 crore rupees for each of
Congress and radius claim they will
release the proof of these kind of
allegations even as the BJP says it has
the numbers and canned majority now the
Emily's continue to remain Macomb
incommunicado once again
questions remain on whether or not this
government would survive its five-year
tenure
in there certain abuti
this government first when mr. Rader
Appa was the Chief Minister of Karnataka
he made operation Kamala which was not
thought of in the political area of this
country they started doing it and in
this government also when the people's
verdict came out that you are not for
the ruling party they did work as a
coalition party instead they are trying
to become the government by the back
doors however we have a control over the
party all over Emilie's are united some
for mls are they are trying to get some
blackmailing package in that process
they struck up in BJP Specter in
maharashtra government is keeping with
their workers and some gündüz quarrel
between sitaramayya and Kumar Swami
every day we see him seed raamaiah
hello saying sit drama is our cm JDS
people saying Kumar Swami this
difficulty government is not Joe militia
leader car Hey push me opposite not
baseball hey he the Sagada that log
either has anyway Raja may burn for
ahead who's killing a circle Cucina kiya
hey rocky Musa dude Veronica Akashi say
mr. karate hey javi I'm karate ah hey
mr. Kirk a gentleman named john amato
JDS cabin a congress given a dose at
milker sir correction we sir corrosion
wound Ichabod DOMA commentary hey exert
karma damu Kaman three commercial
children is Kelly a gentleman our vomit
nice to hear
okay another day another drama continues
as far as Karnataka is concerned so that
I may issued a whip remember when a whip
is issued then if party leaders do not
obey that then it actually means that
they are facing expulsion so these
leaders are willing to face expect from
the primary membership of the Congress
party 9 Emily is still missing six of
them from the Congress - from JD s and
one from Jarius and to independence now
that of course has been leading to a lot
of Drucker's in the assembly you can see
those phenomenal scenes of chaos that
happened yesterday and today tomorrow is
when the budget will be presented
remains to be seen whether the finance
bill would be passed or not remember
finance bill needs to be passed if it
isn't then of course the government
falls on the floor of the house hurry
super they are joining us for the very
latest hurry sure it's interesting
tomorrow is when the budget has to be
presented and we still don't know
whether Kumaraswamy government has the
numbers to get that finance bill passed
or not
both to try to get this project but not
what their understanding is that visit
we now think that they'll allow for the
budget to be tabled later on like this
board shall vote next week sometime
that's when they will try and ensure
that particular comment this majority of
the government doesn't manage this
divided and responsibility for that that
seems to be the idea of for the BJP
right now but number idea of for the
busy now but numbers still in our favor
claims to Congress because a good
hundred and eighteen is their money
right now after those independence we do
support as well and they are saying even
at least four or five Emily's do not
turn up tomorrow for the CLP or for Rob
so even when the budget is put forward
even then they are saying our number
will be around 130 means the house will
come down and they will manage if we
pass the budget the budget will pass the
Kumaraswamy government lives to survive
another day another such battle but no
let me are they said what is it with
this with this coalition government
every couple of weeks we continue to
have the same set of issues coming in
again and again towns and rounds of
resort politics in Karnataka obviously
you as one of the karate guys who voted
in this election didn't vote for this
chaos
in their connection absolutely we saw
the same scenario the same scenes in
2008 and 2010 we all thought that we
won't see any such events happening in
Karnataka we will have stable
governments or at least the entire the
cutting across party lines the
politicians would have got the message
that people would they are not
appreciating this but looks like it's
continuing even now look at the kind of
numbers that's being spoken about we are
talking about 30 50 60 crores per MLA
and the most unfortunate bit is that
tomorrow the budget will be presented
over the last two weeks we haven't seen
a single discussion or any of these
parties talking about the budget what
could be in the budget or what should be
in the budget what is people's
expectation what Bengal who needs the
city is struggling for the last two
years for infrastructure funding the
focus hasn't been on that all the
focuses who's in the resort which side
of which camp how many numbers will the
government managed to keep its numbers
this has been the discussion and that's
what is earth many people work in their
favor
many JDS leaders we are saying that
people will recognize that we haven't
been allowed to form the government
perform the government and then work
properly peacefully the BJP on the other
hand says we will get sympathy
many people will understand that despite
getting hundred and we haven't been
allowed to form the government both wins
both sides claiming that they will get
sympathy but anger is what currently
people have okay we leave it there
Harish let's see I'm sure we'll have
this conversation tomorrow morning as
well ahead of the budget and all eyes on
how long the Kumaraswamy government
survives shifting focus now to Robert
Vadra is interrogation which resumed
once again today after a marathon
questioning yesterday documents in
possession of the IDI appear to put atre
in corner these documents are email
exchanges in which avatara's name
appears and the conversation is linked

plotting off a cool now that then
general army chief General Vijay Singh
has hit back speaking exclusively to
news a share will be getting said that
he has written to the prime minister to
look into this matter and has also
sought a probe to find out who defamed
the army newzik sister publication
revealed that the top leadership of the
UPA two government back in 2011 tried to
hatch an attempted coup to drive out the
nation's attention from massive
corruption charges it was reeling under
the BJP has slammed the Congress and the
Gandhi Parivaar for spreading lies and
of course politicizing the army with
most external affairs minister general
VK Singh so in music since sunday
Guardian have carried out an expose that
at that point of time you know despite
an IB report giving a clean sheet PU a
certain ministers wanted this school
story to be carried out against you or
you to say on that C at that time also
art said very clearly Indian Army can
never think of such a thing and all
those who are accusing the Indian Army
need to be proved I had written to the
Ministry of Home Affairs at that time
and to the Home Minister at that time my
sentiments were echoed by the then rock
shaman three and 3G in his statements
that there was nothing like this which
had happened yet such a thing was played
up now you've all exposed this and I
have asked for inquiry into the whole
thing I have written to the Prime
Minister so that the whole thing can be
enquired into and all those who actually
indulgence reason by accusing the Armed
Forces of India need to be punished is
considered to be one of the most
disciplined and professional army in the
world and you know why do you think that
you know that this attempt was made at
you and you know this the entire cool
story was made against you what do you
have to say about that
exposure has been taken out by you you

nothing I have looked into the eyes of
everybody and said there is nothing I'm
saying so today there was nothing no you
will find out why this has happened a
rule of two UPA ministers also come into
picture I've got no clue as to Paul was
not involved from my side I asked the
Home Minister at that time to do inquiry
they should have done it last question
you know the Congress is now saying that
effort on the part of the government to
kind of as a face-saving measure and
they said if there was such a merit in
this in this particular exposure then
you know the government proved in the
last quarter to find mom did this
exposure come up in 2014 so why are you

fDmuoB0opMw,Didi Vs Centre: Punishment over participation in dharna; centre may issue advisory,Sources: MHA asks WB govt to take action against cops. Centre could take back medals given to cops at Dharna cite. Centre asks ...,2019-02-07T11:44:57Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fDmuoB0opMw/hqdefault.jpg,"that Ministry of Home Affairs has asked
the rest Bengal government to take
action against all those police officers
who were sitting on turneth that day
Center could in fact even take back the
medals that were given to these police
officers at that darkness site and
remember the centre has also asked the
West Bengal government to act against
the police officials who were act as an
aside because it's clearly violative of
the oath that these people have taken as
officers remember this happened in a
clear act of defiance mamta Banerjee
remember had moved the venue of the
ceremony and decided to give away these
awards these medals having a pardon to
police officials from the Dharma site a
couple of days back and now the Ministry
of Home Affairs the noodle ministry has
taken strict objection to that and in
fact has said that there may even be
punishment for participation in aterna
given that it was a political protest
and the bureaucracy the officers cannot
be seen to be part of a political
protest let's get into our Chatterjee
with the very latest on this shreya what
exactly is the Home Ministry saying here
the officer who had joined on ogee
include that of the DGP well as the
director security and other police
officers who had been seen in and around
month of energy while Dena was going on
and calling in participatory action they
have this will know the All India IPS
services that you take action against
these the IPS officers
okay so action has to be taken against
these IPS officers which are these
officers against whom now strict action
could be taken the officers against whom
the action needs to be
Mirinda who is the TPP or / singleton
eco Marvin Lewis EDG directed purity a
neutral Mouse ad g9 orders Jan maan
Singh was the people of another as well
as earlier also that one ministry had
written true the West Bengal government
do to take an action against the coal
that has police commissioners it as to
which Mamta Banerjee had responded that
he had not joined that her now that was
there on duty protocol to provide
security so this is the latest action
that has happened from the well it's
three against the police officers who
had been seen participating in better
now that was being done by the West
Bengal Chief Minister but you know the
argument that he was really there on
duty and not part of the protest is
difficult to digest just simply because
you know some of those officers were
sitting next to these politicians these
Netta's
when that Donna was taking place so how
much of that argument will be bought by
the whole Carter or the Ministry of Home
Affairs really remains to be seen is
futile to rebirth because remember not
only does the police commissioner also I
myself have seen the state security
advisors so this Burkart pure açaí so
also to be present in that Barry's are
not setting the side month of anarchy
so there has to be a very well
explanation on what grounds in the
habitual security protocol could well be
managed by for the process themselves
Jane people like these of further higher
rank could have avoided RT sitting on
the seams are not or even appearing
while in the uniform so that is the same
reason why we are seeing the Home
Ministry taking this action and writing
and so the all-india foolish to take an
action against the same FairPoint indeed
that these officers voided were in
uniform and was supposed to fulfill
their duty instead they were part of a
political protest and more importantly
Sree our information also coming in is
that they made these B's officers may be
barred from central deputation as well
well yes there is a huge possibility
that there we could see that these
officials are being barred from the
centre deputation also because remember
it was a violation again
that UT to actually participate in any
political event while they work under
the duty as the third official most
conduct so that here's the reason why
we're seeing this disciplinary action
being actually initiated against them
very significant also that the center
may strip the medals or some of these
officers it's the harshest possible
punishment or the action that is being
taken absolutely and you know this is
something that is much needed because we
have been seen for quite some time even
during that when the investiture
ceremony that took place government that
clearly to give the figure that you know
we do see that how political immunity is
often given by these leaders to the
table this actually was immediately
especially to ensure that you see the
properly followed rather than by leads
through that protocol which is well
initiated under that rule book right and
you know as of course we continue to
focus of this this raises also
significant questions that at a time
when there are questions being raised
about the politicization of the police
forces in state after state could such
tough action by the center sent out a
very strong message to the IPS officers
at large that you know you have to have
duty as your primary concern not
politics absolutely that but it is very
far the Medical Center is sending out
that of the Home Ministry is the setting
out by art in geology I saw actually
taken initiate actually I guess the
biggest remember this - thumbtack Osman
sees that they would not kept this knew
but they were not inform that could not
be functionary debate that good time
because the woman she had written to the
West Bengal government to take action
against to a discover himself to which
month I nearly said that she would not
take any action against David prophet is
she feels that they were not violating
duty but only giving security or very
fast claim that it's good to be boss in
both of our ministries well as your
little is nothing
right absolutely difficult to buy that
argument and how soon could these in
tired
you know measures be taken stripping off
the medals sending out a message that
they will be barred from central
deputation how how soon will all these
action be taken against these police
officers well if there is proper
documentation of all the protocol as
well as how the witnesses that they were
present on that very stage which is
already out in public it could well be
that by tomorrow we could see where that
action is softly taken against the
officials that have been named by
dominant so ahead of Rajeev Kumar's
questioning by CBI in Shillong on
Saturday measures would be taken against
some of the senior most officers in West
Bengal police sending out a very strong
message
well absolutely so it was a much-needed
move also on the ground because remember
we have seen tea or picking up the mess
that was planning to move along not just
he along with him one of their
additional deputy commissioners as well
as the Deputy Commissioner was seen
plans to be sent by the government along
with Rajas forgot to she long so this
comes at a time when the message is
mostly just that at the end of the day
no matter how much you enjoy your
political ability you cannot violate the
protocol of your duty that is bounded by
this same political immunity for
officers RIA is simply that they will
not be at the receiving end of
politicization of bureaucracy but it
cannot be one-sided so if they are also
indulging in criticise Asian of
bureaucracy of the IPS officers
association so to say then obviously
action has to be taken against these
police officers and you but you are in
Kolkata you you've got your ear to the
ground tell us what is it that some of
these officers are telling you some of
the officials who are there till the
Kolkata Police now of course they
obviously enjoyed the shielding that is
beyond pain which is we saw that
happening on that they did when the
conference was taking place the way
Monza Banerjee actually avoided the
audio that was given by the community to
take in the reaction she could well in
place me that she would actually
conducting the operation or procedure
and then see that whether the measure
could be taken on whether
why was there a part of the or no but
she did not hide she completely hushed
it away and said that we will not take
any action the whole ministry doing this
is from preaching on the lines that they
want to send out a message the glidepath
rank official cannot violate that you
see the protocol and that sort of muscly
did move right stay with Austria because
I want to get in Manos each bundle as
well joining us on the broadcast mr.
Mundell your first reaction to a very
strong message that is being sent out by
the Home Ministry to the police officers
of res Bengal that they have to be above
political interests in a vendetta played
by the BJP enough against I mean how can
the police officers be responsive on
this kind of Donna let me tell you Chief
Minister was sitting in the Dinaric
Kumar Watson was the chief minister or
all the police officials they walk under
the Chief Minister and it was a kind of
spontaneous instant decision and there
is no stage stage at a point in time so
for the security reasons they have to go
there I mean I mean now if they want to
take action again it's just more another
this could be the most laughable to
Nehemiah panel for under the Sun in that
case even the Prime Minister is having
political rallies their ability of
officials around him will work Williams
should there be action against these
people I mean this this bill government
has totally become bankrupt yeah you
know man geez and but give me a minute

big story that we are tracking at the
top of the broadcast Robert Vadra has
appeared before Edie we are getting you
those visuals of Robert Vadra appearing
before Edie he is going to be faced with
a long list of questions by Enforcement
Directorate for the second day today
remember he was questioned for as long
as five hours yesterday he clarified
that he had absolutely no roles on the
alleged deals he also clarified that he
owns no properties he will be facing
Edie for the second day today
all right so that of course is the big
story we are tracking at the top of the
broadcast
Vadra there on your screens remember he
appeared before enforcement directorate
for the second day today
yesterday it was his first appearance
before enforcement directorate he came
along with his wife Priyanka vara and
today is the second day that he will be
appearing before enforcement directorate
he is going to be facing a long list of
questions and the questions of course on
your screens
remember BJP also conducted a press
conference yesterday making some very
very serious allegations and charges
were levied on Robert Vadra my colleague
Pankaj Mishra joining us on the
broadcast with more details Pankaj there
is going to be a long line of
questioning that Robert Vadra will be
facing by Enforcement Directorate today
yes absolutely sure they and musical
learnt it from the sources that's how
broad what was likely to be fishing
today
remember six our long drilling yesterday
and all all that came out was the denial
from Robert what was or what was so
today it means that he is changing tack
and they are going more director on
Robert Vadra questions like you know all
the properties that were brought the
Penniman properties which he claims were
bought on behalf of Robert Vadra the
money laundering the amount that was
used to buy those properties all those
links PD is planning to use all those
documents to confront to Robert water
today and the sources also say that
Robert water had emailed Banderas
nephews so MIT Chadha giving him clear
instruction in which address and
multiple emails all these claims are
made by EDF now those emails are mark to
Sanjeev and re
and whare the reports also say that
Vadra actually responded to those emails
and gave the nod to go ahead and buy
properties in London yesterday's
questioning focused on the houses on
properties in in London which will Vadra
categorically denied today he is
sharpening the attack and it is taking
the line of questioning to a different
level
alright Pankaj appreciate you joining us
with all the details on that story
joining me on the broadcast at this
to time my colleague Arun hanta I don't
it appears that ad was not very
satisfied yesterday with Vadra answers
and hence the second round of
questioning today
well that's right yesterday if you
remember that it was a six hours long
interrogation which happened at the
Enforcement Directorate the officer in
Delhi and now again they the summoned
Robert Vadra today at 10:00 10:30 to
actually take the investigation forward
remember yesterday at around a 4:00 p.m.
in the evening when robert watt rah
along with penka gandhi Vadra
reached at the IDI of it and after
dropping Robert Vadra blinkers and the
other left and post that Robert Vadra
left at around 9:45 without speaking
anything it was his lawyer who spoke and
said that they are completely
cooperating with the agency and whenever
it is required in the future they will
be giving their presence here at the IDI
office and also he did not meet it did
not to make it very clear that there
when it was going to be the next hearing
but later on when we confirmed from IAD
sources we got to know that he has been
asked to appear before Eid Eid today
which means that yesterday's six hours
the grilling of Robert Vadra was not
satisfactory because according to our
sources he was evasive he was not giving
satisfactory answers especially when he
was asked about his London properties or
his relationship with people like Sumi
Chadha Sanjeev and re and Manoj Arora
his answer was very simple and clear
that he does not know anyone by the name
of Sanjeev and Ari or so mr. Chadha yes
he knows a manager or because he worked
in his one of the companies which is a
skylight hospitality for a couple of
years and therefore he knows him and as
far as that the details of those
properties in London London London are
concerned that something which he does
not have any idea does not own any
property there in London that was the
answer of Robert Vadra and he was also
very reluctant and evasive we also
learned that close to three close to
thirty five questions which Edie asked
Robert Vadra especially the senior
officials of Enforcement Directorate
team led by the joint director of
Enforcement Directorate who was
questioning Robert Vadra in this regard
and for today we are learning that there
are there are male mindful which has
which has they which is in the
possession often force
director they're going to confront
Robert Vadra with those a male field
because remember in that male field
Robert Vadra was also mentioned and he
has also given his consent to buy those
properties so that is going to be very
crucial that how is going to respond to
those queries of the Enforcement
Directorate officials when they confront
him with these emails because he's a his
email address is in the CC of that male
trainee and he has also responded to one
of the one of the males as well and also
the the questioning will be on on on on
those deals which which which happened
in 2008-9 during the UPA to stand or
where it was being alleged that some
kickbacks were received by the company
of Robert Vadra in some some of the
petroleum and defense deals which he
routed to Goethe to shell companies to
buy the the lands in London through his
proxies and when it comes to proxies
then these people like Sanjay Bhandari
and so Matsuda you know come into
picture so it's going to be very
important and crucial that how this
investigation and interrogation go
forward because as we know the history
of Enforcement Directorate it takes many
days or months of questioning before
taking the investigation or
interrogation in in one direction so in
this case even if today the the
interrogation gets over we expect that
Robert Vadra may have to come back for
the interrogation by Enforcement
Directorate but not something which is
unclear at the moment and also remember
it was the quote who instructed Robert
Vadra to do to cooperate with the
investigating agency in this regard the
money-laundering case and therefore
Robert Vadra had to come before the
Enforcement Directorate yesterday before
this he was very evasive he was not
really following what bhadra says we're
given to understand that Edie has
documentary evidence that you know sumit
Chadha
the nephew of pandari emailed both Vadra
and cha-da and in fact Vadra was Marvel
news email so there is documentary
evidence to suggest that he know both
the men in question
well that's right yesterday if you
remember Shweta the questioning was
related to males but he was not
confronted with these in the mail trails
today what we are learning from our
source is that as you rightly mentioned
that the names of these people are
mentioned there in that mill trail even
Robert Vadra had had responded one of
the male's related to to buying the
property in London so he'll be
confronted with those those males then
we have to see that how is going to
respond to those those queries and also
as some of the documentary a documentary
evidence which he has in their
possession remember in the in past few
weeks we have seen the rates being
conducted by Enforcement Directorate in
different parts of Delhi especially the
offices like Manoj eroded because
manager or Road I remember he worked for
this skylight hospitality which is the
company of Robert Vadra so his places
were also raided some of the documents
were also recovered from his place in
Jagdish Sharma is said to be a close
aide of Robert Vadra his office at mal
Jamar was also raided so they you know
they've got some documentation with them
some documentary evidence with them and
therefore they would they would want to
confront Robert Vadra with those
documentary evidence so we have to see
that how long today's questioning is
going to last because that is also going
to be very crucial yesterday it was a
six hours of grilling for Robert Vadra
and today now the timing was at around
10:30 which was given by the Enforcement
Directorate to Robert Vadra to join in
the interrogation but he reached a you
know post 11:00 at the office of
enforcement directly so we all are all
are waiting that how long it is going to
take for this interrogation off today
well it's going to be a long
investigation long reading of Robert
Vadra as it happened yesterday or it's
going to be a slightly lesser than
yesterday all right that of course has
to be seen during the course of the day
but for the benefit of our viewers the
gates you know dates back to the PMLA
allegations that have been leveled on
Robert Vadra that he has movable and
immovable property now if you look at
the details of the case it is suggested
or it is in fact alleged that Vadra has
properties worth 50 and 40 lakh two
houses worth
50 and 40 lakh respectively he has eight
more flats and properties in London so
the allegations are very very serious in
this case that he has properties and
flats in London worth lakhs and lakhs of
rupees and all these properties have
been bought a via money that was
laundered from India
well uh strata initially Enforcement
Directorate got the tip off of these
properties there in London now according
to Enforcement Directorate they're
saying that the the worth of these
properties is close to 1.9 million
pounds in London now according to BJP
because if you remember yesterday the
press functions done by the Sampath
Patara and he says that seven to ten
properties are there which belongs to
Robert Vadra and BJP also brought about
this this relationship between between
that deal which happened in 2008 nine
related to some of the petroleum and the
defence deal which happened and that
money the kickbacks which allegedly
Robert Vadra as the company received at
at that time that money was used to
actually buy those properties in London
and some of the ad sources are telling
us that there are multiple other
properties which which has been bought
by the associates of Robert Vadra in
different parts of London some of the
villas and some of the bungalows and
some properties are in Dubai as well and
remember that there are a few companies
with shell companies which has has come
to fore in Dubai just to do these these
these you know transactions of money
from one place to another and that was
also one of the crucial point which Edie
asked Robert Vadra yesterday about the
transaction and the possession and the
assets which he holds you know and
especially that if he has that property
in London where did he go where did he
get the money to buy those properties so
as you like you mentioned that the
statement of Robert Vadra is being
recorded under the PMLA which is the
Prevention of Money Laundering Act so
it's going to be very important that how
a thing spans from now onwards because
we all know and everyone is talking
about it that we are very close to 2019
general election and it is really
peaking because BJP is trying to utilize
this opportunity we we have seen
yesterday some with Batra
talking about Gandhi family and Robert
Vadra stating that all the family
members of Gavi family are out on bail
with Sonia Gandhi but is Rahul Gandhi or
it it is Robert Vadra because we all
know that Robert Vadra has also taken
interim relief from the Dell
hi coat and therefore it was the it was
on the pretext of Delhi High Court they
mandated Enforcement Directorate to
actually interrogate Robert Vadra gave
the date for Robert Vadra to appear
before the Enforcement Directorate
yesterday because earlier he was evasive
yesterday we heard his lawyer very
categorically saying that he was not
evading enforcement directorate he was
out of the country for the surgery of
his daughter and there was no summon
which was issued by the Enforcement
Directorate to them they voluntarily
asked for this thing they voluntarily
came for this interrogation but in
reality it was the court who asked
Robert Vadra to come which was issued by
the Enforcement Directorate to them they
voluntarily asked for this thing they
voluntarily came for this interrogation
but in reality it was the court who
asked Robert Vadra to come before the
Enforcement Directorate take the
investigational interrogation forward
all right and a very interesting sight
yesterday when Priyanka Gandhi Vadra
also came along with her husband in a
show of solidarity there was a larger
political message wasn't it Arun that
look he is not a liability and Congress
party and I stand with him
[Music]
well it's it's amply clear now because
we all know Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has
given the responsibility as the general
secretary of the Congress party and the
general secretary of the Congress party
and especially that tooth purplish is a
very very powerful position and we all
know that she comes from the family as
well and she's coming with the Robert
Vadra here at dropping him outside the
Eyrie headquarters and especially when
Robert Vadra being interrogated by the
Enforcement Directorate the messaging
and the optics were very clear that the
Congress party is fully backing Robert
Vadra you know come what may you know
BJP say says anything but they are fully
backing Robert Vadra in this case and
they are saying that it's the misuse
it's the witch-hunt it's the when data
which this current discipline
dispensation is resorting at Robert
Vadra
and that of course came over is after
you know some bit path redress that very
very crucial press conference saying
that Robert Vadra did not just gain from
you know petroleum deals but also
defense deals making very very serious
allegations and this of course dates
back to UPA regime to in during you know
2008 and 2009 saying that Robert Vadra
was the Zdenek direct beneficiary of
every deal that happened that transpired
when UPA to was in power
well at the jive shredder which came
from somewhat betray yesterday that
Robert has become her own party from
Road fatigue so that's the joy which
came from sublet battery yesterday and
yes of course they talked about the
properties in London which is not you
know less than five it's it's beyond
five with the property which he owns in
London also he spoke about that deals
which happened in the UPA two era where
some of the petroleum deals and the
defense deal took place where kickbacks
elastic backs were received by the
companies of Robert Vadra and you know
to actually you know take that money out
of the country through shell companies
he bought those lands in in in in in
London and that was one of the one of
one of the line of questioning of
enforcement directory that where did you
get the money to buy this probe with
these properties and they also checked
about the transaction which happened in
that period but the WHA draw this
response was very clear that he did not
know anyone you know related to these
properties which they have bought in
London Lee he does not have any relation
with any of them and he does not own any
property there in London so we have to
see that how how today's questioning
actually going to move forward and what
is going to come out from today's
interrogation and how he is going to
take this case forward from today
onwards whether they're going to you
know call Robert Vadra once again in
commute is or it is going to complete
their interrogation from Robert Vadra
and to move a in this case alright so
that of course remains to be seen as to
when Robert Vadra comes out from Edie's
office this morning or in appreciate you
joining us with all the details we will
keep tracking that story very very
closely throughout the day today but

which had been filed by attorney general
and the Union government for his tweets
on a 1st of February remember portion
and accuses center of manipulating
minutes offer meetings of the
high-powered Committee on browse
appointment as the interim chief
Prashant Bhushan had claimed that
Mallikarjun colgate elo P who was a part
of the Select panel had told him that
the government had manipulated the
meeting of the minutes of the meeting
which had taken place between the p.m.
CGI and the L o P of course suppose that
we had seen or AG had to file a contempt
petition norm it's extremely unlikely
that AG files content petitions but now
looks like trouble could be increasing
from pocket pressure on portion as a
notice has been issued to him Jessie
lands joining us live o on that to a big
story Jessie Linda SC has now issued a
notice I believe to advocate to show
emotion on the condemned T which had
been filed by the Attorney General I
tell us so what all happened in the
cordon could that spell trouble or for
mr. Bhushan reply I mean he normally
gives to the court he has been given
three weeks time to furnish his reply
and during the course of which he will
of course you know contemplate on what
to say and what not to say and how to
actually respond to the notice that has
been issued reply I mean he normally
gives to the coat he has been given
three weeks time to furnish his reply
during the course of which he will of
course you know contemplate on what to
say and what not to say and how to
actually respond to the notice that has
been issued to him but coming to what
really happened there in the court
basically our admission is the one who
was actually hearing the plea and he
during the course of the hearing did
observe that you know the code of course
is not averse to no media reporting on
quote matters but then whenever a matter
in subsidies lawyers who represent and
the petitioners will love to observe
some kind of a restraint and the Mishnah
justice arm be sure and also did say
that you know the court was aware of the
kind of you know assault on the dignity
of people you know by a reckless comment
which of course then I could really rob
them of all their dignity and respective
without you know following the due
process of loss so these are all issues
and also you know he did add that you
know he was not in favor of actually
punishing Prashant Bhushan for his speed
because he
said that it's a kind of a Brahmastra
which has to be used sparingly so that
you know the effectiveness of the weapon
is not lost so these are all of course
you know the observations made when ago
Paul of course the Attorney General
didn't want for a Prashant Bhushan to be
punished but in the center of course was
in favor of punishing him for whatever
he had tweeted so now it remains to be
seen what I never reply he gives at the
end of three weeks and how the code use
it take us through what this content
petition was about mr. Bhushan on here
of course and accuse the centre of
manipulating minutes of the meeting of
that high-powered committee or Annunaki
to arouse appointment as the interim
chief in fact he'd even mentioned I
believe that it was mr. kargh ADL Opie
who had informed the Sun Bhushan about
this a manipulation or rather the
alleged manipulation of the meeting
minutes of the meeting of the Select
panel well that's right you know I mean
this of course that happened after the
tussle came in the public domain between
the number one and number two Allah
karma and Rakesh Astana there in the CBI
after which you know there were diverse
sort of the responsibilities late in the
night and then you know a mantra was
brought in as the interim CBI chief this
of course is in connection with that
particular meeting that was held there
to bring in a negation when I was the
interim chief so basically the
allegation in his suite was that the
centre had manipulated the minutes of
the meeting you know and that of course
then I was dead not taken kindly to by
the centre and Attorney General and
therefore they moved the court seeking
contempt proceedings against him and you
know the rest of course is history we
heard whatever and Mishra said in
whatever submissions are read by a
window Gopal himself now it remains to
be seen what reply pressure buton gives
at the end of the three weeks he himself
was present during the course of the
proceedings and when the notice was
issued that said the notice and so three
weeks time which was granted

today is happy free minister of housing
and urban office I remember you wanted
to fight from pada I was asked at one
state would you be willing to fight the
Lok Sabha election and I said most
certainly this is a party will ask you
are told by the time so I consider
myself as a carrier kurta at the moment
I am a elected member to the Raja suffer
from you P whatever the party wants a
given point of time but this is not a
party where people go around lobbying
for things you're told by the party what
does it be that government came into
power with a lot of help from the
corporates do they feel like because
Modi is trying to move away from their
image no I don't think that Indian
business feels like it got out of Modi
what they were expecting as the Congress
been able to woo the corporates Congress
could convert ideas into politics you've
also been pretty caustic about Rahul
Gandhi have you also change your mind a
bit I was critical yes but there was no
alternative
Rahul on the other hand has totally had
a couple of conversations with him when
he says that even when he talks about
Hindu Torah he's peddling a soft him
this flower will that work you still
have to look at Modi's offering it's
still very strong and he ran in 2014 on
three things
welcome back from the break I'm gonna
Pratap Singh you're watching news X is
continuous coverage of budget 2019 our
big focus continues to be on the last
budget of the Narendra Modi government
in an election year has it ticked all
the right boxes will it get the votes
for the prime minister in an election
year as I said you need interim math I'm
gonna step you school today bringing
chairs to the middle class with the
salaried class and the vast swathes of
India with moderate salaries getting
major relief in the form of income tax
breaks and it proposes income tax
exemption for tax payers with 5 lakhs of
annual income the move will result in
our 12,500 rupee saving per annum for
the set us remember doubling the I
wanted kuru Pease additionally the
standard deduction has been increased to
50,000 rupees from the prevailing rupee
limit
and let's open this up to a special
panel joining us this evening to analyze
the budget and to well tell us whether
the government has managed to take the
right boxes is Amundson a spokesperson
the BJP is going to be joining us
shortly I mean Arjuna Congress MP and
national spokesperson also live with us
or it's a tea advisor to the money poor
cm in our Studios live with us mother
banner on senior journalist stays with
us in our studio prandtl share my
economic analyst also with us live
Narses Saleem banker will be joining us
shortly professor mother not a pure
theater director the sunday Guardian
also live on the broadcast with us Priya
sagal will be with us in just a bit
senior executive editor of news X let me
go to you first
I'm er genic as it's a Sukkah saath
sabka Vikas budget it's a please all
budget which will help them get the
votes are you worried as a principal
opposition party that this has turned
out to be rather populist budget and
populist budgets do lead to votes at the
end of the day from you know the voters
yeah but I think it's not a matter of
worry because I think when it's an
election year the budget is likely to be
populist but this bolder statement that
has been made there sub Cassatt sub
comic oz does not seem to gel because
you saw what has happened today with the
kiss on they have not gone back after
hearing the budget speech and the
promise is made in the budget or
whatever has been stated in the budget
so that's one point and it's a little
off what the question you have asked yes
I think the government has tried to
project I think it is trying to please
everybody to look at each and every
subject that was kind of narrated in
detail by the mr. Goyal as a part of the
interim budget I think that the people
know that the interim budget is only
going to be lasting till the elections
and what would happen to the
implementation when the final budget
would come next year with the new
government I think people are understand
what you have promised as it whichever
government comes apart
I'm not gone you know there at the end
of the day organized sector I'm er genic
who has been so far ignored you know
bringing the pakora valas who you often
talked about you know in a jibe against
the government in domain it's bringing
out you know a six thousand rupee fixed
minimum income for small farmers that
something around Gandhi or Congress
president also referred to you know
bringing about a minimum income for the
poor so are you worried that at the end
of the day this is catering to the
unorganized sector the farmers who you
also accuse the government of ignoring
and also the middle class who is often
forgotten by the government they have
also got a tax break for bearing with D
monetization in GST yes but do you look
at the way it has been abroad I think
it's very nice to speak on a budget day
after hearing the budget speech that
everyone is taken care off but if you
look at the 6,000 rupees I think you get
the first installment two thousand
rupees before the election and then just
as I mentioned earlier what happens
thereafter
and it took so long no for the
government to come out in a budget
speech about the farmers woes you talk
about the unorganized sector and you
forget what you promised
in 2014 growth jobs a year and now you
talk about employment in aviation sector
and you talk about in transport sector
and when you will you have some other
infrastructure projects that is not
employment for we are talking about
that's not we talk about Millennials who
are looking forward for a proper
employment after they come out of the
education institutions and yes we are
talking about Anganwadi workers also a
sector also so yes it looks quite rosy
when you present it but as the track
record shows of the government there
will be no Economic Survey no
propagating responses it's nice all
budget and the people will see through
it says the Congress also if if the
government was serious about catering to
these these sectors that to today why
wasn't it done earlier why an election
year well just to correct madam economic
service to be presented by the next
government this is this is again part of
the tradition which you pick and choose
whenever you wish to
so that's part number one number two a
lot of people
not criticizing the government that why
did you do it now why not before so let
me tell you in 2009 it was the same
instance same interim budget when you
came out with a loan waiver of sixty
thousand sixty thousand crores and this
was like literally buying votes by
distorting the credit culture of the
country so you have done mistakes in the
past this is this is nothing new to the
Congress I blame all politicians
together that they put politics before
it can but none and even before
traditions but you can't blame come out
and blame the BJP for doing it because
clearly you have violated these
traditions in the past as well and every
single chance that you have got in your
government has got in the past you have
destroyed traditions that's number one
number two is it's a budget which has
overall created a field goal and this is
the prime reason why opposition is so
rattled that they are trying to change
that this this this number of six
thousand rupees the income guarantee
that is being given to farmers they are
trying to come out and divide it by the
number of days so that it looks smaller
so that is the cheap level mindset that
Congress has gotten into and that shows
nothing that but only how much rattle
they are by looking at what benefits
that this can provide to much-needed
push though it is not enough I
personally believe lot more has to be
given to our farmers analyst this needs
to be respected but o Congress pile is
very cheap ok professional applaud come
in here has the interim fi manage to do
the perfect balancing act in an election
year has the NDA government managed to
give a please all budget according to
you that will convince a majority of the
electorate to support them you know in
the Lok Sabha polls which are weeks
literally weeks away well I'd like to
say that I think the Prime Minister is
focused on the on you know if I may say
so the low middle class as you said this
we know five like income and he ball and
and the measures that have been adopted
today but by the finance minister
definitely will please them there's no
doubt about it
Thomas I mean six thousand rupees is six
thousand rupees
you know it's it's money in the bank
yeah so that they're not going to we are
what what do I say they're not going to
say oh this is nothing they are going to
accept it because the simple reason
farmers are really in deep distress so I
would like to say that I think pierce
coil has done a good job of packaging
he's done a pretty good job of
communication how effective this budget
is in the overall context I am NOT going
to say but I must say that are very good
ok the optics are very good and before I
get into an Sharma on you know at the
end of the day the the optics of also
pleasing us who so far often are ignored
because they simply aren't you know a
core vote bank for the political parties
mother banana Ryan and on the
agriculture sector is will they be with
you know what they've been offered this
budget at the end of the day the
opposition has highlighted issue issue
time and again they have said the
government has forgotten the Kisan they
are on Jai jawan Jai kisaan
two years Sarkar vulgar yet they also
been these farmer protests which we've
been seeing particularly in the National
Capital Region with the agriculture
sector be pleased with extinct um a for
for small sector farmers and be with the
MSP prices being hiked on several
commodities civil right reduce I think
the price from what I can see from the
outlay the MSP increase is not
significant enough and six thousand
rupees per year money in the context of
the fact I have said this before a farm
labourer today a landless liberal on an
average in an Indian farm gets four
hundred rupees per day these days so
five hundred rupees per month for a land
owning farmer doesn't look like a big
deal to me
MSP if you take into account inflation
if you take into account some of the
input cost issues the MSP doesn't seem
to go far enough either so I think the
farm sector is certainly not getting up
on answer somebody compared it with the
fact that a lower middle class urban
taxpayer gets a twelve thousand rupee
per year debate whereas the farmer gets
only a six thousand rupee handout and if
you look at the numbers
it looks a too insignificant in a in a
like especially after the kind of
waivers that the Congress is allowed let
me be very clear yeah the cooperating
with that not only that I do not take an
urban view I do not I hope you'll ISM is
not a dirty word in my dictionary at
least I mean one man's popularity is
another person's populism it is a just a
cultural word used to twist arguments
but going to the game if you're playing
a one-day game you know and in the yeah
I said if you want to you have to play
your strokes and this stroke in my
opinion and it is this populism is
better than no population yeah obviously
the BJP is competing with the main
opposition party which is the Congress
of course exactly and the Congress did
promise the loan waivers in a mother
Pradesh Rajasthan and that is good it
worked for them they did implement it as
well
that may may be bad economics they
competing with that yeah you have to
understand that the elections not won in
the drawing rooms of South Delhi oh
sorry so you have to really that's what
your peers go and refer to he said AC
may Bettany why leave okay turning it
you know ki Haqqani well you spend about
80% of his time yeah what the government
has done in the previous four and a half
years so basically this was an appeal to
the people that look we have done this
much before one half years
give us time for another five years to
do even more okay I'm not sure my you
know at the end of the day the middle
class is often ignored as I said they
are the ones who've borne the brunt of
the monetization
along with you know other other
businesses are the small income groups
particularly they also dealt with GST in
a way this could we see this as a
thank-you gift from the government you
know for dealing with all that for
continued to support a lot of the
schemes and a lot of the populist
policies that are uplifting the poor but
are also helping you know political
parties win elections you know
absolutely the middle class and the
professionals the self-employed this is
a very important category and if you
look at some many of the first time
voters are also you know the millenias
startup generation they're all part of
this this category of people who are you
know living by their weight they don't
have capital but they have
knowledge and they have their brains to
to live by so I think for them it's
important to get some kind of incentives
last few years you know the government
has been talking about expanding the tax
base making more tax
you know pairs into the net and that's
there's been a very so point for you
know all the people in this category
because they feel that you know twenty
percent of the population is paying tax
for the rest of the eighty percent so
why don't we expand the base and reduce
the burden on everybody and I think this
is the first of those steps even though
tax base hasn't risen it has improved
but not think significantly or not
widely enough I think they score for far
more but the fact is that this time the
middle class and feel the impact of all
the taxation changes whether it's GST
whether it's D monetization which they
you know suffered and tolerate it and
somehow came and now it's time for them
to feel that well this is some kind of a
payback for us some kind of a reward for
us so that their pressure on our income
and our taxation burden will ease
Amundson off the BJP also joining us at
this point I once in our it's the last
budget of your government before you go
to the hustings do you believe this will
help you get votes
do you believe you managed to give a
please all budget to all communities
which will help you win this upcoming
Lok Sabha election and which
particularly are according to you are
the mean of factors in this budget which
you will go to the people which with
which we will hear in your campaign
speeches in their days ahead
no the government has come out with the
best possible budget which is the which
is in the simple interest of the country
which addresses the concerns of the
economy and which goes towards
strengthening the economy laying
foundation for a modern developed India
regardless of the elections of there now
let me tell you that this is a historic
visionary budget in not one but several
aspects and some of the real path
breaking changes I believe you were also
discussing just a while back yeah the
income tax exemption limit or rebate
limit has been increased right up to
five lakhs and with all these standard
deductions and other deductions it will
anybody who owns up to eight lakh is not
going to pay any kind of income tax now
somebody was mentioning about the tax
net let me tell you that the tax net has
widened it has in fact doubled from what
it was in UPA era as far as farmers and
agrarian sector is concerned we have
some of the you know real visionary
schemes which have come the allocation
itself in the agrarian sector who they
it then doubled then what it falls in
the UPA era the present month ricca-san
scheme is yet another support scheme for
the marginalized farmers and it will
provide them much-needed support but
that apart besides their today the one
point the one point five percent of the
MSP that we are fighting which is a
statutory enactment now and therefore on
all the 22 crops the farmers are
guaranteed of that yes there may be some
distribution problems in some you know
there might be certain exceptions
however that is a statutory enactment
the government has passed it we are all
bound and we are on obliged to follow it
cut in the agrarian sector 60,000 karoon
has been given under Man raiga the kiss
on credit card another five percent
rebate on interest yes
farmers are going to get so there are
several measures as far as middle class
is concerned it's a decisions that
certain analysts and your opposition
parties have had with this
is that there was no real jobs or
creation of jobs in the budget today and
that has been a sore point which we have
seen particularly the Congress party
raised in the last few days and this
with this entire controversy of the
National Statistics Commission and that
League jobs report they're asking your
government where is the real plan to
create jobs and why would they if a
country is the fastest growing economy
for four consecutive years and we are
going to clog that this year also and if
you know take for instance any do you
know transformation in which has come
for instance mudra scheme 15 corrode
loans have been handed out even if one
or two jobs were created just imagine
the kind of jobs that would have been
created no country please ask any
economist he will endorse this that a
country which grows as the fastest
growing economy of the world major
growing economy of the world for four
consecutive years there has to be robust
job growth rate and any macroeconomic
numbers that you see you there whether
it is EPF account or for that number you
will find that there is robust job
growth rate just because there is no
structured data for the unorganized
sector it doesn't mean that people will
try to build up a narrative the fact of
the matter is there that in the UPA
right was an era of double-digit
inflation rate and low growth rate we
have reversed that we are firmly on
course to double-digit okay growth rate
and low inflation rates we have highest
forex reserves ratio foreign direct
investments are highest obviously we
have Greece consignee on verge of
overtaking our colonial rulers British
obviously they are large number of
economies in a robust state there's
large number of employment generation
and when you news every news for
economic activity okay point taken Amin
see now let's get the Congress imagining
except a repetition of startup India's
skill India make in India where there
are no manufacturing units and you see
the MSME sector and you see the small
industries and you see the credit rating
in the system in that particular
industrial sections and no employment
generation you can't say that where we
are looking at all the jobs that are
created we have no data and there was no
answer or not a mention of how they are
going to create jobs let alone not talk
about 2014 - core jobs a year that
answer has never been given by this
government they go on talking about that
there has been growth but what this
growth without jobs what our water is
what are you going to hand over to the
youth and what are you going to give to
the Millennials that are coming out of
educational institutions so there is no
answer I understand it we want to make
it a very rosy picture but there are no
answers as far as jobs are concerned and
as far as farmers I think you are not we
are in pink of health we are a bright
spot in economy I do not understand why
what problem Congress party should be
having with that they should at least
one spokesperson of the Congress party
quick quick quick
quickly complete your point and then
I'll get in a sense on him as well to
the agrarian crisis I can tell you that
today the farmers would have been
happily returning if the budget was so
good and so rosy and promising rather
than TN think it should have been
promising the farmers daily is still
continuing so what has the present
government to talk about farmers yes you
have copied the UPA by the farmers
reforms here in the budget or the
provisions for a little help you are
going to give to the farmers but that is
not all so I think just to say that they
are going to help the farmers
I don't think NASA Salim come in here he
drew the Samajwadi Party and former
banker also during the panel now sir
what do you make of the budget today
what's your reading of it
you know that I actually since photogate
since early morning and I must tell you
uh two three key points that I would
want to state number one good attempt
I must admit in trying to ensure that
there is some money which is being given
out to you know citizens of India by
getting in certain slabs for example
file like exemption on up to 5 lakhs
exemption income bodes well with the
fact that you want to insure more money
left in the hands of the customer of
your citizens to fuel consumption and
therefore an impact from consumer
discretionary space number one number
two I think as far as the farm agendas
are concerned farm output is concerned
no discussion on that I would have been
happy if the finance minister at spoken
about that because in this interim
budget they didn't dress like an interim
budget was pretty much a full on budget
interim budget we would have been
happier if they had gone and visited
some of the promises that they made in
the last three now four years I think
completely they ignored the corporate
tax structure the corporate copper India
was looking at the taxation structure to
be more streamlined the SME and the MSME
space has been bleeding they put a
bearing balance sheet and I think we
would have been happier to see some
concessional tax up to 250 crores is the
current situation as we haven't standing
if that had increased to about three 350
hundred crores or turnover that would
have also been a welcome change but
having said that I think the impetus has
been given on farmer and farmer output
today here's my point
and it's a very intrinsic point to the
farming community because you know it's
it's it actually it's more of a Bottoms
Up approach what I'm trying to tell you
and it said simply is that today you're
talking about giving benefit to farmer
which is which is all farmers which I
already have land but what about the
farmers who are landless and I must tell
you in the current scenario happens is
the ones who have formed a lands they
typically go ahead and
you know outsource whether the stealing
of the land or cropping sauce to a lure
well labor force which is which is
basically addressing the the farm output
and those are the ones were okay for
your question we got more well would be
very vigilant schemes and obviously
that's not gonna happen
unfortunately because that's again by
Miss yes yes and obviously they are the
CI I'll give you a simple perspective
with a forty to fifty percent of India's
work force labor workforce contributes
to a farm okay however the contribution
of farming has a percentage to GDP is
only fourteen or fifteen percent so that
tells you the lowest are a month in a
quick response to that yesterday who
there first of all I do not understand
the pessimism that the Congress party
seems to be demonstrating they do not
even acknowledge the fact that under
this government India has become a
bright spot in the global economy
however regardless of that we do not
need their certificate as far as farmers
and as far as other sector you know
workers in the unorganized sectors are
concerned for the first time any
government has English Aegis scheme some
social security cover even after they
retire as as pensioners for the first
time you know something of this nature
has been introduced this is directly
going to benefit about 10 to 15 years
I'm hearing from people who are working
in the unorganized sector which also
includes the farm Labor's as my friend
was just from the Samajwadi Party it
also includes those people who are
working as farm laborers and not only
this let me say who they're that all
these schemes are towards those who are
at the lowest rate of development and
the economic hierarchy it was two so to
speak and not only this but if you come
at the ten percent reservation which is
there for economic backward cars
yeah if you consider the fact that
ayushman Bharat
provides them is a guarantee is just
want to come in there anything was wrong
with their medical oh okay I have to
take a break I have to take a break now
to prove I will come back up to five
like - okay I'm not saying a point I can
imagine a point taken unfortunately I'm
short on time so I have to take a very
quick break I'm back to this big debate
in just two minutes
I returned to our studio panelists as
well we also have more newsmakers
joining us on the other side taking a
very quick break don't go anywhere our
big budget 2019 coverage back on the
other side
in the break you're watching a news X
our big focus remains the budget 2019
I'm gonna put up saying joining us now
on the broadcast is a special guest
before I return to our political
representatives and studio panelists I
want to draw in vice chairman of the
nithya yoga Rajeev Kumar on this
broadcast as well mr. Kumar appreciate
you joining us on news exes evening what
are your first thoughts on the budget of
2019
how do you view itself my first thought
for the budget is that it's a balanced
budget between fiscal discipline and
stimulating growth I the finance
minister has done a very creditable job
in not making it into a so-called
pre-election budget and indulging and
fiscal profligacy but at the same time
he has addressed some of the most
important issues facing the general
public which is in the form of the
farmers package and the income tax
rebate for those earning below 5 lakhs
rupees and giving the real estate sector
a good you know and yet maintaining the
fiscal prudence that this government has
been known for when you spoke about
fiscal prudence sir but other concerns
then that some are raising related to
fiscal slippage quite severe according
to you
don't think so I mean I've looked at the
assumptions of the budget and the
underlying assumptions for the revenue
estimates and I think these are very
genuine these are very real because if
I'm not wrong
the total revenue receipts are expected
to rise by 14.3% which with a growth
rate of nominal growth rate of 11 point
1 percent of GDP is you know is a very
reasonable buoyancy of the tax also for
the GST the number that has been used
for 7.5 lakh crore he's just 2 percent
above the budget estimate for the last
year and with the January number coming
in at 1 trillion rupees I think this
will be achieved moreover moreover I am
sure that in the theory will work much
to achieve our disinvestment targets ok
so I don't think that is there are there
should be any concerns about the revenue
of the fiscal surpluses going in this
year going forward but it comes of
course in an election year Rajeev Kumar
it's it's coming just weeks before the
people will vote to elect a new
government
you know ups in April and May this year
is it then to be seen as a political
budget I don't agree but at the same
time all economics all economic policy
is also political it is a political
economy that we deal with so there is no
such thing as pure economics and
therefore to that extent the finance
minister has done well to make it into a
budget which meets the political
aspirations month while maintaining the
economic rationality of you know which
will push growth okay in the economy and
employment generation or better Rajesh
Kumar a vice chairman of the nithya yoga
appreciate you joining us on musics
with your a view on the Union budget of
2019 well let me quickly bring back Raja
City at this point I just I think wanted
to respond to something NASA said he was
saying earlier particularly on the
farmer he was questioning the formula
that the government has used
- you know dual out this minimum income
to small farm yeah I think the objection
that was raised there was that this
pertains only to these high-end farmers
who are owning five acres of land how
about the agricultural labor so
generally the pattern that has been seen
I mean I am privy to what happens I've
toured a lot in Mantha Pradesh I can
tell you that a lot of these farm
laborers have very very small farm
holdings and they their entire economies
are yet justified just by telling their
own small land holding so they are you
their labor is utilized in in in telling
the larger farms as well so we need to
untie that all of these people are
actually registered as farmers and this
number of 12 code which is a huge number
does include not just the farmers but
also family live laborers in large
number of states this is my
understanding of the number and that is
why it is 12 volts okay I got that work
for was about mutual but I come back to
the fiscal prudence argument as well
that I was just racing with the Rajeev
Kumar Nasir you you had an intervention
to make before we took the break - what
BJP Zaman's in ours
no no I just you know I've heard him and
I said he said this is the first time
that any government is done this but I
compute disagree because I mean I must
tell you firstly being a bank intruder
in your plan but also I must tell you
that the Samajwadi Party in you peel
something like this very effectively
which is also praised by the apex court
by the Supreme Court of the Samajwadi
pension scheme and that I think was so
because these have been in the past and
it's 6,000 rupees 6000 rupees for all
these years they are in yupi Airlines no
may I just respond now these parties and
their alliances which were responsible
for plight of farmers their agrarian
budget was not even half of what this
government has allocated to the agrarian
sector they come around and preachers
and the question what is 6000i why
should you be mocking it if it is any
kind of support you should be welcoming
it what is your stand do you opposite
what is your stand not one this is just
one scheme they that apart when the
Parliament guarantees that 150 percent
if were MSP will be given is that not a
Support Scheme was that not a tip
long-standing demand of the farmers for
years and years together if Islam in
there - each and every home they can
register in there it is available is
that not something which farmers want
the irrigation the war
the water availability everything is
there the farmer is fully key reading
the entire nation he is fully capable of
looking after his family he just has to
be provided a positive atmosphere an
encouraging atmosphere this girl is
doing that ok fair enough
honey our night apart let me say that
they concentrate on forming a gradient
sector when the overall economy is
growing such a rapid pace yes it can't
be without the most predominant but I
mean I'm er Jake you know on the loan
waivers if your government is stressed
upon it in your manifestos and then you
implement it out with the BJP is always
said that they are not in support of
loan waivers they don't see it as a
fiscally prudent move you believe
through this announcement today they've
managed to Trump you know that argument
of yours that they can offer relief to
the farmers with okay I'm being told I
don't Jay King Live you know minister
let's cut across a significant part of
the political group which came out with
a national hoax of this kind has the
audacity to say that a scheme like this
like a pan India level is too little for
people who did watch TV nothing now look
at what we've been doing for the farm
sector rural roads 91 percent completed
rumor of housing 2022 everyone will have
a roof 98 points percent people in rural
areas now have sanitation every willing
Oh is re-elected every poor man as with
no other cooking methods interests
affection on loans of 1 lakh cross being
given performance the government is
taking
the burden of cheaper rolls higher
spending on irrigation rural
infrastructure then they get an indirect
subsidy and a support and they them are
within I use one Mahara so free health
care then you have a number of them look
at the Monica benefit which use twenty
eight thousand cross during UPA which is
now 60,000 cross right to food cheap
ration 1 lakh ninety thousand thousand
now over and above all this the center
says that when you buy your inputs
fertilizer seeds etc I'll give you an
initial financial support loan waivers
are never a solution to the farm sector
problem in the long run and income
support still is we we first announced
that the farmer will get input costs
plus 50 percent medicated but some the
markets don't give them fifty percent so
this additional support of 6000 and then
you have a federal structure you have
state governments
if Telangana can announce if I'm sure
the other state governments can also
announce so please don't shed crocodile
tears today for the farmers if you of
the opposition's let them are now
similar schemes I am sure the other
governments within their physical space
will also consider this and therefore
you can prop it up and it's not that as
though this is the sole prerogative of
the responsibility of the center we are
in the cooperative federalism both
center and states must cooperate this is
a huge amount that we are doing and we
are now as against of one-time loan
waiver of fifty two thousand crores
which was partly heated into by traders
and businessman this is seventy five
thousand crores in the first year itself
I am sorry to expand in future years
actually now see that agree that there
is a price
well I think crisis is overstating it
the Indian farmer is really the producer
of our food his productivity levels have
hugely improved and therefore in the
last two decades we've seen shortages
becoming into surpluses four years ago
pulses were in shortage he is now
producing it in surpluses of the isesco
now he gets hit because he is producing
more that the cost goes down and
therefore one over the United States is
subsidizing economist the European Union
is subsidizing their farmer so
everywhere you maintain a balance
between food prices and subsidizing the
farmer so the farmer gets a tip from
producing something I think a farm
sector still needs support and I'm quite
sure if the center and the states come
together with these kind of programs
rather than mere myopic slogans which
really will not give a long term
substance to the farm
it can certainly achieve a lot more now
not many Indian citizens haven't plotted
this budget in general budget they say
it's a budget for everyone it is for the
farmers it's for the middle class the
opposition and the critics again say
this is something to woo the voters it's
that from Hofstra 2009 internal budget
mr. Khurana Mukerjee not even in the
interim budget but while replying to it
announced just a very reduced excise
duties 2 percent across-the-board
well the same argument was all about
then in 2014 mr. Chisholm on a number of
projects including engineering products
automobiles gave a beauty rebate the
same argument can be taken now well by
are an essential part of any
parliamentary democracy so our elections
and if good policies of the government
and the kind of fiscal space they
created enables us to help the middle
class and mind you india's middle class
is being very possibly strengthened i
recently studied went to a study in 2018
we had a 2005 i'm sorry we had a 18%
middle class in 2015 it was 29% in 2025
its projected to be 44% so with it soon
you will see a large majority of Indians
graduating in the middle class and if
you PA give inflicted a 10 percent
inflation of them which we brought down
obviously the taxpayer also his real
value of money has declined and
therefore exempting the the smaller
taxpayer you his ability to spend more
means a boost to the economy what we
given by way of a direct tax benefit
also comes back by way of indirect taxes
because the purchasing power of India's
middle class is important with such
big-ticket announcements there must be a
sizeable impact on the income of the
government how would you possibly
contain in fiscal deficit at 3.4 percent
well if you'll become governments from
Independence onwards and more
particularly after the no government and
I say this without fear of contradiction
has had a better record of fiscal
prudence and we have we inherited about
4.5 4.6 percent is down to 3.4 we had
targeted 3.3 but because of this last
thousand adjustment because of the form
of expenditure we've had to make a point
one compromise our current account
deficits have been proper control
inflation is under control and therefore
if you see our fiscal record speaks for
itself
because of all the anti-black money
measures that we took because of the
entire direct and indirect tax
departments we put online because of we
now offer D monetization after GST the
average we have been growing in our tax
collections ever in the last five years
has been in the range of 15 to 18
percent to you all right that was a huge
that was Arun Jaitley their Union
Minister speaking on the budget the last
interim budget of the of the day healing
it and remember of course Arun Jaitley
is currently unwell and that's why he's
abroad and that's why I've interim a
huge goal was the one with the budget
this morning we have to take a very
quick break at that point back on the
other side with lots more analysis of
the budget our special panel stays with
us we also have Manu Manu maker
[Music]
go back from the break you're watching
our news X is continuous coverage of
budget 2019 we have another news maker
joining us now in the broadcast union
power minister are kissing welcome to
the show it is a budget that's common in
election here
should this be then read as a political
budget considering general elections are
weeks away the ultimate judge of what we
do is the people all the work which we
have done for the past five years is for
the people and whether we have done
appropriate or including this budget and
whether we have done good work or not is
decided by the people in the elections
that is what democracy is so the people
who feel happy with the budget then
we'll wait because the people will feel
happy in fact of operation you also
saying this they are saying this because
they know that the people will be happy
with this that's why they are saying it
is a poll ballot no for the welfare of
the people and the people and they
understand and people will be happy we
know that the people who have so will
but every work done by minutes is
ultimately just by the people so we work
for the people and if people are happy
we have say poll but even the people
will be happy if we are happy that very
good and they are happy but the budget
of course has placed a lot of trust
missing on the farmers on Kisan do you
think this will placate the rural
district I think this will blunt the
opposition's criticism on your
government particularly on the farmers
issue you know the r-1 party since the
dependence which has done substantial
work for the farmers Swamy nothing
competitive
we the Congress had put it you know on
the back burner
in cold storage we adopted it we
announced an MSP now where we are giving
recipe of 50% more than the cost of
cultivation that we that we did highest
ever
you know minimum support price apart
from this now we are giving direct
benefit transfer to the farmers and
incomes benefit income support to the
farmer so what we have done for the
farmers this is not the only one what we
have for the farmers though the
government is all right we leave it at
that our casing unit Power Minister
appreciate you joining us on a new sex
with your view on budget 2009 team 11
and I know quickly if I can draw you in
here you know after the announcements in
the budget particularly of course at
fixed income for small farmers and you
know and the the organized sector
pension what happens to the attack of
Rahul Gandhi and the Congress is
announcement of loan waiver if the
government comes in in 2019 and minimum
income for the poor does this do these
announcements today blunt those
announcements but I won't they count too
but not blunt and I'll tell you why
about 250 million Indians are you can
count them as landless laborers this
budget addresses landed marginal farmers
landless laborers as such are not
targeted in this budget and therefore
and if you look at it in social
composition landless laborers roughly
broadly coincide with Dalits so the
Congress constituency stays where it is
okay and Rahul Gandhi is upping the ante
on that stage where it is but the reason
is the 250 million above those are being
targeted by the BJP so ridden in the
bottom of the social pyramid you have
what you would in Hindi coal per hour
cut okay no but you know I think the
Congress has not been able to come up
with a proper thought through critique
of this budget look at one of the tweets
is saying that BJP promised six thousand
rupees per year to the farmers but they
are giving only you know a five hundred
rupees per month I mean what kind
math says they've also been they've also
been busy and EBM and then they're
turning up you know and then they learn
and talking about you know why to talk
about EVMS and friends around Gandhi you
somebody can be overheard saying only
talk about EBM now you know I think in
in in this newsroom were right now
they've had better critique of this
budget then what the opposition so far
so I think this the government has is
getting away because the opposition is
not think before I give some credit to
fusion oil he's my it's it's a
left-handed compliment okay but huge oil
being a chartered accountant and
structured the budget inside that the
little looks like a lot okay and
therefore we the composition will go
back to the drawing board appointed by
getting come out with a very well
structured critique was because when
Rahul Gandhi made this statement in
chapters good that he's going to he
promised minimum income guarantee it was
more of a vacuous statement because it
wasn't bagged by anything he didn't had
a number in mind now he doesn't know how
much should I criticize 6000 rupees and
will number or do I do not say anything
because I don't know what number I am
going to pitch in front of the decimal
point so he's position has been confused
without tackle this government you've
been left stumped is what analysts are
saying because at the end of the day you
also have announced lot of freebies and
swaps you can't criticize the government
for being populist in this government in
this budget rather there is a question
of criticizing that it is base because
it's the budget is bound to be this kind
of a budget but well the answer to the
6,000 rupees is very clear and it is in
fact the government which is looking
absolutely pathetic by showing the 6,000
rupees would you ever think about less
to speak about the modus operandi of the
government in giving this six thousand
rupees in addition to all the GST on the
tractor detector the fertilizers the
pestis
so I think it is completely okay man
point taken last word necessary
who they were they were there more
Foreman your math and economics
perspective I'd like to say something
see the government is corrected twelve
12 lakh crores from petroleum production
in the last five years and as a result
input cost of pharmacist increase
significantly in the last I was rupees
6,000 and that logic is very head of the
overall population dependent on farming
in agriculture and they will not be able
to compensate for this loss this is what
we're saying and the government is it
not the demand of farmers to be true and
this is under gh teams that's my first
point number two my point is you know I
heard one of the panelists mr. Sinha say
something about MSP yeah but I must tell
you the Finance Minister committee the
increased MSP to 1.5 times the
production cost for 22 crops but I must
tell you they've changed the definition
of cost Oh taking a 2 plus FL instead of
c2 okay so you're questioning the
Congress representative of questioning
this move to placate the farmers we're
absolutely out of time we're gonna have
to leave it at that we have signals in
executive editor of news X is with us
but we're going to come to after the
break thanks for being with us on the
other side a lots more coverage of
karate my colleague joins you with
political analysis now on body 2019
considering it's an election year
Russia is back on the other with all
those points on very well
my guest today is her the minister of
housing and urban office once upon a
time I remember you wanted to fight from
pada I was asked at one state would you
be willing to fight the looks of Ireland
said most certainly this is a party
where you don't do it asked you are told
by the fine so I consider myself as a
carrier Carta at the moment I am a
elected member to the Roger server from
u P whatever the party wants a given
point of time but this is not a party
where people go around lobbying for
things you're told by the party what is
it be that government came into power
with a lot of help from the corporates
do they feel let down because Modi is
trying to move away from her image no I
don't think that Indian business feels
like it got out of Modi what they were
expecting how's the Congress been able
to move the corporates Congress would
convert ideas into politics you've also
been pretty caustic about Rahul Gandhi
have you also change your mind a bit I
was critical yes but there was no
alternative drama on the other hand has
surely had a couple of conversations
with him when he says that even when he
talks about Hindu Tova
he's peddling a soft him this blob will
that work you still have to look at
Modi's offering it's still very strong
and he ran in 2014 on three things
good evening it's been a budget for
votes
there's no mincing words about it if the
Modi government was now given the chance
to walk of the talk and they've said
they've already in many ways not a
single home or individual in this
country would not have had a direct
benefit from team Modi's six core LPG
kits 50 Koror covered under health
insurance today a pension scheme for 39
crore people direct income for 12 crore
farmers income tax cut for 3 crore
people paint boggling numbers so is that
what winning budget let's find out and
quickly get started over the course of
the next 60 minutes we are in
conversation with Union Minister for
iron B Raja bottom rot or we also have
it up a mile in xup a minute HRD
minister Prakash javadekar joining us
and the CEO of DTI oke Amitabh Kanta let
me quickly set this up and kick this off
the putting is the most important
question of the day it's a simple one is
this award-winning budget and there have
been three hat-trick of schemes that
have been announced today that the
central government is certainly hoping
is going to be in less kick it off with
our inbuilt news X a I let me rope in
computer on the how much pension will be
given to India's unorganized sector
announce - to pul announce that workers
in the unorganized sector will get Rs
3000 per month after the age of 60 all
right okay computer how much direct
income has been promised to farmers the
government announced a scheme to provide
direct income support of 6000 rupees to
farmers with land holding up to -
Hector's the finance minister said the
scheme would benefit 12 crore farmers
okay let me put that into context three
schemes we said you heard the subtext of
them inter numeric figures let me
quickly rope in my colleague baby cut
explain them to us they because the
first scheme of course is in the form of
a tax cut which was offered to people
less than 5 lakhs so this will of course
benefit 3 crore people and each person
will be able to save 12,500 in the
coming year the first one the second one
that we have is for the farmers 12 crore
farmers are expected to benefit from
this scheme they will be getting 6000
rupees which roughly translates to 500 a
month for the farmers - as you know
minimum gap income for the farmers and
of course the third one is a pension for
the unorganized sector which is quite
unusual 15 thousand a month is what
we're looking at this is for people with
in turmoil okay thanks that's list
that's that's it that's the big-ticket
scheme right let's open this up for
joining us all gotta pull up
representing the Congress Brenda Sharma
economic analyst is with us here in our
Studios Nasser Salim a banker mother
dollar Perth is joining us in just a bit
sheila but our national affairs editor

quickly come to all of you let me set
this up quickly with raja baath under
old minister good evening to you sir I

you so let me just get straight to the
topic 39 karora minister at or
unorganized sector payments 12 crore
farmers direct income three corrode
middle-class tax cuts so
is your election plan to literally touch
every single individual every household
in this country and thereby strengthen
the country itself a government a true
government is one that is there for
every segment of the society providing
them a foundation to work on a strength
a financial support system to fall back
on providing them with an opportunity to
grow which includes filling them with
the infrastructure providing them with
health care providing them with with
loans to grow and all this has been done
in this budget it's it's been actually
continuously being done in various
budgets of us if you if you just try and
recollect 2016-2017 each of the budget
and therefore with the plan division of
ten years ahead and 20 years ahead the
government has is is repeatedly coming
off with but music in the growth rate
the critique in this case is straight
forward that we are now running the
danger of converting into India into
some sort of welfare states where people
are dependent upon hi handouts perhaps
even addicted to handouts and value
generation in the economy then won't
happen isn't that a concern this is not
for the first time that welfare or
resources have been have been announced
in the budget okay it's been happening
from of it from a long time in India and
there is also a requirement of
supporting segments that needed a need
to be moved out of inertia so that they
move ahead can then contribute in
development of the society and the
financial system of the economy as well
on one hand is you leave people on their
on themselves
to progress ahead and to work themselves
the other is that you provide a little
bit of support
okay then they have some mechanism where
and they have an opportunity to grow and
also something to fall back upon now the
health system for example
now you could somebody could well say
well they are and they can take care of
themselves the point is that there is a
very large number of Indian population
that goes into negative growth when
somebody in their family falls sick and
if we are able to so we've introduced
the largest health care system in the
world the reason for doing that is and B
believe that this",True,en,3235,0,10

that it is finally you made this point
that it's the a position that is
criticizing so there is a there's a
distinction when the criticism is from
the public it is genuine when the
criticism is from the opposition it is
manufactured we are by fact the largest
growing economy in the world our GDP is
somewhere around 7.3 we've come from the
being the 11th of the 13th largest
economy in the world in 2013 to being
the sixth largest economy in the world
so we are the fastest growing one so
that our largest growing economy with a
very high GDP is it does not generate
focus then how is the GDP growing how
does the economy make a becoming strong
all this infrastructure that is being
built is being built in the air is it or
somebody is actually building it right
the manufacturing is growing the MSME
sector is being supported who's working
the in the MSME sector someone is
working there okay in the farmers farm
sector there are various schemes we
provided to double the income between
two agricultural outputs the fishery is
the animal husbandry they are being
interests of mention is being given is
it actually happening or is it just in
the air how is the economy growing
so therefore this therefore this
critique that you say and I'm glad
please keep repeating it that it's the
opposition that's doing it all the
announcement that you've made did you
even did you see a single member from
the opposition ban bench even clap or
thump the table when the middle class
and I think they did it or their income
the opposition everything that you do a
minister righto so let me just pick up
on that thought on jobs data because we
don't have reliable jobs data in this
country we don't have reliable
unemployment most progressive countries
are able to generate those why why
haven't been able to create that people
who are investing in a country why are
they investing in the country so whom
are they investing the country no but
the point is they want to contribute
they want to donate money to India is it
or they want to generate more money who
work there all this economy all the
manufacturing all the infrastructure
that's happening
is actually creating jobs the point it
is not empty or okay the point of the
jobs then remains that do we have data
or should it be ten tangents let me pick
up the the question of the middle class
because there is a pitch that this is a
middle class friendly budget but the
three crew people that should
technically get relief there's another
three and a half word corrode who any
relief whatsoever and they perhaps some
unsaid bility so what will the jobs
front and in this front what do you feel
you want to have the cake and eat it too
is it every single budget we've covered
the for the women the farmers and we've
also covered the middle class but you
kept saying to the middle class being
left out we focus on the middle class
now you say what about the others okay
every single sector has been covered
alright okay no one left out but you
can't have your cake and eat it too I'm
going to leave it there but quickly
Roger Burton rot or is is there you know
have you been talking about pakora Ghana
pensions and everything has come out
today is there anything possibly left in
the bank after this budget for you guys
to come up with for the elections never
st. that's the trailer we've just begun
we've just done five years right now
there's much more to be done in India
this is for the first time that the
government has proved that in moments
can work without scams that there can be
transparency in working the people who
are working in this government are
committed people there's a difference
the tax that you all are paying is being
used to strengthen the most modernized
people and there is no leakage in that
tax money would you like that would you
would you get your money that you pay
gets leaked out gets paid as bribes so
there there are no middlemen now there
is there are no scams the money is
reaching the most poor and downtrodden
we are getting medical treatment they
are getting medical treatment by your
money and therefore this is the
government that has a vision for India
ahead alright he want to and we have a
plan for it a five trillion economy in
next five years well a ten trillion
economy in next eight years
this has to be a sense of belief and
there's Raja personal we're all sitting
on that same boat call India so if the
if the country's doing well we're all
doing better we we we wish you the
because like I said we're in the same
boat but let me pick up on that point
let me quickly get Randall Randall have
you missed that conversation today when
the government says look the
fundamentals of this is that taking tax
yes but we are utilizing it we are not
eating it up has our point be missed
I think what the government has said
very clearly is that you know we have
been taking you through a lot of change
in lot of transition bgs TV ad
monetization it has asked the
professional class as the agriculture
class to endure a lot of transitions
both in business agriculture and in the
professional class and today in some way
the Prime Minister through the finance
ministers budget speech has said that
look you went through a lot we are
trying to change the country and change
is always painful and therefore here is
a sale of the benefits that you're going
to get it's not a full suite of goodies
which the prime minister and the finance
minister have offered but they've said
we are delivering and I think visible
change of delivery is seen in physical
infrastructure what they've created and
by giving shops or some kind of benefits
to professional class to end the
agricultural labor they said this is a
hint of things to come ok I'm going to
get a get a get a rebuttal from Gore
open up in just a second Priya quickly
come in help us with some come perceived
is is IV seeing the pedantic perception
of the people in the Congress and the
opposition are they have to oppose it so
they're going to oppose it or are there
bit concern there is basically the
communist scheme versus the UPA versus a
BJP scheme who is the board bank good
targets are the same the farmers the
poor this thing but it's you know they
everybody's come out with their own
versions and how to do it but but you
look at all the criticisms fear the
farmer was at for the criticism that
that technically is been hate
middle-class was a big issue
middle class is still a big issue
because what they've done is the lower
middle class what they were they haven't
changed the tax labs anybody earning
more than five still has to go by the
old tax lab so the middle class you know
they've tried to redefine the middle
class this is also again primary some of
these contempt of what we colloquially
call the middle class key is actually
address the lower middle class this is
what the Congress is also saying they're
saying that as the end of the day the
middle class is the one that fuels goal
very smartly said thank you so much you
I want to pay for at all but at the end
of the day we will give you any breaks
again okay quick quick couple Sheila but
what's what's the perception was what
have we got since the nobody's been
digested for a few hours now right it
was very unusual budget three things
which I saw you know government is
caught that it was a election budget at
a political was a more a political
activity today then I economic statement
today because one we budget is a part of
our Indian tradition governor part of
governments traditions it has something
to do with tradition also something some
colonial touch everything was missing
today in that sense let fusions delivery
if you notice it was worth noting
because half of the time he was in Hindi
have over the time in English and we
never knew when that issue started and
when the politics started so politics
and Inter economy was so intermingled
see every time when election comes here
like Manmohan Singh time early nineties
shyness about it
politics politics politics one so first
is about language which is very
important as I'd repeatedly say but it
is something to do with tradition there
is a colonial touch one second the baby
BJP MPs the way said modey modey and
what all happened when phylite thing
happened it clearly shown Moody's Pro
plan and strategy and tactics coming
coming days to it is quite clear now let
Misha booth are away that middle-class
and farmers we have to cajole them moong
ki puja carnage or Ruby a vote Kelly
okay interesting
I know I think why I tell you that
Indian middle class is so typical they
really like symbolism medieval water
fetch along yeah you remember that lag
Gujarat I feel that political symbolism
was perfect symbolism and not saying
real things and actually he was saying
clip clip all the time and he was
pushing all his perhaps my we've got you
in the evening you get us all the cover
okay now NASA selling before Ghana but
are not necessarily mean hypocritical
yes is a political budget we were
expecting a political budget yes
election that are two months away but a
lot of things never been been announced
which for have the potential of being
game changes in this country
you see I'll tell you firstly uh yes if
you ask me from a you know from a well
from a bankers perspective we were
expecting it to be a very political but
more so by giving our shops and
subsidies in doling out schemes which
will lure our voters but I think what is
gone I think frankly done reasonably
well is their fiscal prudence which
they're saying that they will stick to
three point four percent not the only
challenge here is Rishabh to leave out
three to three point four percent for
the next year that is what needs to be
question number one number two I think
you know also the fact is that whether
materially all of these shops will
actually make a difference you see the
neo before you before your program I was
in there with musics in the last hour as
well and I said something my point is
that you know labor workforce
contributes more than 50 percent on
labor workforce is about 50% in to farm
humming the poor fellows they have no
money and they Elul and so this actually
this the fact that they've rolled out
this soft you money six thousand rupees
for under two hectares of land ownership
which you have actually will never reach
the labor workforce okay well in here
okay so again you know what I mean
frankly speaking a lot has been said let
me pose the same question to Gopala
Gopala vine I know that they hold on a
question mark of how to substantiate
jobs data but if we just look at the six
months
ayushman Bharath has happened would you
wanna has genuinely been a success you
can't a lot of people have actually got
those LPG connections free of charge
today now the farmers have been told
here twelve root of you potentially will
get a check two thousand rupees
upfront immediately and maybe another
four thousand rupees later that's a lot
of money that's going to be distributed
surely that's gonna have some positive
impact on them see every project is
prepared on some background what was the
background in the economy the economy
was suffering from a very severe rural
distress and there is a all-time high 50
a high level in the country so what this
budget had done had they made a single
announcement to reduce unemployment
level and less me somebody from BJP
sometime back was saying there is no
data that what is the genesis of data
cohort is the CMI data and time weren't
believed on the theta when when belief
of the data but this shameless and rose
from BJP doesn't believe on that data
okay second the you mention about the
farmer distress what comment gave to
farmer three repeat thirty five paisa
per day per person to a farmer by giving
three will be per day five percent to
the farmer do you think you are going to
double day I am asking whatever guessing
you've done six years I am a three-time
policy yes yes yes I correct correct
so I am asking for DT three year back
you announced that within six years
the farmers income will be double in
last three years give us the progress
report shows the country then how much
income cut in three or the second point
yes I won't category comes with a fight
BJP friend is somebody city that in
Prime Minister for selfie values now why
farmers are opting out why farmers are
say we don't hold any cover image
recorded what you try to say it slower
of take point
they are very quickly forgiving it yes
but you baby that is one point
very small point you mentioned about
which whele you know what is the
velocity website 85 connections I am NOT
going for second refill why because
woody ji and his government is more
interested in announcing makes the
question okay the question it's it's
it's in the end it is statistics versus
statistics you can argue that there are
now no unmanned crossing without a
signal but only in broad gauge not in
narrow gauge these statistical quartz
can go on but in the end of perception
so Sheila but in percept oriole terms
yes the speech was a highly political
speech regressive speech a bilingual
speech in perception terms how do you
think is how did this budget come as I
said before that it is very clear that
BJP is aiming in adhering States and
that's why it but it was highly quite in
Hindi and many people already when it
started on Twitter they were completely
so much in the so it's a hilly and
farmers and middle class that is there
okay so I think I think and then
Congress is saying quite sensible things
but we understand that the data is not
there and SSO controversy is that
everything is correct but you know
perception and symbolism okay was
important budget and moody and his
government
okay just hold your thought okay so the
middle-class point of view for a few for
a few seconds a prandtl should the
middle class be wholly disappointed with
what's happened no not really I think I
think what do you ask very important
ratio the perception and the objects of
you remember after five years of the
government when he promised the prime
minister promised I said in our great
days you know a lot of people have been
questioning in the last where are those
great days that you promised what he's
trying to do is saying that okay listen
I have been working for the last few
years to make sure that good days are
here and now here is a couple of what's
going to happen in the near future
okay the projection
and perception and you know the
important word George which is
enthusiasm is very important he's to get
everybody excited about what is to
happen you know to war P back so if we
want but if you want action you not vote
me but that excitement is based on
little bit of sobs and benefits for very
targeted catty very targeted categories
and certainly very targeted category in
the middle class but okay okay prior
cycle of system point of view there are
people in the middle class who let's
face it were very patient during the
monetization know very patient was doing
the entire GST process have been very
patient paying crazy",True,en,14267,0,42

three crore people and each person will
be able to save 12,500 in the coming
year so that's the first one the second
one that we have is for the farmers 12
crore farmers are expected from the
scheme they will be getting 6000 rupees
which roughly translates to 500 a month
for the farmers to you know minimum
guaranteed income for the farmers and of
course the third one is a pension for
the unorganized sector which is quite
huge for fifteen thousand rupees a month
is what we're looking at this is for
people with enterprise okay thanks
that's list that's that's it that's the
big-ticket scheme right let's open this

ball up representing the Congress Rhonda
Sharma economic analyst is with us here
in our Studios Nasser Salim a banker
mother Nala Perth is it Sheila but are
nationally based editor and have Priya
cycle a senior executive editor before I
could he come to all of you let me set
this up quickly with raja baath under
old minister good evening to you sir I
know it's been a busy day both for
government and for you so let me just
get straight to the topic 39 karora
minister at or unorganized payments 12
crore farmers direct income 3 crore
middle-class tax cuts so is your
election plan to literally touch every
single individual every household in
this country Minister on the country
itself a government a true government is
one that is there for every segment of
the society providing them a foundation
to work on a strength a financial
support system to fall back on providing
them with an opportunity to grow which
includes providing them with the
infrastructure providing them with
healthcare providing them with with
loans to grow and all this has been done
in this budget it's it's been actually
continuously being done in various
budgets of us if
if you just try and recollect 2016-2017
each of the budget and therefore with a
plan division of ten years ahead in 20
years ahead the government has is is
repeatedly coming off with but music in
this ghost the growth rate the critique
in this case is straightforward that we
are now running the danger of converting
into India into some sort of welfare
states where people are dependent upon
hi handouts perhaps even addicted outs
and value generation in the economy then
won't happen this is not a concern this
is not for the first time that a welfare
scheme or resources have been have been
announced the budget okay been happening
some of it from a long time in India and
there is also a requirement of
supporting segments that needed to be
moved out of inertia so that they move
ahead and can then contribute in
development of the society and the
financial system of the economy as well
on one hand is you leave leave people on
their own themselves to to progress
ahead and to work themselves the other
is that you provide support okay they
have some sort of a mechanism where and
they have an opportunity to grow and
also something to fall back upon now the
health system for example but somebody
could well say well they're earning and
they can take care of themselves the
point is that there's a very large
number of Indian population that goes in
deep growth when somebody in their
family falls sick yes and if we are able
to so we've introduced the largest
health care system in the world for
doing that is and we believe that this
health system in any case is going to in
itself is going to increase employment
and increase the
make a vibrant bringing more hospitals
which get abandoned and what it does to
what it does to every family is they it
assured of treatment therefore their
their ability to participate and
contribute to okay building the okay let
me just let me just let me just pick up
on that point because said you know even
the health sector things like Ayushmann
balance technically should help generate
employment but the opposition is honing
in on that point and all the opposition
is saying look look at the jobs data
doles in statistics don't matter
are we or should we be satisfied or are
you as a government satisfied with
tangential examples of job data well I'm
happy that you make this point that it
is finally you made this point that is
to be a position that is criticizing so
there is the there is a distinction when
the criticism is from the public it is
genuine when the criticism is from the
opposition it is manufactured we are by
fact the largest growing economy in the
world our GDP is somewhere around seven
point three we've come from the being
the 11th of the 13th largest economy in
the world in 2013 to being the sixth
largest economy in the world so we are
the growing one now you tell me sir
that a largest growing economy with a
very high GDP is it does not generate
keep it growing how does the economy
becoming stronger all this
infrastructure that is being built it's
being built in the air is it what
somebody is actually building it right
the manufacture growing the MSME sector
is being supported who's working the in
the MSME sector
someone is working there okay in the
farmers farm sector there are various
schemes we provided to double the income
between two to agriculture outputs the
fishery is the animal husbandry they are
being interests of mention is being
given is it actually happening or is it
just in the air how is the economy
growing
so therefore this therefore this
critique that you say and I am glad
please keep repeating it that it's the
opposition that's doing it announcement
that so made did you
did you even see a single member from
the opposition ban bench even clap or
thump the table when the I think that
you do a minister rutte or so let me
just pick up on that thought on job is
data because we don't have reliable in
this country we don't have reliable
unemployment statistics most progressive
countries are able to generate those why
why haven't been able to create that
people who are investing in our country
why are they investing in the country
for whom are they investing the country
but the point is they want to contribute
they want to donate money to India or
they want to generate more money who's
going to work there all this economy all
the manufacturing all the infrastructure
that's happening ok but is actually
creating jobs the point it is not empty
or hollow ok the point of the jobs then
remains that do we have data or should
it be 10 tangent so let me pick up the
the question of the middle class because
now there is a pitch that this is a
middle class friendly budget but the
three kuru people that should take
relief there's another three and a half
odd corrode who won't get any relief
whatsoever and they perhaps some
uncertainty so what will the jobs front
on in this front what do you feel if you
want to have the cake and eat it too is
it every single budget we've covered the
poor the women the farmers and we've
also covered the middle class but you
kept saying that the middle class being
left out we focus on the middle class
now you say what about the others okay
every single sector has been covered
okay all right one left okay no one left
out but you can't have your cake and eat
it too I'm going to leave it there but
quickly Raja Burton wrote or is is there
you know have you been talking about
pakora wallah pensions and everything
has come out today is there anything
possibly left in the bank after this
budget for you guys to come up with for
the elections give us ain't this is just
the trailer we've just begun we've just
done five years right now there's much
more to be done in India this is for the
first time that the government has
proved that Indian governments can work
without scams
that there can be transparency in
working the people who are working in
the committed people there's a
difference the tax that you all are
paying is being used to strengthen the
most modernized people and there is no
leakage in that tax money would you like
that would you would you prefer the tax
cuts your money that you pay gets leaked
out gets paid as bribes so there are no
middlemen now there is there are times
the money is reaching down to the the
most poor and downtrodden we are getting
medical treatment they are getting
medical treatment by your money and
therefore this is the government that
has a vision for India I had all right
he want to and we have a plan for it a
five trillion economy in next five years
well a economy in next eight years well
this has to be a sense of belief and
there's this when Roger wasn't over
we're all sitting on that same boat call
India so if the if the country's doing
well we wish you the best with that
because like I said we're in the same
boat but let me pick up on that point
let me quickly get Ranjit Randall have
you missed that conversation today when

minimum pension stands remember at 1,000
rupees per month for the organized
workers the scheme will cost the
government 500 koror rupees as well so
not for a lot of sectors
which was of course only expected in an
election year would it be enough though
for the NDA government to get them their
works for them to come back later this
year that something only time will tell
but joining us live in the broadcast to
examine this union budget of 2019 and
give us there now we have a special
panel when he's going to a leader of the
BJP he joins us in our studio H where
Mahadev spokesperson the Congress so
tree current baby consumer market
analyst will be with us in just a bit so
miss Pierre digital tech expert joins us
in our studio SK that a political
analyst also live with us in our studio
Prashant Solomon honorary treasurer CR
EDA I also live with us in our studio
and Vivek vagabond economic analyst
still live with us as well an expert
Vivek Padma you want to come in before
we took the break on the jobs argument
as well Vikram madaba I beg your pardon
you know that's something of course that
the opposition has been criticizing you
also raised that point earlier you want
to come up with an intervention from
Winnie ji was that of course I have no
reason it's beautiful challenge the
numbers you spoke about in terms of job
creation but my worry is the gap between
the unemployment unemployed youth
Reserve is the number of jobs being
created there so to give you some
numbers you know we have closed about 6
million graduates hitting the job market
every year to top it up we have 16.3%
graduates who are unemployed on another
14.2% post graduates and Beyond are
unemployed so the numbers are huge
vis-a-vis the numbers of job creations
which have been done what I want you to
understand how do you how do you plan to
address this huge gap which is arts all
these years we were producing graduates
and post graduates who are looking out
for jobs only in a government sector and
the education system was at stake and
number two a meticulous who was not
earning well was subjected to go to
schools which are not so good according
to I am varieties of this world because
they were not not having money to pay
their face especially the category are
the social reservation now I think this
first particular thing which we have
done is to enable this was not socially
backward but economically backward a
class made to be upper-class Hindus be
it be Christians or Muslims now get
benefit of this and go to good schools
like you and me and come and sit in this
particular bit again so that is one
amendment and you see the results in
five to four years number two the
transparency which has come up now
because of that the applications are
online selections are online in
challenge now there is no biteys about
you don't see you know some railway
ministers are you weighing and doing
mass candles of jobs and will be a
ministry you don't see this kind of
scanners which are coming up number
three see our education system till did
was producing clerks the Macklowe system
here there is a little change you are
enabling and making them interference as
I said in the earlier segment see the
number of jobs which have been created
in private sector you know the 72 lakh
UPF which has been filed up this is
because there isn't jobs in organised
certain if I go and own the unorganized
sector the an element to have their own
vehicles the passenger vehicles more
than 32 lakh passenger way there you
have to understand passenger vehicles
are not generally one by one person or
not driven driven by belt or some more
than two people I do that extra 4 lakhs
and jobs have been created there itself
yeah irrigation enablement of the farms
will give an access to the farmers and
their last one gas when did you ever
think that there will be an extra of
food grains and food ok I need to open
this up to the rest of our panel but I
want to quickly go cross also to Lucknow
at this point for an on-ground
of people there what is Gupta my
colleague joining us live on the
broadcast run it what are people's
reaction on ground to the Union budget
of 2019 it's very important to get the
AMA place where one is over 2
well the aam aadmi is really happy with
this budget if you if you see the people
are really happy you know they are
saying that this is a faithless budget
and this budget has cater to the middle
class and the farmers so I'm joined by a
few people here who are you know in a
who are working and they are middle they
belong to a middle class Society let me
just ask them what they have to say
about this but about middle class Kelly

Kisaragi
good cause bought you up quiz budget
killer you incomes rising middle-class
families you belong gonna get out you
choose wreckage or dialects a path latke
mostly but again you know this this will
be a game changer and as the ministers
of you know union government they are
also pointing it out and they are also
saying that this is a very populist
budget and definitely this will help you
know the middle class also the
relaxation in the tax so will definitely
help him will definitely help them you
know and this will also be helping BJP
in this twenty seconds also
so please all budget in the people there
in Lucknow you spoke to obviously
welcoming it that should you know set
some smiles in BJP leaders faces at
least those reactions of those people
Burnett stay with us now let me also
bring impressions or a minute is a
pointer for Sean Solomon and of the real
estate sector per se but also your
overall analysis of you know other
aspects of the union budget 2019 the
interim budget 2019 the last budget
movie Sarkar what is your view
perspective I think it has done it is
that a good relief to the general people
in terms of the biggest priorities is
raising the income tax limit from five
actually effectively it's six point five
lakhs because of the 1.5 extra you can
invest in certain instruments so which
means that anyone in India who earns up
to fifty four thousand rupees a month is
now essentially exempted from income tax
which is a good thing because that will
put a lot more disposable income in the
pockets of people which will be spent
and that will fuel the entire economy
now as a representative from the real
estate industry as you as you as you
mention that we are happy with this
budget because we have seen the part
from the income tax exemption there are
other benefits that have been given to
the industry like for example people who
are into how affordable projects the the
exemption under the Income Tax Act
eighty IB P bas re it's been excited for
one more year penal rent one unsold
inventory has also been extended from
one to two years which is a great thing
and a very good thing
what Forrester mentioned although there
were no numbers but they are still very
hopeful in the industry he said that
they are talking to the GST Council
about giving further to home buyers
under GST currently we're paying 12%
they're paying 12% we're hopeful in the
industry that if this is reduced further
that will help the common well
boost the industry as a whole income tax
on on properties you know which are
notional rent has been extended to
second houses as well
occupied houses capital gains taxes also
then the rollover of capital gains tax
been extended from one to two houses and
TPS deduction of rent from 1 point 8
lakhs has gone up to 2.4 lakh so for the
real estate industry as such it's a
great budget and we ready welcome it
however in general one more point I
would like to add is that there are
certain questions as in if you look at
it from a balanced perspective the
question is that actually as the finance
ministers talk more the fiscal deficit
is that really how will that will you be
able to maintain physical deficit
fiscally budget prudently given the
swaps in the announcements is your
question okay
so with me your analysis your reading of
the budget you see okay how do I look at
it I look at budget fall it's a 360
degree budget it's a complete change
from a paradigm what we had there is no
single sector and there is no Indian
ignore me which can today same I am left
out it's a budget for the people its
budget by the people so they have done
everything to please every sector there
are no leftovers so that's the first
friend to make and you know I recall I I
was last night on your channel I said
that you know rather than putting about
piecemeal demands why don't we ask and I
presume that they'll be up to 50,000
rupees of income will have no income tax
and then that has come true and the
second thing would want what do what is
more important than that is you know you
look at today why this has been possible
you have the highest collection of tax
your the highest number of people in the
text net your GST was talking about our
lack rose in January but the pure G gave
the figure with more people joining the
text net with GST collections becoming
to all our high you know all-time high
what we can expect in the economy that
the burden on the individual taxpayers
will come you know what and the most
important thing what I want to specify
here is not the farmers is not a
middle-class yeah I said yesterday
middle class deserves what they get and
it's rightfully so thank you sir thanks
for so you're happy for the yeah yeah
but one money modified you know what
they learned which was the biggest
revelation of my life is that
unorganized sector contributes 255
Buster blend engines and there was
nobody who was talking about that there
was no pension scheme there was nothing
farmers so you might realize that yeah
farmers middle class my friend Harry but
you know what sector is often the
ignored sector by a successive
government the unorganized sector is not
reversible you're saying so it's a first
time straight you know yeah and the
started to show that it's a body of many
first okay currently they come in here
what's your view of the budget and how
markets reacted to the budget for the
industry and also for the common it's a
360 budget has rightly said against the
middle class and the scepter is again
given much more importance in this
budget and we feel that we completely
consumer market experts specifically on
the point we did increase consumer
spending and and secondly I've you know
the Sensex and the etcetera it would
definitely in terms of the consumer
spending we expect the consumer having
rich in terms of the taxation would be
spending more to buy the consumer
durable products but we were expecting
more in terms of the important benefits
to encourage the a-class component-level
manufacturing in the country and also
there was some more incentives expected
on the exports because if we see
currently India is a very attractive
marketplace for all the foreign
investors in the brands who come here
and manufacture but there are some
incentives which one especially on the
exports to you know encourage the
a-class component level manufacturing in
the country right now under make in
India we all know that it's growing but
still we are missing on the a-class
component level and the technology or
acumen let me now go to the politicians
on the panel and before I go to the BJP
and Congress surface and it is political
analysts that I you know come in here at
the end of the day this is this was a
budget that of course you know is coming
in an election your do you believe it
will be a please all budget that was
expected
well last year I had said that the last
year's budget was in my understanding
the best budget but I that the outgoing
government today has given the best
budget it is a budget which is meant for
all it's a budget which is meant for the
deprived section of the society I was
always always concerned about the
deprived section of the society whether
it was the unorganized sector whether it
was the farming class or for that matter
whether it was the you know lower middle
class and the middle class as such and
it's a good move on part of the
government that the government has taken
care of all the section of the society
and specially all these classes which
I'm talking about secondly together with
this if we look into the allocation
which has been given to the but in the
budget for the different sector that
itself is a quantum leap there is a
almost a 32 percent hike in relation to
beer defense allocation it is almost
three lakh crore now which is in a way
very very historic taking into
consideration that geostrategic scenario
across South Asia and Southeast Asia and
yesterday the Cabinet Committee on
defense had taken a decision of allowing
sixty thousand crores for modernization
of weaponry or defense forces just just
ten seconds please that itself is a
historic move together with that
unorganized sector which is almost
around ten crore in number in our
country the fact that for the first time
they have been brought under the
organized sector we test scheme at sixty
years of age this itself is
out-of-the-box thinking you know it's
out-of-the-box extinct in which for the
last sixty years the government has ever
thought of the gypsies and the nomadic
tribes in our country who have always
been out of the economic ladder of the
country not that this government has
thought on those lines in bringing them
to the economic ladder that itself is a
historic initiative together with that
if you look into the sobs went to the
farming sector to the farmers you know
and specially the sixth
and repeats as direct transfer as I was
mentioning you yesterday gory I mean
that itself is a historic move and I
think our government taking into
consideration the tight economic
scenario not only at the domestic level
but also at the Internet
this was the best possible way of
getting to the needs of each and every
section of the society and I see no
other way a better move could have been
done when the opposition reacts with ifs
and buts and with full stops and commas
and says that it is in half in English
and half in Hindi that itself shows that
the budget is actually so good that they
had nothing to squabble about except for
finding out we are finding out the ifs
and buts and semicolons politics is
something that we will continue to
debate as well whether or not this is
really the poll Google the bugle being
sounded out to by the BJP also fossa is
the big question
in fact we do have a big guest joining
us on the broadcast MC Amitabha and CEO
of nithi i oka is with us mr. here
Missa
this is gonna hear a curiosa
yeah I can hear you alright sir so our
first thoughts on the budget many say
it's actually a please all budget it's
there something is there for everybody
in this
first of foremost I think the budget
makes a very general change it moves
away from you know whole business about
farm loan waivers
and gets into the business of direct
benefit this transformational because
there will be no issues of you know
credit histories market market
distortions and that to my mind is good
and when you look at this along with the
five percent interest of my invention
right along with focus on dairy and
Fisheries this will be really good for
the economy but the important thing is
that Center has pushed what it had to do
and now the states have to call for
market reforms they need to bring in
technology they need to push for cold
storages logistics warehouses and a lot
is incumbent on
okay all right so you feel of course the
next step of reforms have to be taken by
secondly I think many people have gnawed
on yes sir go ahead finish your point
sir the you know the budget shows us 17
to 18 percent increase in education and
health
this is transformational because in the
long run the country can't grow without
adequate resources being put in
education and health and without human
development index thirdly I think the
budget puts a lot of income in the hands
of agriculture sector and that is the
farmers and the middle class of India
right and this will in turn enhance
earnings and and push focus vestment and
the rural economy of India and you will
see in due course a thrust on two
wheelers three wheelers tractors and
increased increased expenditure in the
rural economy of India that will be
greatly beneficial to the larger economy
of India so the back of the envelope
calculations in terms of how much of a
boost will this be to the consumption
led economy or the consumption led
growth really after a first for money
coming in the hands of middle-class more
money coming in the hands of the farmers
no wipes a consumption led economy
because the budget has a huge focus on
infrastructure and why there's a huge
focus on social sector so so all these
put together the budget has to be looked
at in its totality and and more than the
numbers came I think when a budget is
just four or five months before the
election you have to look at the
narrative of the budget you have to say
whether the budget brings out the big
picture of what has been what has been
done what is the vision of the
government for the future what is what
is the canvas large canvas of the
government and Dada Dada and there the
budgets cause very well it brings an
optimism and hope and and I think that's
important because the budget story is
woven through the story of jobs it
across sectors it lot not merely looks
at jobs for today but it looks at new
areas of growth so the criticism coming
in is artificial intelligence electric
mobility digital widget so the criticism
coming in is that not enough for digital
villagers all these are chocha not
enough mention as far as jobs is
concerned that is that is one of the big
criticisms that's coming in no no the
whole actually the whole budget story is
a JA story of jobs across agriculture
sector across em SME sector across
unorganized sector and across across new
areas of growth
so you take this well pusher and create
more jobs
I'm quite sure if you put more income
culture sector if you are pushing for
dairy and Fisheries if you are pushing
for MSME sector if you are creating
greater thrust on even electric mobility
transportation highways will they not
create jobs okay what if they are all
multiplier impacts on job creations
alright so what about the fact that you
know as far as the back of the auditions
for the revenue and the expenditures is
that something that is within the
comfort level as far as fiscal prudence
is concerned or at you know as as
somebody who understands the economy as
somebody or numbers where at some level
you're little concerned about any of
those figures
nobody madder look at that the only
concern can be the fiscal slippage from
3.43
to three point four three two but that
sort of work it's also worried because
as long as resources are going into
infrastructure and the resources are
getting into the farming community hand
so I don't I don't my I'm not a great
believer on one point two numbers as
long as the quality of in quality of all
right so you're not you're not so
concerned as far as overall numbers are
concerned also sir what about the fact
that you know this is this is a
breakaway though as as somebody who who
pays taxes as somebody who's
representative of middle-class I'm and
thrilled at the prospect of paying lower
taxes but there are many who believe
this is a way from convention
no the budget it's a it's a budget for
you know which any any interim budget of
this nature would have spelled the long
story here would have spelled out the
vision it would have spelled out the
narrative and as it should have been and
should have taken some policy missions
which it has done any special it is
addressed and it has addressed the
concern of the unorganized the middle
class and the farming community okay any
any specific area that you think the
economy needed more focus on or do you
think this is a very holistic budget
that does created
no I I you know I'm a big believer in
the fact that it's not possible for a to
grow without immense focus on health
outcomes without focusing on learning
outcomes and sing on nutrition
so these are areas which were not very
specific missions-- but then I had a I
had a very close look at the budgetary
outlays and I found that actually Henan
health of an increase of over 17 17
percent hmm okay all right
so that's sorry so what about banking
that's that's a sector do you think
needed more concerned and more more
effort sir so banking the bank
capitalization has just been done the
you know but that's an issue out of the
out of the budget process you know the
capitalization of the banks the the
greater focus on the greater focus on
the insolvency Krupp c-code and pushing
for quicker faster resolution is
necessary but that's not a but
everything can't be weaved into the
budget and should not be weaved into the
budget all right everything odd British
out of the budget and has already been
much action is underway on that okay so
final two questions sir we've addressed
specific areas what about the fact that
you know now a lot more money is being
given as far as the farmers so do you
think this will be able to address the
rural distress that many says is
something it's far more than what we are
being able to appreciate
no it's it's a very good step forward on
to address the issue of Lulu distress
but you can't look at agriculture sector
one in isolation you have to look at
what is being done in the rural
development sector through roads through
man raiga many other areas and second
point I want to make is that long term
long term at issues cannot be resolved
cannot be resolved without technology
without market without cold storages
without backward forward linkages
without pedis without better seeds wider
to farmers and although see the job of
the state governments alright last
question to use a May one on
agricultural reforms on agriculture
homes we need to we need to name and
shame our state governments ok last
question to use as far as the budget is
concerned and the investors they of
course have reacted positively to the
budget announcements do you think that
despite being an election year the
message that goes out to the global
investor community is of policy
continuity the message that goes out is
that India is still a growth story
the story goes that goes out is of
policy continuity of stability of
predictability and of dynamism and
growth
all right so believe it there Muskaan
really appreciate you joining us on the
podcast taking those questions as far as
budget is concerned your first thoughts
on the Union Budget presented by interim
Finance Minister P woosh coil this of
course is the question of the moody
government set into motion really as far
as campaigning is concerned from here on
for the BJP as Amitabh Kant was pointing
out as far as agriculture is concerned a
lot needs to be done by state
governments but of course the budgets
key announcements would lead to a lot of
spurring of consumption led economy and
consumption led growth from here on
going forward you wanna you want to come
in on that mr. C we need to see the Hult
in a holistic manner you know like I
mean we cannot isolate one sector from
the other and we cannot isolate
consumers from the supply side or you
know people who are supply-side from the
demand side everything has to be looked
in a holistic manner in a holistic
pattern and then only we can identify as
to which way things are going and which
way things are blowing you know the fact
that the stock market the Nifty and the
National Stock Exchange should reacted
in a very point the fact that you know
like our investors have been very very
positive about this budget you know the
industrialists parcei
quite pleased with this budget and the
concerns of the rural distress and the
concerns of the unorganized sector zhh
have been met in this but you know if we
really overcome this scenario of
unemployment okay we have to think on
those lines and I guess on those lines
this budget has actually focused that
direction okay and mr. fuse girl has
proved that a good chatter accountant is
normally and good economists alright
okay on that note a quick break on the
show built out on the other side with

welcome back I'm with empathizing you're
watching news X's exhaustive coverage
off the union budget 2019 the interim
budget presented today by interim FM P
were spoiled the last budget off the
incumbent NBA government under Prime
Minister Narendra Modi they've said it's
a please all budget will it be enough to
get them the votes to come back to power
that remains the big question in an
election year let me quickly go across
now to Aishwarya mahadev spokesperson to
the Congress he also live with us at
this point - Maria Mahadev the BJP says
it's a please old budget they've touched
upon every single sector some in the
unorganized sector in the middle class
who often are ignored by budgets in
previous BJP tenuous and Congress
generals and they believe this will be
the game changer to sway the votes in
their favor in an election year do you
agree with that
okay I don't think she can hear can you
hear me alright I think she clearly
can't hear me but you know one of the
main criticisms of course clearly has
been submit on the jobs front and you
were hearing the defense said I mean CEO
of nathie I hope was giving just a short
while back he said we don't necessarily
need to create a talk about creating
jobs you spur growth please
yeah and jobs or let me give you the
first biggest takeaway if you look from
every India I'm not talking about myself
not a lot of people on the panel here
every India you see five trillion is a
story of the past we are talking of 10
trillion now 2030 10 trillion that is
the new story and we have also given the
region what how are we going to achieve
it this is exactly what I said you in
yesterday I mean that class that was
with me I said you know it's not going
to be able to you you can expect
everything from Prime Minister Modi
knowing his style he's a leader who
monetization to surgical strikes in well
months if that is the caliber of the
leader so don't think it will be just a
hodgepodge barrier at something will
happen some soft should be given middle
class will great things will happen but
he'll also his also going to give a
vision for 10 years not his game he
given new benchmarks that what is Modi
say what is p.m. say respect will he
give me two more terms from my economy
when I talk about was I won 1.5 1.6 I'll
take you to 10 today you are already the
highest grade Namie at 7.5% the IMF says
you're going at 7.7 China and all are
going up and what are the major policy
steps which I am going to take what are
those 10 commandments which I'm going to
take to make it rain brilliant and if
you look today or die
what did the puce say who is Georgie
said one thing very clearly anything he
was and also he was relating into jobs
okay because with GDP increasing with
text structure increasing with demand
increasing the job some increase because
we don't have aliens coming from Mars to
do jobs in India neither the Chinese
will come we only going to do the jobs
so if we are increasing the economy in
10 years from now the 10th really who's
going to do all the jobs the jobs are
going to be with us Indian so we're
going to do all the jobs so there should
be no doubt about dogs if somebody wants
puts commas what rightly said said a
processor office know how their
political conventions but in a democracy
they're welcome to have some more let me
quickly go to Aishwarya Rai
spokesman said the Congress once again
if she can have you can you hear me yeah
you know the the BJP says it's a please
all budget its course was expected in an
election year you heard before the break
CEO nithya yoga Amitabh can't respond to
the criticism of your party and other
opposition no mention of jobs in this
particular budget at the end of the day
you know all aspects all sectors have
been touched upon ash we're here from
the unorganized sector to the middle
class cause the farmers do you believe
all this could possibly sway the I
worried rather that all this could
possibly sway the votes in the BJP s
favor that's what they're hoping after
this but that they're calling quite a
game-changer budget in an election year
you know that's it there are a few
things that need to be clarified first
of all it is what mr. Chidambaram called
it a last-gasp budget and the thing is
as much as the using it for being so
holistic every sector and almost making
it a panacea for all ills you realize
this is not what an interim budget is
even supposed to be not only has played
fraud upon what is constitutional
convention and parliamentary convention
they've also played fraud on the
aspirations of millions who they're now
going to take and sell a snake-oil to
the rest of the country in an election
year the very simple fact is that
interim budgets are very hard to put
through in in the next few months the
government is inevitably whoever the
dispensation is it is going to change
and I believe that if they had such
great solutions in all these years why
want one of these budgets
you know announced even two years ago or
three years ago nothing this is a budget
where they're clutching at straws and
they're trying to put out a budget
everybody says it's extremely realistic
know there are large gaps in this but me
and you know it is a fallacious argument
to say you know what because we're
driving towards GDP growth GDP growth
mind you is based on revised numbers
which is why they're showing growth that
high if they're driving towards GDP
growth which means drugs will naturally
come into play no the fenomena jobless
growth has been viewed in several
countries including well during the UPA
regime and I have to concede that I
believe at some point you have also left
out very key sectors of actually pushing
you pushing growth rate yeah what about
the infrastructure sector you have not
played emphasis on that you also speak
about a whole bunch of gamut of things
where are the jobs you owe not only how
examining reports come out but there is
no mention of how you're going to good
but that's the point for you that summit
account which applies to before the
break not because they're hoping that
the you know that they would you
speaking about okay fair enough before I
come back to you on the three points
through the three sectors that the
government has focused on and is opening
to be a game-changer you've spoken of
the of the sectors that they haven't I
will come to you on those three specific
first I want to quickly go back across
to an on-ground
perspective we're trying to get the
voices of the common people as well on
the unit value 2019 because their voices
matter of course cool voices and expert
voices we got you voices from lucknow an
hour back now it's time to go to Kolkata
let's go to West Wing goal that's a you
know politically sensitive statement TMC
squaring off against each other what are
the reaction share Chatterjee of people
there to this budget well well they as
we just talked about the budget remember
we saw the Chief Minister as well as the
Finance Minister address the press",True,en,10998,1,24

categorically that this data this this
report that is being cited is not yet
finalized is the draft report and the
data that is being cited is not yet to
be in is not yet been finalized or
approved by the government but using
this data I think is not the right thing
to do and the reason for that is very
simple the reason for that is that this
this data is still being looked at
because we have to we have to publish
the quarter on quarter report so that is
the right thing to do so let me explain
the household the household survey went
into the field for July 2017 and
collected data for that quarter of
July's temblor and then October to
December etc etc and then the data or
for July to September 2018 and September
to December October to December 2018 the
field that the survey was in the field
and that data has just been received and
is being processed so without having
that data with us without having the
data with us we cannot do a quarter on
quarter comparison and to and and until
we do that quarter on quarter comparison
and we make sure that the data collected
in the first round is is in some sense
you know verified by the next sort of
next next quarter by the successive
quarter neither do we know the Delta nor
do we know the veracity of the data
because it's just that once you collect
a data of eight bar apnea back here now
you will know that he casts a data
collect or I he's got you palea kameni
macaca or what I had was Kelly it to
change here when you call that was the
routier or do a clarification you have
only was earlier data to give me who I
had for the data review process all
right yes sir garnet is report for with
a really sneaky otta or year what are
the Germans fake water Khadija
Vanga
he's carrying his data beside karna all
people adelphia
he is compare carnage Arab aris Arab
army a pataga a funeral service will it
pass shall meet Bartowski methodology T
it is very different just to give you an
example data yoga wah hota score status
it don't divide the effluent and low
income you know and then you pulled out
this sample from those two strata now we
are now this data example is being you
know based on the educational
achievements of the house doors so that
if there are three all right that was
Rajeev Kumar of course talking post that
report that had come out earlier in the
day as far jabs is concerned there will
of course be a lot of focus on the kind
of commentary that comes out as far as
job creation is concerned remember moody
government has faced a lot of flak on
that count but as we find you coming in
right now is the revision as far as GDP
dereyes concern it's been revised from
six point seven percent as we said to
7.2% really in branch and as far as the
government is concerned given that it is
facing a lot of flack as we said on
several other parameters so I think the
perception you know even job creation
data is not as important as this one's
people that yes there are opportunities
yes my income has gone up and yes that
there are possibilities for me to
enhance my income and for my friends and
for me I think unless that sense comes
to the people just numbers I'm not going
to make an impact for this government is
that sense coming in that's most
important I think you know that the
challenge today's world is that
employment in the traditional sense is
not growing but work opportunities in a
completely new environment
whether that will make an impact on the
voting trends and the mind sense of
voters is is a big question simply
because we have been traditionally for
decades being told unless you have a
government job and a permanent job you
have not arrived so I think that is the
balance which is which we will see how
it plays out okay all right let me let
me get in the to political
representative Malik as well as Mohammad
Khan Raman to you first of course these
are positive data points that are coming
in for the government but time and again
there has been a lot of talk about you
know let's address the jobs issue
because that is what Rajeev Kumar was
talking about right now and then we come
into some of the other breaking news as
well you know I would like differ a
little bit from maybe a lot of things
worth my other panelists were yeah
enormous would who want to say what I am
about to say is we already elements
think see when you talk about
opportunities which have been there and
the mindset that was their mindset was
as correctly said that if you do not
have a government job you have not been
something great in your life if you've
done got a government job now your
secured and your various thing was you
know in the earlier time some dowry
issues and not a thing all those things
were you know having those para me okay
so today that paradigm shift has come
into in set of people today it is more
important whether you are doing whether
you are employable or not all right
whether you are into some employment or
not okay how it takes is all that
matters and debates to me see people
have taken some more alone these are all
lower state of society okay and they
have now started some business or the
other even if they're they just taking
one person more alright you are talking
about big numbers okay there's another
important study which is about to come
by economic trends would tell you more
about it I guess but there was
extremely poor category of people
getting less than one point nine dollars
a day all right
that number was 268 to 68 million in
2011 okay this time that study make
around 50 all right okay so let's look
at some of the other data points as well
that will come in okay we have an entire
evening to talk about some of those data
points but let's address for breaking
news coming in maybe AJ Pryor who's the
first member of Travis's Economic
Advisory Council has come out with a
with a very important statement saying
that it will not just be hunkering of
tax labs what we should be bracing for
should be big cuts as far as tax rates
are concerned can that happen in a photo
account is the big question Robbie Jay
the fact that there could be not just
minor tinkering as far as tax labs are
concerned but massive changes could be
really bigger it could be the highlight
of the entire budget so my view on this
would be that of course I mean we have
been debating that whether this is going
to be a boat on account or an interim
budget or a full frigate of course
certainly not full-fledged but certainly
not vote on account much more than that
maybe as far as tax rate cuts are
concerned we all know that the current
slab is 2.5 right the fact that
government few months back has brought
10 percent reservation for the
economically weaker section so if I draw
up there it provides a hint that slight
wrinkling in the budget in the slab I
won't see it will go much higher but it
could be 0.45 to 3 and why I say show is
because if you look at the rebate
provision which talks of 87a which talks
about if your income is 0.5 lat then
2500 rupees rebate you can get on gay
additional income hundred percent rebate
so that in a way amounts to you know
three lack of exemption but that is only
for income restricted to three point
five okay so even if the slab is
increased to three so what I am trying
to make but only stretching it to the
rest of the income group so the the toll
on the revenue
be much okay by doing that or it may not
be so much but never is this a feel-good
factor you know Garre I just want to say
that the conventional habit in India is
to look at every budget from the point
of your financial year unfortunately
what happens is the new put policies
which basically slow down growth over a
three or five year period by
concentrating only on this financial
year I would like to point out that if
you have a lower tax rate a much lower
tax rate you will get significantly more
taxes we are all talking a lot about how
there's been such a growth in the tax
base after the monetization actually the
year of D monetization there was hardly
any increases I mean frankly the fact is
unless you reduce rates significantly
you're not going to get people coming
into a tax base so you need to look at
some of three or five-year horizon
instead of just a 12 month horizon all
right okay so let's let the bureau
before I get into a corporate tax rate
bitters where put mister table as well
as such good seats let's quickly get in
Mohammed Khan as well for his opening
comments for Merck our expectation is
that there could be some relief coming
in for the middle classes and in fact
Jay Pro has come out with a very very
strong statement and a very a statement
that really you know gives us a sense of
what lies tomorrow morning is that it
may not be just minor tinkering but
massive changes in tax labs
well hurry if there is tinkering in tax
labs I was listening to professionally
but he's right I believe the phenomenon
he's referring to is called the Laffer
curve that if you lower the tax rate the
base automatically goes up and we all
benefit so let's see I mean you remember
this time last year as well there was
similar talk that there would be a
relief package granted to the middle
class yet the budget last year was in
our opinion a bit of a dampener we
expect to see a push for things like a
huge Mahabharat that is our hope because
you remember last year we criticized
their use of the grounds that the
budgetary allocation was insufficient to
meet targets and we move in September of
last year when the CEO and the various
officers were on the program also asked
for higher grants okay you hope that
schemes like MGNREGA PMD sy and Indra
vas eugenia also see an increase but to
be honest with you instead of getting
into a hypothetical discussion we would
wait till tomorrow to see what are the
numbers all right yes of course we
should but it of the fact is because it
is the big day pricing and not just you
know rumor mongering that's happening
ahead of budget let's quickly move ahead
let's quickly now pre cut out the
corporate tax rate as well that is
expectation there as well that there
could be a five percent reduction in
corporate taxes that may happen from 25
percent to 20 percent remember done
Jaitley when he took over as a finance
minister did make that policy statement
that over a period of time he does more
to lower taxes wants to bring India at
par with some of the other Asian
economies there have been constraints
more than one as far as those social
sector schemes are concerned but
nevertheless there is an expectation
that it may actually go down to 20
percent if it does happen table it of
course was gonna send out a huge message
as far as the investor community is
concerned
oh absolutely I think if they're able to
lo the tax lab it will definitely add a
lot of good a lot of good vibes to all
the corporate players but I think there
is also cash to that because right now
that slab is only four thrown over up to
250 K rules
I think the FM will also be inclined to
increase that threshold limit to maybe
more than 250 crores mainly so that the
big corporates also get a piece of that
okay and it will automatically be a very
good move after that is able to be done
mr. Seng you want to come in here is
that possible
yeah no I I don't think at this stage
specially it being the budget there's
going to be too much of tinkering with
the corporate tax personally I think the
focus is really going to be on chromatic
lassen and and and if I would if I was
ready to have my we're probably said
instead of that I'd probably make the 2%
CSR which is which nobody is really I
don't think that's been passed but for
people who actually put that into for
selective schemes you spoke about the
universal basic income but I think when
it comes to a fight it's it's something
which can be done it can be linked to
some of your existing schemes you've got
an area which is the Employment
Guarantee Scheme you got you got mudra
which is which is which is really trying
to promote entrepreneurship and and we
spoke about the one of my friends here
spoke about the numbers that have been
there but if you look at the numbers
last year two and a half given but the
average ticket size only 50,000 now with
50 thought you can't really start an
enterprise right so I think what we
really need to focus on it whether we
get funds from trying to we've got about
thousand schemes centrally and stranger
novels half the money really goes into
just tents right that needs to be
channelized and and probably the
corporate taxation you have a point to
make because then I'll get from knows I
just want to say that politically if you
make a small change and I mean zero two
point five two three or three points to
even five it's a small change it's not a
major change and if you change corporate
tax by five percent it's a small change
it's not going to make much of an impact
of the business or the voter my point is
Gary because Indian corporate taxes are
higher then a lot of other taxes what
happens is that corporates have an
incentive to
downsize the profits they show so the
tax collection becomes less I've always
been in favor of lower rates because
then Indian corporates will have Indian
and coppers operating here will then
show the actual profit and pay the
correct tax Franzel is that something
that FM has an elbow room right now to
do because of the time and again in the
past budgets also did say that I want to
do that but there are more than one
constraint you know I think this is not
something which should be a priority for
the government in this ahead of
elections because I don't see a
tremendous impact because what what
Copland world really needs is better
liquidity and even more importantly
higher consumer demand in the end what
drives the economy is consumer demand
and I think that's where and that's
linked to job creation so if I the two
key drivers of the economy and that has
a serious impact Khan on politics is
consumer demand as well as job creation
if one happens consumer demand wouldn't
happen and if consumer demand happens
then you know economic activity picks up
there will be fresh investments new
factories will be created today the way
things are that if you look at all the
manufacturing capacity in the country
you still are about 65 to 70% of
utilization now which is not very high
new investment cycles typically kick off
once we reach 80 to 85 percent because
that's when you realize you know you're
hitting the peak so I think corporate
tax should not be the real issue but
steps to trigger Pressman's in
incentives to do that could be something
that the corporates would be happier
with it remains to be seen yes if I have
a point of view on corporate tax I would
like to like in their initial year
whenever an presented the budget did he
talked about reducing it from 30 to 25
percent over a period of time and
suppose even if it is from 25 to 20 now
then look at the personal tax rate so a
personal tax rate somebody earning more
than one crore
yes the threshold rate goes almost
thirty four percent we severe rate of
poverty tax twenty percent which I think
in an election year might create more
heartburn
that's a fair point yes absolutely and
you know we come back to the fact at the
end of the day this is an election year
this is an election budget there are of
course constraints to the FF has to deal
with let's move ahead let's let's
quickly now talk about some of the other
taxation slabs that many believe may in
fact not just be tinkered as we make the
prices may be massively revised let's
move ahead let's get into the breaking
news as well there may be increase in
the limit under Section 80 C to more
than what it is right now changes in
income tax deduction limits are likely
there are four sir could lead to a lot
of a feel-good factor as far as the
middle class is concerned tax relief on
health insurance may also increase and
this of course could be under ETD as
well so essentially coming back to the
middle class as watching as far as this
is concerned Rehman Malik efforts being
made by the government or at least the
BJP would want their efforts to be made
by the government to try and ensure that
middle-class that core water of the BJP
comes back to it who has been
disenchanted who's been the Notah for
years that affected you in the three
assembly elections you know if you say
the notoriously nota boria's have
understood what they have earned by the
nota especially the way things are being
happening with matter / - whether it is
Rajasthan and they have seen what
happens when you make a wrong decision
but let's not get it on to just the
politics of it let's see at the india
story first and let's talk about where
this government is taking in there the
point is that there was a big disparity
in the last so many years due there was
a slogan of Caribe hurt ow okay but that
population of people who were affected
by that economic distress was not
getting you know was not getting thinner
now today in this governance what has
happened in the +4 9 to 5 years is that
the people who were actually wanting
that help from the relieving that stress
of economic disparity
helped actually whether it is health
whether it is basic amenities whether it
is all those things so that is one part
of it yes we do understand and we do
believe that there is a lot of things
which are required for the urban little
class right which is called as the basic
requirement as per aspirations okay so
we are focusing on that also that which
are the infrastructural issues right
which are the cleanliness which are the
other related way yes all that could be
touched upon in the budget Mohammed car
you want to come in there a quick
rebuttal or a quick word coming in well
I I only have the following to say to
mr. Da'Ville Malik it is interesting
that instead of a boat or a county ocean
to present all of these full budgets
I certainly hope for your sake because
you have a terrible legacy that you're
leaving behind for Economic Advisers
have resigned to RBI governors left
under mysterious circumstances the first
45 years I can only assume you're going
to pull a rabbit out of the hat tomorrow
all right okay Robert Malik let's not
take this debate in that direction
remember can very quickly if there are
limit that is there are exemption limits
as far as ATC is concerned if they are
enhanced nobody should be having a
problem with that
well we never have a problem with the
minor tinkering that this government
carries out that is what the government
is supposed to do it's supposed to make
the law better or in sync with the
changing dynamics of the economic
reality one of yours for one of your
panelists very rightly pointed out
consumer demand consumer sentiment
drives growth and that comes into play
when their employment I don't know what
they're going to do are they going to
carry out a massive public works program
to encourage employment especially
amongst rural areas by 18 percent is the
number we saw today morning shocking we
haven't seen those kind of numbers since
you know since five years and this
government is I don't know what they do
but whatever they do it won't be enough
is my feeling all right okay on that
note Mississippi to a very short
breather we come back and continue this
discussion ahead of the Union budget
that will be presented tomorrow many
believe it could just be a vote on
account and of course is looking to make
it a big political pitch what lies ahead
what could be in store for you the
viewer stay tuned we come back with that
broadcast
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
welcome back in watching a special
broadcast got it lady you're tuning in
to news X ahead of the crucial budgets
feature of pul the interim finance
minister which may of course set the
political tone of BJP s campaign for
relations we bring to our viewers the
expectations what could be some of those
major announcements that may be brought
about tomorrow morning besides of course
that the taxation changes in the tax lab
there is also an expectation that there
might be a commentary around fuel prices
being brought under the ambit of GST the
reason for that is prices were sky high
last year there was a lot of heartburn
especially amongst the middle class who
felt that they've been they've been of
course getting a raw end of the bargain
remains to be seen whether or not it
happens the commentary around that could
be very interesting also electric and
hybrid vehicles could be another area
where there could be some sort of tax
incentives that again a huge push by the
government as far as green vehicles are
concerned and something that of course
within cut curry and his ministry have
been pushing for some time it doesn't
end there there is an expectation of
natural gas as well as ATF there is a
phosphate red fuel that could also be
included in the ambit of Steel remains
to be seen what of course out of this
will actually come to but you know let
me ask you this branch and that's a
question I'd take of the entire panel
which is that fuel prices did heartburn
last year it was the middle classes who
felt that we didn't get the better end
of the bargain and the prices were
rock-bottom excise duties were increased
eleven times why are we getting the raw
end of the deal do you expect some kind
of a commentary coming in and on the
fuel prices well you know if you see
after that the fuel prices went off so
it is like being out in the Sun it is
very high you really upset you're angry
and dissatisfied you know when the
clouds come and the breeze starts
blowing then you feel much better and
you kind of forget what happened when
the Sun was you know scorching you so I
think same kind of sentiment kind of
plays out for for most of us as
consumers when the fuel prices I I will
get very upset I don't think the people
have that long-term memory and try to
you know connect to the global oil
prices and what I
paying right now right now I don't think
at this these few days fuel prices top
of the mind challenge for people I think
they're really looking at what kind of
other economic benefits they can get
what kind of opportunities they can get
I think the issue of being employable is
very important rev one mentioned that I
think that is something which people are
saying you know I'm getting very
restless I want to do something I should
happening around me but how can I
participate in that so I don't think
fuel is a very big issue at this moment
okay all right professionals you want to
come in and I will also get mr. Singh as
some of the other panelists well well
you know I'd like to say go read that
many tens of millions of people are
aware of the of the decline in global
oil and they're also aware of the
increase in prices at the pump in India
and also where the fact that it's much
higher in in India than in so many other
countries problem is that this
government has also like the previous
UPA tool made a fetish of this so-called
fiscal deficit now the reality situation
is frankly the best medicine is faster
growth so we focus on the fiscal deficit
and you sacrifice growth you're
sacrificing your long-term care and I
think this is what has happened and this
high fuel price is because of this
fetish of the fiscal deficit that you
know there is a lot of commentary around
whether or not it's time to also bring
in fuel prices I I think probably this
is this mean major sort of feature
that's gonna shake the budget this time
I mean yes there is a need to sort of
rationalize fuel prices over a period
but again I don't think that's that's
gonna be that critical this time what
I've more important is the other point
that you raised about looking at
electric vehicles and having an
incentive to try to encourage that
because globally we've seen that that's
the way the rest of the world is really
moving and that is something of the
future it would be interesting yeah and
coming to India I mean one of the
biggest problems is Israeli the
environment so that's something that in
line with what's happening globally and
at the same time we are also working
towards improving the the environment
and and
pollution levels themselves I think I
would I would want to see definite kind
of a major incentive given to hybrid
vehicles kind of a maintenance and given
to to promoting electric vehicles in
India see it's it's important this this
focus on physical deficit can be also
interpreted in the way of having enough
revenue generation for the country now
the difference between UPA 2 and India
WA and India to actually is is that
while both have focus on welfare schemes
UPA - didn't really have a plan for
missing the revenue to fund it and let
expose the biggest debate those days
that you have all these great schemes
coming up fine but how do you fund it
and that's where the economic collapse
India - has been trained and great that
they they have succeeded in some measure
in terms of expanding the tax base by
various measures but they've also
faltered in terms of investment you know
in India say it was a complete blunder
it was done internally by the government
system which you know just didn't have
the kind of sense of what was required
so I think let's link it to new
generation also and not just physical as
glad you did bring up you know some of
those revenue aspects and of course
divestment as well yes they have missed
those targets the only way they can fill
it fill it of course is true but that of
course is unrelated right now let's
quickly as we have been talking about
through the last couple of days this is
a budget where we do expect that middle
class may play a larger role in fact
they would get their share and not just
you know the social sector schemes that
are of course likely to dominate as far
as political commentary is concerned
let's quickly tell our viewers also what
is the expectation as far as home loans
education loans all those you know
issues that are very clear to a lot of
middle-class families is concerned there
is an expectation incentives affordable
housing and reads and income tax
benefits on home loans are likely there
may be some revision upwards as far as
the tax break that is available it is
see income tax benefits on home loans
may also be likely that is the
expectation let's move ahead let's also
talk about the education loans that is
again some sort of expectation that a
budget allocation for education sector
may also be in
Hantz there may be more supporter for
new IITs a new iron that may also come
about first up Ravi Jed let me ask you
about you know as far as school loans
are concerned you know time and again
many have said that this is just too
insufficient and absolutely unrelated to
the realities of the home market in
India so I'm somewhat agree because the
home loan interest benefit which was up
to 1.5 lakh for a self opieop I'd home
loan and which was without any limit for
a let out was capped to to lack so to
lack limit with just going further north
I think it's something which we have to
look at specifically when the real
estate sector investment market is kind
of slowing down so so this cat bit can
be a good area where education you know
time and again the the fact that there
could be move just on new IITs new items
again is the need of the hour yeah of
course of course I completely agree so
education law and education also is
something which can be you know added
specifically we are looking at
aggregated creating jobs I think
education can build a base I'd like to
see a lot of more work being down skill
development we talked about education
the minute about employability I we talk
about job creation it's really skills
that we need to highlight this has not
been the highlight and you see no reason
for that it's it's too fragmented it's
being run in between 12 to 13
departments something at the central
something in the state just very near to
where you're sitting right now in the
university has already started okay and
these are basic things which are going
to be lets say the backbone of the
growth in the coming era but you will
have to create the required
infrastructure I will tell you one more
thing which I think and a lot of you may
differ
thought of emphasis is being given by a
lot of economists on to the growth in
the quantum of asset value but I presume
that the asset value if it keeps
inflating would never be making a robust
economy all right it always creates a
demand base economy right but it does
not create an economy which takes care
of the entire environment around which
includes pollution education which
includes everything so you have to make
sure that that's a asset class like your
goal your properties do not inflate sky
rock they should be a systemic growth
which is able which is able to accept
and take all right just come in on 97
percent of India's workforce is
unskilled in the so I think it's
employment is very categorically said
once and I am P remember this he said if
you keep announcements and you do not
fulfill them or you not do not make a
path to fulfill them okay let's get good
K getting some of the other views yes
professor Harper you had a view as well
frankly I think it than so many other
people but we know we're discussing a
yellow budget yeah and not a budget by
not on wood on account at all and I just
wanted to say that if these things had
been done two or three years earlier the
impact would have been fantastic for the
economy also I just want to make a point
and that is I don't know mr. mamma's
Khan's party what is going to do
tomorrow but my guess is if some really
good proposals come like the 10% thing
that Congress immediately supported yeah
and if they do that then they're going
to hope to dilute any positive impact
the Congress in my view behaved with
great you know frankly tactic skill in
supporting this ten percent reservation
and they might support all these tax
breaks is it actually going to come yes
absolutely no response
you're supposed to present a lie but in
fact it appeared on the finance business
pass we of course wart in favor of the
amendments to the Finance Act
I am the new finance act that is then
brought in so we are not here to quibble
over small points I just have two full
points make first of all the BEP
spokespersons of homespun witticisms and
economic knowledge aside I have two
things to say this entire GST bringing
petrol and the GST debate is a false
flag and can you because the fact is
that at any point of time that BJP uses
GST counsel one-third is the central
government's vote and and there itself
BJP till now of course had government's
in 19 states and they had they could
have passed it I am in agreement with
you and the response in fact was to what
Professor now have said that if there
are these groups feel-good factors that
that and now in terms of these middle
class breaks that are being talked about
tax breaks for the minute the Congress
would of course be supporting all that
whether it is the home loan whether it
is whether it is new design the parts
are Napoli the akai here
yeah yeah about the details in fact is
being spent on opportunity to have their
own business
15 million people have been elevated out
of poverty to accomplish you know 14
2007 million plus people of yours okay
we need to step into that very very
short break for passing a back on top we
come back and talk politics we come back
and talk the social sector schemes we
come back and talk how much of money is
going to go into the our CEO Gina and
the gram sadak yojana the CEO Gina's
which I are going to really be the
hallmark of this budget how much money
is really going to go into those social
sector schemes we're going to come back
and talk on that stay tuned
[Music]
welcome back we're of course in a
special broadcast ahead what't 2019 to
be presented by interim Finance Minister
Piyush Goyal all eyes on the commentary
that will come out that would set the
tone for PJ P's campaign for 2019
expectation is that social sector
schemes specifically whether it's the
Naga or the pradhan mantri Havas yours
now or some of the others as pradhan
mantri gram sadak yojana is concerned
all those social sector schemes related
to power rural electrification roads all
that could get a huge huge leg up there
could be massive increase in the
allocations for these schemes sending
out a message as I said for rural India
where of course BJP did get a jolt after
when of course those three state
election results came up but those
flagship schemes could in fact get a
huge increase as far as allocations are
concerned patently let's also move ahead
many have been saying that this could
really be a form specific a budget it
could have some sort of a farming farmer
that could be their guarantees for
farmers it could be direct benefit
transfer for farmers that could be their
crop insurance there could be an update
there as well coming in largely in line
with what many in the party believe that
it's time to focus more on the rural
folk it's time to focus more on the
farmers which is one results through a
Brahmin Malik let me ask you this is it
going to be a political commentary of
the Modi government ahead of 2019 course
on rural focus on farmers especially
after the 11th December George
well it's going to be a clear speech
about what we have done yes it's going
to be about a philosophy sub Cassatt
Sarkar Vikas yes it is going to be about
a positive India it is going to be about
a vibrant India it is going to be about
all those things which are India
positive and that is a way forward for
India to go see when you went Standard
Chartered things like organizations like
that this have a study and they
pronounced that if India goes on the
same track India would by 2030 be the
second biggest word okay you those guys
do not just say it for the heck of it or
they are not boxer as per what probably
some people would say so government is
actually making the foundation of this
nation all right okay Franzen you want
to come in there but you know this this
budget could you know we should look at
some of the perception issues which the
finance minister would like to talk
about and I would like to flag the issue
of crony capitalism because that's
linked very intrinsically good sentiment
and the fact that what the government
can claim to have achieve some success
of in terms of you know removing you
know the first time in the history of
India the owners of Tears are scared of
losing their company if they have you
know indulgent fraud or they have
mismanaged money and I think in the
recent days we've also seen some of
these people who are abscond has come
back into the country some as recently
as today so I think there's going to be
this narrative of ensuring that there is
a clear where people who are thought to
be above the law are being brought under
control items that will reflect in the
budget - okay quick occipital break well
you see social sector schemes really
being the highlight of this budget with
a lot of focus on more money more
allocations there's going to be a boat
on account of it that's good
interim budget and it was good when
interim budget definitely this is more
important to the BJP than its manifesto
this is going to be much more important
than about a hundred speeches by the
prime minister and mr. Amit Shah this is
a very very critical thing for the next
election so from that point of view
knowing the BJP and its frankly it's the
way it is very focused on getting back
to power it is very likely that these
things may happen I just want to make a
point regarding some mr. Tovar or Saxon
or somebody coming back these are small
fry their only value is if they can net
the big fish so you can use a salwar or
Saxena or a Michele to net really big
fish which frankly this government is
not done at all since 2014 that will
make an impact but some calvario Saxena
coming back I don't believe there's any
impact all right okay can we stick our
neck out and say it's gonna be a
full-fledged budget of vote on account
we probably cannot change what we are
most certain office going to be a
political speech with a lot of
particular commentary that could set the
tone for BJP is campaign on that note we
slip into a very short bring back on the
other side with the big debate around is
budget 2019 going to be about universal
basic income has the idea of time of
that idea come now remember urban
Subramanyam did talk about in 2016
economic survey but he did also mention
that there's the money is that idea now
something that part of 2019 would focus
on backward that debate
[Music]
this week on the roundtable we are going
to be discussing something that affects
us all the food that we eat first thing
we doesn't mean that you keep yourself
empty stomach I have not seen anybody
losing weight when they are fasting when
you have this 8:16 as they call it it
doesn't mean that you eat rubbish it is
basically on three pillars have safe
food have healthy food and then have
fortified food whenever you are
following any kind of die you would find
results for sure it is not practicals my
guest today is her the minister of
housing and urban office once upon a
time I remember you wanted to fight from
pada I was asked at one state would you
be willing to fight the looks of a
election and I said most certainly this
is a party where you don't do with us
you are told by the party so I consider
myself as a career kurta at the moment I
am a elected member to the Raja server
from u P whatever the party wants at the
given point of time but this is not a
party where people go around lobbying
for things you're told by the party what
is to be done with a lot of help from
the corporates do they feel let down
because Modi is trying to move away from
their image no I don't think that Indian
business feels like it got out of Modi
what they were expecting Congress could
convert ideas into politics you've also
been pretty caustic about Rahul Gandhi
have you also change your mind a bit I
was critical yes but there was no Rahul
on the other hand has certainly had a
couple of conversations within they says
that even when he talks about Hindu
Torah he is peddling a soft in this club
in that work you still have to look at
Modi's offering it's still very fun I
mean he ran in 2014 on three things
[Music]
but let's definitely feel comfortable
[Music]
welcome back in watching a special focus
ahead of budget in nineteen I'm calling
3d approaching musics the last budget of
the moody government before elections
less than now twenty four hours away in
fact it is expected to take the
spotlight on the announcement as far as
universal basic income is concerned the
idea remember was first mooted by chief
economic adviser a former chief economic
advisor urban Subramanyam in 2016 in the
economic survey he said maybe the time
is right though there is no way to know
how India would actually fund such a
large ubi scheme it hasn't been done
here the power of the world and this is
of course been contemplated for several
years now and that is of course
something that Rahul Gandhi earlier this
week pointed out and said that and in
fact made it a full promise that if the
Congress does come to power then ubi
some form of that would actually be
implemented by the Congress remains to
be whether any form of income guarantee
scheme would actually be part of our to
2019 and amidst the political charges
and counter-charges that have been going
on remains to be seen whether or not a
poverty alleviation scheme can come out
in the budget and more importantly can
the government find a way to fund it
that is the big question but let's first
tell a few was what exactly is a
universal basic income scheme the
universal basic income entails income
guarantee to all the unemployed work it
is modeled on the American social
security schemes the ubi would guarantee
a basic monthly income would be paid
directly by the government the families
are failing the scheme would have to
prove no other source of income and
there would be a monthly transfer
directly to the person's bank account
it's whether or not this would actually
come about in budget 2019 remains to be
seen also joining us on the cast is
NASA's Salim who's with the Samajwadi
Party and also Faust been a banker
himself you also have Pallavi Sharma
joining us representing the Congress
will be getting Esqueda thousand tickle
analysts in just a bit as I do I was a
former Commerce Secretary would also be
joining us on the broadcast let's
quickly in fact NAR said take the first
who there has been a lot of talk about
UPI in the last one V curve with the
Congress president talking about it of
course
earlier it was the economic adviser who
mentioned it back to the matter is you
understand numbers very well you're a
banker yourself can India afford a ubi
scheme
courier you know I personally feel as
far as you know you guys concerned it's
a rain push strategy that is been
adopted this particularly games at the
moment and you know it's it's a good
far-fetched idea and thought but you
know looking at where we are in terms of
fiscal and it's more important scenario
because you know we are getting into a
situation of competitive populism at the
cost of our fiscal prudence and I think
that is something which means to be
question number number two the other
thing I think as far as the universal
basic income program is concerned if the
Congress party is talking about also
needs to be clarified in terms of what
is the threshold limit where which if we
be able to be give out these basic
incomes to its citizens then obviously
it can't be built below
I mean I'm certain I think Pallavi
Sharma let me ask that to you as well
and you know given what we feel very
strongly ok finish a point now so finish
your point yes
yeah no my point is very simple as long
as it doesn't dent the fiscal prudence
the fiscal overall macro picture of the
economy I think one can look at it with
its merits but that is paramount okay
all right
given that this budget is going to be a
lot of political commentary it's only
fair that we also talk about the
politics of this budget Pallavi Sharma
person yes budget is a universal basic
income cake
yeah first and foremost let me very
humbly take this opportunity to correct
to my party president has not spoken
about you BR he's out minimum wage
minimum minimum basic income which is
MBI which is different from ubi so you
VI state that three individual including
me including you including the Ambani's
and attorneys will be liable to a fixed
stipulated sum that will be decided by
the government basic income to that I
got your question yes I should I'll come
to that please allow me to finish please
allow me to finish please allow me to
finish I've got your question right so
we are targeting only the poorest if you
remember in 1617 there was an economic
survey done mr. Arvind Subramanian
headed that economic survey and he said
that seven six to zero a per annum which
is seven seven thousand six thousand six
hundred and twenty rupees per annum can
be given to seventy-five percent of the
population he said that there was a
survey that was done we are not
targeting that seventy five percent of
the population as per the kombucha
report and let's let's ask this to eject
the wise well adjectives are former
Commerce Secretary joining us on the
broadcast
mr. Zhu ah everybody likes an income
guarantee scheme because it's a great
poll promise but how do you fund it
this is why you go to your Mesa yes I
can hear you right I'm saying some likes
an income guarantee scheme it's the best
feel-good factor that anybody any
politician could possibly give but how
do you fund it is that a question to me
yes sir I think we would have to start
Ramba start small that means keep the
threshold limit of people who are
entitled to it
at a low level and secondly start by
giving some amount of call it and income
and allowance dole whatever you like but
it cannot be done of a financial
position and given our priorities it
cannot be a scheme which covers a very
large population or a population which
or the the beneficiary cannot expect to
start with very large sums of when I say
this if I have in mind that up till
about 1 percent of GDP up to 1 percent
of GDP if we are spending scheme
probably funds can be found for it by
looking at the thousand odd central
central central or centrally sponsored
schemes clubbing some of them and the
old ones which have not really been
getting the benefit targeting the
benefits scrapping them as one as one
acquires the experience then ramp it up
and at the same time take out more and
more of schemes which are similar
purpose and which were targeted to a
particular service instead give more
choice to the beneficiary whether he
wants a subsidiary on whether he wants a
food or whether he wants are talking on
health or somewhere ok
poor mark okay stay with us mister do I
want to quickly take an opening comments
from Esqueda thought that I want to
bring in both fragile as well as
professional open SK that thought there
is a lot of talk about you know given
the fact that it's a political budget is
gonna be political commentary the BJP
has seen three assembly election results
going against it it is going to come out
with some income guarantee scheme the
question is can this country afford it
well
Gouri it all depends on how you demise
your you know financial resources and
how you you know like a distribute your
financial resources in relation to
different social schemes in relation to
different sectors if it is done in a
very systematic way with a proper check
and balance I don't see any reason as to
why this is successful okay many
countries in the past have done this and
specially Western countries are known
for their social initiatives and there
is a guarantee for all kinds of social
basic necessities of every citizen by
all the Western governments they give a
guarantee to that so like I mean in the
Indian case yes things are very complex
in the level of population which we have
ten-inch becomes very gigantic but I
guess there is no harm in trying it one
should that actually try this out if it
is successful we read good it is not
successful something else can be thought
of but in the context of India if I look
into the whole thing
taking into cognizance the total
population of the country I would say
that around one to one and a half
percent of the GDP would actually be
needed for you know making this skin
fire we have to funding the Congress she
said it may minimum income guarantee now
you must understand what are they
focusing and what is the political idea
behind it
they call it um ubi or a minimum
guarantee but the fact they are only
referring to those people who are
extremely poor and extremely poor are
those who in the rural areas are earning
32 rupees a day or 47 or 42 rupee
something like that in the urban areas
and that is the population they want to
cater but whereas also share with you
the data which said that the quantum of
those people have reduced to something
like 50 million also maybe or maybe a
little lower than that okay so now the
point is that it is being sold as a
dream it is not being given as a
solution to the question is that you
know even in the papers of the manifesto
of Rajasthan election casandra's he had
written something like this in that
manifesto which clearly stated that to
uplift these people these people have a
life of disparity and that difference
between the extremely poor and the poor
has to finish how can that is the
liability of this state to give quality
life all right we have done certain
things we need to professional yes well
I just want to take over
Raman was saying yes done certain things
writing something in a manifesto is not
doing anything frankly people when you
are in power people expect you to do
certain things with this white scheme
tomorrow sir look we are missing an
important point if the rate of growth is
high if it is boosted due to a double
digit then it will be very easy to fund
the scheme they taught me of one percent
of GDP GDP is not static if GDP grows
fast and you have growth inducing
policies then you can easily fund it
okay can I get a small thing up I expect
and I'm hoping that the Government of
India
the last budget tomorrow would be
announcing something in relation to the
ADA there has been a lot of talk in
reading some mine what I said in the
initial comment of mine was I was
talking about people who are unemployed
irrespective of caste or creed okay
anyone who is sample unemployed and who
is not able to friend himself should be
assisted by the government and social
responsibility of any government to take
care of those people who cannot you know
survive on their own and I guess
India would be looking on those the
point is when you talk about
policymaking when you talk about public
finances there have competing claims for
the same amount that is what is the
challenge as far as public finances
concern transient which is where you
know it is very interesting that on one
end of course when you talk about the
kind of dimensions and dynamics that we
have yes there is an argument which is
fairly credible that it's incumbent upon
any government to be feeding of people
below a certain poverty threshold but at
the end of the day it's the same amount
of money and we need to figure a way out
how best to utilize it you know good
point Gauri I think people have this
impression and you know this is
politically also it's been created
what's going to happen if somebody is
going to go to the every square of a
village or a town and take wads of load
and throw them in the air and everybody
has some amount of Ferno to go home with
that's not going how it's going to
happen
let me coin a word on your show and say
that you know we already have a minimum
benefit scheme everybody is getting
certain minimum benefit a government in
some way or the other already now if you
talk about minimum income we've had this
system of direct benefit transfer which
started under UPA - yes and this has now
you know mauve and matured into
something called the jungle scheme which
has now about 340 million accounts but a
lot of them are dormant so I think the
question partly is about the finance but
I would say a larger and more important
issue is how are you going to make sure
that people get it it's one thing for me
to promise you ten rupees a day but
another thing for me to actually show
you that so I think we're defaulter
right now
is that the system is not robust and now
for a minimum income guarantee or a
universal basic income to actually go
through the pipelines to ensure I think
that's where the real challenges in not
it's not just in promises okay and now
said you wanna comment and I'll get to
you sir as well yes nothing yeah yeah
gory I just you know I heard with
Professor Nalepa on his point on the
fact that we need to ensure growth used
to go into double digits well I'll give
you certain statistics curry between I
mean the last financial if example 17
what costed the Exchequer under various
subsidies in terms of subsidies or tax
benefits that was given what causes the
Exchequer was 70 crores of a budget
outlay in terms of tax incentives given
across you know various for example
under section 87 a medical insurance
covers tax saving investments high exams
you to senior citizens so obviously
there is a huge amount of pressure
already building and this year gory I
must tell you you know meets a lot of
people as a bank I have the miracle of
clients and there is by large consensus
that there are special limits on income
tax should also go up now let's not
forget that that you know there is a lot
of expectation built around certain
other incentives which are ruling out of
a program such as this whether it's
isn't it
yes yes no exactly exactly that's the
point so obvious simplifying this by
just saying that you know people need it
we need to figure a way out to fund it I
would just always simplifying the entire
budget making exercise is very in my
opinion nobody got it no I'll tell you
I'll tell you gari as far as if you look
at the today economic outlier and the
budget outlay that we're going to be
presenting tomorrow I don't think so
we can afford to roll out a program like
this this was our economy is way it
needs to catch up there is a lot of far
more momentum whether in terms of
economic growth whether in terms of the
economic activity whether in terms of e
VA that needs to be raised and I think
the main focus today if you ask us is
ensuring that we give out less
incentives and ensuring how we get grow
further whether it's on the job front
whether it's on reducing for the NPA or
ensuring that our collections go up
today we've had some great news I must
tell you on your show GST is gone up by
over so that's some great news again
coming away that's the kind of numbers
we look forward to okay a quick comment
from you sir and then I'll pause I'll
I'll get in the others as well yeah how
does ubi is concerned I don't think that
currently per country is ready for this
ubi
without any statical data about route I
and what the percentage of population
which need it because you have to hear
larger what size about thing what are
the threshold what are the cutoff point
you have to make for country he wrote
one for three but here and it's not just
saying it become given and like and keep
it like a Joomla for by what BJP
government has done and that's five
years okay do you the Indian economy
presently is on the that pace which when
one Singh ji has left it on 2009 2014 I
don't think so different that's what I'm
saying both both both parties both
leading parties are just playing the
game gimmicks of this politics and this
is the interim budget everybody has an
honest exterior is going on a general
elections I don't think
can be getting both professional
cholesky the tenor of Americans birth
yes prohibition MA yes yes yes Gauri
I've been waiting patiently just three
quick points yes yes Oh point one see I
was just hearing wrong alone eight
panelists speak before me he said
there's no number there is no data
there's no survey there's a survey that
has been done in 1870 in Economic Survey
of India that says 75% people can be
given six sixteen seventy six hundred
rupees approximately per and and what we
are saying right now I think this trend
of painting all political parties with
the same brush has to stop that BJP is
also saying this Congress is also saying
this no we are not saying what the BJP
is saying we are not but universal basic
income we know our economy has gone down
in the last week at basic income has
become a national scheme listen to me
let's not jump to conclusion - let's not
jump to conclusions let me ask you this
question
Plusle basic income will have thresholds
it will you can include the thresholds
that are there there will be more than
one there will be many in that suppose
how beneficiaries will be decided and
weeded out when you talk about a minimum
income guarantee it has to be given to
all so what is the kind of basic
calculation here
everybody is for everybody no I am
saying no I don't think either of the
two things is going to happen tomorrow
the it is now we are pushing ourselves
into competitive populism both sides
know that it is not possible to cover a
large population leave alone Juby I even
guarantee all the people we needed I'm
not denying that there is need for it
but we cannot afford it I get a reach
that level okay if my income is 6,000
rupees below that I get 6,000 rupees to
reach that level it doesn't mean
everybody it's not a flat rate
it's a Frankie you have to ensure that
people get enough second I want to make
supposing you're a poor person there are
so many opportunities to body which you
have massage
now the fact is 1% of the population in
India has more than 50% of the entire
wealth to the country as a result the
bottom tier 30% they just don't have the
resources to produce enough to be
productive you have to give them the
resources and they will then be
productive okay if we the dream of
sustainable development and inclusive
growth and growth and economic you know
like if economic benefits to the last
man in the last letter of the country
you know we have to think there is so
much of this parity when it comes to the
question from generation of individuals
right on one side we have a percentage
of population whose annual income is in
thousands of crows and on the other side
people who don't even have the you know
basic analytical have food power bill so
those who are having a different way
that money can be utilized in all this
college I'll give you that 30 seconds I
promise but remember like the question
that comes to mind is if this is an idea
that India needs why not implement it
before the vote on account see a couple
of things you must
this government from the very inception
the prime minister said that we are
committed to the poor of this country
and the work that this government has
done actually has been and has been in
progress with work and it is not just a
number which you will like and after
that you will speak a lot ok so the
basic point is that we have done things
yes we have given like the Health Scheme
that we have given like the other
shelter scheme that we have given gas we
are giving you to save the the security
of Mississauga by just 900 watts today I
like to say that we are saying our tax
GDP ratio is so low at seventeen point
nine percent and growing only by five
percent when you do not
now what about our budgets they are
going haywire we need to slip into that
very short commercial break on the other
side and continue our debate as far as
budget 2019 and expectations are
concerned stay tuned
[Music]
welcome back in watching a special
broadcast ahead of budget 2019 with the
news X I'm Cory through 18 hour as 2019
looks by elections are almost around the
corner India is a force leaving no
opportunity to reiterate its
achievements that it has made as far as
the last four and a half years is
concerned which is what many believe the
budget commentary tomorrow is likely to
focus on as well remember Prime Minister
Modi not so long back at the prophecy
party diverse event did also claim that
his government has managed to really
curb leakage as far as money going for
these government policies is concerned
and has managed to succeed in giving
around 5.7 lakh crore rupees as far as
direct benefit schemes is concerned he
also did mention that very famous
comment made by Rajiv Gandhi thirty
years ago when he said that unlike the
Congress where it managed to only send
fifteen percent of the money to intended
beneficiaries this time around PGP is
ensuring that all money does go to the
intent it's making us ask the big
question that is the commentary going to
be around these direct benefit schemes
tomorrow will there be more money going
into these direct benefit schemes of
course the political impact of that but
first up let's listen in to what exactly
Prime Minister Modi said when he made
that comment a few days back is purchase
ypres t-shirt elude KO shut up pro
t-shirt Adam cardia
[Applause]
beat a sad HR verse woman directory
patch allowed Ecija dark aura rupiah but
a lot I see a dark era rupiah and it
creep 380 billion dollar hamari sir
carne allah allah huge now get the head
CJ logo KO ta NK bank account might
transfer ta alright as I said is the
focus going to be around those direct
benefit schemes can there be more money
being put into this and cooked every
commentary about replacing all this with
that single big announcement as far as
an income guarantee is concerned now
said do you expect that
Guria I know I personally feel as far as
the basic income program is concerned as
of now they'll be not much of safe but I
what I personally feel is that they will
definitely definitely be a lot of push
on certain other ambit's that the
government can offer in the budget
tomorrow for example more from a
consumer perspective I mean I personally
feel that they will scrap they will have
some changes in the form of dividend on
taxation Guri today for example a
different distribution on or tax on
companies is 15% and they're not to
invest in certain equity funds for
example you end up paying taxation on
that as well a 10% that can be tweaked I
think there is an option where with what
is it also is tax deduction for home
insurance for example okay that's
something which is but we see that the
government can the budget cancer
benefits there then there is also
talking about increasing wider use Asian
section of under ATC talk about those
specific provisions and those specific
areas at 8:00 o'clock when we would be
talking about you know this is a
campaign that we have been talking to
say X is how you know middle class needs
to get its larger say as far as the
budget is concerned we talk about that
at 8:00 o'clock but specifically right
now I want to ask you this necessary
that the DBT scheme that you know this
government has focused on a lot of the
last couple of years and you know some
of those comments that have come in from
the government in the past about how
host beneficiaries have been plugged out
how leakages have been come do you see
that really to be one of the big
highlights of the budget do you see more
money actually going into these schemes
given that they actually touched the
electorate ahead of an area could be
very crucial
career look I must confess even I must
agree they took the DBT firstly was not
something that was at the BGP or the
current government can take credit
obliging the DBT was started frankly in
the UPA it was it was mentioned by
damaged was tired by them and the direct
benefit transfer yes I'll definitely
will the implementation has definitely
been added to a more platform which is
far more better in this government but
that's obviously because they've been
making provisions on it they've been
adding elect making changes to it
this is absolutely and the point is as
far as the DBT is concerned the DBT is
concerned there are still a lot of
action that needs to take place Gauri
there is a still a lot of beneficiaries
today where they are not getting the
actually my dear friend that had this
government not gone after creating in a
bank account which is linked and
digitalized for every individual did not
get in beam apps and other things this
DBT and the exact benefit of DBT would
not have been enjoyed by wear of this
country and that is what they need to
understand that 33 crore accounts have
been added and what have the entire 17
years given we know that okay all right
Roger let me ask you this you know it's
a it's an election here and when you
talk about DBT schemes they actually
reach out to the electorate that's the
connection that there's equity which is
so crucial in an election year which is
why the question there do you think
allocations there would be that much
more
you know I think General George now
which is what is DB T's is the
functional name for it is actually
excellent structure for the government
to take subsidies to people instead of
indirect subsidy so it goes directly
into the hands of the person who needs
it most the system in terms of Consulate
in terms of its practice it is still bit
wobbly I think it still needs to be
strengthened I think not the work so far
in terms of expanding the base has been
excellent they still a lot of dormancy
in that so there's 70 to 80 percent
dormancy where accounts have been open
where people are still not comfortable
about using this because remember these
who have never seen a checkbook they
have been hiding their money or they
save their money under their beds they
dig a hole in their in in their heart
and then put their money over there
so population who doesn't know what to
do with the cash that they have in their
hand and now we have a system which will
say that we will give you money directly
through your bank account it's going to
be a conceptual issue which they will
take some time to warm up to but the
government of the day whichever
government it is can definitely use this
structure if direct subsidies without
leakages and I think that's a very
important point previous systems had
tremendous leakages there was no way to
know whether they 50% was was was the
genuine or not but with biometric
identification I can okay I don't
hesitate to say it is far more robust
system you want to come in there self no
I point out that the technology is
really very important in in making a
system more honest not simpler and Rajiv
Gandhi if you remember regarding
telephones regarding the booking of rail
they did a lot unfortunately Manmohan
Singh did not but this government
certainly the Prime Minister Modi
attention to technology okay I just want
to point out one problem many of them
it's not just a question of direct
benefit it's also been drawing many of
the benefits of so many of the subsidies
because for example fertilizer subsidy
you know mostly very rich people get the
that look at the loan waiver a few
states and rich farmers are grabbing
almost all the benefits of loan waiver
okay so we need to not only give direct
benefit transfer but also with rates
from many upper class upper income
people in in the rural sector who are
getting subsidies that they don't really
need you could you see that coming in
the I guess there would be a proper
proper you know line of thought in
relation to that and I would definitely
say that they would be a in relation to
that that question might arise as to why
are you doing this the last you know
when you are at the 11th hour why didn't
the out see the constitution of this
country is very clear that it's not
necessary that always it has to be a
boat on account okay it can be a
full-fledged but it depends on the
decision of the government of what it
thinks is the best you know like I mean
tradition is that like generally the
outgoing government the tradition of
vote on account but it's not a must it
can be a full-fledged budget also and I
understand as far as my information goes
tomorrow's budget a full-fledged budget
you know taking into account becoming
whole financial year and there would be
a clearer more roadmap in relation to
this and I agree professor Saab has said
okay people who have been enjoying
political strings right they are the
ones who needs to be penalized now I
just want to say that you know tomorrow
if it's a full budget yes and there are
very attractive proposals and the
Congress party and other parties it's
going to be a Celt goal by the Congress
party another part is you have to make
sense I guess what is that though they
have Senate that they're it's a full
going to fulfil or did this Modi
government okay now this is a time when
Government of India has to give you a
report card and they are not giving the
report card every time statistical data
they are hiding from the sources
citizens of India want to know what you
have done for us in last forever
[Music]
welcome back to washing Ardra big debate
to countdown to budget 2010 finance
minister pew school would be presenting
the last budget of this government
tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock and all
eyes on the commentary that will come
out from before slipping into that very
quick break bronzor we asked that
question as to you know time and again
there has been a lot of commentary by
this government as to how it has made a
lot of efforts as far as DBM is
concerned and I come back and ask the
same question to you that do you think
this could really be replaced with that
big income guarantee scheme tomorrow
given that there's been a lot of noise
given that Congress has also been
talking about it for the last couple of
days you don't know that Rahul Gandhi
has announced that they will have a
minimum income guarantee scheme there's
nothing to stop reminiscing Aaron Modi
to actually implement it right away and
if he does it people won't remember who
said it first it doesn't really matter
who said it it's really who gave it to
you first and I think that's what I
think the system as I was saying earlier
our perhaps not as robust as they should
be in terms of directly giving benefits
to the poorest people through the
electronic transfer through their towns
about you know about three hundred and
fourteen million people have got these
accounts in the last few years so that's
a huge number you know we're talking
about almost twenty percent of the
population the poorest of those and so I
think the more than one person leaves
account and so it goes to households so
yes one person gets it it has think
factor of five at least you know so five
people get benefit from it so I think
this government can do it but the real
issue which should professional pass
also referred to earlier is it benefits
which means that again don't throw money
in the air and whoever grabs it takes it
and that's what's been happening in
terms of subsidies the strongest and the
richest and those who have the longest
but got it but now the people who really
need it should give it an I think nobody
in the countries against that okay
before I come to you let's get in a
quick did the work I said where do you
use to answer on this debate
I think we are all work stressing the
fact that there might be a DVT scheme a
modified one because there are precisely
two months the month of April and before
the elections take place
that's if no scheme can be conceived and
implemented fully within shots that is
not time
bogum whichever government is in power
after me would really have to deal with
the issue and I am quite sure that even
if certain tomorrow only promises can be
made but there will not be a scheme
which will be able to get off within the
next two months all right yes number one
and number two okay I come back to the
point that any scheme which is announced
must have targeted a subject a targeted
transfer but the scheme will be very
modest and it does not cover all the
formulas it cannot cover all the so it
has to be a gradual ramp up but an
announcement that we shall brings us
such a scheme or that could be made and
no okay yes the two things which I would
like to put forward here some people who
need whoever our comment they would have
seen the yesterday's program where it
wasn't sooner than he was talking to
some people he you would realize what
he's about
okay and secondly you also need to
understand that he has finished this
system where only 15 percent used to
reach okay he saw that inclusiveness
happens he's also made short that
somehow or the other
everybody starts feeling as a
stakeholder and which is the idea of
ownership okay and once you own it all
right you do not try to splurge it off
okay all right yes very quickly because
I want to get a counter from problem
semi yes I in relation to the targeted
group you know like
how it is implemented and whether it's
successful or not I just jammed an
account itself would be methodology of
targeting the vulnerable groups and to
transfer the benefits directly to dowry
second is second is like in tomorrow's
budget I'm also expecting a huge huge
beneficial scheme coming up for the
farmers that's the information which is
okay and I am also expecting some very
good shops and goodies coming for the
service and then I'll get nasod as well
yes follow me very quickly yes
three three quick points quality is
three flip phones I'll make them very
quickly see the truth of the matter is
the 56 in power it's three points I will
come to is not to t achieve that point
three a total of 48,000 corrodes was
rolled out for the five top schemes of
announced by the Prime Minister okay
oh no I'm sorry is not able to spend its
money on a time I'm going to give those
final 30 seconds to necessary yes
no Garre we were talking about execution
of somebody's subsidies and I must tell
you and I'm going to remind all the
panelists here that while I'm today
appearing as a banker but the Samajwadi
pension scheme which even the apex court
a phrase that must salute Supreme Court
said was done very effective so if you
have the right intention of doing it
like in the eyes of the government in
the previous in the five years at the UU
period we had there's much money in
short effectively more than 55 lakh
women for god pensions under the
Samajwadi pension scheme so the point is
if you have good intention you can exist
the challenge remains with the current
government is that we have great
intentions but they always fail on
execution that is the biggest chatter
okay all right on that to slip into that
very very short breather we come back on
the other side and talk about the aam
aadmi the middle class the people who
are watching this broadcast right now we
pay our taxes we even pay through our
nose when I have fuel bills what is it
that we get in return and what is it
that we can expect in that budget speech
that starts tomorrow morning at 11 o
clock stay tuned we come back with that
discussion
[Music]
this week on the roundtable we are going
to be discussing something that affects
us all the food that we eat first thing
it doesn't mean that you keep yourself
empty stomach I have not seen anybody
losing weight when they are fasting when
you have this 8:16 as they call it it
doesn't mean that you eat rubbish it is
basically on three pillars have safe
good how healthy food and then have
fortified food whenever you are
following any kind of guy you would find
results for sure it is not practical my
guest today is Hardy Puri minister of
Housing and Urban Affairs
ma you wanted to fight from vada I was
asked at one state would you be willing
to fight the Lok Sabha election and I
said most certainly this is a party
where you don't do it us was told by the
fine so I consider myself as a carrier
kurta at the moment I am a elected
member to the Raja suffer from you P
whatever the party wants hadn't given
point of time but this is not a party
where people go around lobbying for
things you're told by the party
what does it be done government came
into power with a lot of help from the
corporates do they feel let down
no I don't think that Indian business
feels like it got out of Modi what they
were expecting as the caller has been
able to move the corporates Congress
would convert ideas into politics you've
been pretty caustic about Rahul Gandhi
have you also change your mind a bit I
was critical yes but there was no
alternative
Rahul on the other hand has surely had a
couple of conversations with him he says
that even when he talks about Hindutva
he's peddling a stock he'll this blob
will that work you still have to look at
Modi's offering it's still very strong I
mean he ran in 2014 on three things
[Music]
well it's definitely to feel comfortable
[Music]
[Music]
welcome back you're watching a special
broadcast on new sex with me got it baby
it's the last budget before the looks of
violations expectations are of course
high and the section which is especially
looking forward to some relief is the
middle class we bring to you a charter
for the middle classes the expanding
high and to include as far as a relief
on the income tax front bringing in a
fuel under GST that would also ensure
that people do not fade through their
nose when it comes to fuel and also a
stable rupee that could be some of the
demands that the middle class have in
fact told us our viewers who've been
tuning in to abroad the last couple of
weeks have said as some of these
concerns remain a top priority for them
and they would want some sort of
addressing redressal as far as these
issues are concerned the finance
minister tomorrow all eyes on whether or
not the aam aadmi the middle class would
actually find mention or focus as far as
the budget is concerned let me also get
in jiya me a crowbar was a professor of
finance the Indian Institute of Finance
joining us on the broadcast we happens
to suma joining us as well and robbie
chan is back with us as well so has the
political representatives of the BJP and
Congress and let me begin with you
Robbie Jane you were the tax expert on
the panel should we as middle class were
watching this broadcast and also first
part of this should we be expecting or
hopeful of not just minor tinkering but
some teacher changes as far as tax labs
are concerned and relief is concerned so
as far as tax relief is concerned Gauri
I think that this is going to be a
potent account or an extended word of
account let's say but I don't know
whether they will have the capacity to
do major changes the next government
comes what they do that going by the
pass trend and if we look at the slab
rate so like when they came in they did
enhanced the slab rate in 2002 14 and
then later they also tinkered with the
the initial rate the tax rate which was
10% for the slab they made it 5% so in
my view I think maybe 2.5 which is the
current exempt limit could be made 3
okay and for senior citizen it could be
further increased from 3 to 3.5 okay
there could be some surprise element for
women which were like which was there
earlier but then brought the tax rate at
par so so there we can see some kind of
a tinkering but I don't see that we
should expect a major change I think
apart from the tax rate other thing we
could expect is on the housing loan
interest because if you look at housing
loan interest the projects are getting
delayed and last - last year the
government has capped the interest rate
exemption for a housing loan both for
self occupied house put the desert with
let out house at 2 lakhs which is a very
minimum sum also coupled with the fact
that in doing up I think there could be
some room to bring in a large exemption
or slightly which will dual purpose so
not only the industry so of course back
of the envelope calculation suggests
that every time you have a 10 thousand
rupee exemption that is being given by
the finance minister it does add up to
about 1500 to 2000 crores that's how it
impacts how many other one let me ask
you this question there are competing
claims whenever you know a budget has to
be made can such exemptions be expected
for the middle class well since it's
gonna be the last budget before the
election that's likely to have a
populist agenda so among the populace
agenda one of the agendas would be both
trying to take care of the aggregation
crisis which is there a farm loan
waivers which they are likely to look at
they're also lying to look at providing
relief so a certain amount of an
exemption there can be some exception so
you can be certain set of Assam
exemptions which are likely to be there
they are expecting that when they are
actually giving these exemptions the
revenues which are there are likely to
take care of the fiscal consolidation
that is there so they may actually
instead of keeping the fiscal
consolidation at three when I actually
switch to three point five which is
there so they may actually give these
exemptions and they found loan waivers
that are there and a certain amount of
an extra locations to the women which
are there okay so whether they're the
nearby our funds or there is you know a
commentary on the fiscal discipline or
the lack of it it does send out a
negative 3 as well to investors and
especially at a time when we had a
ratings upgrade last year it does have
an impact but professional occurred let
me ask you this question sir should the
middle class I think some kind of
goodies coming their way
after all election season everybody is
getting something why not the middle
class you know Gary I've always thought
that the voters are Indian and the
Indians use rupees
they don't use dollars a pump and I'm
constantly much of policy is focused on
making people with pounds and dollars
the beneficiaries at the expense of
those who have only rupees and frankly I
think this is a very very strange kind
of policy regard the middle class I'd
like to say quite clearly well I think
if some good steps are taken like a
substantial increase in the ceiling for
income taxes will be good secondly let
me point out about services nearly 60
percent of the economy services and the
GST structure which was imposed has made
it so company to operate the service
industry I'm told that some some
individuals a hundred times more
form-filling
then was the case prior to the GST so
the GST has created a huge problem for
people in the service sector and I think
this many of them are very very upset
and this is definitely good impacting
growth in the service sector okay yes
you want to come in yourself yeah well
what prophet said I like to take it to a
bit on a different paradigm
you know this budget so a chance for the
Modi government to give a smidgeon for
next five years so if we expect it will
have some little things here and there
it will go much beyond that yes I agree
there might be some goodies for the
middle now which are well desert because
middle
the end of the day is the class which
makes maximum percentage of text if you
look at any section which section pays
maximum percentage of text is the middle
class so by all rights they deserve this
so let's not depend on that but I think
this is an opportunity for Modi
government they will not stop at that
pick in my opinion the budget is going
to detail out for everybody occasion
right as far as the industry goes you
know which I represent especially the
service industry you know GST and all
has made our life a bit complex but
there's one more thing I want to bring
here through your channel you know we
have this in service industry we have
the studious of 10% okay now when we pay
a radius of 10 percent how do you assume
that we are making a profit of 40
percent if they make a profit of 40
percent on our invoices then we have to
pay a tax of 10% but you will deduct
this kind of percentage of 10% which is
paid for summer delay do we get in
alright but coupled with the GST it
really impacts the cash flow of the SMEs
I don't know bigger bags it assesses and
attention but if rack of SMEs but you
know I think the biggest issue here from
the narrative of the government which it
has been presenting in the last year if
you get the monetization its assessment
which is pretty brutal but the fact is
between D monetizes and GST the biggest
benefit that the government is offered
to the pic of the country is that the
tax base has gone up that people who
were stealing money have been reduced
now the tax base has gone up then the
benefit to me for all the pains that
I've been through is to reduce the taxes
now this is a very economic logical
argument as you increase the tax base
the burden on each individual reduces I
think some reflection of that okay most
welcome tomorrow okay go go he let me
point out the tax base went up more on
the UPA one then under this government
yes and may also point out that during
to 2016 2017 the increase in tax base
was much smaller than for several years
and that was the year of the ization the
tax base will go up when you reduce
taxes and reduce the hassles of
compliance when you increase the hassles
of compliance and I'm sorry to say mr.
Chidambaram was a master of creating
problems and unfortunately very little
who better has come during this
particular government I can't use just
yet
tomorrow's budget there would be a
triangular focus on three important
areas one is of course they would be
swaps for the middle class because and
especially the service class because the
service class and the middle class in
the past couple of elections it seems
they have got somewhat annoyed with thee
and so all the government would try to
play catch them it's the election year
so I do expect of changes in the income
tax lap tomorrow and that would give in
some regional benefits to the middle
class second is like I'm expecting a big
package coming for the farming sector
okay and that is in relation to transfer
in relation to the farmers and the you
know rural areas okay and third very
important area where I see the
government taking some drastic measures
is in relation to giving swaps to the
small-scale sector and the cottage and
the mediums all right okay let's let's
get in some of the other guesses well
open mister of the BJP army our neck of
the Congress nasa sally was a banker was
also aligned with SP with us on the
broadcast in fact what pay mister let me
technic take care opening comments from
you you know if taking on from what been
saying which is that there can be some
sort of goodies or feel-good factor or
who knows massive changes here in favor
of the middle
ya see my my first comment is first
chartered accountant is going to forget
the to forget budget this year so you
will see drastic changes in terms of
policy economic policy and some sort of
tax slaves which you have which we have
seen kind of a stability from long time
okay so we are expecting much changes in
economic policies and also top the
policies which can be good which help
growth oriented and also to to fix the
the stability of all inflation all right
I mean you are Nick you wanna come in on
that so we are looking forward since
tomorrow okay yes oh yeah yeah I think
we expect a lot from tomorrow's budget
especially when there are so many issues
and so many promises made in the last
several months and if the larger points
I would like to expect would be the in
the farming sector for the unemployment
sector especially the MA
and especially employment for women
which is absolutely gone down from 32
percent to 23 percent in the labor area
so there should be some great budget
allocations and especially a road map
that is doable that is what I expect
tomorrow I'm going to the it's from
forward in this particular four large
areas bigger areas and not to talk about
some other areas we take it up as the
debate moves on now say Salim you want
to comment on that we were talking about
specifically for the middle class the
kind of exemption hikes that one can
expect the kind of specific relief for
coming on that
here are Guri yes I think you know since
the topic is more middle-income group I
think five six key points that I'd like
to make and I want to hear this from
tomorrow's budget I think number one you
know as far as the SME the MSME space is
concerned buddy if you look at the
startup policy in India it was
originally they were given a tax holiday
for about three years we expect this to
increase to five years now because not
enough has been done has started start
of India's concern and a platform such
as these should be given enough to this
because they eventually will become the
future SME the MSM ears of this nation
number think definitely there is a great
need for revision in tax lab rates
whether it is on income tax lab rates or
by lowering the tax labs which are you
know which will directly impact citizens
the middle-income group those need to be
revised thirdly I think senior citizens
important you know aspect a very
important part of our society our senior
citizen I think there we expect the
government okay it is some more
announcements such as seniors need
deduction for medicines farmers are very
important I think some deductions should
come in there okay my other point is you
know it's tax deduction for home
insurance is when a middle-income group
goes in fix up a house today and he pays
a certain insurance for buying the house
on calamity you're not given any
deduction and they said not be a part of
ATSC Gouri
they should be a separately putting in a
separate bucket to get you reductions
which is very very important and I tell
you is scrappy actually streamlining the
form of dividends you see today what
happens is the devil distribution tax
and distribution of tax paid income of
companies is that and then we have
further tax in the hands of the
beneficiaries of that distribution tax
at the hands of the companies with no
pain and 10 lakhs of income all right
okay let's take this step by step
aasif let's take this step by step one
it can't be both it let's let's take
this step by step right I want to put
the other panelist and also all right
besides it why you have you go ahead
yes sir I think we must keep in mind
that and a budget a couple of months
just before the election will not be
looking at growth will not be as focused
its focus is going to be populism and
what can be what can give it electoral
dividend to that extent the expenditure
more than revenue is going to be the
focus of this budget for extra greater
expenditure on on farms farming sector
okay on the rural sector as also
expenditure on some of those sectors
which the government changes what about
the middle-class vote for it in the last
room the middle class can expect it some
rationalization of the income tax labs
got 20% slab which kicks which is up to
Dell like income I have a feeling that
might be enlarged from 10 to 15 laps or
so because there are not many comments
events as well as people in the private
sector at the middle level who would
stand to benefit from it they could also
be a slight tweaking of of the exemption
limit which is at two and a half lakh
rupees that could be made to 0.75 lakhs
or so but I do not and I'm pretty
confident that this budget is not going
to be one where too many concessions in
taxes will be given me for making India
some indirect taxes particularly in
terms of for rights duties import import
duties dote could be and on the GST
simplification this is just not going to
be a subject of the budget it has all
right yes and what happens there we all
know about it even if there is a convict
a complex system of reporting and all of
the services sector is under
the budget is not going to include any
of these things all right okay you want
to come in on that sir well I simply
want to say babe there's a will there's
a way
and I'd important for people working in
the government the entire bureaucracy to
try and get things done rather than say
that we have this problem and that
problem and things I I think this
government frankly or GST there's been
far too much bureaucratic input and far
too little with the industry with the
results but today the wait brilliant
idea
it's a brilliant idea that's become a
nightmare for many people in terms of
reporting and also nightmare in terms of
very high rates so mr. Doyle what we
saying is actually but I would like to
request mister - ah please ensure that
things get done
we know be people who are outside this
charm circle being in guinea pigs and we
would like to see things get done and as
for GST is concerned definitely a large
number of people are extremely upset and
it's particularly affected the MSME and
SME sector yes well I guess it's not
necessarily that every nitty gritties
has to be paid off only by the GST
council side you know the Finance
Ministry is entitled and capable enough
to take in decisions and I expect the
problems we have arising because of the
complexities in relation to the laws
concerning GST and in relation to the
multiple forms and all this there might
be some announcements in relation to
simplification of those if you remember
even in the last budget also when the
Finance Minister was speaking he had
touched on this area and he had
announced new norms in relation to GAE
in relation to GST on how to make GST
more easy and more I was just coming to
those areas only I expect that the
government of him would be giving in
benefits to the senior citizens in terms
of more you know like in terms of more
you know sobs or in terms of more
stifles in relation to various amenities
such as healthcare such as
transportation in traveling and all
those you know and also in addition to
the woman I expect that that the
government would be taking in some
serious offense to generate more income
for the woman who's who are not
absolutely employed you know even the
same employed woman there might be some
dividends in relation to accelerating
therein okay before I can Tommy you're
Nick branch will do you expect and do
you share this kind this optimism in
terms of you know a lot can be expected
by the middle class tomorrow look I
think middle class has always been a
focus of all governments and all budgets
so it's not as if it's going to be a
fresh spot yeah so I mean I I think
that's that's always always how do you
keep the middle class happy you know
that's that's a political narrative all
the time I think what we should discuss
in the next few minutes is also the role
of population which is coming into what
this year Cory it's a significant
influencer I think let's look at what is
going to be there for them their best
people they are the ones who have very
high aspirations they're connected and I
think they are not very deeply loyal to
any political affiliation they are
perhaps a little bit more emotional but
they are very realistic in what can be
done for them so I think that we should
dwell on that for a few minutes all
right
commissioner what can be expected for
those Millennials
yeah that is what I want to say key we
are just talking about a GST GS they
have a separate consent so every
decision had been taken with taken on
GST sue that has been has been done by a
separate concept and now the budget
things are gone and we are and we have
to focus on our youth and the the
immigration part because youth is the
asset for our country we have there and
we have and we have to focus on that
okay listen of what we must have that is
what eat okay you'd say startup we have
the we have does a startup things and
the move what you have taken yeah these
are the things we have we had already
done for the goose okay okay okay okay
let's get it our be out Nick as well
technique do you expect focus on youth
tomorrow do you expect policies related
to as as parental was saying the
Millennials the Restless millennial do
you expect some focus there
yes I think there should be a central
focus on this millenials between group
of 15 to 24 if you see that the
unemployment rate is almost around three
point five percent and I think they are
looking for four looking towards some
kind of a package where they get some
kind of certainty as soon as they are
out of the education institutions and
that is where we expect that this
government should if it is focusing on
education and it is focusing on skill in
the eye and for the younger generation
let them some kind of a scheme in place
some kind of policy in place or some
kind of a budget allocation or the
roadmap how get this younger generation
a second thing if they also look at the
health sector because I think we find
adults and girls we find in this age
group there are several health issues
which is coming which are coming forth
so there should be some kind of a
expected focus on this as well because
it is somewhere related to this group as
well or a third aspect I would like to
expect is also for the women they are
looking forward for employment they are
looking forward for some kind of a steel
based package for women when we are
talking about women empowerment so I
think brezza these are looking forward
to the young nation a lot can we do a
lot
yes finish your point okay mister yes in
yeah a lot can be can have to be done in
in health sector but what the government
has already done the is money like it's
a world largest this helpful health
policy I rolled out by this god man ok
and we had already taken 10 lakh people
have been already exited so a lot if
anything which can be improved that
might be better but not all it done all
right not just keep involved okay maybe
slip into a baby I expect I did 30
seconds sir I need to take that very
short commercial break I come back and
ask you your expectations from the
budget tomorrow stay tuned
[Music]
welcome back you're watching a special
broadcast ahead off budget 2019 with me
Cory the very day that we've been asking
the Charter for middle class what is it
that they are mad at me the people who
pay their taxes honestly the people who
paid through their nose when it comes to
fuel what is it that they can tomorrow
when interim finance minister huge coil
makes that speech the last budget for
the boutique government in fact NASA
Salim let me ask you this question you
know as as a middle-class person I am
assuming you are one and you know paying
your taxes what would be the number one
thing on your wish list
Maria well yes absolutely truly middle
class but yeah having said that I think
you know two three very key important
points I think number one I what I would
really want is the larger the sea which
gives us a one and a half like limit
reduction or to be increased and have
more avenues under that and also the
limit to be increased tea to about maybe
to 200 thousands about two or less
number number one number two I think as
far as you know you know taxations
concern on equity because today you know
equity ownership today in India is just
about some three what percent as initial
and there I think you know we would hit
really hard last year because the
finance minister then all of a sudden
implemented a taxation on equity funds
for example the middle income group
largely who understand this profile of
equity funds invest in equity for long
term right one end you have the semi
propagating investing in the longer run
talking about bull base investing and
then you all of a sudden come back and
say I'm going to start taking with that
file from you because I find a big chunk
to ensure that I cover my summer fiscal
shortages or stability of the economy I
think it's something which can be done
away with that there is some clearly be
addressed at number three from from a
security perspective more so you know
last year one of the lowest allocations
gory or not defense last year our
budgetary allocation to defense is only
one point five percent of India's GDP
now is alarming figure you know we need
border security we need to ensure that I
am forcing you to say something we just
want to take this entire now sell job
rafael correa paid then people have a
problem if the defense budget is low
then people but I'm not going to let
this debate be hijacked by that finish
your point because then I want to get
the analysis work
no my yeah
so my point was on defense my last point
of course is a force on health care and
on you know on what is means deductions
for medicines today healthcare by large
is a very important factor and on
against the middle income group and very
Andy and the upper middle income group
largely you know and and especially in
senior citizens focus needs to be given
there and we should be given reductions
okay and again I think it's very
important because this is what will
ensure that you can actually all right
repaired a charter here at music since
you know this was of course based with a
lot of what viewers have been telling us
and the one thing that a wonder if you
are in fact you know people in the
senior citizen category said what about
the taxes or interest or not F these
this was the government that did
introduce that and those senior citizens
are upset with that you know for senior
citizens in the last budget if you
remember for interest including FB the
limit was raised to 50,000 please for
others are 10,000 and that is also only
on interest from savings and not from
fixed deposit yes so while saying that
I'm not saying that that is enough but
it was done for senior citizens
specifically on that point and coming
back to I mean in the last budget lot
was done for senior citizen but then yes
when it comes to the medical needs these
expenses on medicines so that is that is
required that is something which we can
look at even the medical insurance which
was increased could be looked at these
two 1 lakh now I think it is about fifty
thousand but I want to make a completely
different point while we are three being
about all these numbers etc but let's
look at also how we",True,en,92,0,0

gonna ask you oh yeah so much of
separation so much of separation so much
hard conditions of service so much is
staying away from family our children
suffer their education suffers our
family lifesavers and what do we get for
fifty years one track one picture was
okay look at everybody cool aspects
which very rightly clearly comes out one
is the fairness aspect and secondly is
the operational efficiency has yes so if
you're making wanting to ensure this
both are sort of met what is required is
as far as the promotion's are concerned
promotions need is a number of years of
service there are is offset fifteen
years of service make whatever rank is
make it possible for the army to come to
that rank don't link the army ranks and
these pay scales number one number two
as far as the army rights are concerned
these are these are related to the types
of formation is commanding he is Brigade
is commanding a brigade you don't call
it we call him a major-general so you
can call him a brigadier yes he may be

Lillian sorry once again so quickly just
so Leishman mother on the larger
question of actually as a country now
being able to re-examine what is
required for a new fashion of a defense
force that is willing to take on the
21st century how do we have that larger
conversation at an accelerated rate
of course look forward to expose those
who have served like beginning to bring
come see NASA and all those experts you
know they know what is the need of the
operational field there we how the best
professional army can be made and of
course we have newer areas we have cyber
you know once again a lot of ideas will
be used also it will not be just
manpower driven may meet a crews
agreement all these are expected to be
considered to make India the best power
in the world ok so I'm going to distill
this is the bottom questions bottom line
question ashish is are we engaged
actively engaging with the process that
this kind of modernization restructuring
both in terms of practicalities and in
terms of fighting fitness is happening
at the rate we should happening have it
happening no no it's not certainly not
happening at the rate because of the two
factors one is the political
decision-making process and second the
slowness I would say it's happening but
politically we need to do much better
second is the bureaucracy aspect you
know as our officer experts explain
bureaucracy is not gonna like it trust
me and because you know you'll have the
to a certain extent parity and pass
these things but that's what the
government is true a crack the whip you
know so this you might want to claim
that you know the common has done a lot
but it needs to do much more than what
it has done it is serious promise that
was made by Prime Minister himself has
not happened so far we are all push okay
see okay okay should I just believe
there can be no compromise on the
quality of commanders that means content
there can be no compromise on that
because that's to the interest secondly
there also has to be a connection in the
founder form of and my solution is
people who don't deserve to become
commanders and not get you to the
command command as chain you give them
NFU you give them paying launches I can
tell you the taste that taste of
sweetness in the command is much more
than what money can give you and
therefore and given a few bureaucrats
are getting they don't get promoted they
get up
got it scales up a while you're in
genomic okay so keep the keep the
command selection process are intact not
sure but the pay scale selection yeah a
slightly different which is what
happening in the bureaucracy particular
pathologic question for the people
watching this broadcast we listen to
this entire interview is are we
approaching this in the spirit and with
the urgency of actually create a
modernized army that we should reach up
a lot of effort has been made in the
last four years in terms of military
modernization these demands for
integrated battlegroup or kind of
restructuring was there for a long
period of time and I at least appreciate
the government has taken the step
forward in terms of doing it it might
take a lot of time similarly I would
also read you know one thing that
similar demands are there in case of
central police forces also who do also a
thankless job in most cases it is the
IPS officers who sit in the top of the
CAD officer this forces do not get the
opportunity I would include ADB but
north of work is really what has been
done ok parity in a few bureaucracy all
the things are fine part and parcel of
worst largest democracy well India but
you know the rate with which the speed
with bridge the threat of two front war
has gone up we have not been able to
make the progress and match that divine
I'm the same I tell you what let's come
back there's a budget day coming up
tomorrow obviously which is why most of
us been distracted I'm glad we've had
even on the eve of that did this
important conversation and let's take an
hour by she let's bring come back on
this next week and and keep having this
conversation because it adds to a
national narrative and perhaps a lot of
people watching because would have
understood these issues a little bit
better for the first time because
they're so important we can't leave it
and pretend they don't happen because
that's how the bureaucrats and the
politicians
burning it because we stopped caring
about it we leave it there thanks to all
of you the interviews coming up next
after this break goodnight
[Music]
this week on the going to be discussing
something that affects us all the food
that we eat fasting we doesn't mean that
you keep yourself empty stomach I have
not seen anybody losing weight when they
are fasting when you have this eight
sixteen as they call it the 80s doesn't
mean that you eat rubbish it is
basically on three pillars have safe
food healthy food and have fortified
food whenever you are following any kind
of diet you would find results for sure
it is not practicals my guest today is
her deep foreign minister of housing and
urban office once upon a time I remember
you wanted to fight from Punjab I was
asked at one state to fight the looks of
I election and I said most certainly
this is a party where you don't do it
asked you are told by the party so I
consider myself as a career kurta at the
moment I'm am elected member to the Raja
server from u P whatever the party wants
a given point of time but this is not a
party where people go around lobbying
for things by the party what is to be
done
government came into power with a lot of
help from the corporates do they feel
let down because Modi is trying to move
away from very much no I don't think
that Indian business feels like it got
out of Modi what they were expecting how
the Congress been able to woo the
conference Congress would convert ideas
into politics you've also been pretty
caustic about Rahul Gandhi Viktor I was
critical yes but there was no
alternative
Rahul on the other hand has surely had a
couple of conversations within they says
that even when he talks about Hindu
Torah he's peddling a soft hill this
club is that work still have to look at
Modi's offering it's still very strong I
mean he ran in 2014 on three things
[Music]
but let's definitely feel comfortable
[Music]
[Music]
a very good evening you're watching a
special show ahead of the union budget
that will be presented tomorrow the last
by the Modi government many believe that
in fact there's a debate going on as to
whether or not it will be just a vote on
account or will it actually be a full
fledged budget so come down to that
final budget in the present of the
present for the dispensation right here
we begin a fait broadcast let's quickly
take a look at some of those important
breaking news that we are getting in
fact ahead budget presentation the
inside details that we are picking up
let's get started let's get the show
going
the first breaking news that we're
getting on the show and then of course
we open this up to our panel of experts
as well all right Rob you weren't likely
to announce minimum income in the last
budget ahead of 2019 elections there a
lot of anticipation how this could
really be a political budget there would
be a lot of focus on the political
commentary that would be made ahead of
the looks of I elections which is where
of course there is a tation that there
could be some sort of a minimum income
guarantee scheme that could be put a
first Rahul Gandhi did mention that
earlier in the week what form and shape
it would take remains to be seen and of
course whether or not India can afford
it is the big question let's open this
up with me here we've got political
representatives Rehman Malik and
Mohammed Khan representing BJP and
Congress Franzel Sharma was an author
and economic analyst with me here in the
studio professional a path through the
eternal director of the sunday Guardian
Ravi Chen whose partner of person taxa
PETA brucey ratchet the finance and
banking expert and ash Maajid Singh was
the MD of IPE global joining us on the
broadcast professional Appa let me begin
with you you know while we're still a
first awaiting as to whether or not it
would be just to vote on account whether
it'll be a full-fledged budget breaking
away from convention the question is all
eyes on whether or not there will be
some sort of an email guarantee scheme
that the Modi government will actually
come out with well curry I'm going to
just go to the politics of it and
frankly politically the urban vote is
very important for the BJP the BJP if it
needs to come to power it's not just UPA
or Bihar it's also urban cities across
India
and in open vote much more than a party
manifesto what will be important is this
budget so if you really have some major
changes in this budget which appeal to
the urban world then that's going to be
much more valuable for a BJP then a
manifesto so the question is will they
use this for their polls or will go by
the textbook and just make it a kind of
a Wharton account without any politics
coming in - all right branch of the
expectation you know as is as Professor
what was also saying that it is going to
be a political budget commentary is
going to be very critical which is where
of course the minimum income guarantee
scheme could be a very very important
component one Big Bang decision would be
made to ensure no the idea and the
benefits are fresh in the minds of the
people and therefore that can be
encashed immediately but I think a
minimum income guarantee scheme comes in
in forms of you know universal basic
income I think the Congress party has
talked about it already so the idea has
been around for a while but a promise
like this I think is not going to be as
successful as people assume but let's
wait and see how the details come out
but clearly that's a very big issue on
the table all right okay it rests more
breaking news coming in as we speak
let's put that out on our screens as
well as we discuss the minimum Internet
guarantee form and shape it would take
whether or not in Dec and afford it that
is of course revised GDP numbers as well
coming in that media Iowa has just put
out revising the GDP estimates going
forward okay let's move ahead there is a
lot of expectation we've spoken about
middle class there is a lot of
expectation how income tax limit may and
the exemption may in fact increase right
now we know that income tax limit that
exists right now there is an expectation
it may go up some say it may go up to 3
lakhs there is an expectation if they
even go to 5 lakh hey Robi J let me
bring you with of course this would
really be a huge and bring a lot of
cheer as far as middle class is
concerned but the point is and the big
question really is all right there is
breaking news coming in right now we
have to cut across to the press
conference that the CIO is chewing right
now the GDP growth rate as I said has
been revised to 7.2% let's quickly cut
across to listen to the commentary
coming in from me TI o adamantly she mo",True,en,87,0,1

live on that big story appreciation of
course all eyes are on the crucial
budget talk which will present it to by
the Modi government tomorrow of course
it is the last set the Parliament you
know when this government is in power
and it is an extremely extremely crucial
session tell us what all can we expect
from tomorrow's budget of course from
farmers to the middle class or extremely
hopeful and not expecting all sort of
stops you know or for their particular
segment this is the extremely important
our day tomorrow for the BJP because you
know a bgp feels that a lot of narrative
can be set right by what the government
proposes tomorrow the government very
strongly feels the tryst waving waving
announcement which was done by the
Congress party has helped them net a
large number of votes where the farmers
were facing a lot of heat due to either
bad productivity or odd being not in a
position to sell their where for a for a
proper price and this is the reason why
the government feel that if they are
able to offer a right kind of soft then
they will be able to net right kind of
votes and if election 2019 will be the
footprint of election 2019 will be
written all over the budget of a voice
vote on account which we will get to
hear tomorrow because the government
knows that this is the make or Mar
moment as far as the bjp-led NDA
government is concerned
absolutely the Congress is also issued a
whip to all its members asked me to be
present in the Rochester bazaar many
other contentions bills also which can
be taken up in the budget session to the
Congress also ensuring that it has its
numbers right in the Rajas above course
the house where the government doesn't
have majority
well you know there are there are a
couple of crucial bills also the triple
thalaaq bill which the government would
want to see to it that you know that
they will want to introduce and get it
passed in the upper house chances of
which is extremely less but the
government would I want to push through
because the government knows that you
know this is the last chance of getting
things done because of you practically
two months away two and two and a half
or three months the entire exercise of
2019 being completed so the government
knows that tomorrow they will be putting
off setting a very important message as
far as you know general election
elections are concerned and this is the
reason why tomorrow all eyes will be
tomorrow just to make sure about the
kind of sauce that is being offered and
also the kind of bills meant is able to
pass through this a budget session of
Parliament absolutely yes and you know
when we speak of soaps so which
everyone's expecting tomorrow one major
announcement which everyone is expecting
is some sort of a minimum basic income
for at least you know the below poverty
line or the the poorest section of the
society
Rahul Gandhi of course of the Congress
has already made that that in case their
government comes to power they will go
ahead and implement the same is that
really on the list something but sure
you know many are of course it's looking
forward to from tomorrow's budget well
one big expectation of the middle class
from the budget is that they want the
income tax net to be raised from 250
thousand to 5 lakh rupees remember when
I don't directly was in opposition this
was one of demand which he defeated
regularly and said that if their
government would come power they would
definitely raise the bar as far as
income tax is concerned income tax
exemption is concerned and this is apart
from this you know the government is
also and people are hoping that the
government would announce some big shots
to the farmers and also or some sort of
basic universal income something in the
line of what Rahul Gandhi has already
made announcement because the government
knows it's just she months away from a
new government to take power as far as
India is concerned and this is the
reason why they would want to make sure
that they put their best forward make
sure that the Congress is not able to
rob them of any opportunity when it
comes to offering shop to net either the
poor or the farmers a vote as far as a
general election 2019
absolutely Burgess looks like that
populism is going or to overshadow
prudence in this upcoming budget and of
course the election seasons are around
the corner and the government want to
take a chance of course all eyes will be
on tomorrow budget on what type of soaps
if any the government offers for not
which is thank you for joining us with
all those detail that note it's a wrap

that they are being at pickin towards
the Patiala household and ever since
they have a brought to the country they
have been interrogated by two separate
things or four was interrogating people
Corral and the second one was
interrogating Raj Saxena and now it is
we will ask for that more time from
Patiala house coat for their custody
because they want to interrogate them
for the longer period and therefore they
will be bringing them to the Patiala
house coat and therefore they will ask
for the maximum time of their custody
and also remember that today in the wee
hours of the morning they both have been
extradited to India a special aircraft
was there in Dubai to actually fly them
back to the country and this is one of
the biggest catches that India have
right after the extradition of Crystal
mission in the month of December
these are going to be very crucial men
since he was the close it mission and he
knows in and out information of the
entire deal or scam which happened with
a boost of SN he's the one who has
floated so many companies many shell
companies along with his wife to divert
the funds which came as a kickback from
if we start with Western so it's going
to be very crucial that how how long it
gets the custody of these two and what
information they collect from these two
so that they can move forward in the
investigation of Gustavus today yes
136th Anna will be produced before the
Patiala house coaster then EB will ask
for the cinema custody offer these two
accused and then the interrogation will
start remember that as we're learning
that Gotham Kevin who little man who in
fact took kickbacks from Abu semester
and I worked it that money in the shell
companies of Rajiv Saxena he would also
be confronted with no with Raj Saxena
and the entire money trail will be
investigated by dissolute so it remains
to be seen that what information he
gives to Eadie because according to Edie
is he's a very crucial piece of
information for taking this case forward
his name has been in the charge sheet
his wife has also been arrested by the
IDI in 2017 later on she she she took
bail and subsequently the IDI was trying
to extradite him from Dubai trying to
send him summons all the while to ask
him to come for interrogation
investigation but he did not turn up for
that evading the IDI for quite some time
and then big big boost of for all
security forces and even for the current
dispensation for expeditions have
happened in the augustawestland case and
he of course not hoping that they will
be able to establish the money trail
in that case also expected to Michele's
answers with Saxena when they managed to
get custody today of course he'll be
produced at the Patiala house code at
2:00 p.m.

according to news X or psa's a deal has
been struck in Tamilnadu between the AI
DMK BJP for the 2019 looks about polls
the two parties have agreed to contest
the looks of a polls together in Tamil
Nadu according to our sources the two
rounds of behind-the-scene talks have
already been done and a 50-50 formula
has been finalised between the two
parties for the 40 seats in the state
including pure cherry 20 seats have been
set aside to the eid MK and the rs.20
will be allotted to the BJP who will
share these seats with regional players
of Tamil Nadu according to sources the
BJP will contest on eight seats the PM k
led by our mamani Rama doors will
contested on five seats while the DMDK
which is led by VG can't will contested
on four seats and other smaller parties
will share three seats but there was a
strong opposition from one section of
the a IGM key and having an alliance
with the BJP because they felt it would
backfire on them but it was EPS and
ministers SP velu money and tongue of
money who managed to convince them by
saying the influence of the PM k and
DMDK
will help them to gain a larger vote
share and only with this combine can
they compete with the DMK
and Congress we will sweep the elections
and that is what is going to happen whom
our may joined and some other fringe
players may also join these alliances
brought alliances but the main reason
being they have ignored the welfare and
the interest of the Tamil people
we have it very clear that we will not
away with the communal DMK communal
Congress communal communist so rest of
the park is we are open for any aliens
and we will definitely form a very
strong alliance for the upcoming
Parliament elections without these three
parties
they do not want to alive with BJP
however I think they both of them do not
have a choice
so as you may predict somebody may
predict it may happen but it doesn't
matter who joins with anybody
every single Minister is obviously with
the BJP half a dozen ministers have
cases against him or against them or
they have inquiries going on Tunde money
and will money have been the conduits
between the BJP and the ad MK for
several since they've caught a Mitch I
thing or two about governance and they
have Amit Shahs years so they are the
people who are trying to convince the
net in any case EPS and okays are almost

vZlDnsnFmWs,Should the undisputed acquired land be used to build Ram mandir? Nation At 9,"In 1915, Albert Einstein was busy publishing his theory of general relativity. The logic of a space time continuum was explained to ...",2019-01-29T17:00:58Z,NewsX,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vZlDnsnFmWs/hqdefault.jpg,"[Music]
welcome back in 1915 Albert Einstein was
really publishing his theory of general
relativity the logic of a space-time
continuum was explained to us for the
first time at any given time only one
thing can exist in a given place but a
different time a different thing may
occupy that space
I understand could not find the center
of the universe perhaps one doesn't even
exist but for many Hindus the birthplace
of Lord Rama is the center of their
faith there is no other birthplace the
particular site is bound by the
space-time continuum only one thing can
exist there at a particular time for 70
odd years we've been debating this point
without much success and now we've
realized that perhaps a back-to-basics
approach is better in 1993 though
minister of n narsimha Rao's government
had acquired 60 acres of land around the
disputed Ram Janmabhoomi site that land
was never disputed today it's central
government property but has a status quo
order from the Supreme Court hanging on
it which means nothing can be done with
it for now if the Supreme Court was to
lift this status quo order around when
their complex could begin construction
leaving only the disputed 2.7 acres and
the less than a third of an acre of the
actual footprint of the Babri Masjid
building where it actually stood leader
untouched this can be resolved later by
the Supreme Court once it rules on the
matter the government has proposed
exactly this to the Supreme Court today
a ruling is awaited needless to say
there are some who are up in arms
calling it a ploy whatever it may be it
would be a step towards the solution a
solution this country desperately needs
a solution which in the space-time
continuum of things would suit the BJP
were it to happen now rather than later
so can the logic of this win why don't
we just why don't we just do it earlier
should all side at least agree on the
undisputed land
let's ask those questions let's put this
into perspective but we bring up on your
screens the actual site of the Ram
Janmabhoomi can
have that on our screens please now
here's what we often miss because our
historical recollection often does not
go in the producers are you guys awake
yeah thank you can add the map map
graphic please thank you I'd be grateful
thank you
have a look at this so this is the IO
their site right that in the center is
the exact spot where the Ram Janmabhoomi
exist that's the spot where the Masjid
used to stand the larger area around it
is about 60 odd acres you can see the
green patch that entire green patch
devoid of buildings is of course 60 odd
acres which was undisputed but was taken
over as central property have a look at
this so the yellow line can we just blow
this up and we can be getting to the top
and world by just blow this up now that
yellow line there okay that is the 2.7
acres which is the disputed site the
central point flashing in the middle is
the actual Ram Janmabhoomi site and the
larger red line around it is about 60 or
other acres which was never disputed in
the first place but was taken over by
the government now can a temple complex
come up in with that 60 odd acres
leaving that yellow line and the red dot
for now untouched so at least something
can happen and once the Supreme Court
does rule at some date then a decision
can be made what's to be done with the
area in that yellow line whether there
is to be something else built there is
to be left fallow
those decisions can be made let's open
up this conversation RP Singh of the
media be joining us station of the Nigam
is with us and our studios Modern Art on
the editorial director of the sunday
Guardian move demons or gie is joining
us from Mumbai and Sri I hear and also
joining us via Skype professor madam
nala Perth irony of course is that there
was a formula to this effect - way back
in 93
well you should I'd like to say that if
in 93 construction of of frankly a Karim
mother complex was was done then I can
tell you a lot of the communal problems
that have been Evald
India since then would have been avoided
the fact is that you know the the this
kind of a situation that has prevailed
over the ROM month over seven decades
has led to a perception of victimhood
among the hundreds of millions of people
it does not help communal relations at
all and so far the Muslim community is
concerned I don't believe that those few
people who are in court and who are
appearing in television screens
represents this great community at all I
think the the bulk of our Muslim
brothers and sisters appreciate the
importance of from Monday to the Hindu
to the Hindu brother insist okay so and
therefore if this has been done in 93 we
could avoid a lot of pain and I
certainly hope is done in 2019 okay we
don't have to suffer more pain more
bloodshed more communal violence more
hatred and that hopefully longer should
we wait there for these wounds are
healed that would be the imminent logic
and the logic would also take us further
that if that site is never disputed in
the first place the area around it what
do we do with that site do we need to
leave it Fano for some reason and will
the litigants in this case now start
disputing that site also they certainly
come is that a reasonable starting point
that's a very reasonable starting point
if you recall for a key judgment was a
fight judges bench okay let's put it
into context so this is 93 I'm going to
put this into context but obvious can be
can I put out one on our screens the
what they smell fire rookie judgment had
to say please so in 93 94 is the so 93
is when there is an IO there act that
comes after the ramen the audience
that's the point of time when under the
narsimha our government the 60 acres is
taken over by the government then any
smell Farooqi goes to the Supreme Court
he challenges the fact that the
government has nationalized the 60 odd
acres and of course raises the question
of a of that there is a need for a
mosque for the numbers to be read or
both points the Supreme Court rejection
yes yes and and and this acquisition has
become final it has not been challenged
by anybody so that case is over that
case is over now this is with the
government only the status quo is
applying and that is status quo is by
five judges bench now this application
has been moved now this happens later
score dates to 2003 2000 now we are
sixteen or years later and therefore
given the view given the fact that the
hearing is not taking place for some
reason or the other I'm not going into
the reasons contained therein therefore
this is a very good methodology of
Ackley's freeing that portion of land
which is not disputed okay so therefore
and this is also this is also five
judges bench please remember that so it
can
so therefore this law if if only because
the status of the land is no longer
under dispute yes the status quo on to
the final adjudication is what is is
what is now currently under dispute
sorry I hear and it's an if so I'm going
to make a big if if this status quo is
lifted how efficaciously can that land
around with these jobs in the movie that
61 acres be used and what can it be used
for you know they can have a complex
such as like maybe a museum for the law
drama or like a longer or a prayer room
or any other kind of facility that
people might want to use if they come
visiting the temple and you can bill the
sanctum sanctorum once the disputed area
is settled and I believe that this sort
of construction should start in the
earnest because this has been going on
for far too long and I have really props
and Oliphant on that and an India needs
to move beyond these things and and
become a superpower which it can because
right now it's getting dragged down by
small issues like this okay RP Singh
from the counter Aryan perspective would
it not be specious that in religion well
it is actually the particular site the
sanctum sanctorum that is all in
that it's pcs to be building a temporal
complex around it by leaving the actual
site still in the realm of the Supreme
Court jurisprudence see I have a map of
that completely head like you'd like to
use yeah let's put it we have one also
and I let's put it on back on our screen
spleens to the map back on our screens
go ahead aren't you see okay and this
you can see only the blue part which is
patches in between you see disputed
areas the rest three are already being
there with deep Hindu organizations and
then there's another 67 odd acre land
which is outside around that place now
dispute is not for the yet that that
temple was not yet it has been cleared
and declared buying the al-abbas coat
there is no question on that if there is
any dispute on whether there is a temple
or not there there was a temple just
clear it was also decided at some stage
during the earlier government narsimha
Ross vomit well then if just dispute if
this is confirmed yes there was a temple
then they will give it with a complete
you see my question was but should we
start working in the remaining 60 acres
for now yes we should we should I'm
saying we should and we should the work
you start because ultimately I strongly
feel and I'm not I'm not tend to
prejudge the Supreme Court but once the
issue is all that yes the temple is just
said there's no issue I'm not very sure
there's just no other judgment because
we don't expect funds above which we
expressed in the court but anyhow but
still there they're set up yes can start
building and it will take not just that
matter of one year or two year it'll
take long time and then quote is taking
his own thing and we found them and
construction networking activity which
is been going on for decades and and the
brick collection activity which is been
going on for decades is actually being
efficacious and once the permission does
come to build something that we can do
it quickly at least hopefully before I
get in most people do di into this
conversation professional nada Perth let
me pose the same question to you because
the argument would be by many people
that look this is would be a creeping
acquisition of the disputed
and therefore is unpalatable you know
sure I want to point out which I've said
consistently Lord Rob belongs to the
whole of India
I'm surprised for example some people
are objecting to Sanskrit the fact is
that it is the Vedic period and the very
clear it belongs to the whole of India
you can't run away from your history and
you can't run away from Lord Rama and
you can't run away from his birthplace
so the practices are among little
complex is not specific to any religion
no one's going to put a sign there that
only people have any particular religion
should be there all of India all of the
world will be welcoming there among
their complex okay so I don't see any
problem whatsoever I again repeat those
few people who are trying to delay this
their nation it's less pressure on them
and they are still perpetuating this
gang of tension ok in society module G a
B this is the proposal the proposal is
that there are 60 acres of land around
the disputed site in Ayutthaya
let's put those 60 acres of land to use
do you have a problem with that

then you are saying is so green
podcasting this is the problem we get
stuck in this - an ecologist that means
evilly unable to take a clear position
this is now undisputed land yet we are
being told that as long as the stage
this which is a fact - a legal position
the Supreme Court will have to lift it
state before any action can be taken and
hide behind that is that reasonable no
the fact remains that mmm that
application is spending it is Supreme
Court's call to vacate decide yes and
and and since this is an undisputed land
there is a likelihood that as a legal
opinion I might tell you there's a
likelihood that this day might be lifted
because this is okay so far as we were
talking about ordinance it was with
respect to two point seven seven acres
which is a disputed land it is not with
respect to ordinance with okay let's cut
to the chase there was already an
ordinance regarding this in ninety three
that ordinance was enacted by Parliament
it was tried before the Supreme Court in
ninety four the Supreme Court held up
that act an ordinance although it
abrogated a certain section one section
basically said that this should not be
open to legal dispute beyond that - that
section the Act was held up by the
supreme court so the comes to surface
three RP Singh you are being accused of
some history here the other side who
seems to have its own so history in in
hiding behind the codes rather than take
a position on their own who's to blame
as a government we have to abide by the
code we are following the better
whatever the best recourse is legally
possible the government is trying is
best
is that possible Rico's but I am again I
am today and record think the options
are open there are options which can be
open which are open but since the Prime
Minister Modi has categorically stated
that other options will be only
considered after the court order so
we'll have to wait for the canal but
should we not the government for
patients and Sanguinetti or should we be
slightly critical of a little a pathetic
and legardie attitude
well I'd like to say that frankly and
this disputer simmer down for 70 years
and it's a sad reflection on our
institutions but we are still stuck at
the almost the same spot
it is really frankly astonishing that
underneath which is so sensitive through
the country and so important for
harmonious communal relations that for
70 years we seem to be stuck at the same
spot what are our institutions doing I
am an ordinary citizen I am saying that
look it is not been finalized

okay - signify something about religion

the position is yes the conversation we
are having right now
[Applause]
protein Shire
should there be now at this point of
time another outreach to build consensus
on what is already undisputed no I don't
think so I think we have you know they
spent enough time trying to create this
consensus and and let's let's face it
it's in the interests of some people
some vested interest to keep this pot
boiling and BJP government is making a
very sensible attempt at trying to move
this thing forward get the undisputed
line and start constructing something
there and I think this process should
play itself out and
as a country we need to move beyond they
say that role Lord lived there 7,000
years ago will be very Vedic age
everybody all of us and always personal
III really see this point about the
Muslims is the logical argument that
there is only one birthplace of Lord Ram
there can be other places to build a
Muslim that doesn't justify the
demolition of the budget in the first
place of course but this is not Mecca
this is not Medina where the request for
a temple to be input is initially yes
yes initially obviously somebody built a
demo in the in the in the sixteenth
century
that's when Baba came that's what is
called the that lot of temples in North
India but this point destroyed by
invaders but I again I don't want to
open up all of that understand have a
practical conversation they should have
the Nigam the same question is it should
be Lord the current establishment with
its patients and its Sanguinetti or
should we critical that this could have
the same thing could have been done
maybe a year earlier maybe a few months
earlier and we would not be up in front
of a general election before we are
sorting these things out see one thing
let us be very clear that this bombing
took a decision when the hearings what
postponed one after the other so this
route was explode it was explored and
patients were socializations was shown
and also you know there is no historic
value and and even the goat there is no
historic value to the land around this
certainly and even even to Islam this
this this disputed structure had no
historic Valley and secondly the High
Court Arabic has clearly held not to be
a mosque
under tenets of Islam okay okay okay I'm
short of time now the ID let me ask you

this is of course about an undisputed

which is of course the irony and
everything you seem to do you there are
piecing quick last for 30 seconds we
waited for 70 years and then the
patience is running out I am very
categorical and then let Supreme Court
take a call I'm saying and Prime
Minister is on record Bobby support ie
apprentices on record saying yet we'll
abide by the Supreme Court that's why we
are waiting otherwise government has
that tools and norms to do well do do
the things Oh baby okay absolutely I
don't know another number this they
still a best-case scenario no no this
well I'd simply like to say that in the
conduit Constitution of India the
government is empowered to take steps
it's not that the government is
recommended tree and it recommends to
the judiciary and the judiciary takes
the steps as far as I understand the
Constitution it's the government
responsibility I'm glad this government
has finally woken up and is finally
doing something about this matter here
solemn promise was made in the 2014
election I'm happy okay's final months
that that's to some extent that promises
being kept and I can't repeat in the
under the Constitution it is
responsibility of the government so what
can be done so what can I give and I
need another time I need to slip into a
short break on the other side of this
very short break we are in conversation
with Subramanyam Swamy who is in detail
discussing this entire plan of what can
be done with this undisputed land is a

Neha Khanna it is the 19 of her 50 d
temple campaign where we have been
bringing you stories of organized loot
plunder and decline of temple property
especially from the south of the country
today we are bringing you here to know
the case this time from the Korra in
Telangana this is about a 900 year old
Shri Sita Ram Chandra Swamy temple we'll
bring you that report in just a moment
but before that let me introduce to you
my colleagues who joining me on the show
location where I would actually file
that story joining us live now from
Hyderabad and here with me in the studio
to deconstruct this for us is my
colleague Devika all right location well
let me begin with you we are going to
play out that report which you filed for
our viewers in just a moment but if you
could briefly explain what is this
particular case of loot ineptitude and
corruption all about
yes this temple is located on the
outskirts of Hyderabad Ram Chandra Swamy
temple that is that is nearby the
Hyderabad International Airport in
streams ibadah and this temple yes for
the not that prosti also it has 222
acres of land one acre of land in that
area cuts almost ten close to 20 crores
of rupees but it is located only nine
acres we went there we sobbed there are
no boundary walls also there no but that
most of the land has been given for long
time Lee is like a sixty six years for
99 years of lazy if you give the land
for that kind of lives
it will not come back and you have to
forget about that kind of land because
no it is for it is given for it is given
for no agriculture all these no
activities but we have seen so many real
estate activities have been going on
surrounding this temple so that the
temple land will not come back and and
Nizam Nawab also donated a lot of land
because it is very same Sun temple and
no dare to believed in the God and they
donated but there were no records found
there about this land but you know no
until four or five years ago there is a
sentiment in Tollywood that is Telugu
cinema industry if any shooting goes and
I know if you saw the temple in the
movies it will be a super duper hit that
kind of sentiment is there and almost
400 movies have been shot there but not
is not in not a good condition okay okay
David Kiser bring you in here look he
should give me one moment I will come
back to you difficult what's really
mind-boggling here so these facts that
we are putting out before our viewers
that while they do not see this on
camera but in an off-camera conversation
the temple trustee and the press priest
urine secretary actually claimed that
the temple get some measly rent of one
lakh eighty thousand a year for the land
that has been leased out then several
kurz have been encroached upon and
illegally occupied when they go to the
endowments Dept to complain the advice
they get is you focus on your puja and
not on the land what does this mean the
null means Department is either not
interested they are happily looking the
other way or the worst case scenario
their hand in glove with the intrusions
and exactly near and that's what makes
this particular case very interesting
and like you mentioned the three
scenarios of the three possibilities of
what this could mean but you know if we
think about it logically it seems most
likely that it is the last aspect right
that the endowments Dept the Babu's
sitting in government offices are in
fact hand in love with the people who've
encroached the random that's precisely
why they don't want to go ahead and take
any action because everybody is making
some money you know on this entire it's
it's a hierarchy of corruption so to say
and everybody is making some fun of
money and what's what's actually
saddening and we will also be putting
that out in the report is the fact that
this is at least a thousand-year-old
temple it's so sacred it's come in so
many films a lot of people would have
actually seen this temple and they
probably didn't recognize that in those
popular films but not only in southern
films it's a temple that's also been
used in Bollywood films and
unfortunately because of an accident
that allegedly happened in 2017
shootings had to be stopped in the
temple but imagine the temple priests
and the the temple authorities have 222
acres of land to take care of this is
one case that when we were also looking
at it it brings about a lot of
practicalities of a maintaining a temple
and forward as well it brings that
question forward as well so it is of
course in a practical if you look at it
practically then yes the temple
authorities have gone ahead and they've
leased out portions of the land right
because how else does one take a look at
the rains are getting it is absolutely
ridiculous in fact you wanted to ask a
question to locate sure go right ahead
right and that's if location could help
us understand the sort of from the
conversation
had what really is the situation with
the rent because when we were listening
to the conversation we were also it was
you know it was told to us that it's not
just the priests were not getting their
salaries but it is the temporal
Authority is who not being able to
sustain with the sort of grants that
they're getting because you think about
it logically even if the temple is
getting a lot of revenue it requires
money in today's day and age it requires
money to go to a cousin a cook of China
and and all they're getting in ranked as
1 lakh 80,000 rupees a year that is
preposterous location this itself is a
scam yeah that's what this temple yeah
that's the God temple you know the
founder trustee told us but you know
even if it is a minimal you can estimate
there are 222 acres main so it weren't
an actor cast and croats at least that
that is any bit mm throats of property
is there with the saw with this freedom
channel swami temple there are no just
that there is a temple there is no no
there are no walls house we said that
one one one lakh eighty to eighty
thousand rupees per annum rent is is
getting but no we go further he says
that that land was given long back for
this leaders we cannot take them back
you know it you know that's he's not in
a position to reclaim it the government
of Telangana has taken up this temple
and endowment Department is looking
after it he along with his founder
trustee but there there are no the
people are in no mood to take back the
temple lands throughout in Telangana
in Hydra was itself the temple in or
just Union secretary served out ten
thousand crores of valued land has gone
for this land sharks but the government
is also not interested to take them back
because there are so many politicians
are involved industrial Sorrell involved
and this you know but these temples are
also located in the very lands are very
you know very important location so the
lands of so high Castro here that is if
now we are seeing this temple this is
located just five kilometers away from
the International Airport that to
Hyderabad side this is very odd
is sold like hotcakes for real estate
and other purposes you know he said that
the land has given for long back for
wages it means that they cannot reclaim
that land that is the pity of this kind
of temples er this will know almost ten
thousand course of bhakti land is given
like this in Hyderabad city
absolutely you quite right there Lokesh
word and this is really what makes it so
shocking this is a prime property that
we're talking about acres and acres of
land you think it's not very far from
the airport and yet we have a situation
where in abysmal rent of less than 2
lakh per annum is being paid to the
temple and you know the vicar I think
what Lokesh was just pointed out is
really at the heart of the problem when
he talks about how no government is
willing to do anything about this and
fact of the matter is where anyone
admits it or not several politicians it
could be belonging to several different
parties seem to be on board this gravy
train and therefore it lies in
everyone's interest to just look the
other way and to let this loot continue
oh absolutely huh and if I can also
bring in location if he can just take us
through some of the details of what
really was that conversation all about
that off-camera conversation because as
we were documenting this entire story it
was really the change in what really was
happening the change in what was being
told to us was so stuck you know when we
were asking the temple trustee he was
telling us about how the temple is doing
really well their revenues have
increased they've tripled over the years
but then suddenly when the conversation
was off-camera that's when the reality
came out of what really was happening of
how they are also struggling to bring
the land back and at the same time you
know it is it just shows that the people
who are trying to preserve temple and
were trying to just run a temple and
that requires money and that requires
resources they are so scared of what's
happening in government offices of the
Babu's of the endowment in charges that
they don't want to
talk about rhythm that precisely is what
is being exposed to this particular case
that the Temple Authority itself is
trying is struggling to maintain the
land and even when they go to the
endowments Dept they're told to focus on
puja and not on the land as if the land
is not a part of the temple and because
they clearly see the land is just a
revenue making machines so they don't
really you know they don't think that it
is the responsibility of the temple
authorities all the priests to interfere
in this matter of location just take us
through quickly what exactly was that he
was told off-camera by the priest
Lucas what could you hear that
yeah I can hear you know of the record
also then a temple priests are some
people they go to endowment officer or
endowment department they immediately
suspect the priests and they say they
order the author you do your work that
is the poses only if you do not know if
you interfere in this land issues and
the deals under the temple maintenance
you will be transported to other areas
on remote area that's why they are all
afraid and if this happens in the city
also those who who do not interfere in
this temple land and there they are only
in the city areas that is the main main
problem even when we go to some
endowment appears and they immediately
suspect that these people are digging
something out that is the reason they
you know from the Commission of
Commissioner to know the sources that we
have when the pisar is of these breeds
they get orders this person has brought
some media person it means that the you
need to suspect that their misdeeds will
be exposed the warnings are given from
the commissioner of endowment Department
to the lower I know priest is the lower
lower this thing of endowment officer
they got this kind of dictator so that
they are also afraid of this know
involving in this surprise run it afraid
quite ridiculous to make that argument
when somebody comes to you with a folio
say is don't it is their job it's the
job of the endowment officials to look
into that complainant get to the bottom
of things instead they are doling out
this gratuitous advice saying focus on
your pooja not on the land that itself
really sounds like a complete scam still
of the case where we come back in just a
woman let's say in the meantime go
across to our first caller Viswanathan
from china is on the phone line rich my
husband please go ahead yeah I would
like to compliment
nearest channel for bringing in out day
in and day out about our condition of
our Indian temples on the land which
belongs to the temple this is all due to
the nexus between the beginning the land
revenue officials politicians then
muscle power and money power this is
what is causing the loss and the temple
lands on like lands which don't have
which are orphaned and know that anyone
really
to to look up to nobody is really
concerned about it I hope with your
program something will happen
thank you well that certainly is our
endeavor
thanks very much I wish for Nelson for
sharing your views with us as we've been
saying this is just d-19 of her 50d
campaign where we are highlighting this
systematic loot corruption and plunder
of temple land that's happening in large
parts of the country particularly down
south darica let me bring you back into
the conversation you know we were
talking about this ridiculous in
gratuitous advised as being built out by
officials of the endowments Dept you
know that itself sounds very very fishy
because what it essentially tells you
it's not just a fact that they're not
willing to do their job the job that
they are there for in the first place
but that they probably also has
something to hide absolutely Neha and
that's what I'd said in the beginning is
well that it all sounds very suspicious
you are the endowments Dept it's your
job it's your responsibility to take
care of the temple and if the temple
authorities and priests are claiming
that they have been going to the
endowments Dept then it's then it
becomes an even more serious matter
because somebody is coming to you with a
formal complaint right they're coming
and they're telling you that listen we
need your help your intervention is
required here because not only are
people not willing to give us a proper
rent for the land but also parts of the
temple land have been encroached
released launched a formal inquiry into
the matter and encroachments are not
something that happen overnight really
and they're quite visible so it's
actually is very surprising and shocking
that nobody would want to lodge that
formal complete unless they had
something that they were getting out of
it and they have something themselves to
hide in the entire matter and that's
precisely what continues to come out as
we dig deeper and deeper you know what's
going on with you know land across India
that belongs to temples absolutely you
know it all looks very suspicious
so many levels and it looks like this
rot runs really deep the question that
then we need to ask ourselves okay sure
is what is the government doing in all
of this you know we're talking about how
revenue officials are looking the other
way they're probably making a quick buck
we're talking about how officials of the
endowment department either don't seem
to care or are very much on this gravy
train you know we're talking about how
in many cases temple trust themselves
just don't seem to care but the question
really is what about the accountability
of the state government itself because
at the end of the day the endowments
Dept the agency department is a part of
the state government why for example in
this case is the Telangana government so
indifferent to this whole affair
yes this government turn of the many
people don't they don't bring this issue
into the chief minister's notice are
this governess notice in the lower rank
that is no district collector RoR devos
are there the revenue department
interfere into this kind of requires
it's a revenue department is far more
powerful than this endowment department
and they growl you know be there you
know with some contractors or of some
real estate or no business people they
grab this this land with the help of
Revenue Department so take for example
or not in this temple another temple is
the same kind of things happen if there
is a ram chander swamy temple they
change the name like rumps and the Rao
or some chandra rady or something that
it happened in Hyderabad Hyderabad only
and the land will be sold in that name
Ram Chandra and it is sold this land to
somebody else so that in this interpret
know there are the records are not
properly maintained by endowment
departments even if there are records
there the revenue department will change
the names this happened that is the
reason you know we actors of land in the
heart of high drama they also have gone
to many politicians and the powerful I
guess IPS address of that case is there
still in pending in heiko in the Supreme
Court in Supreme Court but you know when
these three only the priests arising the
issue in Dovan Department officials are
supposed to save the land of the temples
their primary duty is to maintain that
temple properly and richly but they they
know they are one herbal to this
politicians law influence and though
they are the department's influence they
simply kneel to this kind of preserves
and they cannot speak and the land is
going like this and the same cases with
this their temple temple also the temple
we see that which it is located in the
nine active sub land only the the
trustees were said that it has 222 acres
of land but where is the land where is
that absolutely that's the
million-dollar question when you talk
about the 222 acres of land and this
temple is built on only nine acres what
happens to the remaining land it's a
huge amount of language about and no one
seems to care no one seems to have the
answer
where is the accountability I mean this
is really a mind-boggling situation that
we're looking at they wake up before I
come back to you let's take another call
at this point yes bina on the phone line
to Mumbai be now go ahead yeah I don't
understand one things on the so-called
secular parties while they are after
Monday's property and why I don't
understand what the renewal cycle is all
sacral and horn avoid windows no for
anybody else when you're Daisy have
secular security what is securi
if you have a graph of dumping land
what you'll do what's the meaning of
that what you want to prove what
settlers of catan
are you talking about secularism and you
know you may think this is about
religion but at the end of the day don't
you think this is essentially just about
insatiable human greed secure plan for
that if we do Buddha over there by
people by a politician by anybody's with
putting that property I don't understand
all right dinner very much for sharing
your views with us we we need to take
another quick call at this point colonel
SK Puri is on the phone line to
Mangalore Colonel put it go ahead from
Bangalore hello yes go ahead so we can
hear you I'm speaking from Bangalore
one of the reasons why there is so much
of corruption in these Indian temples is
because of the nexus between the
politicians and the baboons
I feel that it is high time that Armed
Forces of India who are still known to
be uncorrupted should be given these
high posts and they should feel put on
the various boats and the guests of
these hospitals or rather of these
temples of our country because millions
and millions of rupees of being wasted
and being eaten away by the Nexus of the
politicians and the bubble okay was
right about the Nexus I'm not sure
really
he really has a role in this unless
you're referring to retired army
personnel but point taken thanks very
much Colonel Bowie you are of course an
ex-army man yourself and you have strong
views on this issue which we completely
understand thanks very much for talking
to us they because quick last word you
know this also brings up this whole
question of just who should be in charge
of running these temples and that is
something that has come up time and
again on our shows because at the end of
the day if there is going to be no
accountability in the current set up in
Scenario then something's got to change
somewhere absolutely Neha and because it
falls under the government like you said
this is a question that we also in a way
hope to answer perhaps towards the
conclusion of the campaign we'll also
have a better understanding of what
really is going wrong and where is it
going wrong so that we can come up with
a solution of who really then should be
taken care of temple land because case
after case we real to our viewers and to
anyone who's watching the fact that it
is acres of land and at the end of the
day yes it is temple land but land is
land and land is frying property
absolutely and I come buddy's got to in
fact take charge and say enough has gone
wrong over the years and decades and
this draught needs to be stemmed and
that needs to be done now well on that
note I'd like to thank both location and
David Carr for joining me on the show
thanks very much all the viewers for
watching and for sharing their
perspectives with us this is a story
that we continue to track very closely
remember it is a 50-day campaign that

Congress MLAs now this is rama camp has
targeted the Kumarasamy government for
failing in governance
seven months have gone and nothing has
happened said a Congress MLA in an event
attended by former Chief Minister
Siddaramaiah what added fuel to the fire
was Rama who himself claimed that all
the developments would have been all the
development work rather would have been
completed and he been given another
five-year term he also accused other
parties of conspiring to throw him out
with more and more cracks unfolding in
htk facing the heat again the question
is has the Communists given him enough
reasons to part ways and switch
loyalties Congress leaders they have to
watch all those issues that is left to
them there is not my
reaction has to be taken by maybe you

Minister of Karnataka
Kumarasamy reacting to watch the drama I
had said earlier and what his supporter
emily's had also said say the Nama
Kumarasamy going on to say he's ready to
step down if we did the Congress must
rein in these type of comments and these
leaders statements so big news coming in
Kumarasamy sending out a stern warning
to the Congress leadership Jaiprakash

replicas over to you every comment
coming from food or photography Emily at
an event which was presided over by the
governor himself while one MLA said that
in the last seven months
nothing has happened in the Bangalore
especially no funds have been really
released and government is yet to take
off the other element is went on to say
that he considers a drama have still has
ceased minister and over you can take
his place
a day after of these the comments are
coming from the flows go three of the
drama yaar
Kumar Swami I know lashing out at the
Congress stating doctor you can step
down if needed and that the Congress
lemon is a should be reined in this is
not the first time that these comments
have come so dr. who
Philip or Emily a week ago her handle
said that the drama is still the still
see a de facto sickness of Karnataka and
that no one else's have to face him he
cannot comment have coming in the wake
of a large-scale dissent in the Congress
rank and file which feels that the
Congress has a foreigner return to peace
mr. Kumar Swami and and junior partner
has been given the highest post and this
was unnecessary
Kumarasamy in fact has also hit back ads
or the Congress dispensation some time
ago that he is he's a clerk who is doing
all the accounting and that he doesn't
have much access or disposal and he's
also said that had people had given him
a mandate he would have gotten real
development whose work which he had the
fourth in for the state so clearly in
the coalition government there are these
are comments of lying from each other
from the coalition partners and now
Kumar Swami latest so he's back at the
Congress saying that he will steps out
here so the Congress doesn't rain in
their every and this of course Jaya
Prakash is the last thing that you know
the Congress and GDS combined would have
wanted you know in the run after the
looks about polls this will all be
exploited of course by the BJP by saying
this is an insta you know this is an
unstable coalition and they need to be
voted out in the looks of elections
monthly speak how the coalition has been
rocked by various developments
one we saw two weeks ago where in a
section of the MLAs loose of boom by and
ever talks about how there was a terror
attempts to pull down the government and
then we saw a resort politics returning
our ticket Sukumar again taking all
their emanates to the Eagle to golf
resort and then there was this sunken
brawl between two MLS now all these
things have a Marisa bullet in
government if that was not needed these
commands which I read yesterday where's
the drama of himself was on the podium
and now come on from reacting to it all
is not hunky-dory for the poor little
partner Jai Prakash stay with us a let's
player once again for our viewers what
Chief Minister HT Kumaraswamy had to say
they are suggesting you to start
Congress Congress leaders they have to
watch all those issues that is left to
them there is not my reaction has to be
taken by maybe you ask Congress leaders
I'm not concerned person for those
things same the same thing if they want
to continue I am ready to step down I am
ready to step down Congress leaders more
must they must mind think about all
these things to control them yes line
bridge karappa leader of the Congress
joining us on the broadcast British
caliper big statement by Kumarasamy how
do you react in the comments that come
together as a postponed announcement
something which everybody knows and the
clip contested against each other is
also something which everybody knows we
have come together for the purpose and
the purpose is to keep to clean it you
out under two divisive politics out and
to keep the entire people policies all
missing that is the mode exp so this is
the reason we have come together and as
you know the PPP has been trying to buy
our anyway it has been trying to buy our
enemies for a long time and from even
from the moment the government is formed
which isn't mean the PPP by up in trying
to and then they acquire in the case for
the now presently there is working a
rate of 60 crore for enemy so first of
all new but mister kelapa that is a
separate issue sir that is of course a
separate issue that we've discussed
exhaustively you know when when there
was the entire resort politics playing
out now with Kumarasamy claim claiming
that he's ready to step down and your
party must control what your a malaise
are seeing in public against him and
against his government you know that's a
big statement and a and a stern warning
coming in from your coalition partner
you me that is so sir but but now this
is another problem which is playing out
an ad it has been playing out where
we've seen
Jeremiah and loyalist Emily's make very
uncharitable remarks to the work that
Kumarasamy has been doing the community
program where they were speaking and
addressing those members of the
community see God has nothing to do with
the governance of the larger issues of
governance that doesn't have anything to
do with the street that was yeah there's
a little community forum of witnesses
which reminds also party with none of
that community therefore at that point
in time had made certain statements and
have not mean no statements and
obviously not been taking well by mr.
Kumarasamy Coordination Committee which
is the grammar and the kamacho Mian
members to crush out their minor issues
which will be priced out why the Bible
Coordination Committee okay and at the
end of the day are you weary mister
caliper of how the BJP will play this up
in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls they
will you know a resort on this you know
on these statements to say that this is
a coalition which is unstable this is a
coalition which is imploding which is
infighting and obviously is just
together just to keep out you know the
BJP and mr. moody we come together
consistent solution for which the
Congress party and if you give f-16 I'm
going to be okay with us I'm being told
the deputy cm of Karnataka also reacting
life to this story what is your children
mister there is no - now you ran behind
a Muslim lady
see Anant Kumar he today is known for
his reactions like this what can you
expect from him it only shows you know
his background and his culture beyond
that I don't want to comment anything is
always the best seeum who said is not
the best he said naturally because he is
our CLP leader but you are not you are
not happy with the SDKs program sir your
statement says no no no we are all happy
what is there what is wrong in that he
has expressed his opinion nothing wrong
in it he is our CLP leader he has done
well last five years yes nobody nobody
can dispute that different that is a
different thing but as far as their arm
is concerned yes these our leader is a
CLP leader in our party he has done well
for the last five years nobody can
dispute that what is wrong in that what
is your issue saying that there is
nothing wrong and with what he said that
that's just respect for a syndrome aiya
but are these internal rumblings now
within the coalition this is of course
the big question let me go back to
British colaba with us
yes mr. kalapa you are you were pointing
out you reacting to weather okay I think
we've lost British calliper there but
this is of course the big story we are
tracking for you Kumarasamy reacting now
to the criticism that Siddaramaiah and
his loyalists emily's had mounted
against the Kumarasamy government saying
he's ready to step down if all of this
continues let me get back Jai Prakash at
this point on the broadcast executive
editor still live with us Jaya Prakash
we are seeing very defensive reactions
coming in from the BJP from the Congress
now to the statement of Kumarasamy be a
british caliper or beard Jeep and Mishra
well that's right I mean the Congress
use definitely him hot forces simply
recall they gotta and all 78 when the
results came out on a feature of 234
very sure about 30 feet short of a
simple majority about 13 of their
cabinet ministers lost the elections and
about five of them even suppose it was
so the rank and file of the Congress he
is unhappy because the Congress had to
surrender to JDF and offer the dismissal
pollster who for Mara Swamy and this was
without any conditions played out ever
since then it has been a rocky a ride as
far as this coalition government is
under a week after Kumaraswamy took over
he in fact inertia tear saying that I
know he has to cut the poison and just
to keep the DDT outer he had to in a
partner with the Congress and he is not
a happy man and then came the statements
from Sid remind himself that this woman
might survive in the most of the
elections and posted the coordination
committee was better and you've seen so
far both of my abilities have happened
we have seen how there will be
differences MLAs war we take ways to
switch over to the BJP and we have seen
how for emanates and led by so these are
purely
rather permits are clearly we're camping
in poverty there was a spin detect often
the girlfriend and these are given the
fact that they just 34 or cabinet
positions and then they had to invent
the parliamentary speculative force to
accommodate about 15 of them both in
corporations and for the Congress is
concerned they are filled up almost all
of them except for one or two still
there are over 40 MLAs who are crying
foul over coalition government simply
because the works have not been
allocated and the death demands have not
been met by Kumaraswamy basically not
even after having a tea any lives they
have to go with folded hands together
hearing from Kumar so I mean many times
the apartments are turned out that this
research is inaccessible except for five
to six senior senior congressman who are
part of this government for other
communist leaders
feels that long to this coalition
government so these are my Romney's
inside the Congress parties and then the
fact that the drama Yahoo has actually
attacked the jr. saying that Darius was
a beating off the ESC and even though
all that he went on to say that the has
been genius was done for you are they
had to put all those things aside and
align with the JD s to form this
government but at the end of the day
there are allegations from the Congress
that the Kumaraswamy government is
walking away with all the accolades
it's only a couponer Swamy is a very
often or he's taking all the credit
okay with us we have s Prakash a leader
the BJP also joining us on music's s
Prakash how do you react to this this
statement coming in from HT Kumarasamy
America is cracking we have been saying
that it is the sitaramayya
and the Congress and believes are trying
to teach supplies the commercial millets
government but we were attacked by
sitaramayya saying that we are indulging
in operation table but today their own
his own Congress MLAs are making
uncharitable remark against the Chief
Minister and they claim it is Sitarama
even today this has prompted mr. kuhmo
economy to offer to step down
immediately
if they do not wish to continue him and
this clearly shows the two political
parties it had come together only to
grab power in turn after though they did
not have the power major majority or the
mandate two days they are crumbling
under their own weight
Ryden and is this something then that
the BJP plans to highlight mr. Prakash
in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections no
no you don't have to so long completely
gone there is no government in Karnataka
people are suffering there are 108 son
of seven declared as the dodge hit the
shot hit but the no relief worker
started all missiles there is only the
Madeira poisoning all these places to
review de process they are men but sadly
the government is only busy
in saving their own power feet and not
least interest on the people governing

watching musics our big focus on the
program today in news X running a 50-day
campaign to place an important reality
on the national agenda the Lewton grab
that's taking place at temples across
the country from tamil nadu to Telangana
to Karnataka we brought two cases that
have exposed the greed which runs
through the system from top to bottom
from the Babu's and government offices
to the temple authorities and priests
running our age-old heritage greed and
apathy has resulted in the loot of
temple land for petty profit we bring to
you now the case of an ancient Shiva
temple
representing at least a thousand years
of Hindu heritage which has lost acres
of sacred temple land to the greed of
those responsible for preserving and
protecting the temple the courts have
once again stepped in to deliver justice
we're adding to the chaos is the apathy
of the Babu's sitting in government
offices were let it be a failed to
restore the land even though it's been
brought to their notice take a look at
this detailed report

land sold and encroached for greed and

the fifth temple on the new sects list
is the Winkies for a temple in Chennai
situated in the neighborhood of
Vadapalani the Greece where a temple is
believed to be one of the oldest Hindu
temples in India as per reports the
sternum of the temple dates back to the
Vedic Ages while the temple structure
itself is about a thousand years old
this ancient Hindu temple is dedicated
to Lord Shiva also known as Lord when
geese were and goddess santhu nike
humble an elephant back or gut brush the
type of Ramana the NGO forums around the
temple represents architecture from the
time of the chola dynasty
a tall Flagstaff known as the Bali
Pithom and the nun diamond the firm are
situated facing towards the temple
shrine with a grand entrance crowned
with a massive raja gopuram adorned with
several stucco images the Wendy's Fela
temple is a magnificent marble
representing Hindu heritage but it has
fallen prey to alleged neglect greed and
apathy of temple authorities and Babu's
sitting in government offices alike
musics launched its investigation and
this is what we found
what was supposed to be sprawled over 14
acres has now allegedly been reduced to
a mere 2.5 several commercial spaces and
homes have come upon temple and what's
even more shocking is the curious case
of the missing temple tank we are right
outside
but apparently Winkies for a temple a
famous temple that is situated in the
heart of the city and only 50 meters
from here there was a simple tank which
is covering more than two point eight
six acres has disappeared but this has
happened for almost a decade ago so far
the temple tank has not been identified
because more than 26 residential plots
and commercial establishments are
sitting over that temple tank this came
to light after a pl was filed by a
petitioner before the Madras High Court
seeking to retrieve the temple land the
HR nce Department which is responsible
for the Temple Square in Tamil Nadu has
accepted and acknowledged before the
madras high court stating yes there was
a tank and now that has disappeared the
HR and sea department has given a
clarification before the Madras High
Court stating a trustee
Harry DeFreitas tree who was with the
temple has converted the temple land
into a commercial plot and have sold the
land for commercial purposes yes the
Madras High Court has heard the petition
and has ordered the hits RNC Department
to retrieve the land to clear all the
encroachments on the water body but so
far nothing has moved from the order
it's almost more than six months now
that the buildings and the residential
complex still sit on the tank the HR NC
department has not still acted on the
Madras High Court's order
have a look at this report from August
2018 it alleges that the temple tank and
Wendy sweater is now a parking lot the
same report further alleges that the
temple tank came under the scanner when
the trustee was found selling temple
property back in 1987 as for the same
report after years of legal hassles a
fresh lawsuit was filed by the
petitioner
Jamin Raj and the matter is now in the
Madras High Court
so the alleged sale of temple property
began at least 30 years ago for three
decades the temple trustee who was
responsible for taking care of the land
has been allegedly selling off portions
bit by bit we also found this report
from July 2018 which alleges that the
Madras High Court had directed the HR NC
department through removing Crozier's
from the temple tank and restore it the
report further alleges that the temple
tank spread over two point six acres of
land is now buried deep beneath 26
residential and five commercial
buildings there's another report from
July 2018 this alleges that the temple
banks cease to exist in 2004 when a
former trustee of the temple managed to
get a civil court order reclassifying
the tank as a residential plot it
further alleges that the agency in
commissioner was not informed however
look at section 34 of the HR NC act it
clearly states that any enhance sale or
mortgage of temple property is null and
void unless it is sanctioned by the
endowments commissioner it further
empowers the commissioner to take a call
on whether this exchange is necessary
and beneficial to the institution
so how did a temporal trustee manage to
allegedly reclassify the land as a
residential clock without anybody in the
endowments Dept getting a whiff of the
entire matter it's all highly suspicious
[Music]
another report further alleges that one
of the hereditary trustees of the temple
transferred the land to a third party
who filled up the tank and made
constructions the temple trustee was
allegedly expelled and proceedings were
initiated against him during the course
of the investigation we also came across
this online petition that was started to
recover the temple sank this petition
alleges that the wife of the dismissed
trustee is now a trustee of the temple
so here's what we know Wendy's Fuhrer
temple is at least a thousand years old
located in Chennai in Tamil Nadu it is
dedicated to Lord Shiva the temple tank
has gone missing it has been alleged
that have been trustee of the temple
reclassified the temple land and sold it
for commercial purposes as per reports
the 26 residential buildings and five
commercial buildings have come upon the
temple tank the temple trustee was
expelled and proceedings against him
were initiated the case is under way in
the Madras High Court which in 2018
directed the eight RNC to get the land
vacated and restored the current status
of the order is still not known
an ancient shiva temple representing at
least a thousand years of Hindu heritage
has lost acres of sacred temple land to
the greed of those responsible for
preserving and protecting it the courts
have once again stepped in to deliver
justice but adding to the chaos is the
apathy of the baubles who allegedly have
failed to restore the land even though
it has been dropped to their notice this
is only one case of temple landing loss
to breed from hundreds across India
this is only one case of those managing
temple trusts allegedly profiting from
the sale of acres of sacred Hindu land
we don't intend to stop here we are
putting these cases that have been
gathering dust on the national agenda if
washing musics for more
people trustees and government officials
to sell parts of India's heritage for
petty profit but powerful and rich
people to lie accused of stealing
India's temple heritage yes this is all
part of the news ex-special save our
temples campaign the bubbles seem to be
working hand in glove
nunna I've arrested none of the
irreplaceable idols ever recovered so
much so that the investigating officers
don't even show up in court no case file
has ever produced the Madras High Court
in its judges the only defenders of

whereabouts of the IO and even the case

now given the go-ahead for the arrest of
the IO if the law permits and the bottom
line has been highlighted by the bench
which says that the patience of the
court must not be used to flout orders
in a divine place orders passed by the
court must be implemented in true spirit
idols stolen no action taken and even
the investigating officer is either so
nonchalant or under pressure that he
refuses to show up the courts of this
land having to threaten contempt to help
save Indian temples
this is the copper lease for a temple in
Chennai in Tamilnadu situated in
Mylapore
it's believed that this temple was built
in the 10th century by the Vijayanagar
kings in Dravidian architecture a 180
foot tall gopuram towers the street on
which the temple sits the two entrances
to the temple are marked with go poems
on either side the east copper room is
about 40 meters high while the smaller
west gopuram faces the sacred can
protank this at least thousand year old
temple in tamil nadu is dedicated to
Lord Shiva legend has it that God is uma
worship Shiva in the form of a peacock
or mild as it's called Enfamil thus
giving rise to the name mile up or to
the city that developed around this
temple it is this peacock Idol inside
the sanctum sanctorum of the shrine
which represents a legend that finds a
mention in the Puranas and it is this
peacock Idol which has now become the
center of a major controversy as it's
fallen prey to the alleged greed of
temple authorities government Babu's and
industrialists have a look at this
report from July 2018 it alleges that
the HRM C Department promised to launch
a probe into claims made by devotees of
the Capelli's for a temple alleging that
the infamous peacock Idol has gone
missing the report further alleges that
the stone Idol of the peacock was
replaced with a fake in 2004 when it was
damaged the issue came to light after it
was mentioned by RTI activists in an
affidavit it has been alleged that the
old peacock statue had a flower on its
peak but the idol that now sits in the
temple has a snake during the course of
our investigation News X found a stone
flock inside the temple which allegedly
contains a replica of the original
peacock Idol it is this stone which
allegedly serves as proof that the
original peacock Idol had a flower on
its beak and not a snake
seen in the peacock idol that currently
resides in the temple but as per this
report the HR NC department claims there
is no concrete proof to substantiate
these claims as not everyone can enter
the sanctum sanctorum we are right
outside the world-renowned kapaleeswarar
temple here in Mylapore chennai
thousands of devotees come to this
temple to offer prayers and as a part of
our self hindu temple campaign today
from kapaleeswarar temple there is an
allegation that a peacock statue which
is very much inside that temple campus
has been replaced by a new statue in the
month of in the year of 2004 the
centuries-old peacock statue has been
replaced with the news of peacock statue
the old peacock statue the centuries-old
because statue will have a flower in its
week but this time that statue that has
been replaced has a snake in its beak so
this is the allegation that the various
activists are rising and even they asked
that the HR and si department should be
held responsible for what has happened
inside the temple and more bizarre
tourists at HR and city officials still
maintain even before the Madras High
Court they maintained that they have
lost all the documents which is relating
to the cap additional temple and the
idols and statue inside the temple so
they couldn't verify whether the statue
which is inside the temple that peacock
statue the century gold because statue
is the same old statue or something
which has been replaced after 2004 still
this case is pending before the Madras
High Court even when the case came up
for hearing yesterday before the Madras
High Court the there are clear
directives from the Madras High Court to
probe into this allegations that have
been put forth by the activists but even
now the head shot and see officials are
not obeying the directives of Madras
High Court and even Madras High Court
has pulled up the officials from H R and
C to probe this incident and bring out
the truth where to find out whether the
statue which is inside the temple is
centuries old or something
replaced after 2004 ever since the news
of the current Idol allegedly being fake
came out the Idol ring of the CID
launched an investigation into the
matter and named after name has been
probed the chief accused in the case as
for this report from August 2018 is the
chairman of a prominent corporate he had
moved for anticipate Rhee bail and was
guaranteed by the idol ring that he
won't be arrested for six weeks the same
report alleges that the petitioner who
had moved the court in this case claims
that the state government had
constituted a Kohli through Pawnee
committee to conduct renovations in
various temples the corporate honcho was
allegedly a member of this committee
giving him access to the temple we also
found this report from August 2018
acclaimed sculptor M Mathias the fatty
approached the Madras High Court for
anticipatory bail in the case filed
against him charging him with theft of
the ancient peacock Idol the idol wing
of the CID said that they will not
arrest him for 4 weeks but the same man
according to a report from math 2018 was
arrested by the idol wing of the police
on charges of manipulating the casting
of an important Idol to replace the
presiding deity at the thandayuthapani
Swamy temple again in 2004 the same
report alleges that the hidden agenda
was to make the public believe that the
replica was the original and removed the
original Idol under the pretext that it
was damaged so that it could be smuggled
out of the country to be sold at an art
gallery
according to this report in October 2018
the chief stoppeth II or chief official
at the HR NCE was questioned as per this
report the executive officer of
kapaleeswarar temple in 2004 stopped at
the end thermocol told the investigating
officer that she wasn't responsible for
statues in the shrine fast forward to
December 2018 and this report alleges
that the same HR NC official enter
mughal was granted conditional bail
after she was arrested by the idol wing
of the CID an ancient Hindu idols
thousands of years of heritage and it's
allegedly gone missing all those
involved in the process of protection
and preservation cry coolest Ness while
the courts continue to demand answers in
September last year this report claims
that the Madras High Court came down
heavily on the priests of the companies
for a temple for their laxity in
reporting cases of idol theft so here's
what we know the companies were a temple
in Mylapore is at least a thousand years
old
a peacock idol in the temple has
allegedly been replaced with a fake in
2004 the chief accused in the case is a
chairman of a prominent corporate who
applied for anticipate rebuild while an
acclaimed Indian sculptor M Mathias the
party has also been accused of idol
theft t2 is on anticipate rebel at RNC
officials and the executive officer of
the temple enter model was questioned
but she claimed that she is not
responsible she was later arrested by
the idol wing of the CID and is now out
on bail the matter continues under the
Madras High Court in the latest
development reports allege that the
investigating officer is now missing the
court has given the go-ahead to arrest
the IO but the status of the allegedly
missing ancient peacock Idol is still
unknown
so powerful and rich people lie accused
of stealing India's temple heritage the
Babu seemed to be working hand in glove
none are ever arrested none of the
irreplaceable idols ever recovered
so much so that the investigating
officers don't even show up in court no
case file is ever produced the Madras
High Court and it judges the only
defenders of India's heritage left
threatening contempt cases to have their
writ followed this is the state of the
loot of India's heritage this is why
news X is committed to putting this on
the national agenda keep watching for

pro quo fare the allegation is that
chunga Koecher extended 3,200 piece of
loan 250 account
despite red flags being raised by
several Bank members and more
importantly when video porn owner and
promoter had in fact bought into deeper
culture to the poachers husband's
company let's get in our team of
reporters let's get in our team of
reporters both Abhishek ona as well as
strategy on this story as I said it was
a clear case of quid pro quo that was
being poked first internally by the CBI
by ICICI then by semi and then of course
now it is the investigative agencies who
first find a pea last year that is
preliminary inquiry and now have filed
an FYI let's quickly now play out a
ground report that's been filed by over
she Cunha from the outside one of those
locations where raids were conducted
this is a building where new power
alright as over she was outside one of
those locations where rates were
conducted what a fall what a fall from
grace for Chanda Kochhar to the big hero
in India anchor and from there she's now
of course be named in the FI R by CBI
remember she was one of the longest
standing CEOs of ICICI Bank one of the
biggest success stories of India Inc
from there she's gone on to now being
named as the F as one of the accused
India fire by CBI let's get him in fact
an update as far as what really does the
fyr say does name several individuals
let's get Meenakshi - Phyllis ain't no
hangman option managed to get an
exclusive copy of the FI odd that copy
is right here and of course trouble
coach and the culture seems to be
increasing Chanda Kochhar has been named
as an accused in this Fi are the copy of
cfir
is right here in front of you remember
cbi from the morning had been
investigating our various offices off
Videocon and by the evening or trouble
of course mounting fortune the quota she
has been named in this fi are here is
the exclusive a copy of the FI are in

executive officer and the quota she is
of course the former CEO of ICICI and of
course from the morning there had to be
in reads or which were conducted on
various offices of video corn and
written by now by the evening of course
news came that Chanda Kochhar has been
booked and an exclusive copy of fi are
now available with news X which shows
how to and the culture has been named as
an accused in the ICICI video corn alone
chief all right believe it they have
enough should preciate you joining us on
that story as I said earlier as well the
case is quite simple that is being
proved of quid pro quo and there you can
see on your screens those companies that
have been named as far as the route in
which that the money changed hands why
is it that shall de quarter is in the
door for a quid pro quo essentially
making it very simple amidst the web of
companies that you can see on your
screen is that Chanda Kochhar husband
deeper poacher had founded the company
which was very large stake was bought by
Venugopal booth at a time when 3200
rupees of loan was dispersed to his
company even though red flags were
raised by several good in ICICI Bank
that is the quid pro quo allegations
against Chanda Kochhar joining us now
from outside one of those locations were
age took place earlier in the day is
over she Kona
oversea as we were saying that while of
course investigations are underway it is
one of the biggest cases of crony
capitalism coming to light
this a complete a case of you know such
type is out now
however the allegations are completely
different side of agency they come out
and say that how the loans were given to
the private companies and for our own
interest and this was done by cheating
ICICI Bank well in fact we are since
morning
one after another spot we are just
visiting we visited bkc at the capital
by the new power energy a private energy
officer there we saw that how to
officers where are their and conducting
searches electrons office currently an
act metal card now this particular whole
building on 17th floor or it is aware
the new profile roots our boutique on
company is there and over here CBI
officers are still inside as what we
understand yet there's no word from the
site of whether profile or when he tried
to contact him up within yes the CBI is
conducting searches over here is what we
understand there I do tell three places
in Mumbai where the searches are
conducted and one particular place is
from or in the bath in ordering about
there is a manufacturing unit offer
Videocon industries where again to CBI
officers are under thin searches now
this all start I almost have to ten
months of preliminary query how we see
that today a fire it was in fact on 22nd
January was the fire when she stood
against not only these three people that
is Chandler hotel
Lipa for chair and even for file Booker
then also our that nine people are
related to their companies now very
clear message is region or the the whole
a fire comes out and says that out there
was a criminal conspiracy that was
hatched right the allegation yes
absolutely
the allegation criminal conspiracy
charges have been deviled against the
quarters and remains to be seen what
happens in this case going forward as I
said this is one of the biggest cases of
crony capitalism coming to light and as
I said fall from grace for chaga culture
and you know only she as of course now
the investigation is gaining pace while
of course the P was filed last year
raids have taken place today
it's interesting how soon can of course
and what will be the pace at which this
investigation goes from here
see it's also fun this time that seems
yours or the transactions were taking
place and that doing closed off an
almost more than three thousand rolls of
witness so our CBI as an agency was
coming out in fact our when having board
with some of the CP officers they came
up and said that now in certain years
level very heavy transactions that
happen so to go through the one after
another all the transaction details that
happen between booths and poachers or
was something which was very important
before coming out and we'll just fill
the case of instant why yes for
interrogation they were called again and
again they were called n number of times
by CBI in Bandra Kurla complex where the
CIA headquarters of Mumbai are there and
then are later on sorted after
preliminary inquiry now the case has
been registered
it is also to see that how in while
coming out of it this whole a fire or
that he knew six of access in an extra
be there is a complete detail of what
CBI has to come out and see on their
side the allocations that they come out
and say in fact the suspected or friends
on all of them is as we are clearly
mentioned of criminal conspiracy
cheating public servant taking illegal
gratification undue advantage criminal
misconduct by public servant and abuse
of official position by public servant
so all these charges are clearly comes
out and explain everyone's role in it
you talk about the culture you talk
about gender coaching you talk about a
clinical file the allegations are
completely clear and then there are
series there is whole series of the way
things happen by CGI in the whole
initially that was attached and then
detailed way they came out they could
have come out and said that how in here
this all happened during 2009 to October
or 2000 level when I see I see a band

give your best
just that people should appreciate your
things whatever you have done so and the
most of I would say not challenging but

BJP in Kolkata under the initiative of
the Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee the
Prime Minister had launched a caustic
attack during his visit to Dada and
Nagar Haveli more the gutter bunsen
Prime Minister had said that the parties
are coming together because they're
scared of the BJP now Congress president

and after West Bengal the poll focus
seems to have shifted to Tamil Nadu it
all started with FK MK Stalin who had
taken a small u-turn while pitching for
Rahul Gandhi as is 2019 prime
ministerial candidate remember when he
spoke on the behalf of the people of
Tamil Nadu as this is happening
our sister newspaper has learned that
she Tom's eagerness to push karthi's
prospect in his Bastion she begun our
constituency may have led to Congress
settling for about six seats in the
state as the form of finance minister is
turning it into Congress's may
negotiator for the Alliance till now

month in January as well as February his
alliance prospects with EPS is
conducting a host of meeting to fix a
AIADMK s alliance plans for the pool but
a AIADMK so far has not come out as far
as alliance in 2019 is concerned it's
keeping its cards closed and moving on
now
after West Bengal's show of strength the
2019 election focus seems to have
shifted to Tamilnadu major developments
are unfolding from the southern state it
all started with stuns big claim
despite asserting that the opposition
parties will decide their prime
ministerial candidate after 2019 he
justified that his pitch for Rahul
Gandhi as Prime Minister was a
reflection of Tamil Nadu people's
mindset particularly luckily nobody man

story of the negotiations between DMK
and the Congress party
with DMK and Congress here in Tamilnadu

to be believed what we're hearing it
from the DMK sources is that the DMK has
decided to give ten plus two seats to
congress where the MK will be contesting
in most of the seats as say as it senses
that there is a very strong and two
increments he has set in the state and
it will favor the DM gate to win the
majority of the seats Prime Minister
Modi's all set to visit Tamil Nadu next
month a complete by the BJP top brass
Prime Minister Modi will look to
finalize their alliance in the state
which he claimed he was open to here all
parties for when the BJP won a majority
on its own we prefer to run the
government with our allies we cherish
our old friends and our doors are always
open for parties but more than all these
political issues the braining alliance
each and alliance with the people but
uncertainty looms over a ADM case plans
EPS has dropped out a strategy after
holding range of meetings
race for Tamilnadu is getting tighter
his talent ready to stand with Rahul
Gandhi throughout as claimed or is he
putting on 2019 elections to decide this
Modi have an ace up his sleeve in
Tamilnadu Bureau report musics moving on
now the interim budget on 1st of
February could be bringing chairs for
tax payers in the country with an eye on
election for now he's expected to double
the income tax exemption limit from 5
lakh rupees from 2.5 lakh rupees
existing to 5 lakh rupees now the
government may all flounce reinstatement
of tax-free status for medical expenses
and transport allowance the move is also
expected to placate the middle class
amid the possibility of a backlash in
the elections
[Music]
millions suffered from the sudden change
in currency ordered by Prime Minister
Modi in September 2016 and the recent
successful surgeon fuel prices burnt a
hole in the Armada nice pocket in the
interim budget to be announced on
February 1st right ahead of elections
all efforts will be on by the centre to
appease the masses the text limit has to
go up from 2.5 next to 5 lakhs 8 lakhs
10 lakhs
how will we will desire for 10 lakhs but
we are expecting that it will minimum go
to 5 lakhs and what better way to do so
than to dole out a tax holiday to the
average tax speculation is right that
the Finance Ministry may remove tax labs
for those earning salaries of up to 8
lakh rupees per annum this step may be
taken in likelihood in the backdrop of
the economically weaker sections quota
announced by the centre in the
Parliament other budget tax
possibilities include tax holiday for
the in group of 2 peas 10 lakh or less
this will result in a huge relief to the
middle income group in the Earth's
current fiscal deficit sounds at three
point three percent of the g6 locked
rows on the other hand RBI deployed the
reserves are anywhere between one lakh
to three Lac rose there is going to be a
full-fledged budget because just before
the elections you don't have the mandate
to lay down the economic policy for rest
of the year the question we are asking
is this Prime Minister Modi going to
deliver a big ticket to leave to the
middle class in a bid to go populist
ahead of the big chair election she
expecting another tax lab reject or a
stunning rani a tax holiday but more
importantly can india really afford to
give the average taxpayer attacks Julia

at India is not willing to engage with
Pakistan this was in sharp contrast to
Pakistan's foreign minister Shah
Mahmood Croatia's earlier statement
where he had said that India's
cooperation would be required in
Afghanistan
due to its residents and presence as far
as Afghanistan is concerned now India
has hit back at Pakistan statement with
Foreign Secretary Rajesh Kumar saying
that Pakistan cannot decide on behalf of
India as India as a sovereign country
also adding that Pakistan must
introspect on its own role and
responsibilities as far as Afghanistan
is concerned and put an end to the
cross-border terrorism from Pakistan

Deepika Chopra and our focus right now
some breaking information coming in on
the story that we've been bringing you
on the homeless leader Zamir Hemmer has
now confirmed of a brow in the eager
term resort he says that small fights
happen between friends and that is
common and he further says that on
seeing the Emily that we've been talking
about has sustained small injuries to
his eyes and his further confirmed that
P Manik Ganesh and dancing were involved
in a small fight so that brow that
happened in the Eagleton Resort has now
been confirmed as a mere Emma's we also
have the minister on record let's hear
that sound bite before we take the story
forward nothing is happening they're all
friends Biman is and completion agenda
Nancy something little little something
under the tree something has gone wrong
and there you've heard it that is
Congress he does Amir Emeth confirming
the news my colleague Harish apatheia
joins us live on the broadcast
Harish absolutely shocking what's going
on
well it's been a huge embarrassment for
the Congress party and they've been
trying to cover it up since morning
but the kind of reasons and statements
that came out made it very clear that
it's been a shoddy job at covering up
that entire incident first you add
acacia Kumar saying that Allen Singh has
gone for a wedding then when it became
very clear that Alan sing indeed was
admitted to Apollo Hospital in Sheshadri
forum in the city other leaders who came
and said including DK serration said
that up Allen Singh had this suffered
chest pain and that's why he was
admitted to the hospital later on other
scheme and said that he was fine and all
these things and finally now Sameera
mirth coming out and saying that yes
there was some altercation between Bhima
Naik on insane and complete on ish and
it's routine it happens when there are
friends who get together trying to
justify saying there was no such serious
injury there was just an injury to his
eye and there was no serious injury that
required stitches was I mean I'm at
answer a statement but nonetheless it
exposes formulas sadly for two reasons
one for the last week or so we had seen
the Congress party taking a moral high
ground saying that we haven't want to
resort the BJP has gone to a resort
during time of drought in the state now
one the Congress went to resort and
later on such scenes coming out of
legislatures involving in a brawl run
control three MLAs from the Volare
district in such a behavior and such a
bad job at covering it up by the
Communist Party really exposing the
Congress leadership as well and the kind
of bickering that's been on within the
Congress party right would absolutely
Harish that is of course number on
what's really going on and the fact that
as you mentioned with the Congress's
doing a rather shoddy job of even
covering it up what's going on in the
resort between all of those emily's and
particularly those three emily's who
were in fact engulfed in that drought
with the
fact of the matter is who's working then
it seems that everybody all the amylase
are locked up in a resort so who's
really working for the people of
Karnataka
exactly the opposition emily is in
Goodrem some of whom have come back
yesterday and congress Emily's at least
75 of them in the resort the question
that one really needs to ask is who will
take care of people in 155 districts
that have been declared rounded one
second there is a budget session that's
all coming up at the six so as we speak
there will be preparations happening for
the budget duties emily is even care to
go and ask the chief minister to
allocate some funds or any specific
project to the constituency is that
happening at all is another question
many are raising right absolutely hurry
stay on with us are dr. Berman Shari of
the BJP is also joining us on the
broadcast so right here now Congress
leaders Emir Hamad has confirmed that
route did take place between three of
its emily's but the Congress say is that
you know this is just a small issue and
such fights happen between friends it's
common what do you have to say to that
okay if we can fix that line with dr.
Bachman oh sorry so my question was that
now a Congress leader has come out and
in a way he's confirmed without a fight
who did take place between three of the
Amelia's were locked up in Eagleton
Resort he says that he's justifying it
seeing that it's common between friends
how do you respond to that forum in
their loyalty if you it is not a good
thing they chose this whole fighting
started and I think and we show that
Congress is not a United Party it's
exciting right but Sir the Congress's
allegation is that they having to resort
to you know resort politics because of
the BJP and its attempts to consistently
topple the government in Karnataka how
do you then respond to that
those allegations clearly and much much
before all those six seven days back
when we were in a national and q2 as
daddy we refused the message that the
moment we go back to Kannada time some
of the emulation report precaution now
you can can only keep blaming other but
what is happening in their own party let
them see it because they are in power
they are expected to deliver then there
is loss of 154 sonica they're sitting in
the resort then even in opposition
we went there to protect y so that's
precisely the points that we're also
trying to raise yeah why can't both the
sides just quit this resort politics and
actually get back to work who's working
for the people of Karnataka you can just
shift the blame on the Congress now and
say that you know they've since they are
in power they shouldn't be locking up
their Emily as in a resort and we were
also doing the same because we wanted to
protect our leaders what is going on and
who's amid all of this working actually
for the state we take a little ice every
minute she'll come back there already
started working in the field our
villages are going to rocket a new car
and we have started working it was only
a precaution we took yes the government
which perform which does not have
problems the government and other party
problem they should perform their
government their officials their power
instead of that they say that we weren't
15 minutes
which is unfair you have intelligence
you have all the police force can you
not prevent your Emily from being put
this also shows not only that your party
is not enlightened that administration
itself is very loose and you can't do
anything in Karnataka okay thank you so
much for joining us on the broadcast I
was I've I'm gonna show you off the BJP
now saying that the Congress is unable
to keep its emily's together and that
shows that the party itself does not
have a clear plan let me go back let me
open Harish once again Harish before we
had that phone call we were of course
discussing the price that Karnataka is
paying because of this resort politics
and it's absolutely maddening
absolutely 156 tarrlok's halted on the
8th of February when the Chief Minister
is likely to present his budget all the
electorate the citizens would be
expecting that their MLAs would be one
looking after what is the kind of POD
route relief measures that are being put
in place 156 tarrlok's second they would
be holding parlors and discussions with
the chief minister on what is the kind
of funding projects that will be given
to their constituency but we have here
one set of legislators who are in Delhi
who just returned yesterday and now the
BJP is up having a huge a plan of having
a drought assessment for a good week
they did not remember that state had
drought and on the other hand you have
another set of families who are
involving or indulging in a drunken
brawl in a resort outside Bangalore all
this playing out in the scheme the ex
Chief Minister of the state is I believe
