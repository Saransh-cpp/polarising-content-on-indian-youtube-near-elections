good morning you know in terms of for
the number of seats money people
contributes to of the elected the looks
at my MPs but it clearly contributes to
a you know a larger narrative of the
Northeast's contribution to the larger
narrative political narrative across
India how is the political fight panning
out there
good morning Shia up for the outer money
put a seat the election will be held in
helding tomorrow and we have been told
that the polling parties had have been
displaced day before yesterday because
there in the far-flung areas the polling
offices have to travel at least 6 to 7
hours on foot and maybe on the local
transport called shaktimaan so that's
number one
secondly three helicopters has been
deployed to airlift no polling officers
in any emergency that is them that is
that is another facility which has been
provided although all the hospitals and
cooling stations are on high alert
security arrangements has been beefed up
in in the last few years we have been
told that there are 227 critical polling
stations and 171 vulnerable polling
stations where the use of muscle power
and money has been detected in the past
and Election Commission has time and
again instructed the the returning
offices as well as the bellows to take
care of all these things for the first
time Shia
I have been told that I am ready
campaign was long by the Election
Commission and if I can show you that
some of the some of the voting campaign
which is the Election Commission has
launched in how to cast your vote on
EVMs and Vivi pads and I have been told
also that there is a mobile app which
has been developed by the Election
Commission and the polling efficient has
just to press one red button if there is
any kind of malfunction in the Vivi pack
or EVM and that that will be immediately
replaced and and we know that this is
Election Commission's office and
arrangements have been meant for further
for the webcasting from all the critical
and vulnerable polling stations that I
have just just told so terrific
arrangement almost 17,000 police police
stations a policeman including the CRPF
and Assam Rifles have been required
almost 40,000 state and central
officials are actually all geared to
contact the free and fair fair poll in
this state and and all the political
parties and now geared up to face the
elections and you know this is the
sporting nation and issues of Elektra
education health infrastructure women's
security and corruption are the core
issues on which this election is going
to be fought okay I'll just stay with us
I'll go across to Monaco and who's
joining us from konima good morning
money can't
you know it said the mana calm that
another never forgets and rarely
forgives and obviously political parties
will remember it this election season
there is more about the electoral fight
panning out to bear in the state
sure I've been meeting the people across
the spectrum I've been talking to the
state bureaucrats the common people
political party leaders and on I find
there is something very strange here in
the sense that they do feel their
connection to former prime minister atal
bihari vajpayee
in advertently in all of their
conversations the name will crop up what
they think that they're they think that
it was mr. buzzby who did a lot for them
in the northeastern region which was
quite a neglected but this time the
disconnect is the citizenship amendment
bill they are apprehensive of the fact
that once this comes into force they
will be the victim of this CA be they
they have been talking to the people and
telling them about and in fact the local
leaders are talking about the thing that
they will be the first victims as you
know the citizen share permanent bill
that was put in Parliament in 2016 and
was passed by cabinet in January this
year has created a lot of apprehensions
in the mind of people across the
northeastern region it's just not only
Nagaland it so many Porter's main
highlights are natural as all everywhere
people are talking about even as some
you say there have been irritation and
let me tell you that all the BJP leaders
across all these estates have opposed
this bill they are not in favor of this
bill and they have they have told their
leadership in Delhi that they don't want
this CIB to come into force so that
point is also there
apart from that let me tell you once
again that NP F has been a dominant
force in nagaland politics of course
also are in manipul politics it has
always been supportive of BJP for the
last 15 years it came into being in 2002
and since then it has been supporting
BJP but for the first time NP F is not
fielding
its own candidate neither is supporting
BJP but
has gone on to support the archival
Congress well mister KLCC is a candidate
he has been also the former Chief
Minister of nagaland but NP F and an NDP
p.m. I think the present chief minister
of foreign a garland mr. Deford you he
was in was and PF leader he formed and
EPP and came to Papa not and EPP he's an
ally of for NDA yes and BJP and these
parties are working together given the
development plank in the state one could
see that it has really taken now you see
the duma poll question i wrote which is
the main road from the mainland you
could see the d my poster Vanya plane
area that Nagaland has it was very
difficult to cross that area because
there's a single door when I came to
kohima through that word I could see
that for landing was on it was something
like a dream come true for the people of
nagaland because that's the only way to
connect other things given the
electricity education and all that or
the local level I think people do not
have any any thing to complain about
what do they what they think is the is a
citizenship remarkable which could
affect them sure okay I'll go across to
new tendrá methane Drano in terms of the
importance of the constituency of which
avala it does play an important role in
the national narrative because it houses
several small and medium industries and
it is also home to Asia's largest
automobile industry so obviously there
will be concerns there for the waters
especially the first time waters there
the young boaters there or going out and
looking out for jobs for them this
election will be a very important one
isn't it what are the concerns of the
people there mr. Thorpe a - a young
voter will kill you both but is novel

wanna come in second yeah him in second
here right I'll go across to RJ RJ you
know anybody who goes to the Northeast
would know that it is culturally a
matriarchal society and obviously I show
centering around women will take center
stage in this election to what are the
women voters saying there have you been
able to talk to them absolutely out of
almost 19 lakh voters
10 lakhs 10 lakhs 10 lakhs are voters
and a number of women voters are more
than the men and that's why it is said
that where the students and and women
thinks that politics goes in the same
direction for the outer Manipur
seat Shriya the Benjamin Mata who is the
BJP candidate it has been Ellis that the
cookie the cookie naga leaders are
actually supporting them in the hills
but that's the advantage BJP but when it
comes to the Congress candidate mr.
James it has been LS bias the PSU Bank
PNB which has written actually to the
Election Commission that he has
defaulted 100 core of loan taken from
the padam National Bank so these are the
center these are local politics this is
going on but you cannot you're right in
saying that the cultural issues are very
much important and that's why you cannot
you cannot avoid the 40% Naga population
in the outer Manipur said we didn't
actually have decided to support the BJP
so BJP has an advantage in the matter
out of money crusade but as we as we
understand that the women are very
important and the surgeon ship amendment
bill is very very crucial for this state
and everybody is not talking up front on
this issue everybody wants that this
bill should not be allowed to come and
it should I should heart the local
sentiment of the people so these are
some of the issues of the women but
women's security and corruption are the
core issues when it comes to the female
voters out here sure okay Manik on do
you know the same question to you there
are women voters and there are
first-time voters the young voters out
there what are they feeling what are
their concerns what are they looking for
in this election in this year's election
sure is a very good thing here in
Northeast that women are already
empowered as you already know and people
jokingly say that if anybody needs
empowerment it's meant for because
everything belongs to who they win for
here that's a really very very
heartening thing here
secondly the coming about the new voters
this time more than 16,000 new voters
have been added to the laid list sugar
it may seem to you that were just 16,000
but this expression is not valid here
because 16,000 is a huge number in a
difficult terrains of nagaland to go to
them have your sweep activities as the
Election Commission carried out in a
very innovative way there were hundreds
and thousands of rallies for that
election comes on saw to it that they
get the awareness gets to them in every
nook and corner say every hilly terrain
every difficult place and they carried
out in a very successful way what I
learned from the press here
secondly the there was an urban apathy
when I spoke to mr. widgets in her chief
electoral officer of nagaland he also
admitted that there was some kind of
urban apathy that has also been taken
care of as far as the other college
going students and concerned with the in
certain cases particularly in areas like
dem opera and all I particularly saw
that evidence was little note they were
was in cancer around 20 21 23 years of
his but they are yet to restore
themselves but then also that that thing
has been also taken care of you know the
topography of this state is could be
divided into two parts first the one
plane area in the market which has a
population of around 5 lakhs and the art
of total 12 lakhs you can have another
10 distance of nagaland so the 10
distance of nagaland have around the
same 7 like population okay
the volute is thick that is the on the
plane side and taken from the awesome
side
a publisher has a population of 5 lakhs
dimmable again has a mixed populace of
people from all the 11 states of
nagaland and other parts of the country
of course in Kojima in right there is a
mix also but in other districts there's
no tunnel so the population here by and
large is local you say Nagaland came to
general election for the first time in
1963 and the people were involved in 3
where who super was in Nagaland that
time they were involved has happened in
Assam but in the local elections yes
yeah all the people who were not from
the local tribe or the what had come
from outside may be from Bangladesh even
they got involved it themselves so that
apprehension of what what I told you
about the citizenship amendment bill is
there that if they are the doke will be
pulled out yes of course yeah who have
been enrolled in local municipal
corporation elections and all will they
also be getting the citizenship and will
the inner line in a permit line who will
be abolished no it has been carried
under the constitution article 371 a
that are Nagaland and mana pool has the
special status
it cannot be repealed okay mana
comprehension so people are little
apathetic to elections but it has been
well taken care of for the Election
Commission of India and of course their
local okay all right
money can't be enough to see how that
pans out for the moment I'm short of
time and I will have to thank all of you
three gentlemen for talking to us this

items that may hinder the cure of the

be followed the safety of homeopathic
medicines is well-known still it is
advised to take medicines with the

homeopathic is always safe and people
doesn't create any toxic effect on that
so while you are taking the homeopathic
medicine there should be a gap of 15-20
minutes before the medicine and 15-20
minutes after the medicine do not take
any food taking this period and
otherwise we do not do any restriction
as such but some medicine will rested

hello and welcome to big picture I am
Rochelle de here and today we will talk
about the problem of Naxalism and how
can we continue to fight this problem
now for BSF personnel were killed and
two injured in an encounter with Naxals
in the cockade district of chhattisgarh
on thursday a few hours later on Friday
morning one crpf Chauhan was also killed
and one of his colleague injured in a
gun battle with Naxals in thumb turistic
of Chuckies cut itself according to
security forces Naxals have also
suffered heavy casualties in these
attacks an axle affected Buster looks
about constituency is all set to go for
polls in the first phase on 11th of
April security forces are making all
efforts to ensure any threat of naxal
attack is kept at bay during the polls
approximately 60,000 security personnel
will be on duty in the state of
Chhattisgarh during the polling so what
is the current situation in terms of
containing the Naxal threat and how can
it be tackled effectively and for good
for more on this which ran by a
distinguished panel of guests today let
me start by introducing them to you
beginning with the mr. Anil Chaudhary
former secretary of Internal Security
Ministry of Home Affairs we also have
with us professor Hersh we punt
Distinguished Fellow and head of ahrefs
our strategic studies and then we're
also joined by Miss Prakash Singh of the
former DG of BSF and a well known police
officer let me begin with you mr.
Chaudhary and let's try and understand
the problem of Naxalism in the context
before we go ahead and talk about what
is it that is happening today and how
can we tackle it you shall thank you a
privilege to be on the panel with a
personal like mr. Prakash saying I'll go
talk about the basics of the problem on
Naxalism
see let us start by D probably depriving
tribals who were dependent on forest
produce for their living for essentially
it is the act comes conservation Forest
Act amendment they can't even leave it
all cut crease they can't even cut box
they can't cut cut branches you left
them high and dry and come the Maoist
called the mall
thinkers here is a gun is 5000 B the
month for your families come they have
nothing to lose so the misc
the people in literate masses who are
very gullible
they have been wind to take on Nucks
ilysm where I'll tell you the other
thing is that the Naxalites the Maoist
look for fault lines in our society and
exploit it to the hilt and whereas the
government counts its success by figures
of violence violence has gone down the
police takes a back seat Naxals gaining
strength can't care where this has
happened he's on the fringe of the nut
cell belt in this place and what they
have been penetrated I believe they have
reached dude so now we have to pull our
socks up we have to be vigilant all the
time I have a few more points to make
please ask if there's any question you
want okay you've you know correctly
pointed out how it all started but you
know things have changed a lot view
moved up have you've come a long way
from there in fact if you look at the
data then the recent government data see
is that the red corridor according to
Ministry of Home Affairs chunk from 166
to 90 districts that itself is a very
significant achievement I'll say don't
go by statistics go to the roots of the
problem and other thing is we want to
have successes encounter not slep
operations intelligence timely and
active actionable hold the key the nut
cell move in forest area their movement
is from known to none our police parties
moved in full uniform in the gaze of
everybody so the our technical
intelligence is very weak okay our
technology support to internal security
is non-existent unlike the Defense
Forces which have the Bureau foolishness
surgeon no sorry the DRDO thousand
strong since long we have nothing
and the police the other thing a point I
want to make is that in my view it is
the local police which can fight
terrorism and Naxalism and insurgent -
much better than bring you in
forces from outside army will be the
worst paramilitary forces also border
security forces meant to guard a border
in Pakistan you bring them into the
hinterland CRPF is stretched to its
limits because of elections so you are
now the local police understands the
ethos know the language they know the
topography they can penetrate they can
find out what's happening is so bringing
in troops from outside let us learn
lessons from Andhra Pradesh police which
made huge successes by the Greyhounds
they raised greyhounds and the
greyhounds 20 teams used to go into the
forest there is two zigzag north-south
east-west they didn't know the Nexus
didn't know where they were against team
and communications another problem among
the people there they blow up Tower
cellphones don't work the villages are
not connected so the prop it's not so
simple of problems okay yeah and
politics comes in sorry to say elections
are there they will say no this is sham
democracy elections will not be held
what elections have to be held okay
let's just bring in you know the man
who's been on the ground super casting
mr. Singh
welcome to Raja super television and you
know we would like to know as to how far
have we come in terms of containing the
threat of Naxalism and are these steps
being taken in the right direction
you see mr. Chidambaram during his
tenure as Home Minister he started what
is popularly known as Operation green
hunt that started sometime in our 2010
and there were massive deployment of
security forces in all the natural
affected districts now deployment of
security forces on a on a massive scale
has had its impact and during the last
about nine years or so there has been
considerable containment of the Maoist
audience in about 2010 the total of 223
districts were affected across the
country that number from 223 who has
come down to 90 which is a very very
substantial
reduction in the number of districts
affected in terms of violent incidents
also the incidents have been coming down
every year then you have Central
Committee and Politburo members about 17
of them have either been killed or they
have been arrested in any case
neutralized one way or the other so
there have been significant successes on
several fronts you can say during the
last ten years a number of districts
have come down violence has come down
Senate committee Politburo members are
very much less and the committee in its
internal documents has admitted that it
is it is in a state of what they call
tactical they retreat they are bearing
the brunt of the security forces
offensive so outwardly you can say that
yes we are in the process of containing
natural violence okay but I emphasize
the word outwardly because as far as the
basic causes are concerned what was
mentioned just now is the root causes
those by and large still remain you see
the tribal discontent is at the root of
the problem there has been massive
displacement of tribal population in the
affected states there are no official
figures but according to one NGO but for
crow tribal have been displaced now
that's a huge huge number due to
development projects due to mining due
to deforestation for other reasons
development projects I know
now the relief at rehabilitation policy
is there was was I think it in 2006 they
formed relief and rehabilitation policy
but that has not really been very
successful at the ground level and
displacement of tribal population from
their habitat to other places where they
were struggling for the livelihood this
has been a major cause and really when
you are struggling for livelihood I as
just now pointed out by mr. chaudhary I
mean if somebody comes to you and said
look here is a gun you would join our
ranks will give you five thousand rupees
per month so he is guaranteed livelihood
and on the other hand when he becomes an
axle and he goes to a village he's
treated by the villagers with great
respect
so from mr. nobody he becomes mr.
somebody and who is respected by the
villagers who is feared by a feared and
respected by the villagers okay okay so
let these causes the basic causes have
not been interest and and we have
noticed that you see Chidambaram's
policy had one basic component clear
hold and develop okay what he meant was
that you clear an area of of the mouse
then you sort of hold it and then
administrative control and development
should begin now what we are witnessing
in actual practice is that while the
security forces are able to deliver the
required follow-up from the
administration the administration is
stepping into the vacuum establishing
their network and delivering essential
services to the people that doesn't
happen with reserve that after a few
years we go back to square one
so the there there are very fundamental
problems in our coach okay while
outwardly we are trying to gain control
and we are gaining control but we are
not going to the root of the problem and
the basic grievances remain so much much
needs to be done missing I'll I'll come
back to you let's bring in now you know
a professor Ponte professor Ponte you
know as we heard both the gentlemen and
in terms of you know the work done as
well I was going through the data as
well a lot of for you know work seems to
be done in terms of mobile towers you
know a roads being constant and all that
but if you look at holistically all of
us seem to agree that this is a dual
problem it's as much a social problem as
it is a security threat as well so that
two-pronged strategy which has been
talked about for quite some time that is
seemingly the option it seems to me that
you know it seemingly that's you know in
an ideal world that's how you would
resolve this problem but the issue of
course is that you know what comes first
and how do you go about actually
articulating and operationalizing a
policy that takes you know these two
aspects step by step and I think there
as the two speakers have pointed out we
have had great successes in terms of
what we have been able to accomplish
with our internal security and so far as
Mao is in max ilysm house over you would
define it as concerned
and at the end of the day it's a it's a
question of governance both whether you
look at it from a security perspective
or you look at it from a development
perspective so long as state does not
deliver and deliver in a manner that the
ordinary citizen whether it is the ADI
bossy or whether it is you know any any
or any of us so long as we don't feel
connected to the state in some
fundamental way
I think the any nation will continue and
so the inability of this state to
deliver in some in some quarters of
administrative delivery as well as
larger government governance issues is
clearly a problem but I think also when
we look at the structures and processes
that have been put into place in the
last few years I mean the green hunt was
being talked about and then of course we
have had movement towards you know
whether this government has talked of
aspiration districts for example the
approach towards article you'll find
England these districts which are part
of the Maoist
belt and how do you incorporate them
into those which are more aspirational
where to a certain developmental social
physical and social infrastructure
development can be it can be undertaken
so I think there is a there is a sense
in which the larger public policy in
this country seems to get the neck get
to the number of the problem is getting
the sense of the problem but I think
clearly if you look at you know as you
were saying that if you look at the
numbers for example then the number of
security forces they have been killed in
the last five to six years is
considerably down compared to the number
of Mao's annex and you know Naxalites
who have been either taken on board or
who have been killed neutralized so I
think clearly there is there is some
positive you know movement in in one
direction but if you are looking at you
know changing the very governance
topography of a of a of a part of the
country that have been very very
backward it's not going to happen
overnight okay it's going to take time
but mr. Chaudhary if you look at you
know both things working hand-in-hand
with each other that is the governance
the developmental part of it and
obviously since I somebody is taking up
guns against our the elected government
and that has to be dealt with Stern you
know in Anniston manner as well so the
security person as
both will have to go hand in hand and
there's no doubt about that
we shall I agree with Professor punt
that it's a socio-economic problem
exploitation of the poor which has been
taking the advantage off by the Naxals
think-tank so-called on the other hand
at the point I want to make is that
nowhere in the world
leave aside naturalism nowhere in the
world the problem of insurgency has been
resolved through military and force
action it has to be hand in hand get to
the root of the problem reach out to the
people bring them forward to join the
mainstream in some way give them
vocation let the development take place
that's the way to go ahead and not just
gun them down wherever you find them and
nowhere in the world have it miserable
you take any place even outside it is
you've got to forget the people on board
as long as there's a feeling of
alienation deprivation exploitation this
will be taken advantage of and along
with development those people will also
have need to feel secure and that would
be with the presence of armed forces
they are sure there has to be presence
of armed forces and there has to be
security for those who are peace-loving
would like to remember that's a big
problem but they're scattered the
terrain is such it's such deep forest
Abuja Mara where you cannot see the Sun
see you see and our tactical satellite
imagery our communication intelligence
does not work in that area which holds
the key to finding or where are these
armed groups hiding and get them okay
so armed groups but also we take a
little bit probably let's bring in mr.
Singh here again mr. Singh you know just
a short while back one of our panelists
mr. Chaudhary was talking about how the
local police the State Police will have
to get it it's again you know get its
act together in terms of doing more than
what it is doing right now in tackling
this problem so as a pulley of you know
former police officer what do you
believe needs to be done from the local
police's perspective we have a
paramilitary forces there but from the
local police is a point of view
I'm getting disconnected in between so I
have not heard you fully but still I
will respond I think I broadly
understood what you mean to say you see
I entirely agree that the capabilities
of the State Police have to be enhanced
very substantially enhanced and I firmly
believe that the State Police should be
in a position to tackle the national
problem head-on on the basis of its own
strength and they should not be relying
at present what's happening is that they
think it is centrist baby it is not
their problem it is a national problem
and so the center should deal with it
that seems to be the attitude and the
psychology at the state government level
which is absolutely wrong they must
understand that it is their problem and
they have to tackle it whatever
assistance they want from center will be
given to them but basically they have to
deal with the problem tackle it and get
on top of it that sense of
responsibility I find missing in most of
the states I mean the only state which
which went about it the business
seriously was their state of Andhra
Pradesh I had occasion to see that at
the ground level because I was there in
Andhra Pradesh for more than four months
whenever asked to whenever asked to
inquire into the assassination attempt
of on Chandrababu Naidu and I found that
in every district the district
magistrate and the Superintendent of
Police had some innovative scheme or the
other to to win over the Naxals to win
their hearts and minds they went to the
ground level and they went to the
families of people who had joined Maxell
ranks tried to persuade them to bring
your children back to the mainstream
etcetera etcetera and then their efforts
were supplemented by the by the
Greyhounds so they went about very
systematically but other states I find
mostly they think biocentric a problem
called our NATO home security Cotulla
both State Police now in that classic
Don Towada incident over 75 crpf
personnel were killed just one state
police personnel was killed because that
that was the only strength they had
provided so 775 is to one is that it is
a it should be there 75 and central
forces 25 or 30 but it is absolutely
topsy-turvy the center the states must
realize that it is their baby it is
their problem they have to fight it out
unfortunately I have also noticed and
I'm sorry to say this that some kind of
a vested interest has developed in the
continuance of moist insurrection they
think as long as this thing continues we
will be getting a lot of extra funds
extra allocations extra jeeps extra
manpower water so I mean so they say
ticket charge gentle near-term tyranny
de santurce pesara
I need oh okay that kind of attitude
it's deplorable and reprehensible okay
so the state states will have to do are
much more than what they're doing right
now professor pon do you agree that you
know at the state and specifically the
state machinery in terms of the police
machinery and obviously the local
administration as well we'll have to put
in more efforts will match what the
central government is doing yes and I
think the the modernization of Indian
police is a topic that I think it's so
significant because police after all is
a common man's first point of contact
with the great idea of the state if you
do not have a police service in which
ordinary Indians ordinary citizens can
have faith then I think the real idea of
India itself goes down so and here we
are talking about a group which is being
you know threatened or you know making
to stay alleviated absolutely so I think
that you know you can you can do lots of
things by by bringing streamlining and
the local police and you are not only
signaling a resolve for security but
you're also signaling a resolve for the
larger administrative governance
structures because a lot of the times
before even people will go to the
administrative machinery they believe
that the police can deliver so if there
is the security apparatus can deliver on
some of the basic grievances that people
have I think a lot of this alienation
can be gotten rid enough but
unfortunately that is not happening at
the local level and unfortunately people
find that the first time to interact
with this with the local police and they
have a very bad experience and that then
you know
boomerangs into something much bigger
complained about against the Indian
state complain against the way they are
being treated and so alienation
exploitation etc develops so I think the
larger point here is ultimately the
whole administrative machinery both in
terms of security and governance will
have to deliver if you have to go to the
root of this problem because while you
can kill so many you know
mouths and Naxalites and and and you
know you
you can superficially deal with this
problem ultimately you will have to make
a case to the ordinary citizens of this
country that they have a better stake if
they are integrated with the larger
Indian state and you can only do this if
you are capable of showing them that or
you are delivering both in terms of
governance and in terms of security and
in terms of basic you know coin you have
that population centric and enemy
centric approaches and by a large
population centric approach wins where
you try to win the hearts and minds by
doing in governance by bringing better
governance in India alienated and then
grieve it you know grievance oriented
sections of this okay okay mr. Chowdhury
for concluding you know final comment
from you and would you agree with that
tie aspect specifically where you know
both the center and the state have the
equal responsibility here on the ground
state for sourcing vishal has hit the
nail on the head the central forces in
the State Police have to work hand in
hand unfortunately it does not happen
they have a representative from the
state police and assistance of inspector
or somebody accompanying the party but
the district SP in the command not are
there together unfortunate it depends
the local leadership if they realize
it's our problem jointly and distinguish
they must come forward not just deputing
an assistance inspector to show them the
way no he is absolutely right
they unless both treat this as a problem
of internal security okay chattering the
security of the country is thought the
state problem policing is a state
subject no state government can run away
from this fact it's a constitutional
reality they have to come to terms with
okay so finally you know looks like both
sides do have that responsibility let's
sever one concluding comment from mr.
Singh mr. Singh according to you what's
the way forward from here because you
know it seems that we made some progress
in fact a lot of significant progress if
we may put it in terms of data in
containing the problem of Naxalism but
we get to have that success you know
final success being achieved but the way
forward
you address the basic problem the
problem of poverty the problem of
unemployment the problem for any
inequalities the problem of tribal
discontent the prime the problem of
forest rights these are basic problems
which need to be addressed and at the
same time they can the capability that
the state police have to be enhanced and
the state governments must view it as
their problem primarily and that of the
central government secondarily once that
change in mindset comes I think we start
when we start I mean seeing the end of
the natural problem okay so so the
change in mindset as well as you know
walking hand in hand with each other
concluding comments from you professor
punt yes absolutely I think you know I I
would continue to reiterate that it is
it is very important it is going to be
very important for I think for Indian
state machinery to start delivering on
the ground and unless we make the
transition from from a system whereby we
are looking at it primarily through the
security to a prism where we are looking
at through the through the prism of
development and delivery I think will be
missing the mark so hopefully that you
know as as the security situation
improves which according to various
indicators of the data it has then I
think the onus lies on those who are who
are who are there to deliver on the
ground to deliver and deliver it well
okay so clearly as a pen Lisa pointed
out that as far as the problem of Maxell
ISM is concerned we have made some gains
in terms of containing this problem but
from here onwards all the stake holders
will have to build on the success and
ensure that both things that is
development as well as the security
aspect go hand-in-hand and for this is
Center and the state government
machinery will have to act together
we'll come back again with a different
topic and different set of guest

over the past 31 years I've had the joy

of this vast subcontinent that is India
it is amazing to see how landscapes
culture food music dances and even
languages change every few hundred
kilometers that you drive you see the
highest mountains of the world great
seas bountiful rivers and best of all a
people whose thoughts and heritage go
back a few thousand years join us on an
enthralling journey I am traveling again
across the whole of India to bring you
spectacular India in the far east of
India is the land of Tripura
it is a land of verdant hills lush
greenery and cultural traditions which
are rooted in a long history
[Music]
[Applause]
tripura was one of the last great Hindu
kingdoms of India behind me is the og
anta palace which was built in 1901 by
the Maharaja this imposing building is
made in the saris attic style of
architecture and it brings alive the
splendor of those times traveling
through the verdant land of Tripura is
taking a journey into a time when they
were thick forests everywhere
a sense of the eternal still pervades
the life of the people and images of the
devotion are still to be seen everywhere
[Music]
Lord Shiva and Durga have always had a
very special place in the heart of
Indians many holy sites devoted to them
are very well known however what is not
well-known is that the state of Tripura
has some of the greatest sites of their
devotion
we are at owner Cote which literally
means one less than 10 million
apparently this was supposed to be a
land of so many deities in the past we
are 178 kilometers north from agartala
it's a fascinating site with the largest
shiva rocket reliefs in all of India it
is a particular pleasure for me to come
here today as I came here for the first
time 35 years ago
[Music]
this remote and magnificent site in the
hills of North Tripura is one of the
greatest sights of religious art in
India these impressive sculptures were
made in the eleventh or twelfth century
towards the end of the reign of the
palace the central Shiva face is known
as the UNA cottage for a calm air of
including the headdress it is over 30
feet high but the most enchanting part
of this site is its magical setting in
the middle of the thick forest
[Applause]
we are dwarfed by these massive reliefs
for indeed that is the purpose to convey
the awesome majesty of the Spirit which
is far greater than the forms of the
world around us
[Music]
under koti also has massive rocket
depictions of Durga and of other deities
in this enchanted place the colossal
sculptures blend with the natural beauty
of the verdant site
[Music]
Mukul Inga's and beautiful sculptures of
many other divinities
are also found at owner koti these
indicate the existence of earlier
temples here prior to the rocket reliefs
along with Hinduism Tripura was also an
important center of Buddhism evidence of
Buddhism has been found dating from the
first decade of the 6th century onwards
tantric Buddhism flourished here from
the 8th century onwards
these are the remains of the pillock
stupa located in a very remote part of
South rapport
the exquisite relief on the stupa on the
base of the stupa represents the
vegetarian school of Buddhism which was
prevalent in parler times when it was
made the Vajra of the Vedran
school is Lord indras Vajra the
Thunderbolt where it was believed that
the logic of the school of Buddhism was
as striking and as clear as a
thunderbolt it was also believed to be
as indestructible as a diamond
[Music]
the variant form of Buddhism developed
in eastern India mainly at the
universities of Nalanda and Vikram Salah
in fact the earliest representations we
have of relief made along the base in
this fashion is also found at the site
of Nalanda these reliefs are also
similar to those found in the base of
the pas Harper stupa in Bangladesh we
also find the pala period reliefs carved
in wood like this at the cheran
monastery in Kunal
[Music]
this two piles of great value in the
study of Buddhism in the east of India
these reliefs are among the earliest art
found in sites of the Vajrayana school
of Buddhism it was from East in India
that this form of Buddhism spread to
Myanmar Nepal Tibetan Indonesia
[Music]
bronze sculptures have been found in the
area around pillock these are of a very
high artistic quality and are made in
the style of the Pala period it is
believed that pillock may have many more
treasures to offer and excavations are
being carried out in the area in ancient
and early medieval times the worship of
Shiva and Shakti was widespread all over
the Northeast
[Music]
28 kilometers from agra tala near the
Bangladesh border is the Kamla Sagar
kali temple
[Music]
this was built in the late 15th century
by Maharaja Tanya Monica
it has a very early image of Mahishasur
martini with Shiva made in the base
[Music]
it is visited by a large number of
devotees from Tripura and from other
states
[Music]
the temple of three periphery or three
pure sundry is in the town of Buda pour
about 56 kilometres south of agartala
she is a form of Durga and is the most
revered deity of Tripura in fact the
state is named after legend has it that
King Dania Manikya who ruled through
pariah in the end of the 15th century
had a revelation one night in a dream in
the dream he was told to install the
image of Tripura Sundari in a temple
which stood on a hilltop near the town
of Udaipur
that is how the three poorest under each
temple came into being in the year 1500
and one it is now over 500 years old
this is the most important temple in
Tripura or an average more than 2,000
worshipers come here each day the temple
has a square type sanctum made in the
style of a typical Bengali heart with a
conical roof on the eastern side of the
temple King hanya Manikya built a pond
which is today home to a large number of
tortoises the poorest under e means
beauty of the three worlds
she is also called show dashi Vermillion
huge Lalita or playful Varna and Raja
Rajeshwari or queen of queens in Hindu
mythology Lord Vishnu had cut the body
of Parvati in the form of sati into 51
pieces with his Sudarshan chakra these
pieces fell in different places
throughout the country
these places came to be deeply revered
and are known as beta stands
it is said that the right foot of Satya
fell here in Matta body kashmira shah
fights have a collection of five ancient
hymns that were composed in praise of
tripura sundari
[Music]
the deity tripura sundari combines in
her being Carly's determination par with
his charm and Durga's grace the temple
is also known as kuma Pete because the
shape of the temple appears like that of
the kuruma or Toto is inside the temple
the image of Kali is made of reddish
black caste stone the deity Kali is the
embodiment of eternal energy it is this
energy with which we must battle the
demons of our ignorance in Indian
thought he only evil is a lack of true
knowledge our confusion we remain caught
in the spell of Maya or mithya the
illusions of the world of forms around
us thus we are blinded to the truth
[Music]
Dirty's are the personifications of fine
qualities within us we look upon them we
meditate upon them to awaken those
qualities within us these qualities grow
within until finally we become the deity
Kali personifies the boundless energy we
can have energy which we can use to
dispel our ignorance and confusion Kali
is visualized as a supreme mistress of
the universe in union with Shiva who is
said to be her spouse she creates and
destroys the world
[Music]
this is a destruction of the Maya of
mithya in which we remain constantly
caught in her role as ruler of the world
and object of meditation
her appearance takes on a more benign
dimension she is described as young and
beautiful has a gentle smile and makes
gestures with the two right hands to
dispel our fears these gentler features
present Kylie's divine Roth as a path
toward salvation she dispels all fears
of the devotee

this is the Milan Geneva's which used to
be the summer palace of the Maharaja of
Tripura the great bengali poet
Rabindranath Tagore spent much time here
he's believed to have written many of
his works the temple of Bhuvaneshwari is
55 kilometers south of Agartala it is of
the 17th century the temple is also
known because it features as the
backdrop for a novel and for a play
written by the Bengali poet Rabindranath
Tagore it was made in the rule of
Maharaja Govinda Manik not very far from
the tripura sundari temple in udaipur is
the beautiful goal of a group of temples
these were made in the 17th century
a long tradition of living with nature
is reflected in the beautiful
handicrafts of the pura these are made
lovingly out of the bounty of nature
available in the thick forests of the
state the people of Tripura make the
most exquisite things out of cane such
as these I remember 35 years ago I had
picked up some small chairs and mudras
pumpkin shape Buddhas to sit upon in
Tripura that was 35 years ago and they
are still as strong and exquisite
looking as ever in fact every time they
get a coat of polish they look new
sometimes I think that objects made out
of cane are the most artistic the land
of tripura is a crucible of early Indian
culture which continues till today a
journey through this verdant land is a
great reminder of the richness and glory
of India in ancient times

Supreme Court thank you very much mr.
putnik firstly we've listened to Arun
Jaitley's blog this sort of evidence how
does it stay a standard court see now
the evidence has come yes and as per the
see RPC I mean the procedures is already
laid down that yes now you know the of
course the e DS will entitled to file
the additional chart sheet which has
been done yes you know we need to wait
that yes after the trial the relying
upon this evidence the quality of
evidence it would be clear that yes we
sucked actually the culprit and who are
the persons involved and according to me
it is too early in the day to you know
to say that yes these are the person for
a cause and would be convicted okay
it will take a little bit of time in
terms of you know the quality of
evidence and examination and the
cross-examination so you use the word
quality of evidence now when we have you
know abbreviations like this ap fam RG
etc and there are reports also that
suggests that that christian michelle
has named a mad patel though of course
his lawyer and the court said that he
has named nobody so but the point is
that you know these abbreviations are
obviously linked to something and
somebody and their and the IDI has
sufficient evidence to show some sort of
a money trail so that is quality of
evidence it has to be linked to
something isn't it
say you know I don't eight it is correct
I mean that yes the abbreviation has to
lead to some name but today if you ask
me that yes that what is exactly the
quality of evidence and you know to ask
a specific question that yes whether it
is going to
name these people I would have little
bit of you know I mean I would not be
convenient and comfortable in saying
that yeah these are the people who were
named and those so this would be the
accused it is only the time and in other
Karachi generation of those witnesses
would prove the case beyond any doubt
otherwise milord I mean it would amount
to putting the you know horse before the
cart to say that yes today's the day
that where these people can be convicted
the fact is that if it's it's good
enough to be put into a charge sheet and
bring them to the walls for them to be
scrutinized and to be cross-examined of
course of course if somebody is clean
this would come out clean and you know
the what is the truth like in any
another procedure that is they're done
in the CRP sea is to bring out the truth
it's not that you know some you know
innocent people would be convicted if
somebody is clean they would come out
with clean hand and you would say that
yes there is no evidences so therefore
these are all fabricated grants but if
that is truth of course of course our
procedure either the you know the the
entire evidence would lead him to the
conviction so we have to wait and watch
okay but you know we we read just as
napier persons that these charge sheets
all run into thousands of pages i mean
what can there be in so many thousands
of pages i mean we only get these little
bits and pieces so i mean there must be
some sort of solid backing to what the
IDI is saying in its charge sheet if
it's convinced that you know that there
can be a conviction in this case
see well honestly you know i haven't
gone through the charts it as yet like
the you know the linear charge today
also say that how this you know the
charts it was leaked to the media first
and then to the road and that is quite a
you know of course you know being a
lawyer i would say that he has it is a
matter confined to the courtroom and
after that it may be a document and
which can be released to any media yeah
exactly
now the point is you know to say that of
course the IDI would definitely do its
job in the best possible manner but to
test that only the evidence only the
cross-examination that whether these
evidence are good enough to convict a
person
okay Auden gently of course has said
that the accused have the right to
silence can you explain that a little
bit because you know I mean Christian
Michele himself does he have the right
to silence and his lawyers have come out
and said that you know he has said
nothing see you know at least as usual
in with a great humorist and you know he
to all Gandhi of course of course but
the only aspect I can tell that yes you
know who's right whose priority was to
have the right to silence it is of
course to have you know whether the
Congress or the BJP has to decide but
end of the day yeah speaking legally
speaking and asking who has the right
the accused as the right to silence I
see you know I would say that yes any
person who is the accused you know if
there is some nothing is there and none
no truth is involved in it he would come
out and speak for itself now the point
is that yes how these names are being
reflected whether these names are
related to those people okay that is my
stand is you know right from the
beginning you you saw saying that a
person would remain silent has something
to hide is that is I mean is that a
soldier is something that can be
inferred it had supplied to interesting
question that is whether the silence
amounts to conviction or to point out
somebody that yes he's the culprit and
if you say that if he has nothing to
hide you might as well say come out and
say of course but to come out and say is
actually the right place is the coat not
in the another channel or in the media I
would definitely say that yes somebody
is of course the right to silence is of
course the creators of anybody for that
matter me that the complainant be that
accused but if I'm aggrieved really you
know I would definitely come out and say
in so many words which would make it
clear crystal clear that yes I am NOT
that person
but today to assume that yes that you
know to say that yes you know this man
would not have been proving any case for
that matter it's probably little too
early in the day but of course I would
not say that whether the Jet Li service
correctly that is have is not correct it
is you know that everything would be
clear after the trial okay so you are
simply saying that the
it is early days right now and the
chargesheet indices entitles the IDI to
prosecute and bring all these people to
court to cross-examine they will be
entitled to defense there will be a case
and the truth will come out in open
court is that what you're saying exactly
exactly
you know you know as a lawyer if you are
practicing you definitely defend your
case and of course suppose the IDI
definitely prosecute its case and
because the kind of evidence they have
supposed in thousand pages it would not
be you know fair on my part to say that
no no it is not the quality of evidence
it to be 100% no doubt about it only
thing is that yes to say here today that
known under the quality of in such good
quality it would be you know maybe a
little bit too early to decide that yes
those are the quality of evidence which
is proof you are not going to prove that
yes the a quiz that would be convicted
or their ability so it is correct to say
then that the due process of law is
taking place because I mean at the end
of the day this is the only way to get a
conviction you have to file a charge
sheet you have to name the accused you
have to bring them to the court they
have to defend themselves or they have
to be pronounced guilty based on what
everything that is decided in the court
this is the process that is started and
this is the exact thing that this is the
government is right and doing everything
absolutely
absolutely there is no doubt about it
because it is not that a government or
big government under the CRTC the IDI is
entitled to fire them you know
additional charts it which if he fails
and the judge would accept that yes
these are the documents which is
relevant and parameter in deciding an
issue in question and obviously the
court will take into account and pass
the order accordingly we live there

on April 11th CEO of ultimate Coco
league
Tenzing new yogi is highly optimistic
about the prospects of the tournament
according to him this league can be a
big chance to go to the grassroots and
make Coco a career option our
correspondent Ashok Marceau Lea caught
up with him this is what he has to say
after Bertrand and I calculate cupboard
Dilek and Indian Premier League we
finally got our indigenous sports Coco
League and I am joined by Coco League
CEO Tanjung yogi sir or can you tell us
a bit about what is this
Coco League and when you start this Coco
Lee so Coco League is an inspiration
which has been there for a while now
we've always believed that rural India
should get its own sport and only what
really excited us was almost about 35
lakh players playing in India and it is
entrenched in across rule so we believed
that we should eventually give a leak to
this particular discipline and we have
created altima toko
in my mind this is going to be one of
the
you know largest leagues in India as far
as television viewership is concerned
because this is completely rural and we
are going to modernize the game so this
again gets back to urban as well we're
looking at two cities to start off with
first season and from there we're
looking at eight teams coming in all
across India so and the timeline is what
we're looking at is October November so
I think it's sort of bound to get new
heights and even cope who's going to
touch new heights it's a very fast-paced
format well there are a lot of leaks
going on in India so how this leak came
in in your mind and what is the
importance obviously so if you you know
there's very little material available
on the Internet and that's actually good
for us because when you actually see the
new avatar of cocoa it is a superbly
fast paced and a lot of skydives
happening lot of agility a lot of speed
lot of stamina we believe that India is
a country is always consumed sports from
a team sport perspective and you've seen
the past successes of pro Kabaddi league
you know
no one knew how it will look on
television until sort of Charu showed it
to us that's exactly the vision which I
have nobody has seen Coco till now and I
think we'll be gearing ourselves up to
show the nation what the real Coco is
all about and and how much of how much
of excitement there is from a television
property perspective last - edition of
Colonials huge success or do you think
that kilo India is a real game changer
as far as the promotion of this
indigenous scale is concerned absolutely
absolutely I think honorable sports
minister Colonel Raja Waddell Singh
Rathore I think he's been a is simply
been a visionary in Indian sporting
history the reason why I say that is
also because of the fact that I have
always firmly believed that being a
sportsman yourself gives you the nuances
as to what happens deep down inside and
deep deep rootedness right and his
vision was was basically to create a
pyramid where everyone ground up gets an
opportunity to play express themselves
in a national platform and that is all
kilo India is all about what has also
happened is these scholarships which
have been given
I've been an ex cricketer and I know how
it feels to be a cricketer right but
when you look at non cricketing Jonah
it's a very different sort of space but
in the recent times in the last say five
years or so non cricketing consumption
and television has really increased how
will you ensure that from the rural area
the players from gulia they will
participate in this event so what we've
done is with the help of kaykai fi we
have actually graded almost 250 to 300
players in three grades A B and C
depending on their statistics for the
last four national championship that
they've participated in bases that we
are going to touch upon pretty much
every district every corner that is
number one which we'll be playing in the
ultimate cocconi the other thing what
we're going to do is we're going to
parallely start off state driven
grassroot leagues which no other legal
ever done and that will essentially
create our base of feeder system where
players will be will be identified
tabbed identified and nurtured and then
they will bring them up to the national
league and Indian shooters continued

started adapting if you get pregnant

think up to three years so it's great so
you have a hard time coming back or a
hard pregnancy you want full of pressure
like I did to come back and then to kind
of try to get your ranking together it
was wasn't very easy so it's really good
to have it

with the end of Turkic slave mamluk

called Hillary's annex the rule to Delhi
Sultanate their rule to Delhi southmost
was highly aided by cracks and decline
in the former Empire however Jalal Udine
pharaohs killed you the first of the
killjoy empires chose not to rule from
marilene rather to move further down to
establish his capital in a new city
called kilo cream
the city's foundation was laid by
Baldwin's ransom Jakub on what would
have been his palace in those days gillo
Creed or kill agree as it was also
called has now transformed into a very
busy locality of southeast in Delhi
opposite what was once a broadside
course of the river Yamuna kilo curry
was the second imperial city built in
the neighborhood of
Kitab Delhi in the 13th century by kappa
bart the last of the turkish sultan ali
turkish Sultan's it was built on the
bank of the river yamuna in an area
which today extends from Maharani Bagh
to jankura roughly and we know that
there was a there was some kind of
military use of the land or military
encampment near kilo Creek lorry later
became a fully fledged city but in
balban's period there was some kind of
or even before he also built a
settlement called Ria's poor which is
where the modern Nizam of deals to miss
shall elude in ecology when he was first
assumed the throne he was actually
crowned at kilo quarry and he ruled from
there for at least a year before he came
back to what was lolcode so nothing much
is left of key locally it was actually
called key Luger he because it was and
it was built by cake Awad who was the
grandson of Melbourne and his successor
but kilo Cree the only thing that
remains now is the name which is the
name of a small village one of the urban
villages of Delhi
while the remnants of killjoy rule here
may be very few in distant the place was
once a home to a rich Township and an
established market cradles brought from
the daily of old and bazaars were
established the life went on and perhaps
flourished even more in the new city a
sense of stability was slowly sitting in
Delhi Sultanate which allows the until
Jesus goat gaining strength we have a
very lively description of the city in
the writings of a 14th century history
Tarifa Pharaoh Shahi of zeldin Behrman
and also a very lively account of
celebrations held in kilo Cree by Emir
Hassan so if we put the two these two
major texts together we have a picture
of kilo Cree as a thriving city the
nucleus of the city was a palace built
by catobar for himself where he came and
held his court delhi continued to be the
capital of the sultanate because major
offices meant secretariat were not
really permanently shifted from Kitab
delhi but it's fair to say that when the
sultan came and settled in kilo Crean
his nobles also came and settled
merchants came and that was how so the
impulse was political which is very
which was very important in those days
for a city to come into being gradually
of course shops of different kind
civilians other people working people
they all came and settled in the city
acquired the shape of a proper city rich
people of Delhi also came and it was
called the nosh ahead and people
came and built their own palaces next to
the river and it must have been a very
beautiful place at some point because it
was inhabited for such a short while
that maybe the stones were reused in
later constructions or the palaces and
all were made of relatively perished
metal material like bricks and wood and
all and they have now gone we really
cannot say because there's very little
information we have about it what
happened later jalal al-din kg was
already walking towards the evening of
his life when he took over
although the royal throne was still in
Maharani killed Reid decided to stay put
here and rule from kilo Cree he was
unable to come to the terms if the
people of his kingdom will accept in a
sir / so what did it he decided to built
on the palace left by his predecessor
kekada several other buildings two
houses princes nobles and other officers
report over to be built in kilo cream in
the words of 14th century political
thinkers Europe in Boerne accountant in
tariqa pharaohs Shahi the excellence of
his character his justice generosity and
devotion in gratitude removed the a
version of the people and they accepted
the new emperor and his muse sitting
this is the first time when we hear the
phrase
old daily daily a corner daily a berserk
for coat of Delhi because there was a
new city in kilo Cree which began to be
called
Sahara no or new city or if you like New
Delhi to use a modern expression so the
moment a new city came up this city
began to be called old he realized that
they were Turkish ruling classes in foot
of Delhi who were not favorable to his
rule and therefore he avoided ruling the
Sultanate from what began to be called
old le now and he stayed in kilo Creek
he started the second round of building
construction in pillow crew
expanding kibbutz palace building
gardens building new houses therefore
providing another round of if you like

room jelly was preparing to see another
of a throne shaking while city's partial

murdered by his nephew Runa Muhammad who
later came to be addressed as a now teen
season power allowed in assumed the
title of Sultana the lead
well the murder of the reigning Sultan
his uncle Jalal looting fringy was soon
forgotten
in the beginning it was a stigma of
course and the Jalali nobles who were
afraid of allowed means ambition truly
afraid then they were against him but he
bought them with the gold he brought
from the south he bribed them he took a
whole lot of measures to bring them to
his fold and as I said he had a nobility
of his choice so frankly speaking in the
political circle very soon his image as
a regicide forgot was forgotten

Delhi was decorated up Ken

the throne before taking over the phone
of Delhi allowing began its military
career as the owner of Kara province and
from there he raided and plundered malwa
in the year 1292 and two years later in
Davari LG was arguably the most
important ruler of the Delhi Sultanate
before Muhammad took luck he ruled for
not a very long period of time 1296 - 13
16 which is 20 years but in these 20
years a lot happened he built a new
capital in Siri another city which was a
plain earlier he built a city there he
built an imperial palace which also held
the secretariat of the state and we know
that Siri became a city almost of the
same importance commercial and political
importance as Kota mayor only if we
disregard his earlier career as an
invading Prince he was in these 20 years
was able to not only consolidate the
hal-g power in Delhi and in the Delhi
Sultanate but also take measures which
had very long lasting implications and
he had an image a self image of himself
he considered to be the second Alexander
or Alexander of the age a term which he
used in an inscription on the allied
Arase in the cut up complex in his coins
also he called himself secondary Sahni
or the second Alexander so he had a
grandiose image of himself as a powerful
ruler
considered one of the most belligerent
coolers in the history of Delhi
Sultanate who ventured southwards
launching attacks in Gujarat ranthambore
Mahad chaleur Warrenville mobber
and Madurai among his most significant
of campaigns he successfully defended
Delhi against many Mongol invasions
there were many Mongol invasions the
Mongols were trying to capture India and
one major contribution of the Delhi
Sultan's to the politics of the period
was to protect the Delhi Sultanate from
the Mongol invasion the history of India
would have been very different with a
Mongol ruler but it's fair to say that
allowed in LG played a very major role
he fortified all Delhi because the
population of Delhi was exposed and
people were crossing the river and
coming and settling in Delhi seeking
refuge in Delhi he fought a war a very
fateful war against could la caja which
he won and also ordered a string of
forts to be built to guard the route
from where invasion was taking place we
just in stock and the defensive postures
leading ruthless attacks deep into mangu
territory in Kandahar gusseting and
Kabul in Afghanistan his forces ensured
that mongols never attacked his kingdom
with ken in a move considered one the
most significant ones of his rule will
allow the in kill jury changed tax
structures he increased agriculture tax
from 20% to 50% and stop payments and
commissions on the tax collected by the
local chief
DOX direction and money control all
these things added to the Treasury of
allowing khilji Treasury which were
attending for the needs of his growing
army and it's even growing military
campaigns aloud they also took a series
of measures to consolidate his political
power by bringing in people of his
choice as officers of the state and
getting rid of the older nobility by
introducing a new taxation system based
on a measurement of land and conversion
of tax share of the state into cash
minted coins silver coins particularly
the silver Tonkov allowed Dean and his
gold Tonka were found later much later
in the mughal period also so the
circulation of these coins was very very
high he also introduced a whole other
set of measures to consolidate the
political and fiscal power of the state
and the ruling class at the center large
markets on Shahana money came up in his
room catering to the needs of Bailey
households to exquisite products Muslim
merchants were granted exclusive permits
and monopolies in these markets
no other merchants could buy from
farmers or sell in the markets those own

punished well it has said under allowed

ears and eyes his no boats were under
constant scrutiny even the private
households were not spared from an
efficient network of spies
he banned socialization among officials
intermingling and even banned marriages
between the noble families all that he
wanted to make sure was there was not
even a yota of opposition against him

sometimes questionable measures but
among the measures that was rather
popular among public was that of
prohibition where drinkers importers and
smugglers of wine was subject to harsh
punishment that included jail terms for
many days months and even years the
prominent quote writers Aldean Bernie
noted the Sultan himself entirely gave
up wine parties he directed his
ministers to go out in each in every
corner of the city its bazaars wards and
Sarai's and read out the Royal firm on
that no one shall drink sell or have

west of Cairo cream and north of all
city merrily the city third of Baileys
was named ZB city actually the earliest
references we hear about city are as a
big plain not the city itself which was
a big flat ground it was a plate the
plain of City and it really came into
prominence because the armies of allowed
the LG here engaged with the Mongols the
Mongolian visions were a constant
feature of allowing Hill G city and in
fact particularly the early part of his
reign the Mongols made several inroads
into North India and a couple of times
they came that you know one time they
came to the outskirts of Delhi and the
second time in 1303 they were at Delhi
itself
they laid siege to the city of Delhi and
when you talk about the city of Delhi
you mean merrily the lolcode city but it
was here that the armies of the Emperor
were encamped in the plain of City and
they kind of barricaded themselves and
somehow managed to keep off the Mungo's
and the Mongols for various reasons left
after a couple of months but it is said
that then allowing LG woke up and
decided that he really need to do needed
to do something to protect the where the
army was camped within its high walls
and imposing ramparts filled with stones
quartzite bricks and mortars block
houses and other structures were built
to prevent the army from forcing a way
in it said the Raiders from Central Asia
could not penetrate the walls of Syria
and hot food would feed back after all
being killed he moved his capital hero
city was transformed into a flourishing
town once known as the pride of a city
this fort housed
azar Suton or a palace of thousand
pillars built with marbles and a
beautiful stone work in Pietra dura the
palace is said to have a huge beautiful
gate that took a breath away of its
admirers
today only part of that fort with its
walls and ramparts has stood with the
test of times
Shahabuddin is now a crowded locality
with its busy shopping holes and
upmarket boutiques nestled in hostas
stands another monument of significance
a telling statement of his room joven
are the pillar is standing on a square
of partial is believed to have stood out
as a dead frame for thieves and thugs
who attempted to venture in his kingdom
what we have about German art is mostly
legend and oral traditions and it is
said that this was built during the time
of allowing kenji at the just outside
the walls of City and the significance
was that it was it was a tower where the
heads of criminals who had been executed
those heads were displayed over there
you can see that it has these holes on
the top of the Menard and these holes
each one of them would have held heads
so it was a huge deterrent that people
entering the city would see outside this
Menard with those heads displayed and
they knew how what what a strict ruler
allowed in culture was often establish
in the new city allowing build the first
building in the history of India that
employed Islamic architecture la terraza
housing in Mohali just behind go to
Menard a beautiful gateway with a
doorman archer who extended by Vista
southwards with Queens on its both sides
among his desires would build the dog
twice the height of putting Menard he
called it on imanari
no construction began on a site running
parallel to majesty cooking Menard due
to his death the construction was
stopped Midway and as the feed will have
it
none of his successors took up the
unfinished job he wanted to leave his
mark he wanted to be a great ruler and
there are you know one of those
important parts of his of his rule was
that he went and come you know made
inroads into Dickon for instance that
was one major feature of his role he saw
himself as a great Conqueror and great
conquerors try to leave these monuments
to their greatness so a lie there was
the expansion of the Kitab mosque was
part of this plan so the building of a
new Minar which was never completed the
building of a grand gateway into the and
if you look at the inscriptions of that
gateway it refers to allow the in
very hyperbolic terms as secondary Sahni
the second Alexander he saw himself is a
great Conqueror nearest city is Siri an
emperor of Bailey also build a large

his legacy in role is still remembered
for control our nobility agricultural
reforms taxation reforms establishing of
marketing reforms and price control
mechanism
besides several battles and warfare so
one has a mixed reaction when one
recalls the rule of the Sultan as a
stable regime oppressive to the
peasantry particularly and the
subordinate classes but many people
liked him
also a because there was a prohibition
against liquor consumption in Delhi and
the neighborhood he was also remembered
as a sultan in who whose reign things
were very cheap so much later in the
14th century people recalled his reign
with fondness by saying how cheap things
were in his reign and Nasir Uddin Shah
who was a chesty Saint in Delhi mentions
that people of Delhi go to his grave and
tie strings hog about them and seek
blessing so his image as a tyrant Sultan
which we have today was very different
in after his death when people almost
took him to be a saint

manifesto also proposes to scrap IPC
section 499 on criminal defamation
making it a civil offense instead senior
BJP leader and Defense Minister Nirmala
Sitharaman charged the Congress party
but showing scant respect for the
supreme sacrifice of security personnel
because despite saying they would Accord
martyrs status to Armed Forces personnel
who died in the line of duty the
Congress is putting them in the line of
fire
after removing their protections she
took this point further by highlighting
the weakening of powers of the district
magistrate as well to take a pre-emptive
measures to prevent unlawful assembly as
via social media
Congress key manifesto head whare
protection a protection alga body came
added Carnevale birthday Hey moon ki
manifesto me who scoff may highlight
Kirkuk HRT Hong Ki Congress especially
currently - ke kya aapke manifesto ke
dwara alga bodycam mothers may upper
manifesto decree you finance minister
Arun Jaitley - had tweeted wondering
whether the Congress's consultations
with Lefton in general Hooda we're mere
optics clearly the Congress's election
manifesto is causing a few problems for
them on a key central government
function of national security with
inputs from share of the Mishra didi
news so this leads us to our in focus
point for tonight and this is it in
focus is the Congress manifesto a threat
to national security it's a question
that we are asking based on what the BJP
has said is the Congress manifesto a
threat to national security to help us
understand this we have with us profile
Kate Kerr who is the editor of organizer
and PK Mishra Prabhas Kumar Mishra's
former Additional Director General of
the BSF and is a senior fellow at the
Vivekananda into
National Foundation thank you gentlemen
for being with us we'd start with you
mr. Mishra you have been with the
security forces so tell us why do the
armed forces why do the security forces
need app spa in disturbed areas yes I
have gone through this manifesto
Congress but the question have asked why
we did aspire in in the most disturbed
area it may be mr. Amin may be Nagaland
may be Nani porec may be whole of Jammu
and Kashmir correct you have called the
government the state government and the
central government you have called the
Defense Forces and the paramilitary
forces where the things are not under
the control and he want security forces
to be there to maintain normalcy for
that for the safety of our security
forces we need some law to protect
ourselves like you have seen in Google's
case you have seen so many stone pelting
cases in Kashmir we have seen so many
police personnel CRPF and be a parcel
being massacred by natural light chain
improvised explosive devices so there
are a lot of threat to the lives of our
forces yes I can will tell you suppose
in Kashmir we appreciate some persons
are in firing some persons have been
killed and if a spy is withdrawn and it
is not there for us what will happen
there Rosalie's cases against us and all
of a whole de life even after retirement
this gentleman will be running around
the court in Jammu and Kashmir Ian and
in natural affected areas and absolutely
and he'll be facing problem that is what
we need the protection our troops
particularly the sine X the Jevons okay
they require this protection and law to
cover them so Praful kate curve what
political purpose can be served in you
know in toning down or diluting ab spa
as the congress wants to do
manifesto of the Communist Party it
talks about the calm and the DOM and
Shan and swabhimaan you know the a new
terminology you find in Congress
manifesto that clearly shows that some
impact of you know the Modi style of
acronyms are being used there seems to
be you know some groundwork that is
being done as far as various economic
and social welfare majors are concerned
but somehow I don't think why I don't
know why this particular point and this
is not just about Congress interestingly
the same points were mentioned in the
CPM manifesto day before yesterday and
the same points as as today with
Mehbooba Mufti said that it is being
mentioned even in the purity manifesto
okay why these particular points are
being raised now it's clearly see we
should not forget that up Spa was
brought under the Congress regime okay
and recently in last three four years we
have seen that there are certain areas
where up spa was removed through pure
eyes the classic case because entire
state is now a major chunk of Arunachal
is out of op spa yes it clearly shows
that we're and there are percentage 80%
85% you know violence or insurgency
related or militancy related incidents
have gone down abscess already you know
so the key point that should be learned
from a northeastern lesson is when there
is a decline in insurgency unforce is
are not there for their own happiness
absolutely no governments have called
them so I don't know I think this is a
major you know
mistake that has made by Congress
strategies by bringing this at this
juncture and that's so you know the the
entire work that is supposed to be
focused actually because mr. Rahul
Gandhi has already built certain
momentum around you know seventy two
thousand and other social welfare scheme
that is completely gone out and again
Social Security national security and
Jammu Kashmir has brought to the
fortress so mister PK Mishra the the
fact is that the security forces already
use a humane approach in dealing with
the situation I mean the threat the the
use of force is the last resort and they
are already trying to win over you know
the people who are under their influence
through other means through development
or other means so this this really this
idea of balancing doesn't quite arise at
all does it
yes I can tell you our security forces
you see Chris we see the way we are just
really are decreasing the youth the Army
and the Defense Forces and the parameter
report says they are going all out I'm
they are recruiting a lot of use in that
area and they are being taken into Jammu
and Kashmir Police they caliper
battalions and all and a lot of
development and progress in those areas
and particularly the young generation
they are being channelized properly and
suitable warnings have been given if you
take up the gun you will perish my very
clearly exist if you take a gun in your
hand
definitely you are going to because that
that has to be done and that is our ups
ups rise there to protect them and we
have got a system also we are having our
court-martial system if we find any one
of us they misbehave with civilians okay
and we go out of Harper knew that it
could marshal if we would go GUI case he
has been punished so many persons have
been punished in Kashmir but if you want
to withdraw now like Congress in that
Manny Castro they are troubled that will
be making Swamy in kiss me you're
talking about reviewing
and balancing it is a very very
dangerous proposal I can tell it goes
against the national security and they
sword immediately would draw this one
what they have stated not correct let's
put it also into an international
context a Praful Kate curve because
Jammu and Kashmir is not only is it a
disturbed state it is a state which has
illegal occupation of Pakistan in
Pakistan Occupied Kashmir and also
illegal occupation of China in some part
of Jammu and Kashmir so with both these
adversaries they're demoralizing the
Armed Forces will send a very poor
signal doesn't it it is not I would I
would call it an illegal occupation
rather because legally still it you know
India I said illegal occupation did I
say so illegal
I said illegal oh I meant illegally I
said illegal oakarina so you know those
those that that illegal occupation and
not just illegal occupation the kind of
you know infiltration and interference
by the external forces that is that has
been happening right and the way
internal forces are manipulating this
you know external intervention to
maintain especially the valley or
certain areas of Valley as they're
filled amenda key issue if you see the
you know the the reactions from the
common Kashmir is in last few months you
will clearly get the signal that they
they are looking for the development
they are looking for opportunities there
and and armed forces are playing very
constructive role in in that process but
unfortunately that the political process
what they call as the political solution
and political issue
they are ensuring that this domain takes
place of any development activity you
know they don't want any accountability
so they have created all the hurdles so
you know the complete constitutional
provisions and governance machinery is
not implemented there and then they are
saying that you know this is a disturb
area okay on your request this is a
disturb area Saurabh spa as was called
external enemies
the threat is there we have seen that
again and again so it is a dual threat
it is not just the internal issue it is
external issue as well so Jammu Kashmir
is not just a political issue it has a
security ramifications and if you are
saying that we are open open for
dialogue we are we have seen what has
happened to earlier efforts you know for
a democratic process peaceful dialogue
is welcome with anybody but it cannot be
conditional it cannot be in you know
support with Pakistan
it cannot be try back that it has to be
within the framework of the Constitution
of India okay and and Jammu Kashmir
Constitution is also bound by that
unless somebody accept this basic
premise there is no process though there
is no possibility of dialogue so I don't
think you know I don't know under under
which political or electoral
consideration
Congress has come up with these you know
well this is one occasion but let's talk
about the other provisions also or the
provision of saying that sedition and
also defamation are are out outdated
they don't think they don't need it we
don't need them anymore but the PK
Mishra let's look at the issue of
sedition itself it can be a dangerous
issue even though the state the country
is you know quite large in the terms of
the population is able to control these
kind of dissenting voices it doesn't
really it the country may have the
capacity but within it you know I mean
if you allow these kind of streams
without any law to control it we are not
quite ready for that is it fine
absolutely
the manifesto now tells that they want
to repeal such 100 to 120 for a species
that's right I can't will tell you we
have just seen what has happened in JNU
we know what is all happening in Odisha
and the Dakar in Buster and those areas
and natural affected areas you see the
look into hardik Patel's case and so
many cases and Nelson shouting slogans
against the country against the national
interests against the natural security
so what's all happening now somebody's
helene last today we want a prime
minister first now in this way another
Prime Minister post forget about that
political part I have not knocking but
in sedition charge I'm telling you if
the law is not there if we cannot
control this type of hoodlums those who
are going against the national security
policy they have to be brought under
some circumstance they have to be kept
under control
otherwise our system our the probe the
problem security problem of our country
will be definitely facing problem and we
have to set them right and the law must
continue and if we repeal this 124 a I
hope we are going to face a lot of
problem in those areas like what
happened in JNU I mean it is going to
happen more and more in every street it
will happen so prefer cater now again
what is the political message that or
what kind of political advantage will
the Congress try and gain by removing
sedition or even saying that it is
outdated and redundant see I want to
make three quick points first of all you
know we need to understand that our
Constitution has enough protection as
far as the freedom of speech is
concerned and other freedoms are
concerned and and judiciary time and
again has interpreted them in a very
positive light to ensure free speech
right now as far as this Congress
promise is concerned there are two
inherent contradictions in this first is
we shouldn't forget that for all these
years Congress not just continued with
the Sedition law but Congress
effectively or in effectively used and
misused these laws now for take the
example of could I canal for example it
was a new it was a protest against
nuclear plant whether certain NGO
supported by external agencies were
involved or not involved one can debate
over it but not less than 6,000 cases
were registered under the same act under
UPA - okay secondly the same manifesto
the
manifesto talks about a stringent and
strong laws against the hate crimes so
human to bringing certain laws that will
curb individual liberty so it is it is
definitely a political strategy by
Congress to address certain sections of
the society and protect their you know
the allies that that have been
ideologically in tune with them but
again what kind of message you are
giving because you are the party who
fought during the freedom struggle you
are the party you were part of the
Constitution making process and under
the same Constitution you have governed
almost for sixty years in this country
for fifty fifty-five years in this
country
after that if you are suddenly giving
this promises what kind of message you
want to give to the country that is the
real problematic issue as far as the
Sedition law is concerned
supposing a PK Mishra to play the
devil's advocate you know the Congress
is really trying to give the part of the
people and reduce the power of the
government we they would say that you
know in a you know in a sort of let's
say in a theoretical sense this is too
much power but the government is
bringing in a sort of a police state
well we should be a democracy shouldn't
be quite like that happy is that sort of
an argument even possible and under
these kind of circumstances with these
with this law of sedition I can well
tell you mark that if we give this type
of power to the civilians and jamol
Allah and would draw this and repeal
this section 124 a IPC and this and say
decent charges will not be there against
anybody it's very very difficult to
carry to control this type of situation
in a democratic country and the
Democrats in enough safeguards already
in the Constitution as an already safe
cause the courts of their institutions
already are in place and he just told
that if we're to has already utilize
more than 6,000 cases so the argument of
well I mean if the UPA is doing it I had
done it or if the NDA is the question is
that there is it's
to be misused is what the Congress is
saying the Congress is tell that it may
be misused of in in such cases wherever
the misuse is they're definitely the
people's themselves to protest they are
and will judge means to look into this
and there will be political approach
that will be quote also to help us and
both the judiciary and executive the and
political combine they can help us but
this is not there just to wipe out the
sedition charges that will take us to
nowhere Praful kicker is a you know do
we require to have such a strong state
with all these provisions at this
current time or I mean is this an
interpretation that the state is strong
actually the state is normal see I I
completely agree that there is a
interpretation and this kind of
interpretation has been discussed in
various cases even in the judiciary see
please please remember that in in
nineteen forty nine itself first time
when such laws were used in independent
India Court had given verdicts in favor
of individuals against the state that's
why particularly this provision in
nineteen to putting certain restrictions
on free speech was brought and unity and
integrity of the nation was put at the
foremost and whenever there is a threat
state and government has a right to put
certain restrictions on such freedom so
what I am saying is there e there are
safeguards the restrictions are
specifically mentioned okay the remedy l
majors are suggested to approach the
court in such cases in such scenario
there can be discussion and debate about
what can be the possible amendments but
you know this kind of promise just
because something happened in certain
campuses or certain mindsets are being
exposed in last few years you are coming
with a political agenda regarding
Sedition case I think
this is a dangerous ploy oh yeah well
also let's try and put into context
mr. Mishra the the current circumstances
that we are living in we've talked about
it to a large extent but is it necessary
for the state to have you know I mean
this is this particular election is for
the government at the center and we look
at national security as a role and
function actually of the central
government is it important to have so
much power with the central government
or can these actually law and order be
maintained by the state is a state
subject otherwise national security look
into this letting guests amidst do you
think even now also maybe Chuck this
good maybe West Bengal maybe Orissa may
be Maharashtra it's not a state subject
now automatically it is transferred to
central forces and sent to central
government and most of the central
forces are available in deployed in
these areas so you can't always tell
there are some weights where the state
can handle okay but in most of the cases
if state will not be able to handle a
particular law and order situation
definitely the central forces and the
central government has to interfere and
the provision is there they have to
interfere
so propagate carafe spa is not really
imposed by the center it is in in
consonance with the state the state
which is having trouble with these kind
of actually approach the center and
that's when the center comes in and and
this is a necessity for the armed forces
especially to be able to fulfill their
responsibilities in bringing about law
and order in these particular disturbed
areas so this is particularly necessary
even at this time it is necessary it is
necessary to give protection to the
armed forces to perform their duty and
their duty is clearly defined in the act
itself to bring in normalcy just not
just law and us not law and order
normalcy so that the local police and
administration can handle this but there
is a bigger contradiction in this you
cannot say see if you want to have
lesser State and lesser government and
more governance the the basic law is it
cannot be just in law an order thing it
has to be also in economic thing on the
other hand you are saying that we will
make people more dependent through
various social security schemes we will
bring in reservations even in private
sector we will know remove laws so this
is a contradictory Mis ideologically it
is a contradictory approach you have to
if a state has to retreat in state has
to retreat in all fields then freedom
should be absolute can we can in a
society like India we can can we afford
really to have a complete so-called
liberal quote/unquote state that is the
key question that needs to be answered
absolutely and we live with on we leave
it at that point

India and the Bangalore South
constituency is witnessing a straight
contest between the veteran and also a
newcomer and the Congress veteran is the
senior leader BK Hari Prasad then he's
pitted against a BJP youth icon the
party's youngest candidate in fact the
28 year old pages sweet Surya so this
constituency has a mix of urban and
conservative voters and it's also home
to India's
Silicon Valley it's expecting leadership
with a vision for development and the
name of the candidate apparently doesn't
matter very much Ashoka pillar behind me
is the identity of banglar salt this has
been the identity for several years but
slowly this identity of Danglars salts
the students II change to burglars
Silicon Valley which is situated just
few kilometers from the Ashoka pillar
here in this constituency and this sums
up the sudden growth of IT in this
region and the development of Bangalore
South the prestigious Bangalore South
constituency has seen
leadership of BJP leader Anant Kumar
considered a moderate and
pro-development face of BJP who held
this look server for six consecutive
terms
his sudden demise left a big queue for
the BJP but the party found a young face
regis visu ria dynamic personality and
has youth connect through the social
media and anthem our wife which is
Finney was a strong contender but the
party decided in favor of they just
before the very fact that it can groom
another Anant Kumar to replace him
the roadshows of the justice area along
with BJP national president Amit Shah in
Banglore South are an indicator that the
Jersey is connecting with youth he
addresses the youth and instills
confidence in them to trust him just as
they would trust a young 28 year old CEO
on a 27 year old captain of a cricket
team when so many youngsters can lead
their teams and build leadership just
like a young CEO or a cricket captain
why can't a 28 year old go to Lok Sabha
and be the voice of the people on the
other hand Congress veteran PK Hari
Prasad who was a former betrothed
Congress in charge and a secretary
begins his campaign stating that Bandra
south model is the actual model of
development and credits UPA and former
Congress government in the state
he says his opponent in this contest is
not to just be Surya
but narendra modi the young man has been
misled doctrine for whatever he is so i
have no comments on that my fight is
against visibly my fight is against mr.
not in the motive for to see what
matters to them is a vision for the
country and welfare of the people
nowadays you we know very well the Modi
is doing good job when you take attack
on Pakistan and a yachtie
he has a more knowledge how to leave the
India the jTA's Congress coalition
government in power has made several
promises to improve the infrastructure
for Bandler South but the commitments
on paper and the speedy delivery of
infrastructure related projects by the
center and the coalition drift is
leading to unpredictable instability in
governance which is affected too before
the voters a shock on a really new
standard and known for its innovative
electoral campaigns an intense voter
participation at the hustings Kerala is
still not ready to rest on its laurels
the state with a high voter awareness
wants to achieve more involvement from
the people in this in the biggest
Democratic exercise well the
administration has now released a
full-fledged professionally produced
song for making voters more aware and
generating a sense of involvement in
them and the music has been well
complemented by a video as well
[Music]
to the people of Kerala being bombarded
by the cacophony of the shrill election
campaign music these lines come as a
breath of fresh air not urging them to
choose a party for praising some leader
this song actually exhausts people to
get ready to vote and take absolute
pride in being a water
[Music]
election form 2019 has been titled
hard-partying be Tadasana penned by K
jayakumar former chief secretary the
four - piece has been sung by state
playback legend yes Chitra
[Music]
the song was released in Thiruvannamalai
poram in the presence of carbon opposite
a sebum it will definitely motivate and
encourage the young voters and the
people to participate in this Democratic
Festival of elections because elections
should not be dominated by the political
activities alone it has a lot of
cultural social and patriotic aspects
also people should feel fully involved
people should feel free free and they
should feel independent without any kind
of pressure any kind of influence the
video provides an English translation of
the lyrics would seek to send across the
idea that by voting people shape India's
destiny and create the colors of the
future it is probably the first time
that a state will have an official
election song urging voters to cast
their vote

Pakistan had been advised to take
measures to curb terror funding with
specific action points if you permit the
transmission of funds
for terrorist activities naturally
international community has to take note
of it and prevent you from doing it so I
don't see any reason what complaint
what packets can axon can do is to say
that declare that there we have we shall
permit any terrorist activity from our

permit to any transmission of funds to

take place in June in Washington DC
Pakistan has show compliance on 16
points to demonstrate that it means

is in September
after which Pakistan could be
blacklisted if it's again found wanting
clearly Pakistan is feeling the heat
generated by India at the international
level on the question of curving
terrorism emanating from its soil its
economy is weakening each passing day
and those international actors who
usually supported have been advising it
to move away from its policy of
sponsoring terror targeting India it
remains to be seen which way will
Pakistan go at this dedicate juncture
news that desk D D India and the US has
approved the sale of 24 multi-role
mh-60r C called maritime helicopters to
India Atta and an estimated cost of US
dollars 2.6 billion boosting the Indian
Navy's anti-surface and anti-submarine
warfare operations
the Trump administration on Tuesday
notified the Congress that it has
approved the said of 24 mh-60r
multi-mission helicopters which will
provide the Indian Defence Forces the
capability to perform anti-surface and
anti-submarine warfare missions it's
designed for hunting submarines as well
as knocking out ships and conducting
search-and-rescue operations at sea the
Lockheed Martin built helicopters would
replace India's ageing fleet of
british-made
Sea King helicopters the Reserve Bank of
India will present its monetary policy
tomorrow the three-day monetary policy
committee meeting started yesterday and
the key outcome will be delivered
tomorrow the Reserve Bank of India had
reduced the repo rate by 25 basis points
in February after a gap of 18 months
currently the repo rate stands at six
point two five percent in its last
policy review in in February the
monetary policy committee had in fact
shifted the monetary policy stance to
neutral
from a calibrated tightening and
economists believe that the RBI is
likely to cut the repper eight this time
as well to boost growth I'm hoping that
the the new governor and the two RBI MPC
sees correctly the light and therefore
I'm saying I believe that I believe that
they will be and I think they should do
and I think they will do is a 50 basis
for great card unless we don't change
the stance on the quality the
transmission is not going to be smoother
and that is where I think there are
times when we are witnessing but we have
witnessed in the last row you know for
five years this kind of a disconnect
which has led to some kind of problem
when it comes to transmission of
monetary policy actions so when it comes
to transmission I think now we are
seeing some measures which are being
taken to ensure that liquidity is you
know gradually moving back towards you
know April 2016 there was a liquidity
framework which was announced by the
I tore the liquid to move towards
neutrality specially in a country like
India you need flexibility in my view
it's been implemented to strictly since
the beginning and then what is the
question of timing when you do what the
quantum of adjusting adjustment all
these are issues we've not really seen
discussed in the context of inflation
targeting one issue that has been
flagged and I want to go a little more
granular in it is that the transmission
mechanism doesn't take place the Reserve
Bank keeps reducing the rate of interest
but banks generally don't transmit it
the other side that has not been flagged
enough is the commercial banks are
having the deposits and for them to
adjust immediately as quickly as the
Reserve Bank does is not as easy and
that issue has to be taken into account
and moving on whatsapp has said that it
will now allow its users to decide
whether they want to get added to groups
on the instant messaging platform the
move assumes significance especially
ahead of the addictions in the country
and social media platforms are expected
to play a major role in political
campaigns to reach out to citizens in
large numbers the messaging app has
added a new privacy setting in which an
invite system will be will be helping
the users to decide who can add them to
the groups previously whatsapp users
could be added to groups without their
consent well these new privacy settings
have been rolled out to some users
starting today and it will be available
worldwide in the coming weeks to those
users who are using the latest version
of whatsapp and with that useful bit of
news we are concluding news night for

bsLfYApUpNg,Newsnight @9| Congress Party faces backlash for proposing review of AFSPA in its manifesto,DD India' is the News Channel of India's Public Service Broadcaster 'Prasar Bharati'. DD India has been successfully discharging ...,2019-04-03T16:11:54Z,DD INDIA,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bsLfYApUpNg/hqdefault.jpg,"and a day after it brought out its
manifesto for the Lok Sabha polls the
Congress party is facing the heat on the
subject of weakening provisions that
protect the Armed Forces and disturbed
areas the prime minister said that the
Congress party intends to remove
provisions that protect the security
forces against terrorists let's look at
this report the day after the Congress
party released its manifesto which the
ruling BJP condemned as dangerous for
its scheduled approach to national
security
Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman came
down heavily on the Congress for wanting
to review both EFT spa and the disturbed
areas act the Congress manifesto says
the Armed Forces Special Powers Act and
the disturbed areas act in Jammu and
Kashmir will be reviewed suitable
changes will be made in the text of the
laws to balance the requirements of
security and the protection of human
rights Prime Minister Narendra Modi took
up the issue at a rally in Siliguri West
Bengal he questioned how the Congress
manifesto could even think of reviewing
apps which protects the security forces
from terrorists president Amit Shah
won't the Congress that the BJP is
standing like a rock against apps paas
removal
[Music]
[Music]
besides apps per review two other
promises like repeal of sedition the BJP
says law enforcement agencies have been
forced on the backfoot
with the hands and legs bound this they
suggest indirectly empowers Maoists
separatists and terrorists the Congress
party in its manifesto proposes to emit
IPC section 124 a which deals with
sedition alleging it's misuse and
redundancy the Congress manifesto also
proposes to scrap IPC section 499 on
criminal defamation making it a civil
offense instead senior BJP leader and
Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman
charged the Congress party but showing
scant respect for the supreme sacrifice
of security personnel because despite
saying they would Accord martyrs status
to Armed Forces personnel who died in
the line of duty the Congress is putting
them in the line of fire
after removing their protections she
took this point further by highlighting
the weakening of powers of the district
magistrate as well to take a pre-emptive
measures to prevent unlawful assembly is
via social media
Congress scheme manifesto ke dwara
protection a protection alga body came
added Carnevale bata hey moong ki
manifesto me whose cough may highlight
Kirkuk HRT hunky Congress especially
currently - Kelly kya aapke manifesto ke
dwara
alga bodycam mothers may upper
manifestation decree Finance Minister
Arun Jaitley - had tweeted wondering
whether the Congress's consultations
with Levin in general Hooda we're mere
optics
clearly the Congress's election
manifesto is causing a few problems for
them on a key central government
function of national security with
inputs from share of the Mishra didi
news so this leads us to our in focus
point for tonight and this is it in
focus
is the Congress manifesto a threat to
national security it's a question that
we are asking based on what the BJP has
said is the Congress manifesto a threat
to national security to help us
understand this we have with us Praful
kate Kerr who is the editor of organizer
and PK Mishra Provost Kumar Mishra's
former Additional Director General of
the BSF and is a senior fellow at the
Vivekananda International Foundation
thank you gentlemen for being with us
we'll start with you mr. Mishra you have
been with the security forces so tell us
why do the armed forces why do the
security forces need app spa in
disturbed areas gone through this
manifesto Congress but the question you
have asked why we need aspire in the
most disturbed area it may be majorem it
may be Nagaland may be nany porridge may
be whole of Jammu and Kashmir correct
you have called the government the state
government and the central government
you have called the Defense Forces and
the paramilitary forces where the things
are not under the control and if one
security forces to be there to maintain
normalcy for that for the safety of our
security forces we need some law to
protect ourselves like you have seen in
Google's case you have seen so many
stone pelting cases in Kashmir we have
seen so many police personnel CRPF and
BS a person being massacred by
naturalisation improvised explosive
devices so there are a lot of threat to
the lives of our forces yes I can will
tell you suppose in Kashmir we
appreciated some persons are in firing
some persons have been killed and if a
spy is withdrawn and it is not there for
us what will happen there Rosalie's
cases against us and all of the whole
the life even after retirement this
gentleman will be running around the
court in Jammu and Kashmir e'en and in
natural affected areas and absolutely
and he'll be facing problem that is what
we need the protection our troops
particularly the sine X the Jevons okay
they require this protection and law
to cover them so Praful cater what
political purpose can be served in you
know in toning down or diluting appspot
as the Congress wants to do party it
talks about the calm and the Dom and
Shaun and swabhimaan you know the a new
terminology you find in Congress
manifesto that clearly shows that some
impact of you know the Modi style of
acronyms are being used there seems to
be you know some groundwork that is
being done as far as various economic
and social welfare majors are concerned
but somehow I don't think why I don't
know why this particular point and this
is not just about Congress interestingly
the same points were mentioned in the
CPM manifesto day before yesterday and
the same points as as today miss ma'am
baba Mukti said that it is being
mentioned even in the purity manifesto
okay while these particular points are
being raised now it's clearly see we
should not forget that up Spa was
brought under the Congress regime okay
and recently in last three four years we
have seen that there are certain areas
where up Spa was removed through pure
eyes the classic case because entire
state is now out major chunk of our
natural is out of op spa yes it clearly
shows that we're and there are
percentage 80% 85% you know of violence
or insurgency related or militancy
related incidents have gone down apps
per has already you know so the key
point that should be learned from a
northeastern lesson is when there is a
decline in insurgency unforce is are not
there for their own happiness absolutely
no governments have called them so I
don't know I think this is a major you
know
mistake that has made by Congress
strategies by bringing these at this
juncture and that's so you know the the
entire work that is supposed to be
focused actually because mr. Rahul
Gandhi has already built certain
momentum around you know seventy two
thousand and other social welfare scheme
that is completely gone out and again
Social Security national security in
Jammu Kashmir has brought to the forces
so mister PK Mishra the the fact is that
the security forces already use a humane
approach in dealing with the situation I
mean the threat the the use of force is
the last resort and they are already
trying to win over you know the people
who are under their influence through
other means through development or other
means so this this really this idea of
balancing doesn't quite arise at all
does it
yes I can well tell you our security
forces you see Chris we see the way we
are just dyrdek lysing the youth the
army and the defense forces in the
parameter report says they are going all
out I'm they are recruiting a lot of use
in that area and they have been taken
into Jammu and Kashmir Police they
caliper battalions and all and a lot of
development and progress in those areas
and particularly the young generation
they are being channelized properly and
suitable warnings are being given if you
take up the gun you will perish my very
clearly state exists if you take a gun
in your hand
definitely you are going to because that
that has to be done and that is our ups
ups rise there to protect them and we
have got a system also we are having our
court-martial system if we find any one
of us they misbehave with civilians okay
and we go out of our purview that it
could marshal if we need go GUI case he
has been punished yes so many persons
have been punished in Kashmir but if we
want to withdraw now like Congress in
that manifesto they have trouble that
will be making we're talking about Swami
in case we are talking about reviewing
and balancing it very very dangerous
proposal I can tell it goes against the
national security and they so
immediately would draw this one what
they have stated not correct let's put
it also into an international context a
Praful Kate curve because Jammu and
Kashmir is not only is it a disturbed
state it is a state which has illegal
occupation of Pakistan in Pakistan
Occupied Kashmir and also illegal
occupation of China in some part of
Jammu and Kashmir so with both these
adversaries they're demoralizing the
Armed Forces will send a very poor
signal doesn't it it is not I would call
it an illegal occupation rather because
legally still it you know India I said
illegal occupation to the same league so
illegal is illegal
I mean illegally I said illegal so you
know those those that illegal occupation
and not just illegal occupation the kind
of you know infiltration and
interference by the external forces that
is that has been happening right and the
way internal forces are manipulating
this you know external intervention to
maintain especially the valley or
certain areas of Valley as there filmdom
that has been the key issue if you see
the you know the the reactions from the
common Kashmir is in last few months you
will clearly get the signal that they
they are looking for the development
they are looking for opportunities there
and armed forces are playing very
constructive role in in that process but
unfortunately that the political process
what they call as the political solution
and political issue
they are ensuring that this domain takes
place of any development activity you
know they don't want any accountability
so they have created all the hurdles so
you know the complete constitutional
provisions and governance machinery is
not implemented there and then they are
saying that you know this is a disturb
area okay on your request this is a
disturb area Saurabh spa as was called
external enemies
the threat is there we are sealed that
again and again so it is a dual threat
it is not just the internal issue it is
external issue as well so Jammu Kashmir
is not just a political issue it has a
security ramifications and if you are
saying that we are open open for
dialogue we are we have seen what has
happened to earlier efforts you know for
a democratic process peaceful dialogue
is welcome with anybody but it cannot be
conditional it cannot be in you know
support with Pakistan
it cannot be tried back there it has to
be within the framework of the
Constitution of India okay and and Jammu
Kashmir Constitution is also bound by
that unless somebody accept this basic
premise there is no process though there
is no possibility of dialogue so I don't
think you know I don't know under under
which political or electoral
consideration Congress has come up with
these you know well this is one
conversation but let's talk about the
other provisions also or the provision
of saying that sedition and also
defamation are are out outdated they
don't think they don't need it we don't
need them anymore but the PK Mishra
let's look at the issue of sedition
itself it can be a dangerous issue even
though the state the country is you know
quite large in the terms of the
population is able to control these kind
of dissenting voices it doesn't really
it the country may have the capacity but
within it you know I mean if you allowed
these kind of streams without any law to
control it we are not quite ready for
that is it fine absolutely the manifesto
now tells that they want to repeal such
100 to 120 for a and ICC that's right I
can will tell you we have just seen what
has happened in JNU we know what is all
happening in Orissa and the Dakar in
Buster and those areas and natural
affected areas you see the look into
hardik Patel's case and so many cases
and shouting slogans against the country
against the national interest against
our natural security so what's all
happening now somebody's
helene last today we want a prime
minister first now in this way another
Prime Minister post forget about that
political part I have not knocking but
in sedition charge I'm telling you if
the law is not that if we cannot control
this type of hoodlums those who are
going against the national security
policy they have to be brought under
some circumstance they have to be kept
under control or the rights our system
however says the probe the problem
security problem of our country will be
definitely facing problem and we have to
set them right and the law must continue
and if we repeal this 124 a I hope we
are going to face a lot of problem in
those areas like what happened in JNU I
mean it is going to happen more and more
in every street it will happen so prefer
cater now again what is the political
message that or what kind of political
advantage will the Congress try and gain
by removing sedition or even saying that
it is outdated and redundant see I want
to make three quick points first of all
you know we need to understand that our
Constitution has enough protection as
far as the freedom of speech is
concerned and other freedoms are
concerned and and judiciary time and
again has interpreted them in a very
positive light to ensure free speech
right now as far as this Congress
promise is concerned there are two
inherent contradictions in this first is
we shouldn't forget that for all these
years Congress not just continued with
the Sedition law but Congress
effectively or in effectively used and
misused these laws now for take the
example of could I canal for example it
was a new it was a protest against
nuclear plant whether certain NGO
supported by external agencies were
involved or not involved one can debate
over it but not less than 6,000 cases
were registered under the same act under
UPA - okay secondly the same manifesto
the same
manifesto talks about a stringent and
strong laws against the hate crimes so
you want to bring in certain laws that
will curb individual liberty so it is it
is definitely a political strategy by
Congress to address certain sections of
the society and protect their you know
the allies that that have been
ideologically in tune with them but
again what kind of message you are
giving because you are the party who
fought during the freedom struggle you
are the party you were part of the
Constitution making process and under
the same Constitution you have governed
almost for sixty years in this country
for fifty fifty-five years in this
country after that if you are suddenly
giving this promises what kind of
message you want to give to the country
that is the real problematic issue as
far as the Sedition law is concerned
supposing a PK Mishra to play the
devil's advocate you know the Congress
is really trying to give the part of the
people and reduce the power of the
government we they would say that you
know in a you know in a sort of let's
say in a theoretical sense this is too
much power but the government is
bringing in a sort of a police state
well we should be a democracy shouldn't
be quite like that happy is that sort of
an argument even possible and under
these kind of circumstances with these
with this raw law of sedition I can well
tell you mark that if we give this type
of power to the civilians and Jamal
Allah and would draw this and repeal
this section 124 a IPC and this citizen
charges will not be there against
anybody it's very very difficult to
currency to control this type of
situation in a democratic country and
the Democrats in generally there are
enough safeguards already in the
Constitution as an already safe cause
the courts are there the institution's
already are in place and he just told
that if we a2 has already if you like it
in more than six thousand cases so the
argument of well I mean if the UPA is
doing it I had done it or if the NDA is
the question is that there is
liable to be misused is what the
Congress is saying the Congress is tell
that it may be misused in in such cases
wherever the misuse is there definitely
the people's themselves to protest they
are aware that means to look into this
and there will be political of role that
will be caught also to help us and both
the judiciary and executive the and
political combine they can help us but
this is not there just to wipe out the
sedition charges that will take us to
nowhere Praful Kate Kerr is a you know
do we require to have such a strong
state with all these provisions at this
current time or I mean is this an
interpretation that the state is strong
actually the state is normal see I I
completely agree that there is a
interpretation and this kind of
interpretation has been discussed in
various cases even in the judiciary see
please please remember that in in
nineteen forty nine itself first time
when such laws were used in independent
India court had given verdicts in favor
of individuals against the state that's
why particularly this provision in
nineteen to putting certain the
restrictions on free speech was brought
and unity and integrity of the nation
was put at the foremost and whenever
there is a threat the state and
government has a right to put certain
restrictions on such freedom so what I
am saying is there e there are
safeguards the restrictions are
specifically mentioned okay remedial
majors are suggested to approach the
court in such cases in such scenario
there can be discussion and debate about
what can be the possible amendments but
you know this kind of promise just
because something happened in certain
campuses or certain mindsets are being
exposed in last few years you are coming
with a political agenda regarding
solution case I think
this is a dangerous play oh yeah well
also let's try and put into context
mr. Mishra the the common circumstances
that we are living in we've talked about
it to a large extent but is it necessary
for the state to have you know I mean
this is this particular election is for
the government at the center and we look
at national security as a role and
function actually of the central
government is it important to have so
much power with the central government
or can these actually law and order be
maintained by the state is a state
subject otherwise national security look
into this you take into letting guests
amidst do you think even now also maybe
justice Gert maybe West Bengal maybe
Orissa may be Maharashtra it's not a
state subject now automatically it is
transferred to central forces and sent
to central government and most of the
central forces are available in deployed
in these areas so you can't always tell
there are some weights where the street
can't handle okay but in most of the
cases if state will not be able to
handle a particular law and order
situation definitely the central forces
and the central government has to
interfere and the provision is there
they have to interfere
so propagate car app spa is not really
imposed by the center it is in in
consonance with the state the state
which is having trouble with these kind
of actually approach the center and
that's when the center comes in and and
this is a necessity for the armed forces
especially to be able to fulfill their
responsibilities in bringing about law
and order in these particular disturbed
areas so this is particularly necessary
even at this time it is necessary it is
necessary to give protection to the
armed forces to perform their duty and
their duty is clearly defined in the act
itself to bring in normalcy just not
just not law and order normalcy so that
the local police and administration can
handle this but there is a bigger
contradiction in this you cannot say see
if you want to have
lesser state and lesser government and
more governance the the basic law is it
cannot be just in law an order thing it
has to be also in economic thing on the
other hand you are saying that we will
make people more dependent through
various social security schemes we will
bring in reservations even in private
sector we will know remove noise so this
is a contradictory mix ideologically it
is a contradictory approach you have to
if a state has to retreat in state has
to retreat in all fields then freedom
should be absolute can be can in a
society like India we can can we afford
really to have a complete so-called
liberal quote/unquote state that is the
key question that needs to be answered
absolutely and we live with or we leave
it at that point

fielded six women candidates for the
upcoming looks about elections in
Gujarat the Biju Janata Dal also
released a list of nine candidates on
Tuesday the list includes two candidates
for the Lok Sabha elections and seven
candidates for Isha assembly elections
Bartra hari maha table is being fielded
again from the katuk seat the state will
be voting simultaneously for 21 Lok
Sabha and 147 assembly seats and in some
more report related news now 28 lakhs of
our seats are at stake in Karnataka when
the JD's Congress government when the
farm loan waiver scheme was announced
the JD s Congress coalition government
had announced that it will help around
20 lakh farmers but the government had
allotted around 9400 crore rupees to
over 16 lakh farmers who had been
identified as the beneficiaries but so
far only 800 farmers have benefited from
the scheme and many farmers are angry as
they feel that the government has
delayed the entire process in Monday are
the farmers continued to suffer some
even taking the suicide route to end
their misery
Jenn and Hali is a small hamlet in
Mandya the village has over 300 farmers
and it seems that every house here is
under the burden of loans the streets of
Chinon Holly village are far from the
din of electioneering Madhu's farmer
father C Rajendra committed suicide four
years ago as he couldn't repay his 12
lakh rupees loan the village hasn't
forgotten Rajendra suffering nor has it
failed to note his family's ordeal of
having to run from pillar to post
seeking fair compensation and interest
reduction when kumara Swamy government
came to power it announced farm loan
waiver up to 1 lakh rupees Madhu hasn't
seen a rupee of it yet forget the
compensation or benefits we are served
with notices from banks to pay the
interest
many of us have mortgaged our lands and
this comes as a shock the state
government did nothing to support other
farmers also cite similar experiences
and speak with a bitter taste in the
mouth when farm loan papers are
mentioned for farmers they come and go
we are yet to see the benefits of loan
waiver ruling coalition leaders such as
Chief Minister St Kamala Swami's son
Nick here who's also contesting from
Mandir is having a tough time explaining
to farmers that his father cleared loans
of 15 lakh farmers but the model code of
conduct has put release of funds on hold
to make matters worse farmers in
Karnataka are also not getting the
benefit of six thousand rupees a year
under the PMT Sansom Manatee scheme as
the state government did not share its
list of beneficiaries with the centre
the anger among the farming community is
palpable the farmers are not neglected
they become lazy
government is responsible for all these
things they don't give any visitation of
the farmers they're promising they are
not to keep up their promise farmers
want government to live up to their
promises and do justice to those who
suffer at the hands of moneylenders the
incidents of serial suicides by the
farmers in Mandir district had hit the
headlines few years ago and this was a
lesson to the farmers in Mandir
that no matter what they do there was
not end and the political promises by
the leaders to wave loans and provide
compensation still remains the same
to many farmers in this district with
cameramen partha and Jay Kumar Asha
Hannam during news
Munya in some other news now India has
expressed sorrow over the loss of life
and property in the devastating
thunderstorm in Nepal the External
Affairs Minister in a statement said
that India is deeply saddened to learn
of the loss of life and the damage to
property in the devastating thunderstorm
that struck bara and parcel districts of
Nepal India and it's people's thoughts
and prayers are with all those who have
lost their dear ones sustained injuries
or suffered damage to their property the
government of India is already to
provide relief assistance as may be
required by Nepal the Indian Embassy in
Kathmandu and the consulate in bargains
are in touch with the concerned
authorities quote-unquote and more news
now from around the wall Algeria's
ailing leader Abdul Aziz but the flicka
submitted his resignation with immediate
effect after weeks of mass protests the
resignation came as after the military
demanded impeachment proceedings be
launched against both flicka immediately
as it dismissed the announcement he
would resign before his mandate expires
he's been in power for 20 long years and
had already dropped plans to seek a
fifth term as the opposition to his rule
grew the ailing leader suffered a stroke
six years ago and has rarely appeared in
public since then and hundreds of
Algerians took to the streets of the
capital L joyous to celebrate the
departure of the president after 20
years of power people waved their
country's flag cheered and sang in the
streets as cars packed streets beeping
horns and in more international
headlines now the British opposition
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn agreed to
discuss a joint brexit policy with the
British prime minister Theresa May to
resolve the current impasse Corbin
welcome May's offer of briggsie talks
but one the resolve the right to try
to bring the government down if it is
incapable of getting a majority in
parliament speaking in an interview
Corbin reiterated that his party aim to
keep a customs union with European Union
access for Britain to its single market
and protections for the workers we hold
in reserve and our right to bring a
motion of no confidence in the
government if the government proves its
incapable of commanding a majority in
the House of Commons time will tell on
that but our responsibilities the
opposition is to make sure that we don't
crash out and is I believe to make sure
that we have a government does command a
majority in the House and does indeed
come and support majority support across
the country at the moment we don't have
that u.s. president Donald Trump has

people at their southern border coming
in from Honduras and Guatemala and El
Salvador and they've they're really

it's the first time really in decades
that this has taken place and this
should have taken place a long time ago

rising create tensions and tighter
financial conditions but pauses in rate

second half of 2019 she said that the
IMF does not anticipate a recession in
the near term Lagarde described the
global economy as unsettled after two
years of steady growth with the outlook
precarious and Wallner able to trade
brexit and financial markets shocks as
well for this year we expect not 75 but
70 percent of the global economy to
experience a slowdown in growth exactly
the opposite of what we had but just to
be clear we do not see a recession in
the near term in fact we expect some
pickup in growth in the second half of
2019 and into 2020 so you see now what I
mean by unsettled and indeed the global
economy is at a delicate moment so as I
have said just like I have said please
fix the roof nobody wins a trade war
that is why we need to work together to
reduce trade barriers and modernize the
global trade system so that we all win

discovered scientists at the Center for
cellular and molecular biology have
discovered an enzyme which helps in
breaking the cell walls of bacteria and
hence offers potential for a new drug
delivery route to arrest the
antibacterial resistance to the existing
antibiotic drugs in fact scientists all
over the world are trying to understand
this phenomena and working on how the
e.coli bacteria in particular cells
function divided and grow to understand
diseases like cholera leprosy and
tuberculosis for the past decade other
bacteria to the report adds and very
important information as far as the
health is concerned have the same enzyme
working on the cell division as the cell
wall is fundamental for bacterial growth
and division therefore by blocking the
scissors enzyme from functioning new
ways to target microbes could be found
leading to a new wave of antibiotic
drugs but that it's a wrap on the

ruling Delhi as his first independent
sovereign sham Sabine bill took mesh
spread his territory far up to Bengal to
manage affairs of his ever-growing
Empire he had placed his eldest and most
capable son Nasir Uddin Mahmood as
governor of Bengal
[Music]
[Music]
but the tragedy struck
NASA within Mahmood Umayyad whom as a
successor died in a battle of lucknow t
on his deathbed who sultan saw a bleak
future with his other son Rahman Dean
Pharaohs considered a natural hire to
the throne at the helm of affairs he
decided to do an unthinkable something
which no other Emperor the court of
rulers had done in those times for
several months
her face was wheeled her swords they
flashed lightening light from behind the
screen since the sword remained in the
sheath many rebellions were left
unchecked but the Royal blow she tore
away dovey she showed her face son from
behind the screen the lioness showed so
much force that brave men bent low
before her iltutmish nominated his
daughter Rosa Sultana as the ruler of
Delhi Sultanate
she was quite extraordinary in the sense
that she had all the qualities of being
a strong ruler she gave up her attire
female attire donned the right kind of
Imperial attire and quite extraordinary
she minted coins in her name which have
survived we know that she was coronated
and lived in a palace which was called
the turquoise palace or kashi Kasab's
first of all we do a great disservice to
her by saying razia sultan she herself
said that the word sultan if added as a
suffix is used for a consort or a
princess I am at the truth Angela look
Dean Raja that was the name in which she
ascended the throne and in
name in which she struck her coins so he
should call herself ambrosia she was a
monarch in her own right not the wife of
a monarch or the just the daughter of
Amana now her rule is supposed to be
very just and a continuation of her
father's room and into a bush there's a
lot that's been written about him to
promotion all the and his governance but
there's very little written about to
what Reza actually achieved in the
foyers except that there was peace and
prosperity agriculture flourished people
flourish taxation was very just
considered much more able and qualified
than any of her brothers Gracia who
according to historical accounts lies
buried hill in Delhi's walled city with
Cookman dead
vasya was trained from childhood by her
father in warfare in administration and
statesmanship and even before he had
made his will to appoint her his
successor he had gone on a campaign to
Gwalior and at that time also he left
Delhi in charge of Razia and not in
charge of her of his sons and in his
during when he made his will he said it
to the chair the stale Ghani slaves and
he told that a pitch lazy said my
daughter is worth 20 of my sons so
obviously at that point of time it was
ability with matter mattered to him and
not the sex while the accounts of that
period wrote about capabilities and

chehon one the most important
institutions that develop under the
slave dynasty for a group of highly
placed and powerful officers whom
iltutmish and organized as his personal
supporters they were like the cabinet of
Sultan well in the beginning there were
two major ruling factions in Delhi the
Turks and the Tajiks the rulers were all
Turks and they also had offices of the
state to attacks but there was they were
also people who were not Turks the
Persian speaking people of Central Asia
who were Tajiks they were also given
leading positions they were not given
military high military positions but
they were given civilian ranks and they
were part of the civilian bureaucracy of
the Delhi Sultanate so there were two
major factions but with the passage of
time particularly after the death of
iltutmish the Turkish faction began to
assert itself at the expense of the
Tajik faction and there was a
large-scale massacre of the Tajiks
carried out by the Turks iltutmish's
Vizier nizam al-mulk Junaid II who was a
Tajik suffered heavily and so did other
Tajiks so the Turks emerged and
therefore in the absence of any other
powerful bloc emerge as the sole clique
ruling clique it was a time of recurrent
discord between the tipped successors of
iltutmish and the nobles started looking
for personal gains shrewdly pitting one
nominee against the other
and so it happened after the death of
sham Sabine iltutmish in April 12 36
nobles made a Sun rock movie in Pharaoh
shahe Sultan of Delhi
hence began the proxy rule of his mother
shahe token and in effect the rise of
selected nobles mother was shaken and
one was Shahrukh Khan and there was a
lot of rivalry between the mothers
themselves and because Reza and her
mother was the favored ones by into the
motion so when they took which type bulb
and made sure who to look on at that
time and the slaves they made sure that
Rikuo Dean came to the throne lucuma
Dean was what is called in common
language
Yash he had no interest in ruling or
governance he just wanted power and it
was his mother who was the de facto
ruler but Maha loyalist in the bond of
army she appeared before public a coatl
Aslam most she drew an instant support
were already seeding with under against
the incumbent and the gang of proxy
rulers especially during continuous hike
in taxes
shot open and asked the nobles to keep
on hiking taxes to fill their coffers
majority of what went to meet the
expenses on Rupa Dean and his vices
during one of the Friday prayers Raja
went into the ladies section of bottle
Islam mosque in the Kitab complex and
from there she came out dressed in the
clothes of her play a complainant in red
clothes and then she appealed to the
people of Delhi that your ruler your
Sultan appointed me as his successor and
these grannies have put my brother on
the throne he is not ruling you he's
cool
etc etc whatever the problems and
everybody had a grievance with
aquamobile so they agreed to what she
said recruiting at that time had gone to
kill okra for on a campaign kill okra is
Maharani Bagh at that time it seemed so
far away and he
when he came back he was captured he and
his mother were both imprisoned and they
later executed and Rajab is as a
professor Karla camera the Nizami says
that she this is such a beautiful
example of a monarch who is
democratically elected and she also
promised that in case you find any
shortcomings in me at the ruler you can
depose me anytime you want that was her
promise to the people of Delhi and
resumed the charge of sultan of delhi
the first until date the only Muslim
women to rule in Delhi firmly in subtle
she proved herself to be a sharp
politician as well under her ages the
kingdom successfully crushed the
rebellion that occurred in molten Lahore
and haci almanach Mincy Raja countered
that from territory of Lucknow t2 Duvall

manifested their obedience in submission
before rasa on the administrative side
she established in a serial college
which was headed by legendary chronicler
al Manoj bin Suraj Rosa sultanas private
life has also been a subject to intense
historical speculation while there are
passages talking about availa
bravery and administrative Taxation
reforms during arene there are passages
engraved in the annals of history that
talks about an association with an
African origin court slave jamala bean
Yakov according to our traveler Edna
Battuta Yakov was conferred with honors
and titles by Russia giving rise to
resentment against her for yaku's origin
were considered inferior by the talking
Nobles ruling at that time and so an
Abyssinian slave being given such an
important position as being made the
head of the stables which is again an
essential part of our army and also he
is a mentor to the Sultan would itself
be objectionable and that is one of the
main reasons that was used that was a I
think that went against her the fact
that she could she had the
and she had the guts and the courage to
go against the chill granny Turks who
were all powerful in themselves because
that is what they would have seen it k
had issued appointed somebody who's not
an attack means she has the independence
to work is them so you know not in any
romantic way or anything but the fact
that she is aware building against an
established order our association with
Yahoo eventually led to defenses within
the court as provincial governors
revolted among the also revolted was the
winner of patent de Maliki TR beam out
to Nia was also described as a childhood
friend Yakov was tilled and Russia was
defeated dethroned assault on Delhi in
April 1240 she was launched in a royal
prison at collabo barrack in patan de
where she had a regular visitor in
Altoona when she when she went to put in
when she fought with Molly caldonia he
imprisoned her and later on she sent a
proposal oh he sent a propose that I
know how it happened but anyway they
decided to join forces together and she
was married to him so the fight whatever
was was a political one the marriage may
have been a political alive
but very soon Razia Sultana was
preparing for another battle to take
back at phone while she was in prison
her half-brother Musa Dean param Shah
had a soaked the bubble the throne of
Delhi was once again shaking Razia
fought hard but destiny had other plans
for dealings first female ruler much
like a romantic life
there are several accounts that talk
about the last days and eventually her
death all Minaj Road that both Russia
and Altoona were robbed and killed by
thoughts and ruled to cattle while some
account claims they were executed by
param shah Farishta when he was writing
I think in 1620s something and he was
writing he said that Raja was better
than Keitel now how why Cathal I have no
idea because in 13th century when Rocha
not 3034 14th century when ferocious

one village he says is bull Gauri Khan

asked more authoritative accounts she
lies buried at all daily his Turkmen

[Music]
said to have died poeple and most wild
Zoltan driven to hunger and fatigue
faded away in solitude during her sleep
she's believed to have died on October
13 ill 12:14 that gives a very
interesting description is there that
when she came she came here to fight
with her husband she had come they had
come from Bhatinda to fight her and the
husband was killed and she was left for
dead I think when she was fighting
against her brother Behram and somewhere
in this area of man foul she asked a man
for some food and he seemed that she was
dressed in the clothes of a warrior and
a very good expensive clothes she looked
like a man he killed her and stripped
her of her clothes and then realized
that she's a girl and when he the people
were called they recognized her as ogia
so when she was found dead some way here
I'm the question was a disciple of shia
turkmen
he got her bare he did all the funeral
rites for her got it done and he buried
her here the death of Raja was followed
by a 6-year period of political
uncertainty after two years of Baron
Charles rule the nobles made iltutmish
grandson allowed them Masood the Sultan
of Delhi and after four years of rule in
1246 his half uncle Nasiruddin Mahmood
took over the throne of delhi during
this period the turkish nobles an army
general baldon became very powerful 20
years later in 1266 after death of
nazareth beam bulb on became the sultan
of delhi sultanate the descendants of
iltutmish including rezian including
Nasir Uddin Mahmoud who was the last of
the rulers of iltutmish's
progeny they were all more or less
controlled by these Nobles balbin
emerged as a major figure in this
so-called clique of 40 Turks
so much so that Barney says that
Nasiruddin Mahmoud was a puppet nimona
in his hands and it was he it was bulb
and who was a noble with the title of
han lu lu han who was the real ruler so
the de facto ruler was balbin whereas
the DCO ruler was less irredeemable
these ruins at mayor only are the only
remnant of his rule a Turkic warrior of

there were accounts that when he assumed
charge so Thorne Baldwin murdered some
of them while others were banished from
his kingdom the Bible followed a very
deliberate policy of consolidating what
he already had then expanding the domain
of his kingdom that he systematically
pursued throughout the 22 years of his
reign he was busy consolidating power in
the vicinity of Delhi launching
campaigns against rebellious local
rulers also trying to build some kind of
an alliance with the local rulers based
mostly on a policy of force and violence
but he was not terribly interested in
expanding the domain of his Sultanate
and in fact in a conversation recorded
in a historical text somebody suggested
why was he not conquering territories
which were worth conquering and annexing
then he laid out this policy that he
would rather stay put and built a stable
Kingdom in the territory which he was
already holding then stretch beyond
those so he was not a great expansionist
in that sense establishing an effective
espionage system and network of cunning
spies the Sultana belli made sure that
everyone was loyal to the crown baldwin
model is caught on the lines of the
court of Persia with every visitor had
to prostrate themselves before salt on
the practice of formal sajda began here
in the words of muhammad qasim fereshta
in the retinue of those princes were the
most famous men from learning war Arts
and Sciences that Asia at that time
produced the court of India and the days
of Melbourne is reckoned the most polite
and magnificent in the world all the
philosophers poets and Divine's formed

preside at those meetings
among the fork lures his new residency
now in ruins located at Mohali
archeological park once was a city of
splendor with markets of gold on both
sides of the pathway leading to what is
now his tomb well the major buildings in
the cut of murali city were built by ill
Turkish and after you tooth wish there
was another round of construction but
that was not certainly not during
Melvin's time the city of Delhi if you
want to point to a city centre and if
you take the the Citadel the Imperial
Palace in the Citadel as the heart of
the political part of Delhi then that
was the Red Palace which bill balbin had
built in Delhi Kashi canal as his
residence when he was a noble but after
he became Sultan he started residing in
the Red Palace and then the Red Palace
became the Imperial Palace when Jalal
Udine LG took the took power in his
hands he went to the Red Palace
dismounted in front of the palace as he
used to do as the officer of the Turks
and somebody actually asked him why you
were doing that you are now the Sultan
and it's your residence you don't have
to dismount as previously and he said
that look I have been doing it for so
long I just don't feel like entering the
palace and sitting on the throne of my
master so from this episode we know that
there was this Red Palace which was
built earlier as the residents of a
leading noble and later as imperial
palace his over two decades so I am
constantly increasing the prestige and
power of the monarchy for he felt that
it was the only way to face the internal
and external dangers challenging him but
after the death of Baldwin in the ER
1287 a struggle for the throne started
which eventually pulled the curtains
enslaved the Nestea rule in Delhi as
both his sons were killed in the battle
bald man shows his grandson Gekkos row
as higher apparent but his scream shows

gained a stronghold

promises and to his credit he was not

launched across it Katya Katya keno
JaJuan called John Kelly come kegger
only because Kerrigan clearly no party
and no leader is sparing any effort to
ensure that election fever keep speaking
before reaching a crescendo on the last
day of campaigning in each of the seven
phases nears night disk D D news and
let's find out how the entire process of
the elections is being moved right now
as far as the state of Telangana is
concerned Americans my colleague on a
correspondence joining us on the phone
line from Hyderabad oh my god the PM
held a rally in Secunderabad there neat
talked a lot a lot of his focus was on
development and how his governments you
know attract record contrast with that
of Casey as a government which got a
resounding mandate in 2018 itself so how
is how the people really taking this
entire a bid of the bgb to make inroad
into Telangana right now keeping this
factor in mind that the TRS had a very
good performance just last year in the
assembly polls well if you look at the
entire election we are just nine days to
go for the polling and considering apart
from the five yeah it seems that we're
not able to get in touch with ROM
accounts at the moment we will try and
reconnect a little later for the moment
let's let's turn to our in focus which
is of course about Monday 2019 and
that's just ten days to go as far as the
first phase opponents concern and we
have in our studio our rajagopal encinas
journalist a frequent guest good evening
to you mr. rajagopal and how do you see
the elections are poised at this phase
the first phase very crucial especially
in a state like Uttar Pradesh which
could set the toll for the entire entire
state which is of course produces the
largest number of seats the rajah skitty
and that in itself is quite crucial not
to mention assembly elections three
states completely being decided in the
first phase itself in Risha also having
assembly elections although it's in four
phases from 1971 onwards this is my
tenth election I must new credence cup a
kudos to the Election Commission because
so far there is no violence but Election
Commission is facing immense problem
from the money distribution for example
in Tamil Nadu in Jalandhar in
darken so many places there are 17 to 18
complaints and total as for the Election
Commission's recourse thousand of cores
of rupees have been seized so these are
all said it's not just money it's liquor
it's a lot of value is like gold and of
course drugs too
I come from a state of Tamil Nadu where
you get everything free spits swinging
machine fridge refrigerator even cooker
even mixi these are all certain freebies
they are giving in Parliament even in
Parliament I am shocked to learn today
the DMK treasurer bears house 20 crore
rupees were seized and to 200 rupee note
500 rupee notes were seized the point is
they are given installments Gautam till
elections are over
they separated three they take creation
card from you as a pledge and they give
you 200 rupees after you are voting you
get 300 and they return the relation
card it's interesting how the peg comes
from what's happened today itself how
things have gone beyond money power into
the AIDS in the space of cyberspace what
happened as far as Facebook in the
Congress is concerned right now the
Congress is saying that we we need to
evaluate first and then even say
anything about it and get a piece
accusing that they learned is from
Cambridge analytical side because I
t-cell of Congress has been doing this
type of faking that one for example Modi
go back in Tamilnadu trended but the
French and Pakistan's are the initiators
so therefore this say it can be
generally Ticker taught them how to do
this type of thing coming back to the
point of 10 days we had to have for
electioneering it is going very well we
must give compliments to the Election
Commission for trying because the third
Direction Commissioner mr. Sudhir child
was in the CBD tea very recently
therefore he knows as a chairman what
are all the weakness weak points of the
political parties that is the reason why
in Andhra Pradesh in Karnataka in Tamil
Nadu
lots of raids are taking place the black
money not only the black money the
distribution of 500 rupee notes and even
then
the Election Commission has deputed a
retired chairman of a nationalized Bank
so that he understands how that money
system works how that financial with the
toil of money deposit of money so these
are all certain things apart from the
electioneering today Prime Minister's
rally was well attended in andhra
pradesh and telangana and prime
ministers focus was on you know even if
you have noticed very well Prime
Minister said Chandra Babu is a u-turn
Babu
that is why you shall dragon lady's
sister
Sharmila just now said bye bye Babu so
these are all certain score catchy
slogans which are picking up
apart from that today in Delhi many
newspapers were all saying about these
bouncers or you know he employed
deployed by the candidates and Election
Commission Delhi Police have taken
objection to that type of bouncers
because they threaten the waters they
try to intimidate the waters or the
opposite party supporters like that
so therefore the Election Commission is
facing immense ones you've gone to
bouncers it has come like that but it is
very developing the economy of ours
especially today mr. Arun Jaitley also
said GST collection was immense
yeah how do we have to have this type of
curtains the government is giving yes
and it's a rotting tahan t-midi pradesh
former Chief Minister held the press
conference in BJP headquarters and
accused
commoners government of giving that free
dole Rahul Gandhi dude what I like of
the speculation around Sri Racha on that
he could be standing for elections
themselves yeah but because thing is in
the fray now very tough how many years
ago he was chief minister
yeah I'm second thing there is an
internal tug of war between Congress
Kemal not Chief Minister Kamal Nath
and also the Ajay Singh so therefore the
group is Armenia many political parties
that it's not only new to the Congress
political parties the without group
isn't it's not a democratic political
party
so therefore the originating candidate
it is going to be very interesting
and today mr. Mallen singing other you
know the pradesh filed is nomination so
therefore this role today
important day we have got another
ten days first race will be over at
least one fifth of the Parliament
election process will begin in the under
ten days is going to be a very bright
democracy it's a dance of democracy
because I have covered this Parliament
elections for a longer time my
understanding is it is going to be the
best election because it is supervised
by the three Election Commissioners very
well I hope that what you are saying
very base out towards the end right up
to counting they own a 23rd of May but
we've got a long way to go let's talk a
bit more about the politics of what is
happening around these elections the
Prime Minister for the first time
perhaps after you know that some jatha
were it mentioned you know to his
inferences from that and said that what
he had to say about the Congress how do
you think that issue will resonate with
the people and do you think that that's
a an appeal that would really really you
know stick in the minds of people as
well or people could find the it
objectionable as where the opposition
certainly would the objection so
definitely a welcome sign from the
opposition parties my understanding is
today everything started mr. Amit Shah
observations as soon as Prime Minister's
observations because of Y&R do yesterday
Rahul Gandhi's decision to contest from
why now to Southern District southern
states Kerala because that created this
Hindu throw one and Prime Minister walls
in Maharashtra where he took on formal
Home Minister minister Sushil Kumar
Shinde therefore he brought the word
Hindu terror how you can coin and he
compared it with some yota Express press
mr. Rahul Gandhi's contest from via Nadu
created an amount of you know enthusiasm
among the congressmen but that reonardo
is consisting of sixty percent minority
votes
there's who BJP says Rahul Gandhi chose
that particular constancy because he is
not comfortable with committee and
therefore he was driven out of a media
you know all that in all that the PM
said do you think there's a ground for
say the Congress any of the opposition
party to once again go knock on the
doors of the Election Commission saying
it's a it's a problem there's some
problem there
they will definitely go like they went
for even for this is one of the a set
and also he's biopic that cinema which
is going to be today Delhi High Court
has said they have given permission to
be released on April 5th therefore
opposition has a role in the election
and also in the democracy they have
every reasons to knock on the doors of
Election Commission but the Prime
Minister's concentrated speech today on
Hindu tois is going to set the trend at
least in some parts of Maharashtra
without that there is no BJP Shoshanna
can be whipping up the Hindu votes that
is the concentration because Sushil
Kumar Shinde is also contesting yes the
election because he coined the word
Hindu terror therefore you have to take
on him and the Samba Express judgement
was also there and everyone started to
criticize you questioned there was a
minister there for prime minister
focused on that every time the best part
of Prime Minister Narendra Modi six
seven prime ministers in close quarters
but Mr Modi analyzes the speech for the
next 2-3 days and he sometimes gets a
point and elaborates it with his team of
no speech writers suggestions research
team like that so his team of
researchers are doing the very job very
well whichever state prime minister
receives those things will be pointed
out and he himself remembers because in
2014 it is he who crafted that and given
that kampol campaign strategies 2019 is
also being the same copybook off for
2014 election campaigns apart from that
the BJP
single largest party which is having the
majority in the Lok Sabha doing the
direction campaigned very well and it
that momentum has picked up Gotham okay
and what do you make of what's happening
as far as the Maha
in Bihar is concerned today it seems
that it's brother versus brother in law
who you are there's a party the younger
one saying the the elder one I'm sorry
saying that he's going to part ways and
launch a baby munch he's going to rob
breed every month
he's just jostling for some space no
it's not serious no one takes him
serious because you know he takes some
sort of Krishna Vitara immediately he
puts a snake around his neck and he says
shishu back so therefore he's also
attracted he has got some sort of in a
crowd for him a section of society going
after theta Prakash Singh but on this
tree take this tree has that political
control of our LD and Mahajan but then
you ask me a question JD r JD y
Alleluias oh sorry sorry and hug that
but then things are happening only in
Bihar because the other places for
example I am Telling You mr. Rahul
Gandhi's decision to contest from
vanadyl was had provoked a lot of
reactions from CPM you have one set of
mahogany in Madhya Pradesh and other
places in the adjacent state of Tamil
Nadu CPM and Congress having alliances
livid Pinar a vision has thread that we
will defeat him Prakash Karat has also
gone on record that we will defeat mr.
Rahul Gandhi therefore it is a political
points are heating up in Kerala today
Shashi Tharoor has also filed his
nomination from Thiruvananthapuram it's
a very prestigious seat all seats all
543 are very important though some but
select some 15 or 20 or more crucial one
among them is by an order because Rahul
Gandhi chose living amethyst suppose if
he wins in both places
my understanding is which seat will like
it tell me go to Vegas
no I would never see these resins from
MIT so he means to say sorry nodded and
Amity
if he leaves Ryan out of the seat which
is south it will be a problem therefore
he has double mind which seat
relieving relinquishing we have to wait
and watch and the things thought very
interesting days are ahead for another
two months is going to be a very crucial
political correspondence like me who
ever served this you know Parliament for
more than thirty forty years I
understand this election is going to be
a very major election 2019 is digital
election first time voters who are going
to face elections yesterday even in May
chalkida um campaign may prime minister
also spoke that first time water should
not be misled by false promises you
compare my five years with ten years of
you pee and then you decide that is the
slogan Prime Minister has given and he
gave it you know he said whatever
achievements he has given and the Prime
Minister also says I am the one Prime
Minister who gives report card
suppose he files some khalsa Sydney from
the foundation to the meaning of support
project he has been monitoring every
project of the Government of India is in
the tips of mr. fring fingers of Prime
Minister Narendra Modi the reason is he
reviews with Pragathi he reviews with
the officers whenever he goes to a state
he goes to the particular despite a site
of the project and ensures that project
is completed within the time frame work
and he also said five major things he
has done in named Burnley you know you
had seen that word memorial National War
Memorial which is an icon of a Delhi
plus dr. Ambedkar's yes centenary
celebration building Indian path which
is also an iconic building so therefore
these are all certain achievements plus
Sardar Patel statue what he built in
Gujarat the things are there similar
think about the North East as well
because in the first phase you have our
naturalization Sikkim and assembly polls
are going there and not these the BJP is
concentrating according to the Prime
Minister's office I have one or two very
interesting things for DD viewers to be
shared with the thing is Prime Minister
in 2015 issued a circular that all the
ministers of his Council of Ministers
should visit one day in northeastern
province in a month so therefore because
there is also a political catch
that Gautam the reason is in Uttar
Pradesh BJP has got 73 seats the after
this Miami tea Akhilesh get burnt then
BJP has internal apprehension that they
may be winning or losing 20 seats how to
make up that so not least since 2015-16
onwards Prime Minister began to forecast
that we inverted Malaysia if we lose
certain amount of seats we have to
compensate it from northeastern states
that is the difference even in Telangana
for example that the PM was there today
the BJP wants to get at least eight to
nine seats whether it'll get it or not
is another matter but it's making an
all-out effort similarly in order to
late BJP I say announced the why now to
candidate way that they will not lose
they are going to give a tough fight to
Rahul Gandhi because now BJP and CPM may
have to campaign against Rahul Gandhi
and that is the predicament Rahul Gandhi
has given it to CPM till yesterday CPM
in Congress were friendly - against
Narendra Modi today they're both of them
are accusing that in the ramadi see the
funny part of the opposition unity there
is no opposition unity there is no
Mahajan but then split in mahogany but
then center about Naidu who initiated
this he has Morocco he was making the
point today that you know at least there
are formidable formations of the
opposition not just necessarily with the
Congress in the in that mix but there
are formidable formations of parties
opposed to the BJP in the NDA so he was
trying to make that argument having
closely observed consider argument
gautam having closely observed congress
for many years my understanding of
politics is congress is the group to the
opposition unity muhammad bent then if
you don't bring him congress there is no
amma hog abandon their food
rahul gandhi's miss application of mind
him bringing the you know opposition to
a one table it is cease failure and he's
not even in states where the Congress
could just bring in 5 percent 5 percent
could make a huge difference even say it
be hard where the Congress might be
although its vote chair is diminished to
Allah I wouldn't say 5% but it has
diminished but it brings something to
the table it will definitely bring in to
the table but Congress will get
two-digit seats in Karnataka
baki other states I have a feeling that
it will not cross single digit therefore
totally if in 2019 if Congress crosses
the present strength of 44 which every
extra that is plus point for Rahul
Gandhi and Congress leaders will hail
the leadership of Rahul Gandhi even if
he stays with 60 or 70 seats in 2019 Lok
Satta for Congress oh we have to see it
still a lot of time to go but the first
phase could set this down and the the
most important as far as tone setting
goes would be the eight seats that are
going to pose interpretation how do you
see the situation shaping up over there
oh you today is very interesting place
because Prime Minister concentrated on
two rallies you know today's yogi is not
has been given a you know he is unable
to go to other states for canvassing
because seven faces are up there like
mum type energy Yogi's also facing
problem because mamta Banerjee has got
six seven phases total she can't go out
of West Bengal for any other part of
country for the election campaign
similarly yogya it's not though they
heard interesting things yogi as it now
has done a best it is also a test case
for Congress train car Gandhi has also
taken some 42 seats that for it is also
test case for Prem cos leadership give
Creon card as well will Congress project
Priyanka Gandhi STF of Congress so
therefore this internal problem she
noticed from somewhere yes he may or she
may not contest he said that she will
come to us even from our own I see so we
have to wait and watch me that she gets
that strength do you think there was
even a little bit serious in what you
said about oneness I don't think
yeah we can't vary travel eyes it it's a
vegetal dope because she was not serious
she is not serious because her husband
walked out today got bailed from the
anticipatory veil from the daily course
that foot that is an extra I get for
Priyanka Gandhi whenever he goes did
Vadra campaign is also along with her
the opposition which Irvin a he goes
they speak about Robert Vadra so that is
a - point for her mm-hmm well Robert
Vadra keeps on saying that nothing isn't
Rovin against him is yet but he may be
really counting days as far as that fact
is concerned not wait and see how things
go and what does fate will only be
relevant to the 23rd of May or even
before that last phase of falling
pulling radiates because Priyanka Gandhi
has taken over the full control of
Congress that by all riding overtaking
the Ruggles image also dream car if you
were one of Congress because Rahul
Gandhi has been delegated to suppose if
all the three mothers and daughter come
the the attraction will be only 33% you
know so mother has got the Bakke 66
percent 33 they are having it now each
it's a it's early days early days to see
how things shape up as far as the
internal diamond dynamics of the
Congress is concerned because Priyanka
Gandhi has just stepped into active
politics we thought she had mean that
what their 15 years ago
gautam yeah she has been their driver
alien weighty but a full-fledged role
active political role is only now but we
will see how things go thanks a lot for
joining us this evening
Thank You Raja and well we're moving on
to of course still politics as far as
these elections concerned but politics
of a different nature because political
parties taking part in the docks of our
polls may be brainstorming over their
manifestos but assam's children are
ready with their own agenda for the
general elections don't be surprised
let's see a detailed report about this
manifesto prepared by children
meet javi socket on a student of class
line besides telling other children
about the election manifesto Assam is
the first such state in India where
children have prepared the election
agenda through this they are demanding
from the political parties that they
should also include children's issues in
their manifestos issues like education
health and cleanliness special
arrangements of sanitary pads for girls
in schools have been given prominence in
the children's manifesto to make
Bahuguna sediba - kolima hot upon
admission akale they say a shiksa
upon Thames everstik as I'm gonna say
Lucy Cooper gets it back you wanna play
a manifesto me Pakeha Marisa vision add
curd if the population of children in
Assam is about 1.5 crore 21
non-government organisations have
collectively brought together the
state's children for election manifesto
program however the children were
neither given any directions for
deciding the issues nor any changes have
been made in their agenda some kid
dinner plans me jaha my bassoon a muñeca
problem Deborah may search a Kia War
Circle K kia kia chatter hey whoa cha
cha cha or lost a december may appeal
the Archaea jo hoon hoon a political
party Bobadilla
the children are meeting the leaders of
BJP congress and other political parties
to get the demands fulfilled part is to
are talking about including the
children's issues in their manifestos on

hello I will welcome to the brand-new
edition of policy watch I'm Christie
Michelle today we've moved beyond the
confines of our s TV studios in the
national capital streaming to you from
Andhra Pradesh's with Chaka Putnam and
in this episode we'll take a closer look
at the National mineral policy 2019 this
policy will ensure effective regulation
and sustainable development of the
mining sector and under Pradesh is one
of the storehouses of mineral wealth in
India so let's begin the discussion and
on the show joining me is mr. K Kumar
Raja
vice chairman on the Pradesh Chamber of
Commerce and Industry and also joining
me is mr. Naresh president of Vizag
Development Council mr. Raja let me come
to you first because of geological
formations on the pradesh contains rich
and variety of industrial minerals and
also building stones
how important is national mineral policy
for under Kadesh in particular and for
the country in general firstly we
welcome the national policy on the
minerals which is taken up by the
Government of India national monopoly
2019 from chamber of commerce site we
welcome it as you rightly said on the
padishah has got a lot of potential is
mineral rich state has got a lot of
minerals natural resources he's got a
1000 kilometres of coastline and our
state is the power sir place so
transporting the minerals through water
channels is much cheaper and economical
than the conventional methods so that
will boost up the transfer my mean
economy next it comes to the processing
of the minerals as well if we can do the
processing in in the Andhra Pradesh and
who ascended because we have the
supplies power and industry and
enterpreneur wise our state has got many
number so allowed India if you look at
it that most of the idea pioneers are
from Andhra Pradesh so a lot of
potential is
for the holidays mr. naresh how will
this policy ensure sustainable
development of the mining sector and
also address the problems and the issues
of people residing in the tribal areas
see as you are aware both in Andhra
Pradesh and in India most of the
minerals are in hilly regions are places
where tribals are there where
development has not taken place either
physical interaction is not there or
even the social interaction is not in
place unfortunately lack of a proper
mining policy and proper regulation has
led to illegal mining and people
excavating and exploiting tribals with
the new national mineral policy in place
one of the best points is protecting the
interests of tribals they come out with
a policy called national mineral
development fund for the District
Development Fund so every district where
you mine minerals they are setting about
Mendel fund you have to pay royalty
suppose it was 2015 it was earlier to
2015 you have to pay 30% of the entire
proceeds as royalty for the development
of the district that's the fantastic
feature what about by this body
government if it is after 2015
you pay 10% because the values you may
ask why it's only 10% because the value
of the auction proceeds are much higher
in 2015 because of the transparency and
better auction proceeds the volume of
money that's coming in is multiple times
compared to the earlier auction in this
thing so they have come out of the frame
the 10% of the entire revenue earned
from the mining is given to the district
it is imagine not the country not the
state to the particular district where
it's mine hi my name is taking place so
the 10% fund from the 2015 policy and
earlier to that is 30 percent royalty
this alone they have calculon 3500
crores of money is available for helping
the district develop and helping the
project displaced people let me take the
example of Orissa which has got the
highest amount of district mineral fund
just in 30 districts of Orissa they've
collected close to 40 hundred and 50
crores this fund
so yes you know what is one of the most
backward states in the country the
utilization of this fund is specifically
target for the district and the Prime
Minister's come out to the specific team
called the PM triple KY scheme this
helps improve the not only the basic
amenities like water
reducing pollution increasing healthcare
in the cloaca area increasing education
levels creating skill levels among the
population and also what sustainable
development sustainable development is I
also created a concept of not only this
mineral fun but also intergenerational
equity one you caught our
intergenerational there are also setting
up a fund not only this generation but
future generations also will be taken
care because if you just exploit this
wealth now and destroy the environment
the future generations are impacted so
there is a study being done what will be
the impact of this mining on the future
generations and what we can do to
protect it so they're putting in steps
to see that these people are also
developing the local area is being
developed because of even though the
minerals are bought throughout the
country are exported also first the
district develops that's the outstanding
each one if you see if 30% of the
revenue is going only for development of
a district you will not see over
exploitation of resources and when that
kind of fund is put into place you will
have knowledgeable people coming into
there and then sustainable development
happening where people will see that the
environment is not destroyed if you see
some areas earlier in like Karnataka
very illegal mining was happening they
used to destroy the environment
completely they just you should dig up
dig up dig up the water water levels
used to go down the pollution levels
used to go up relays this used to be
affected a all these things cannot
happen now because there is a fund not
only to develop that also to bring in
awareness levels and to prove the skill
level whence knowledge comes into the
area
it is not possible to exploit people
exploitation happens to an educational
step so the large part is expertise also
in educating these people and also
imparting skills I feel this is the most
significant part transporting it by a
waterway is reducing taxes rationalizing
taxes one part but actually empowering
the district like I said in India the
highest amount of one out of three
thousand finite crores only fifty nine
it across has gone to Orissa which is
the most backward state so I think this
is a very good initiative and the
utilize a layer also this was there but
the utilization is now done through the
PM wky scheme where at least sixty
percent goes only for creation of basic
infraction
the forty percent goes for sustainable
thing like you know for irrigation
allowed areas to bring in a holistic
development area so they are not only
talking about the health care
and sanitation but also to improve
irrigation facilities in that area forty
percent of the fund is earmarked for
that they saw they have clear-cut
benchmarks sixty percent for water
supply health care sanitation forty
percent for agriculture and so overall
development so I think this policy you
have to commend the government for
coming out with the policy only thing is
if we implement it properly I think this
will be very good for the economic
progress of not only the district and
the particular state for the entire
country so it is important to ensure the
fruits of development percolate our
words but there's also another important
feature mr. Roger of this policy and
this policy talks about planting
industry status to the mining activity
now how important is industry status for
the development of the mining sector
yeah this will definitely will help this
policy had given the provision to give
the excess resources which is lying with
public sector to the private sector
which public sector could not utilize
the private sector can make use of it
and bring more output that way it will
help and secondly once the entrepreneur
goes for a institutional financier bank
finance what is industry status it's
much easy to get and many companies can
merge and become a giant company merging
is possible so access to finance will
become easier talking about another
major highlight and that is of mineral
corridors
now mr. neary sure this policy talks
about creating mineral corridors in
India what's the roadmap ahead for
creating such corridors I think that's a
good initiative of talking about mineral
corridors is first you identify which
states are rich in minerals and then
create a corridor for easy
transportation of goods through the
mineral corridors
and here we had moment of cargo either
through national highways or airports or
ports now this national mineral new
policy talks about using cost in inland
coastal corridors and waterways for
transportation of goods so once this
effective master plan in place like I
said there are 12 big states in India
which are mineral each out of the ten
states all two Indian states don't have
so if you focus on ninety percent of the
minerals come from twelve percent of the
states if these twelve states
our integrated wherever possible through
the Inland Waterways or the portlet
development obviously they're connected
by the national heavy so the national or
the point we talked about is mineral
corridors are in two categories one
connected by rail connected by Road
connected by ports the fourth element is
the inland waterways which is not yet
taken off so far
once that takes off you will have cost
of transportation being less cost of
pollution being less and being had
bringing down the cost of minerals in
the eventual and in increase in their
export revenue so the national mineral
corridors when they are defined it will
facilitate easier movement of cargo and
also consolidation of warehouses like
where units talk from which port you
will get up so I think now each state
and each institutional player had his
own way like up suppose I have a mind in
Misaka bottom I will just send it off to
them through be shocked but report one
minor or I will send it through or
support one in Gouda so integrated
policy will also lead to warehousing
you'll have in the National middle
corridor you will have warehouses and
important points in important ports on
important national highways on important
national waterways so you can have when
you input there is some import component
this is some export component some
finished product which will involve it
so overall in a holistic policy when you
both input and export this national
mineral corridor will facilitate I feel
low transportation cost better
utilization of resources better storage
facilities and faster output if it's
tracked on a national level instead of
being tracked at a local state level of
renter up on the level so national
mineral corner I would definitely
recommend there's a separate task force
put up for seeing that actually benefits
are passed on so the nation benefits
earlier there was no proper tracking
like each state had a different policy
each and reporter purse tracking but in
the national called or you can actually
track where the minerals are getting
delayed which ports are delaying it up
where their robotics for example most of
the minerals are in tribal areas how can
we facilitate movement of minerals from
tribal area to the mainland through
waterway or through the railway through
rail network or road network or portlet
network so this kind of planning if it's
done at the national level that
information can be particulate it down
and the funds can be
National Highways and mr. categories in
world if we tell him that even though
there is not much transport in from one
area to one year there's a lot of
revenue coming into the country
if you facilitate moment of this cargo
and a new national highway or a new
state highway may be sanctioned for that
area similarly if you go to the railways
mr. Speers goal there is no need for a
railway line because there is no
passenger moment in that area but if you
know there are huge minerals lying in
that area and that minerals need to
murdered for better realization of money
and there thousands of crores of money
in fact if you see we sharpen our
railways on ninety percent the revenue
comes from cargo when it ten percent
comes from passenger traffic so if the
government knows that because of the
mineral called our minerals can be
evacuated either through a rail line
which is much cheaper directly to the
port so this way facilitation of a
national mineral corridor will involve
the Ministry of shipping Ministry of
Highways Ministry of Railways working
integrated Li where you'll exactly know
where the revenue is how much of revenue
is coming and you can prioritize earlier
you never do because if or is a
politician asks you
they make Arabian zone may go to or say
for another politician ask you make it a
railway line for Andhra in there you can
have a transparent policy of which
district is contributing the highest
revenue to the nation and you can
prioritize either your rail network or a
road network or a port network to that
area to see that cargo and resources are
allocated mode for integrated
development of that area and firstly
evacuation from that area so task force
must be set up for developing mineral
corridors in the country mr. Raja mr.
Naresh mentioned about Windell
Development Fund now how will this
policy ensure effective utilization of
that fault basically it is from the
bureaucracy level there should be
transparency
everything should be put on the net so
even enterpreneurs can see and
government also can watch so that
transparency will come like this where
funds can be utilized properly and also
so how important is database maintenance
for the progress of this sector
acquiring data and consolidating it and
putting in one place definitely it will
help the entrepreneurs and as well as to
the coordinate and you will help the
entrepreneurs to have a transparent
building
and every entrepreneur can know where
exactly which type of mineral is
available and they can plan their
industry accordingly database is the
basic requirement for any activity also
mr. Nareesha there's lot of focus on
encouraging private partnership how will
this policy ensure private participation
in exploration see government sector
exploitation generally in the government
is now moving towards a core areas money
has to come in from the private sector
one particular area is earlier public
sector units or government units had
access to natural resources but they
were not utilizing this for some reason
this new mineral policy has said that
whichever public sector Enterprise has
access to vast amounts of natural
reserves and which are not being
utilized for the last few years or few
decades will be put to auction by the
government or the PSU for opening up for
private sector investment private sector
is obviously profit driven but also
efficiency driven right so if we have
large amounts of minerals and natural
natural resources not being exploited
when especially the country needs money
for you know for embodying for creating
employment or for improving the health
care you cannot allow just people to
sleep on natural resources so earlier
there were some publics because of lack
of money or lack of decision making
private sector wins in both faster
decision-making faster access to capital
and speedy implementation and faster
import-export so opening up of areas
which were earlier not there and also
granting industry status giving them
access and now now the government
allowed to mining companies to merge
they allowed taker of mining companies
they allowed Indian mining companies to
take or assets abroad globally now we
have access to global capital so by
allowing private entrepreneurs to do
these things in a transparent manner it
is open for every Indian patriotic
Indian citizen to use his intelligence
and the facilities the government of
India is given to actually exploit these
resources for benefit of the nation and
for when for the entire population so
earlier this is not being done because
of lack of decision-making and lack of
funding sometimes people did not
two ferns now they have some access to
both and they have access to policy now
the difference is they have access to
policymaking which they're allowed to
know their access to funds being given
industry changes they can merge come and
they are also access to assets which are
blocked for public sector now they're
opened up for private sector in a
transparent way so nobody can excuse
anybody that was one particular person
is being favored because it's in
transparent only an option so it's
freeing up Africa bringing natural
resources to public good so that way a
private entrepreneur may his first
edition making by his intelligence and
by his ability to raise funds at a very
competitive global competitive rate
which a PSU may not have been able to do
it quickly so an opponent can raise
global funds and also access his
contacts use his resources to tie up
with foreign people quickly and export
these materials and cash in on the
global boom whenever it occurs I think
that way this policy has done a lot to
empower private sector to utilize the
reserves source of this country but
there's another important component and
that is of Taxation mr. Raja how will
this policy harmonized taxes levies and
royalties and also make the entire tax
structure very stable yeah with the
introduction of GST almost it is
organized because earlier we used to
have customs duty excise duty and road
tax and all these things now the one
takes one nation it has come but still
this royal teapot affected most of the
states I mean different states have
different rate of royalties I think that
is one point government has to think and
there to being a rationalized a rate of
the royalties that will have uniform
idea for the entrepreneur to bid
anywhere without much depth of
investigation on it also this policy
talks about a long term export and
import policy for the sector how will
that incentivize large-scale commercial
mining in the country see long term
export policy can be drawn up first if
you have if you understand what you have
and then how you mind what you have and
then how you move them across and how
you can so the first thing they have
done is you talked about databases
earlier they're creating the national
database of all the minerals we have if
you have gold in Karnataka
why are we importing gold I'll give an
example suppose we were importing tons
and tons and tons of gold because gold
is cheaper to import than to produce
here and we also put a 10% import you -
what if you have the long-term export
policy first you have to reduce the
imports and increase the imports so if
even if the cost of mining this gold is
slightly higher than the global cost
government benefits by fuel costs but
GST talk if these if you provide some
subsidy or additional incentive for
goods which are being input input
substitutes suppose government becomes
the Commerce Minister comes up with a
policy of import substitution every year
suppose we are importing thousands and
thousand tonnes of gold because our cost
of production of gold if you actually
mine here is little higher then if
somebody is mining in Australia so far
we don't have a policy that why should
we buy gold and send out our entire
money out of this country for buying
gold at 30 lakhs a kilo so we are
sending or 30 lakh rupees for every kg
of gold we are importing from Australia
or Ramana mine in South Africa suppose
it was costing us 32 lakhs to actually
mined that so because we are 5 to 10
percent higher we are not mining that
and because this mine is going to shut
down and we are allowing input of gold
if the government subsidizes the
commerce ministry subsidizes this gold
cost by two legs you will see if 30 less
going out of this country
understood what I meant so no you need
two things not only boosting the exports
was also curtailing exports and also
coming about the policy for import
substitution first if you create the
database database of all the minerals
available in the country and why these
minerals in spite of being in the
country are being allowed input into
this country
why are they being allowed inputted his
country because they are available
globally at a cheaper rate than if you
my in them in India but if they're only
if the if the cost of mining in India is
only 10 to 20 percent higher then
importing them instead of allowing the
entire hundred percent of our money
going out for importing this metal if he
subsidized this by 10 20 percent in the
government anyway makes this 10 20
percent when the people use their fuel
or you know they use as the pay state
taxes or their employees pay taxes the
employment generation and the money
generated to the Government of India
we'll be offset by the 1020 percent
subsidy they provide so as the first
step I would recommend the entire
database which is their way it's a good
thing they're making the database of all
the minerals in this country then you
should make a database of all the
minerals that are being input into this
country and the database of materials
being exported out of this country now
why are we importing
some minerals which we can mine in this
country so why is the cost of mining
higher what makes the cost of mining
higher suppose the cost of wages higher
now we have this MNREGA scheme Mahatma
Gandhi National Rural Employment you are
giving funds to farm laborers you can
give that money to the mining sector so
that one another policy like the America
policy where you actually subsidize
directly into the mining workers account
without giving it to the company so the
cost of mining comes down and this is
import substitute you create a fund for
subsidizing and I'm bringing a stop to
all minerals that are available in the
country but I'm not a being exploited
because they cost higher to exploit them
higher because the power cost is high or
because the cost of labour is high or
because the state taxes are high they're
only three years or the cost of mining
equipment is saying you subsys any way
you can down the power cost you can down
the labor cost you cut down the cost of
equipment or some state the cost of
equipment automatically the cost of
mineral falls down so automatically our
entire foreign exchange is same I don't
think the government has made much
effort in this direction where you stop
all import of minerals which are
available in India if you go in this
direction you need to create a
comprehensive study of the database and
that's the cost of many and how were to
substitute this any way to substitute it
so that we the government does not get a
bad name you know interpreters have this
habit of trying to explain the
government at every possible cigar which
should be very but definitely this is
one area through your Raj supporting me
I would definitely like went to the
government this will help the government
save precious foreign exchange just by
substance in by 10-15 percent in most
cases you will save 100 percent of the
money going out of this country in the
first test in the second aspect you
talked about how can we improve the
export potential of this the export
potential of all the minerals is
definitely boosted by preventing this
Luton scoot this Luton scoot scheme
comes in where you
illegal mining is happening you dig up
the resources fast you leave that area
in m/s and it's good from that area we
have seen in the previous few years
people doing that now because of
sustainable
which they're what and where the entire
environment is protected you bring in
sustainable development you protect the
rights of tribals you make the mining
more long-term by you know reducing the
cost of transportation reducing the cost
of taxes helping them access to global
finance giving them industry status then
this is a series of small small steps
bringing in GST team orientation by
curbing in black money now you do
transactions in white you pay all the
kind all the states have a uniform tax
and then you create better highways
their government is investing lakhs of
money in national highways and you also
created a more beautiful robust rail
network and now you want to utilize in
the next five years maybe the Inland
Waterways what all this will do the
cumulative effect will be you can see
this benefit in two to three years
stream water this may take three to four
years but what they even miss tilly
national highways what they have
initially in portlet development what
they have done in the cargo net moment
still every year every area we can
improve and also making the database and
making this sector open up to private
sector where they can actually use
faster decision making in faster access
to capital to take up this willis
transport this build is faster and help
them export them by creation of viruses
and better ports all this will
definitely boost employment and also
improve our foreign exchange and also
making a global powerhouse but all this
is rolling out in 2019 this policy
earlier policy was in 2008 it was 11
years back the Supreme Court had to
intervene to have this policy in place
the policy has just come into place and
you know the again the new government
will come into place so once you
actually set up a bureaucratic good
bureaucratic honest good bureaucratic
team to actually implement this policy
policy most of the government's have
excellent policies on paper but once you
have a task force like I said to
actually implement this policy to go
into detail to talk to stakeholders to
talk to state governments to ask them
whether you need more money you need
more railway wagons for example with
shock button it's always a constraint to
have railway wagons we are always having
shorter wagons cargo is delayed by one
week at least due to shortage of wagons
bottleneck in the ports because wagons
are not available so if there is an
integrated policy where the railways
talks to the national language national
language talks reports and ports talk to
the entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs to
the banks so in case there's no non and
non per family I said because of delay
in moment of cargo
so everything is integrated so once you
have a proper policy till now antibodies
was a power deficit state we could not
process and respond five years after the
BJP and the TDP comment came together we
had this become powers are pledged
tiered now all our airports are having
expanding more than 50 percent we have
growth in passenger traffic rail traffic
is in green a tional heavens have
increased all our ports are doing we are
in the top five ports in the country so
then you can exploit these minerals but
the local level districts have still not
done once you actually develop the local
level districts and like I say a proper
evacuation plan for this in the shortest
possible time and the lowest cost that
will happen when the inland waterways
also trickin but you actually talk to
the enterpreneurs to find out where is
bottlenecks where he is being held up is
it because of bureaucratic problems or
because we have a bad judiciary where in
India in ease of doing business
I'll tell you to boost the X we need two
more areas I think one is reducing
corruption among the bureaucracy
political corruption mr. Modi has
cleaned up if you reduce corruption
among the bureaucracy and also speed up
the judicial reforms in India in ease of
doing business
we have jumped quite a few places now
but in judicial ranking we have not been
out of 170 countries were at 160 it
takes five years to settle a dispute in
this country like either if the
government goes to court or the
entrepreneur goes to call it takes five
years and 40 percent of the amount
involved in this petition
so one thing we can reserve is for us
exclusively because this minerals are a
focus area I would expect if the
government sets up for a strike courts
at least for error minerals and these
foods are cut and in it's resolved in
five to six months I think that will
easy because a lot of people go to court
for silly reasons
I'm talking to interpreters also the
private cable so if there are fast-track
quotes India is at 160th are drank in
ease of doing business in judicial
reforms if you move that if you improve
the speed of resolution of disputes you
will attract more investments like
either if the bankers go to coat or the
entrepreneur goes to coat on bank or
they go to go to and state government or
local people go to coat stopping this
full of remaining there are so many ways
the entire reserves are not being
exploited because of the judicial system
lack of speedy justice so one of the
things I would like request the
Government of India to improve the
export condition of the national medal
policy is to set up dedicated fast-track
courts
for this purpose so that dispute
resolution is resolved in six months
there should be a time frame for any
anything if like you know when they say
national emergency overrides if you are
hitting the foreign exchange of this
country you can't a local person cannot
hold the foreign exchange of the country
to ransom just because he doesn't want
to allow the trucks through his village
or some banker doesn't want to give
finance or he wants to hold this see if
there is a fast-track justice for
national foreign exchange issues at
least in on a trial basis on this new
mineral policy if they set up dedicate
the first records very nice put is wrong
within 180 days or 200 days and that
will definitely rate the and lastly and
certainly of paramount importance and
that is the make in India initiative mr.
Raja how will this policy further
fortify the make in India program in
India we are rich in minerals but only
thing is our crossing cost is very high
now we are exporting the minerals and
importing the finished goods this is how
we are lagging so to promote the Meccan
India program we have to process in
India and since it is cost is very high
where to spend time and money on the
processing where to spend money on the
R&D how we can reduce the cost of
process that's how we can promote the
make in India so the focus has to be on
R&D for processing and producing in
India for furthering they make in India
initiative well on that note thank you
so much for joining us certainly this
policy will ensure transparency and
provide better regulation and
enforcement well that's all I had for
you in this edition of policy watch from
the shaka Patna thanks for watching and
stay tuned

in our studio first to you the general
Kulkarni of course this has a meaning
both for India's mission in its

self defense it's a deterrent capability
it's a fourth dimension really to what
Indian defense capabilities are aren't

the very fact that we have a deterrence
is adequate we have I feel today
credible deterrence against China and
punitive deterrence against Pakistan the
satellite of China know when you look at
it all this and the kind of capability
demonstration yeah they're just the 4th
nation in the world would be having a 90
satellite capability US Russia China
China did it in 2007 and we immediately
followed it up
and let me tell you what fantastic
capability even the Chinese satellite
that was launched at 850 kilometers left
a breeze which would they bear for
decades and centuries and has also
damaged a Russian satellite in 2013
cause we did it at 350 kilometres it all
our debris would have settled out within
a week with no damage to anybody you
could have demonstrated even at 2,000
the gravity will pull them in and
they're absolutely so you see that it is
a technological demonstration capability
that you must be proud of our dr-dos
ideas they should be proud of all the
scientists that have worked so hard to
be able to put us in a space club a
unique Club a uniquely which also
protects all our assets in the space
more is unrestricted warfare we will
have space we will have cyber will have
all kinds of things what is it not that
there is there is in space all our eyes
I hear there is phase where they do your
entertainment channels whether it be or
whether folk not whether they do our
military whether it depends capabilities
whether it is your banking whether it is
navigation everything in anything those
space assets need to be defended
better than having an anti sight
capability today our energy what's your
take on it
going into the facts that this was an
alia ante sat demonstration and also
what information is there as far as
because this was a target that India
chose Indian knew where it was it could
track it do we have the capability to
even track you know enemy satellites
very important question it was a low
Earth orbit hit very critical because
low Earth orbit is the area where
military satellites and spy satellites
strong and this is true for the entire
world beyond the low-earth orbit there
is another higher orbit it's around
1,100 kilometers 1,200 kilometers which
has a different geospatial satellites
which map the earth and the zones
separately above that there's another
another level which is around 20,000
kilometers where the GPS stationing
satellites are there about that there is
another level which is around 36,000
feet sorry kilometers above the earth
which is about the communication
satellites like for example this program
if it is on a satellite
we'll be beamed through a communication
satellite which is around 30,000
kilometers 32,000 kilometers up there in
the sky
why 300 today because it is the military
satellite the military ability which
will hamper countries which will mean
that the enemy can be hit enemy can be
disabled enemy can be made deaf and also
a Leo satellites imaging satellites
which used by you know countries to spy
on each other yeah and also to direct
missiles and also high-end UAVs when I
use the word to make enemy deaf and
blind means that when you disable a
satellite kill a satellite the enemy
cannot launch certain kind of missiles
one it cannot have its own communication
going most military communications have
redundancies built-in means that they
will also have a satellite based
communication and also have a
ground-based communication but yet again
how will say a navy talk to the ship in
outsi it has to be through a satellite
so if you can disable the satellite the
communication is gone even that is the
kind of impact this is at best brings in
now to bring into prospective to break
it down further for the viewers see an
satellite like which was destroyed today
is travelling it's something like ten
thousand kilometres 12 thousand
kilometers per hour which is huge now it
is not more than a small little dot in
the sky when this molecule dot an
invisible small little dot has to be hit
by a missile from ground it takes
precision calculation it takes
technology it takes years of hard work
it takes years of silent back-breaking
work before this can be achieved mm-hm
and we did it in one go that is also
very significant look at it anything
being hit at 300 kilometers within three
minutes can one imagine within three
minutes again in the Chinese capability
demonstration that they did it was on a
stationary satellite here the moving
satellite which has been hit like
rightly brought out imaginal supplied
moving at ten eight to ten kilometers
per second that's the movement and what
kind of precision and to be able to hit
hang on is something which is absolutely
marvelous no wonder I think hats off to
our scientists at
to the Univision hats off to the
entertainment been given to them to
demonstrate that's very very important
not that we lacked anything of it we
always had we always build a VF
tremendous talent and tremendous amount
of capability all the new require is
just that little push will be increase
dirt and I think they did it and what
better now you can just see the kind of
feeling that has come at VR as we said
all along a peace-loving nation this is
not directed against any nation it's to
ensure that our space assets are
protected defended and that at no point
of time we should be found wanting and
tomorrow everything is digitized
everything is on computer everything is
to space and eyes and ears that are
working at least we know and the others
know what I did to him you know earlier
this to say to be you must will be ready
for war at any point of time today you
are ready you do not even go to war the
very fact that you have all these
capabilities are deterrents enough to
prevent the war and that's what we are
here for now will grow economically
tomorrow we are every yes world is
looking at us as a third largest economy
in the world if you are the third
largest economy in the world yet of 1.3
billion population you ought to be
strong militarily you have got to be
strong economically you got to be strong
technologically and you have to be
strong the world over and be able to
tell the world we are here all the
satellites we give all of it whatever
with the neighboring countries we give
three mythological of my things and tell
them all about the agriculture the Sun
didn't want it but we talk about that as
well but as I there are certain
questions that are you know going around
specially in social media you know by
kinetic kill because there are the ASAT
capabilities as well which would have
created debris I'm sure you have answers
for that see first of all we must all
agree in a bit that let the scientists
choose the method of killing the
satellite china has demonstrated a laser
kind of beam to kill or Jam a satellite
please keep in mind it is a laser beam
possibly we do not want to reveal that
technology possibly we are still
developing that technology and keep in
mind this is
small baby step there are countries
ahead of us the US and the USSR now
Russia made these technologies 40 years
ago during the Cold War era the treaty
to discuss ASAT weaponry and
weaponization of space is on since 1983
yes China joined the club 2007 you're
talking about the conference of
disarmament yes and yes yes the UN
conference of the summit 2007 China join
the club but keep in mind more than 10
years before that since 1998 US US
agencies had been hinting that China
already had that capability China did
not reveal it till 2007 India's reveal
it today though everybody in the world
knows India has this committee since
2010 11 when the former chairman of the
idea mr. Sato was just on a show told it
in a public platform that we can do an
asset test anytime we just need to go
ahead so possibly we don't want to
reveal that capability every card cannot
be kept on the table we are not playing
poker so every card has to be kept close
to your chest don't reveal everything if
we are making a lesser heat gun or a
laser hit weapon please keep that a
secret let the time come it'll be
revealed the problem naturally it'll be
revealed in the manner that it has
because even when we did Pokhran to the
world found out only after it had been
done and it required a lot of secrecy as
far as that is concerned general
Kulkarni's and it just goes to show how
india can really execute these critical
missions that are very very important
for our national security isn't it no
doubt you know like right they brought
our budget you could have a fly by kill
capability you could have the jamming
capability you have the kinetic kill
capability now you have to demonstrate
what needs to be shown you know and what
better then at this point of time to
exhibit the kinetic kill capability you
have been able to hit atop the satellite
and totally they destroyed that's what
is required the other capabilities are
also existing are credible nuclear this
is about credible absolute enemies at
the time when they required to be used
but today if you had a flyby test
capability being show probably it should
not be seen you know approach seeing is
believing you know the picture is worth
a thousand words you have destroyed a
satellite and once you've destroyed a
satellite well the world
India's capability has gone to that
extent that yes the BMD capabilities
have been used to interceptors have been
used and India has now entered that
elite club and become just the fourth
nation in the world who have an
anti-satellite capability now we also
talked about what this really means in
terms of how the world is reacting to it
we've had reactions with China and
Pakistan as well but let's talk about
some other reactions as well
the congratulatory messages in posts
loading the massive achievement and the
success of mission Chuck they have been

security news night desk Bedi India so
those were some of the laudatory
reactions that have come in from all
over the country really but as far as
some of those international reactions
coming from our neighbors are concerned
that's another story altogether and Ajay
if I could ask you about that you can
see how China and Pakistan it you could
have anticipated also how they were
going to react somehow suggesting that
India is contributing to you know the
arms race in outer space while a state
n't it intent and apart from that our
role our record through the years
decades has been completely the contrary
just elaborate on I'll answer your
question into three parts first Pakistan
is a nonentity in this space game so we
should not even discuss Pakistan it is
like loading our own standards so you
design is not China is not definitely
I'm not China's be more guarded India
China is more guarded because China has
itself conducted three tests in the past
decade last one being a February 2018
which was the laser test which the
Americans and the others protested China
is the one which has gone with the fresh
draft to the UN disarmament Council
talking about this very weapon ization
of space now China's draft please
understand says that we cannot stop
stockpiling stockpiling of a sad
represent on ground that means China is
ready with those weapons China is just
putting up a smoke screen so China is
not to be believed in these games and
they have to be ignored even that India
has to go on with its own efforts with
own path one two we have been very
responsible as a nation because please
keep in mind India holds one of the most
deadliest of missiles called the BrahMos
and it is stationed across wherever we
can
I am NOT taking names where they're
stationed but we have not fired those
missiles despite provocation keep in
mind no nation has a breakthrough of the
Brahmas the brahma is going to be
brought down it
it's target we have not fired the
BrahMos we have non supersonic yes which
is like the most deadliest of
conventional missiles available on earth
well keep in mind we have also India has
not done any kind of hanky-panky with
its nuclear assets its assets are
declared its stockpile is declared as
per the Rana Conventions Pakistan is the
one whose nuclear assets or nuclear
stockpiles are shady are not known same
as with China China's nuclear stockpile
it's test is fusion test its outcomes
are not known globally they are not
transparent about it so I think China is
talking about India's a sad test is like
the kettle calling the pot black kind of
stuff and the US and Russia are
naturally guarded because they are the
wider question of disarmament really
even the race the arms race in outer
space where do we stand on that and what
effort I mean what is India's
contribution to ensuring that we don't
head in that direction if I could also
ask you Jen Kulkarni CVR signed a treaty
yes and after the treaty militarization
is totally out we are neither a part of
it
nor would ever be a part of it because
right now there's only agreement on no
weapons of mass distribution or and III
think even China said the same thing
they have also stuck to that and we also
state you are absolutely right China's
been guarded they've only said that they
would the women want the race for space
race but any case when China did it if
it's natural for any country with
self-respect would want to demonstrate a
capability
we are not against any nation we are not
even demonstrating it against anybody
we are only stating that yes there
exists a capability and we have that
capability what does that capability do
it only secured the nation it makes the
nation safer
it makes the nation you know stronger
that is what it is all about ultimately
whenever we have our space assets
tomorrow and they have already started
if you've got to go into the 21st
century
with the way that we are all going out
to be seen as the air in any case
outer space is getting cluttered and you
need to clear it up and one of the ways
to do it there is no space assets of us
have to be dependent and we are the only
they must be one of those two nations
this share of the space assets with care
with our neighboring countries and we
give them free even launch the
satellites free so look at the baby are
all going about it and tomorrow when we
have wanting to launch to mean how do we
go about it we have to defend our I said
and not only this capability building
capacity building takes time look at it
only dead before yesterday we had the
Chinook's come to us we'll have the
Pasha's come across this October
November will have their fails coming
close around the same time you have a
nuclear submarine joining us now you
have the modernization of the artillery
of the infantry is on so you find that
capability building capacity building
right doesn't this really go even much
beyond defense really it's essential to
our outer space program to about from
clearing debris it could have other
applications as well this capability it
does but can I say one thing before that
I am sure del Kulkarni has just left his
olive green he will hesitate in saying
it but let me say it see in the past
four five years there have been
discussions within the three services
that the first hit in the case of a next
big war will be on satellites it will
not be on ground it will not be on
assets on ground infrastructure on
ground the first hit by the enemy will
be on your satellites so this asset set
is as important as that and when you
talk about how we are saying about whose
thing I assign here senses yes and
because when as I move off a key to the
yeah what happens is now the enemy knows
that you have this capability and keep
in mind the enemy has a lot of
satellites to watch what you have done
he doesn't need your statements or our
statements to learn anything
the enemy has satellites watching and I
am talking to the enemy on the northern
but the Western is not even counted in
this the nothin enemy has enough
satellites to look at you you're not
really known too many words tonight yeah
yeah no need because I'm being very
candid they have enough satellites to
see what you have done they know what
you have done they have assessed this
capability and they now know that in
case they hit our satellites their
satellites are also in danger this is
the significance of the ace a test today
this is the important part of it but as
far as the space
is concerned how to space there is
relevance there as well yes it is
because see outer space when we talk of
the communication satellites got them
there at what 36,000 kilometers up there
in the earth these ones in the lower
lower orbits are the ones which are
military used military applications how
the missiles would write to the targets
how the UAVs go how the picture will
arrive from the satellite to the fighter
pilot who's flying say somewhere over
Punjab or in Haryana how will the
picture come to him it comes from this
low orbital satellites the same is the
case for applications in China
and also in US and also in other
countries now these are restricted
technologies is not that China sharing
with Pakistan they would not more India
will share with anybody that a satellite
picture of what they're emerging what we
are doing these are super super secret
technologies yes they are like hardwired
into the system and people very few
people know what this is going to tell
me anytime that we're out of time but
before that happens let's have a word
gel called Connie about our defense
scientists the DRDO isn't it a great day
a great day that of course tells us the
value the worth of the idea for us
definitely
DRDO has proved it's worth
DRDO has been working at it for a long
time you've heard dr. Saraswat sake very
nicely that the capability existed then
only the will was required to be
exhibited and that one thing got a clear
go ahead that yes exhibited they did it
I think we must trust our scientific
community they must have faith in this
nation we must have faith in the
leadership you must have faith in the
Diageo and their Israel I'm sure the
world looks at it with tremendous amount
of pride we all also feel very happy
extremely proud for the fact that the
scientists have the ability to prove it
given the right wherewithal there's
nothing that we can be found wanting on
I think what is congratulations to our
scientists community and to the audio
for having exhibited the kind of you
know the entire anti-shock capability
that has actually brought us in the
elite club and rightly brought out the
moral warfare is the space warfare it
will be cyberattacks and that is where
we need to protect ourselves from and
the beginning has been made and I'm sure
we're gonna get stronger and stronger
the day passes how do you feel a bit
wasteful because although people like
Kamath witty and said that this was
something that was being lighted by the
UPA government others have come out and
said that that was not sadly not the
case and 2012 after Agni not just the
finance the army tests Acme 5 tests not
just the finance manager Minister
mentioned it but also a person the
statute of former DG of DRDO yeah see
what happens I go we're very strict
thumb rule that the person who is given
the political go-ahead gets the credit
now for example can anybody take away
the credit of this test from mr. moody
no he has given the political go ahead
or for example I was telling another
show in the afternoon can we give the
can we take away the political rate of
liberalization of Peyman or simmer out
No
so this is happily mr. Modi's tenure
today 27th March mr. Modi's the Prime
Minister he has taken the political call
so the credit goes to him so what how
does it matter
he's taking a good step the DRDO has
done it it is for the nation how does
this political thing come into it I
really don't understand the day if the
man who has taken the decision gets the
credit as as simple as that
because ultimately it is the political
will that counts even follow coat if you
see not that the capability did not
exist earlier the capability existed
once the go-ahead was given how it is
exhibited and how it is translated is
what is important that is the person
where they have not developed it
overnight they have worked over the
years as I say keep saying the positive
take time nothing can be done overnight
but decision is what is important what
is important would you say I say that in
the country from 2014 being the point of
divergence has gone from strategic
diffidence to strategic defiance yeah I
would say see there is a change when you
talk of the nerubian era what we did and
then the Rajiv Gandhi era than the
narsimha Rao era and then them unknown
singular and now the Madeira
there have been differences in WA how
they have looked at the national
security and what decisions they have
taken so each man has done his own thing
and people have analyzed them in the
past now in future history will judge
what people have done
what people have not done so I leave it
to that because decision made today he
is had done 27th of March 2019 who's the
Prime Minister that as simple as that
mm-hm and in terms of what's in the
pipeline as far as indigenous defense
capabilities are concerned how
optimistic do you feel because of what
has happened today general Kulkarni
it is totally making India nobody will
ever share critical technologies with
you under the making of making India
seems to have seen too is making India
was about you know others coming in with
their taking with their know-how and
whatever wherewithal kind of money and
setting up industry here to you know
give employability and of course
manufacture things and taking there as a
growth in a different direction when I
was more about made in India yep totally
made in India reason is critical
technologies will not be shared however
hard that you want your best friend will
never ever share critical technology
with you it could be even small things
like Sikhs we have to work on our 50s
over the your therefore you have to work
on our stealth fighters of stealth
surveillance why and where is the
progress they are at you know I I
sincerely hope let this be the beginning
okay
we've been one of one of the largest
importers of defense equipment
let this be a beginning and let this be
a start that we'd now stuck in denying
everything they start making in India as
you rightly say made in India and prove
to the world that we are no less rather
than being dependent once you are in
that elite club I think it's time the ad
you are showing the way and I let them
not take on this responsibility with
pride and even in other piece also they
must work extremely hard to ensure that
there is more dependence
what are your for the future as a very
quickly see I think the Hindustan
Aeronautics Limited and the D I do have
done a very good job there need to be
hand held they don't need to criticize
people don't criticize your own own kith
and kin please help them please carry on
with them and as I always maintain
please the viewers and the listeners of
this channel should be known that
nothing in defense is built overnight
takes years decades a couple of decades
you
three decades so have the patience
nothing can be made it is not like being
a car
there's assembly line tomorrow if you
have to add a probably a new a new glass
cockpit to a fighter jet
it takes three or four five years it's
not done like this that is not like
changing the windshield of a car that
the mechanical change in one day it
can't be because you have to test those
wind chills the fighter jet windshield
that what probably 30,000 feet and at
supersonic speeds it is the test itself
in last year's because it has to be done
with engines athlete gratification is
perhaps built into our DNA now more than
ever because of the way things are
changing fast around everyone but where
its defense of the country where its
national security these are very very
critical things that cannot and should
not be done overnight it is well worth
spending time over than perhaps that's
take away that we have from this entire
process where India has got a capability
that only three other nations have so
far in the world and that is the biggest
takeaway really and it's all home made

Mahabharata period it's not only nanny
literature I mean whether I mean it is
alphabetized what we get them and the
reference of in the past but in even in
Persian literature also we have the
reference about this place particular
place as in the path and interpret one
of those five places which Pandavas had
a man wanted in the path till Perth back

the basis of the archeological
excavations earlier Houston Opera the
scene of the fight was escalated there
at the lower bottom we got a poor tree
known as PGW that is painted grey ware
pottery that is known as Mahabharat
poetry and the same poetry has been
excavated from this place also which
confirms the authenticity of the Persian
literature also and also to ask of each
race also excavations on this site have
unearthed remnants dating back to the
Mahabharata period in their Presta
described in that epoch could have been
settled in its vicinity excavations
prove without doubt that there was a
settlement here about a thousand years
before the birth of Christ pottery and
porcelain ware testified to the fact
that who Maya and Sher Shah who were
building on a site that has served as a
cradle of civilization
when the excavation was conducted so we
have got right from the modern period up
to mughal period there is say conditions
cultural sequence without any kind of
break this kind of getting a site
without any break in between that is
something very unusual that means after
the mahabharata period a habitation
started there right to the modern period
and through some cochon and continuously
up to medieval period there was a
continuous in habitation in that area so
that way it is historically very
important for us forts in furrows Abad

historic role at different times but by
the middle of the sixteenth century all
of them had fallen into disrepair and
were in ruins there was need for a

8p1TTzYfVSQ,In Depth - Analysis on the need and ways for Water Conservation,,2019-03-26T05:01:16Z,DD INDIA,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8p1TTzYfVSQ/hqdefault.jpg,"[Music]
hello and welcome to in-depth I'm Tina
cha millions of people worldwide are
living today with less water than they
need be it in the world's most
prosperous cities or agricultural
heartland according to the United
Nations nearly 1 billion people lack
access to basic drinking water women and
girls spend an estimated 200 million
hours holy water every day more than 800
children under the age of 5 die from
diarrhea every day due to poor water and
sanitation just ten countries account
for 60% of the world population without
access to clean water 19 percent of them
live in India so the next time you leave
the tap open while brushing your teeth
or bathing remember that 163 million of
our fellow countrymen are living without
safe water a resource which is meant for
all no one should be left behind in
accessing and managing the safe water
that they need this is also the theme of
World Water Day this year with the motto
whoever you are wherever you are water
is your human right today and in depth
we talk about the significance of World
Water Day the global water crisis
scenario and the extreme water stress
faced by people living in India we also
look at the efforts being undertaken at
the global level to conserve water and
what we can do to save water at our
hopes
since 1993 22nd March is observed as
well what are they every year the
purpose is to focus on the importance of
water and the urgent need to preserve it
today across the world marginalized
groups women children refugees
indigenous people disabled people and
several others face discrimination as
they try to access the safe water that
they need
therefore World Water Day this year aims
to tackle the water crisis by addressing
the reasons why so many people are being
left behind
[Music]
water connects every aspect of life on
our planet it is crucial for human
survival healthy ecosystems
socio-economic development for energy
and also food production but according
to reports one in nine people do not
have access to safe water that is eight
hundred and forty four million people
across the globe who are deprived of
their right to clean easily accessible
safe water so far we could understand
that water is readily available for
every individual citizen but this is not
true
no water is not available if you see
more than 7.1 menial people are not
getting safe drinking water by 2030
seven hundred million people won't be
able to get safe drinking water and the
recent example of Capetown is very
evidence suggesting that how a rationing
of water has been started and therefore
we need to respect water it's very
important the United Nations defines
safe water as that which is free from
contamination accessible on the premises
and available when needed it has
identified several reasons why people do
not get safe water sex and gender are
the foremost reason for discrimination
when it comes to accessing clean water
women and children are the worst
affected children are more vulnerable to
diseases due to dirty water and women
and girls because they carry water for
their families for an estimated 200
million hours each day the lack of water
and sanitation locks women in a cycle of
poverty other reasons for water
discrimination include race ethnicity
religion bird cause language and
nationality certain people are
particularly disadvantaged due to
disability age health status property
tenure residence
economic and social status the United
Nations also recognizes environmental
degradation climate change population
growth conflict forced displacement and
migration as reasons that affect
marginalized groups
the United Nations has long been
addressing the crisis caused by
insufficient water supply the United
Nations water conference in 1977 the
International drinking water supply and
sanitation decade 1981 to 1990 the
International Conference on water and
the environment 1992 and the Earth
Summit 1992 all focused on water as a
whiter resource the water for Life
International decade for action 2005 to
2015 had 1.3 billion people in
developing countries gain access to safe
drinking water and drove progress on
sanitation as part of the effort to meet
the Millennium Development Goals the
most recent initiative is the 2030
agenda for sustainable development that
aims to ensure availability and
sustainable management of water for all
by the year 2030 this means leaving no
one behind which is the theme for world
water day 2019 no one leave behind if
you see it is very important to see that
how UN assembly thought about this World
Water Day long back in 1993 on 22nd
March and this they decided that since
water is going away from us very very
fast
therefore it become very important and
imperative to understand the importance
of water and therefore UN thought of
bringing this concept of celebrating
wall water day and we need to understand
that water is not simple liquid but it
is life and when something become life
we need to recall address and touch that
life supporting commodity with lot of
respect
to realize the vision of leaving no one
behind we need to focus on efforts to
include marginalized people the world
must ensure that water services reach
these groups regulatory and legal
frameworks must recognize the right to
water for all people they must ensure
sufficient funding while effectively
targeting those who need it the most
Bureau report Roger soffit EB water
crisis affects every continent and was
listed in the Year 2015 by the World
Economic Forum as the largest global
risk in terms of potential impact over
the next decade as more people put ever
increasing demands on limited supplies
the problem of water scarcity is growing
continuously in our next report we look
at the global water crisis and how it
impacts the growth of a country as well
as its people water scarcity is a
reality that cannot be overlooked
millions across the world today are
living with less water than they need
weather in the world's most prosperous
cities or in it's bountiful agricultural
heartland one-third of the global
population that is around 2 billion
people live under conditions of severe
water scarcity for at least one month of
the earth this number is expected to go
up to 5 billion by 2050 half a billion
people in the world face severe water
scarcity all year round
globally 844 million people lack access
to clean water out of which 159 million
people depend on surface water to meet
their basic needs over 2 million people
live without access to improved
sanitation scarcity of clean water is
also a health crisis as statistics
indicate that a child dies every 2
minutes from a water related disease
without clean easily accessible water
families and communities are logged in
poverty for generations
children drop out of school and parents
struggle to make a living
women offer bear the burden of carrying
water for their families for an
estimated 200 million hours each day
each year at least 1 million people are
killed by water sanitation and hygiene
related diseases India tops the list of
countries with the most number of people
living with water scarcity as many as 1
billion people in India live in areas
with physical water scarcity of which
600 million are in areas of high too
extreme water stress approximately 330
million people from 302 districts were
affected by droughts in 2016 and half of
Indian states are prone to floods over
21 percent of the country's diseases are
water related in 2015 India lost over 1
lakh children under 5 to diarrheal
diseases water scarcity in India is
expected to worsen as the overall
population increases mine estimated 1.6
billion by year 2015 major big issue is
that India is a blessed country we
receive about 1.3 meter rainfall every
year and but the issue is its
distribution over space and time if we
talk of time we get about 95 percent of
our rainfall during monsoons and if you
talk about geography or northeast
receives about 13 meters of rainfall
every year that is one of the highest in
the world but parts of Rajasthan are
receiving less than 200 millimetre so
they are one of the driest places in the
world so how do you distribute water
over space and over the geography of
India having said that in terms of
groundwater the issue is over
exploitation of groundwater and its
contamination so we have iron fluoride
mercury in water now in terms of surface
water the issue is that lot of lakes and
rivers and streams are drying up then
there is pollution of surface water and
also there are issues of lack of
efficiency and
lastly these are the issues and we have
to shift from water development to water
management today shrinking reservoirs in
Morocco India Iraq and Spain could spark
the next day zero water crisis as per a
report by nithya yoga Bengaluru will
soon be among one of the eleven cities
in the world to run out of groundwater
the report states that day zero will hit
Bengaluru and twenty other major cities
in India by the year 2020 affecting an
estimated hundred million people this
includes the national capital Delhi the
capital of South Africa cape town
recently grabbed global headlines by
launching a countdown to the day when
tap water would be cut off to millions
of residents as a result of a three year
drought day zero was originally
scheduled for April last year but got
moved to July on account of severe water
rationing like limiting people to a mere
50 litres per person per day taking
severe measures to save water Cape Town
has been able to push back day zero
Brazil's Sao Paulo a mega city of 20
million faced its own de zero in 2015
the city turned off its water supply for
12 hours a day forcing many businesses
and industries to shut down in 2008
Barcelona in Spain had to import tankers
full of fresh water from France in 2017
water played a major role in conflict in
at least 45 countries particularly in
the Middle East and North Africa Yemen
had the most water related conflicts
with at least 28 individual events
reported by 2040 it is predicted that 33
countries are likely to face extremely
high water stress including 15 in the
Middle East most of northern Africa
Pakistan Turkey and Afghanistan many
including India China South Africa USA
and Australia
we'll also face high water stress though
nearly 70% of the world is covered by
water only 2.5 percent of it is fresh
water even then just less than 1% of the
fresh water is easily accessible in
lakes and rivers of the remaining fresh
water one third is underground water
supplies or Wellsprings while the other
two-thirds are locked away in ice caps
or glaciers physical water scarcity is
getting worse due to the growing demand
on water resources and by climate and
population changes while the world's
population tripled in the 20th century
the use of renewable water resources has
grown six-fold within the next 50 years
the world population will increase by
another 40 to 50 percent this population
growth coupled with industrialization
and urbanization will result in an
increasing demand for water and will
have serious consequences for the
environment Bureau report rajae Safa TV
in the face of a looming global water
crisis it is important to act
responsibly on the domestic from the
fast can take a number of steps to save
and conserve water
97.5 percent of volts water is salty in
seas and oceans the rest 2.5 percent is
in ice caps what we humans depend on is
a tiny bit that we get as freshwater we
don't just use it for cooking we wash in
it clean with it and use it to produce
everything from clothing to food all of
which is putting a great strain on
freshwater supplies what a conservation
therefore is essential in all regions
even where water seems abundant our
finite water resources are shrinking
every year with pressure being added by
agriculture business and substantial
residential usage with more areas
struggling under droughts conserving
water is more important than ever even
if one is not living in a drought
stricken region cutting back on water
use lowers our utility bill and
conserves our precious resource right
now our efficiency is less than 40
percent it is one of the poorest in the
world we need to get smart to basically
improve our efficiency so most of our
water is used for irrigation
right now the technologies that are
being introduced in irrigation is from
open canals we are going to underground
pipelines so what it does is you don't
require land for land equation and
secondly there are less of evaporation
losses and transmission losses
similarly in drinking water and other
schemes we are going for SCADA system
which are very smart systems water
slowly there is there are new
technologies emerging and we are getting
water smartly to people there are simple
ways to conserve water we can reuse
water for instance after washing
vegetables it can be used to water
plants and Gardens water drained from RO
filters at home can be used for mopping
the floor rainwater harvesting systems
in our houses and locality can fight
water shortage in
2017 the thermal art agricultural
development was encouraging farmers to
cultivate less water intensive crops
like millets and pulses as the state was
facing a severe drought compared to
refined grains like rice and wheat
millets are nutritionally and
ecologically superior they do well in
poor soils with low irrigation and zero
chemical inputs these crops can grow in
poor soil conditions and lead lesser
water as against the requirement of 5000
litres of water to grow a kilogram of
rice
millets need hardly 250 to 300 liters
another way to reduce water shortage is
not to leave your taps running while
brushing aerators saved nearly 35 to 40
percent of water a minute when compared
to normal taps besides they don't
require a plumber and can easily be
fitted to a tap thus dispensing less of
water
composting a process in which wet
garbage is converted into men your can
also help save some money with gardening
increasingly becoming popular in the
urban set up water usage in homes with
plants has also increased by using one's
own many or less water will be required
synthetic ingredients contaminate water
bodies and affect marine life ditch
those conventional home care and
personal products for eco-friendly ones
collect your clothes and do the laundry
when washing machine is fully loaded
this can help a great deal in saving
precious water even if you have a bath
for five minutes
you have used 35 litres of water during
a bath try to bathe with one bucket of
water which roughly stores 12 to 18
liters you can also install water saving
shower heads to cut down 80% of your
water usage and reduce energy
consumption don't use the toilet as an
ashtray or wastebasket put plastic
bottles or a float booster in your
toilet tank
by an adjustable toilet flapper install
low or dual flush models install
composting toilets
apart from this check for leakages in
the house the moment we start thinking
that every drop of water which is going
out from house is a life-supporting drop
like a polio drop and every drop of
water which is going out from your house
through your drain ultimately going to
create problem for the rivers which
ultimately you drink so we need to find
out solution for water pollution and
that solution can only be achieved when
you treat your wastewater saving water
at home does not require any significant
cost outlay the bulk of water saving
methods can be achieved at little cost
by using water saving features you can
reduce your in-home water use by 35%
this means the average household which
uses one lakh thirty thousand gallons
per year could save forty four hundred
gallons of water per year on a daily
basis
the average household using three fifty
gallons per day could save one hundred
and twenty five gallons of water per day
the average individual currently using
70 gallons per day could save 25 gallons
of water per day Bureau report Raja
Sabha TV today nearly a billion people
have no access to pure drinking water
lack of water is a serious and what are
some sign not only for human society but
also for the environment
what is the root of this crisis and how
can we combat it
let's find answers in our next report
water is one of the most precious
resources needed for the survival of
mankind with a growing demand for water
there is a bigger need to conserve it
[Music]
the proper management of water can be
done by conserving land and forest
preserving groundwater proper
utilization of ponds and lakes
construction of check or temporary dams
on small water bodies and by keeping
water pollution free water purification
is also a solution for water
conservation impure water can be
consumed through microfiltration
ultrafiltration nanofiltration and
reverse osmosis techniques groundwater
and surface water can be purified by
adopting nanotechnology method
85% rainwater flows into oceans through
rivers but if this 85% is allowed to
seep into earth
it could have two benefits first floods
will reduce and the groundwater level
will increase the quality of groundwater
would also improve significantly and
it's refilling capacity also known as
groundwater recharge can be increased so
we have to see that when you have a lot
of rain how we can keep those water and
store those water because rain might not
be problem in India but what to do the
problem rain will come in a shorter span
lot of rain in shorter span so everybody
you have lot of water but after some
time that water will become in flood and
it will become misery so you need to
understand that how we keep your water
restore your water restoring water
become very very important and therefore
green cover plays very important role as
you see didi has created Network of
system six biodiversity parks in Delhi
which covers about 2,000 acres area and
if you create this sort of three story
forest along with grassland and wetland
probably this would be one of the finest
example and functional model to be
replicated anywhere else which can help
you in mitigating climate change and
store lot of water
one of the simplest method to conserve
water is rainwater harvesting
to accumulate rainwater the depth of
wells and tuples should be fixed as a
standard the depth of wells and tube
wells should be 400 feet water is
essential for agriculture attempts to
popularize the drip and sprinkler
systems for irrigation must be made in
mountainous areas groundwater level can
be increased by adopting artificial
recharging techniques artificial
recharge is a process by which excess
surface water is directed into the
ground spreading basins recharge pits
and shafts ditches recharge wells
subsurface dams farm ponds and check
dams are some of the top methods of
groundwater recharge the problem of
water scarcity can be avoided by
monitoring water efficient management
and advanced techniques
[Music]
Bureau report Raja Sabha TV
so even as ordinary citizens we can all
contribute towards bringing safe water
to families in need the global vision
and goals towards sustainable
development may be ambitious but without
participation
it is certainly achievable so let's all
take a pledge to save and conserve water
in whatever little ways we can that's it
from us today in depth you can also
watch our episodes online on YouTube and
Twitter and send us your valuable
feedback and suggestions thank you very
much for your time

in the body there are generally two
types of disorder the first to do less

are decreasing appetite

hello and welcome let's first go
cross-strait live now to the FinTech
Conclave 2019 that's been organized by
Anna tteokgalbi governor speaking there
is to have a written text they present
it and then it is uploaded and that is
the position of the governor so
therefore the same discipline I am
following here for many of my friends
you know formal colleagues and senior
officials and many of you who with whom
I have interacted you would have seen
that normally I speak extempore but on
this after moving to Bombay to the
central bank one has all right so that
was the RBA governor Shakti Conda
speaking general bank sir who do I have
interacted you would have seen that
normally I speak extempore but on this
occasion I think after moving to pump
into the central bank one has to follow
the discipline that is adopted by the
central bank that is adopted by central
banks
Wendover in fact on a more serious note
this is the discipline which is adopted
by central bank governors across
countries as I understand this Conclave
is woven round the theme of Indian
FinTech ecosystem as well as steps
required to help achieve the potential
that the sector offers towards growth
employment and inclusion given the white
canvas that FinTech encompasses and as
rightly explained by Shri Mata of count
and Sri Shabazz God you know I have what
I have done is that I have attempted to
organize my thoughts on some of the core
issues in this area basically I will be
highlighting on the payment systems on
the utilization of intake the
opportunities and the risks and
challenges in the banking and non
banking space and in the overall
financial sector in general FinTech as
all of you know stands for financial
technology and describes technologically
in a
financial innovations from startups to
big takes to established financial
institutions all the deep key players
are harnessing this technological age
along financial services radio chain to
provide agile efficient and
differentiated experiences to the
end-user the movement has the potential
to fundamentally transform the financial
landscape where consumers will get to
choose from large set of options at
competitive prices and financial
institutions could improve efficiency
through lower operational costs as a
country that is determined to achieve
Universal Financial Inclusion at
affordable costs this is a defining
moment for us and we as a country should
seize the opportunity
let me first proceed to highlight some
of the experiences that we have had in
the film of FinTech in India India has
indeed been at the forefront of this
revolution a recent global survey ranks
India second in terms of FinTech
adoption with an adoption rate of 52% it
is reported that there are as many as
1218 FinTech firms operating in India
which have created a large number of
jobs they are also generating a healthy
appetite for investment the Reserve Bank
has all the years encouraged greater use
of electronic payments so as to achieve
cashless society the objective has been
to provide a payment system that
combines the attributes of safety
security enhanced convenience and
accessibility leveraging technological
solutions which enable faster processing
affordability interoperability and
customer
awareness and protection have been the
other focus areas banks have been the
traditional gateway to payment services
however with the first piece of
technological changes this domain is no
longer the monopoly of the banks
non-bank entities are cooperating as
well as competing with the banks either
as technology service providers to banks
or by directly providing retail
electronic payment services the
regulatory framework has also encouraged
this enhanced participation of non-bank
entities in the payments domain in
recent years a focused effort has been
made to develop a state-of-the-art
national payment infrastructure and
technology platforms beat the I MPs that
is immediate payment service the UPI the
Bing the power bill payment system or a

fact the conclave is about the financial
technologies and the Albia governor is

of the Eastern Himalayas forms the route
through which the knowledge base of the
Oriental region flowed westwards to

of domination the story that tells us
about the arrival of the fittest
it is here deep inside these gorges and
streams that we get a glimpse of the
rare features of nature at their best in
the nom de foie National Park where some
of the greatest wonders are yet to be
explored the nom de fer national park
the last of the East nan de fer unfolds
its slopes and valleys and seems to
reveal the causes of migrations the
route through which the forefathers of

the region to the chuck my refugees from
former East Pakistan or today's
Bangladesh form the broad spectrum
humans who found nom de fer to be a
better place to live the fringes of Nam
Dafa have a good population of Chuck Maz
and the Tibetan Buddhists who migrated
in 1951 following the occupation of
Tibet by the Chinese military the
liberation of Bangladesh led to the
added population pressure on Nam Dafa
the concern for secure borders made it
inevitable for the Indian Armed Forces
to tackle positions within 25 miles of
the free transit zone between Mayan Maud
and India
this led to the displacement of the Lisu
tribes and the struggle began here an
open confrontation between the forest
officials and the Lisu tribes 1947 some
ideas moated but these things could not
be done during their time soon after
1962 the Chinese aggression you might be
knowing it took place after that lot of
papers Exeter was misplaced
and then in due course of time again all
those things was recovered and during
1970 the area was declared as a nom de
for is a forest so this number four is a
forest was declared in 1970 after that
on the second October 1972 the same area
was upgraded into wildlife sanctuary
then again during 1983 it was declared
as tiger reserve so it is the 15th tiger
reserve of de India and 1983 itself it
was declared a national fire in the heat

Anika contravening yeah to a local
kegerator kegerator Shakur Garriga in
the buffer zone and interiors of the
forests the pressure is created on the
ecosystem by the newly introduced
species
the introduction of new species of
animals and plants is required for the
survival of the settlers whether they be
transplanted Chuck Mars or forest
officials resulting in the systematic
imbalance in nature any new species of
plant or animal when it intrudes into a
natural habitat brings along with it an
undesirable host of other factors
ranging from microbes to symbiotic forms
or dependence this brings in a change in
the ecosystem from the micro level
onwards moreover most of these will
interfere with the roots of migration of
the original species or inhabitants
sometimes these can create undesirable
residues in the soil that may negate the
growth of other microbial systems or may
foster the growth of another by all
means such interventions are disastrous
to the natural system along with this
the Forest System became the ideological
clash ground between human beings as
well all for survival
that can be seen in every aspect of
nature which we get in Nam Dafa for ages
nom de fer remained unspoiled from human
interference most of the area is still
inaccessible except a few pockets where
poachers and forest officials have made
camps the core zone of Nam Dafa is
nearly 1808 square kilometers and the
buffer zone where human intervention
extends is nearly 170 7.4 square
kilometers

after the Gibbons the Gibbons land holic
Gibbons are the only ape species found
in India as a self-defense mechanism or
protective behavior these Gibbons can be
spotted somewhere far among the foliages
of tall trees
during nearly a month of expedition here
they surfaced only once at such a far
distance they're sharp qual can be heard
miles away among the macaques or the
loggers the Assamese macaque is
predominantly seen here moving in groups
they follow the course along the EM fan
River to the day hing River from one
side and then to the other side the
macaques and the Gibbons share the same
habitat and have several commonalities
and food habits fruits of this wild fig
tree and this red fruit locally called
Bund edema is also their favorite
among the rodents nom Dafa has quite a
sizable population of the Malayan giant
squirrel mostly they feed on flowers and
fruits
[Music]
Hori bellied Himalayan squirrels can be
spotted near to the 40th mile
[Music]
the most interesting squirrel that needs
intense searching is the flying squirrel
and the long wait for the flying
squirrel to come out ends as it turns
away and vanishes in a flicker
[Music]
the flying squirrel can never fly but it
can glide with the help of a fold of
furry skin extending along each side of
the body from the wrist to the ankle the
smallest squirrel is the palm squirrel
very difficult to be located as its
color mostly resembles the bark of the

one landlocked for weeks together both
the banks are rich in biodiversity
[Music]
you'll see in the winter the snow
covered peaks are there and their
general it is the home ground for the
snow lay part which are still yet
unexplored due to the all these things
what is the configuration and is a mini
accessibility of those areas
nan de fer was claimed to be the abode
of all the four big cats the tiger
leopard snow leopard and clouded leopard
are recorded
[Music]
though not to be seen around these bugs
are the only proof of their existence
the presence of predators or big cats
can be established by the variations in
the population pattern of the herbivores
non Dafa has a commendable presence of
sambar and The Barking deer also the
feeding pattern and movement of the
herds of the herbivores is another
indicator for the pressure created by
the big cats
the unpredictable climatic conditions
and hostile terrain do not permit any
such studies one has to go by the
records of the tribes who frequent the
interiors of these forests and those who
agree that once they used to hunt for
commercial purposes

the distributions of the living systems
are closely interlinked with the
drainage system the Dafa bum Ridge that
runs from east to west is drained by the
nom de forever the de bon river drains
the entire southern face of the ridge
this finally culminates into the great
Noah day hing River the rivulet switch
take a course along the ridges join at
dabangg from here the course of the
river is quite rough
Noah de hing cuts across the ridges and
flows further
along the sedimentary Hills the loose
soil permeates seepage in the seepage
roots along the slopes the most
prominent vegetation is of colocasia
species or arabi as in hindustani the
seepage at several places also has the
pandanus species which is more akin to
tropical wetlands of india this is
another key species that can throw light
on the discontinuous distribution
[Music]
plantain or Musa species are growing
well along the seepage areas next to
this at the bottom layers form the funds
[Music]
livingstone Jenkins's or Jing is a pond
like tree that abundantly grows along
the seepage areas this forms one of the
major components of the undergrowth and
is in much demand by the tribes living
nearby as a roofing material planting
species form a major fodder for the
elephants the abundant growth indicates
that the elephants
no more traverse through this belt the
eastern Himalayas are most sedimentary
in nature during every rain landslides a
frequent and this is the reason by which
the secondary propagation also happens
naturally
such landslides are also a major
hindrance in conducting studies here
every aspect of the forest is a strong
component of the ecosystem the fallen
trees as they wither off form a
substrate for microbial action and
replenishment of the soil system insects
that depend on minut organisms also move
in the moisture is retained by fungal
and are the small mosses growing
creating a spongy layer for mushrooms to
grow in a living tree the same spongy
layer gives adequate room for orchids
and other saprophyte to grow although
more than 400 species of orchids have
been discovered in this zone the
unexplored regions can be the hosts of
several rare orchids bamboo orchids are
plently
[Applause]
changes in the natural habitat and the
lust for micropropagation for commercial
purposes have made the orchids shrink
maybe the loss of natural habitats in
the fringes may make the orchids vanish
the only way to rescue the species
maybe these orchid areas
[Music]
in its entire depth nom de far still
nurtures many species of plants which
have rare features Shima Valley Chi is a
tree that creates an allergy to
passers-by people who pass even through
the near vicinity of this tree get
irritation and itching on the skin which
later on develops into boils
stockist are villosa or the adultery is
another species that has high commercial
value the bark of the adultery is highly
fibrous and has good strength as well
and therefore is used by the tribes for
making ropes another prominent tree
species is the Morris Alba or boola tree
which has a high traditional value in
tribal society the wood of the bola tree
is termite resistant and non corroding
and can last for over a century where
there are flowers there are also
butterflies nom Dafa has a record of 140
species of butterflies
dragon flies which have almost got wiped
out from many parts of the tropics
somehow have survived deep inside these
forests another amazing aspect of Nam
Dafa is that out of the eleven species
of insectivores found in India five of
them are present in Nam Dafa most
interestingly deep blue damselflies for
the rare ones to be found here moths a
few of them of amazing beauty display
the aerodynamic design of nature and are
quite fascinating beetles are often
unwanted visitors after the rains they
get hallucinations even by candlelight
and get into trouble it's a mammoth
effort for them to turn back and fly off
[Music]
grasshoppers are seemed less frequently
this is a good indication for the
predator-prey balance in this case
Indian red ants are widely distributed
with the advent of the monsoon they club
together the leaves and mostly lead a
leisurely life in the extreme rain
honeybees are abundant in the forest
areas but due to restrictions the local
tribesmen do not harvest this minor
forest produce some insects camouflage
themselves and are difficult to spot in
and ephah stick insects or faz myths and
the leaf shaped grasshopper are some of
the ones that could be spotted
earthworms constitute one of the
prominent annelid species during the
rains these come out to escape from
waterlogged areas as many as ten species
have been identified in the nom de fer
national park leeches are unwanted
guests the heavy presence of leeches
tells the story of the multiplicity of
animals around altogether five species
of leeches are identified from this area
huge tall trees provide an ideal
breeding ground for the hornbills during
the period from April to June only
single hornbills could be spotted the
female hornbill remains confined in the
nests inside the tree holes and the
male's go in search of food feeding the
mother and the chicks till they fly
mostly the male hornbills
are accompanied by another bird the
lesser racket tailed drongo or died
crisis rama fur this is an easy way of
feeding for them as the leftovers by the
hornbills
are amply enough for them to survive
[Music]
one of the largest hornbill spotted was
the great hornbill Bucyrus bicornis this
seemingly had wing spread of 130
centimeters another species of hornbill
the oriental pied hornbill or anthro
caseros coordinators is also a rare
sight this brown and gold striped spider
resembles the banana spiders found in
north america there is no doubt that its
web is quite strong as it could
withstand heavy wind speeds this is a
strong indication that spider silk will
be the material of the future as it is
the toughest natural fiber known spiders
may also serve as biocontrol agents as
they are good predators of insects and
now this is just the reverse of the
theory do not get misguided that this
green spider is preying upon the Hornet
wasp the Hornet was overpass the spider
with its toxic venom injected to it
through the rare sting the spider is
almost paralyzed and now watch it's not
scissors it's simply the clasps of the
mouth that are ripping off the spiders
legs
and a turn to the other side the work is
done in a pre-planned way and is not by
accident but must be of a routine nature
what the entire Hornet wasp is trying is
to get rid of the spider's leg to
maintain the aerodynamics of its flight
to the nest the weight of the spider
also needs to be reduced and so it is
dragged and dragged to friction wears
out the tissues of the spider for the
final takeoff somehow our natural ists
are only concerned with large animals
when they talk about conservation these
small and less charming creatures are
forgotten although they form the basis
of the sustenance of natural systems and
service controlling mechanisms lambda
fur has all that to justify a new
initiative in the conservation efforts
the fishes of nom de fer idly throw
light on the relic forms and are a
living testimony to arrive at conclusive
inferences for the discontinuous
distribution of species the rich
heritage of nom de foie is evident from
the fact that ten species of earthworms
five species of leeches four hundred and
thirty species of insects 140 species of
butterflies and moths seventy-six
species of fishes 25 species of
amphibians 50 species of birds and 96
species of mammals form the major bulk
of the animal kingdom here
all this richness and diversity does not
matter much as the conservation efforts
and the management comes to a
confrontation leases or European tribes
known to inhabit Nam Dafa became hostile
as they were flushed out of their
original habitats until date no
settlement has been reached leases are
branded as hunters leases in Arunachal

by the beginning of 16th century Delhi
had already established itself as one of
the major cities of asia a metropolis
ruled by clan of leaders coming from Raj
pools the Turkic slave dynasty to kill
juries to Gluck's sired Lodi's it was
also a major focal point of cultural
exchange in this region but I'm in this
grand AO another invasion was knocking
at the doors of Delhi

the jeweler from the Farhana Valley in
Central Asia
entered Indian soil through Western
frontiers crossing the historic fiber
pass riding a strong army of 12,000 men
use Delhi Sultanate was by then already
weakling and shrinking under Lodi
dynasty Mona Ibrahim Lodi it were the
cracks within the empire which gave
barber an entry in India well there are
so many theories as to why he got
interested in invading India one is that
he was being pushed out of Central Asia
and therefore he was looking to carve a
Dominion of his own as a powerful
temperate prince and that was the
impulse which was driving him the second
is that he was invited to India by
disgruntled Lodi nobles and chieftains
in India who was who were against the
Lodi ready
eyeing the crown for himself defector
dollar Carlo the road to barber asking
him to sack Delhi and overthrow Ibrahim
Lodi it is at the same time that Barbra
decided to move towards Punjab and he
claimed this territory to be his uncle's
territory hulu bigwigs austerity and he
in fact he sent his emissary to to
Ibrahim Lodi
the Lodi Sultan of Delhi but his
emissary Rashid was the Russian people
to stop in between by dollars hundred is
the then-governor of defaulted on job
because dollar condo they didn't want
any cordial relationship between barber
and Ibrahim Lodi because Allah's Khan
had his own designs in Punjab by the
year 15:24 baba had established himself
capturing Kabul and summer cont
he then rode out to attack Delhi which
led to the first battle of Panipat
[Music]
the idea perhaps for the avanti's and de
la Cruz was that after inversion like
some other earlier invaders like the
moon for instance barber will go back
but barber actually eventually decides
to stay here and have a kingdom of his
own yeah it seems when barber is writing
in his Kisuke Babri orange barber nama
we find a reference that barber is not
happy that rana sanga did not join in
the battle of Panipat and barber is
saying that you know that I am being
invited and then rana sanga has not come
here and so that that shows that
probably rana sanga was somewhere
connected in an inviting barber i don't
think that rana sanga was part of any
larger coalition built by the Lodi's and
the tradition that he was also
instrumental in inviting barber because
he was an ally against a common enemy is
a week tradition and I don't really
think that was the case I think in the
dynamics of the sixteenth century early
sixteenth century politics domestic you
know in domestic terms within India
Sultanate Lodi Sultanate as also
conditions in Central Asia Iran etcetera
that and that barber had to come in any
case even if rana sanga and on duty may
not have invited him
ibrahim lodi was killed his army
humiliated routed undefeated Delhi
Sultanate overthrown
the foundation of local Empire in India
was laid on April 27 1526 the code power
spread in Barbara's name in Delhi
[Music]
delhi sultanate began to decline after
Timo's invasion towards the end of the
14th century but somehow survived and
del he retained its central position in
the 15th century when the sides retained
it retained it as their capital and it
was only second LOD who moved away from
Delhi and founded a new city Agra in
1506 and then that city became the
capital of the one Empire but that apart
it's fair to say that with the defeat of
ibrahim lodi in the Battle of Panipat
the end of the Delhi Sultanate come fa1
Empire was clearly there and it was the
beginning of a new domestic role in
India but Barbara's journey to invade
Delhi had started much before from these
lands of Central Asia
born in a Turco mumble ancestry of the
new lung and Cheng ISKCON he succeeded
his father Omar Sheikh Mirza the ruler
of fertile part anima region in
present-day Uzbekistan abu saeed mirza
his great his grandfather has divided
the entire legacy of the moon into 5 so
1 goes to his father and mother goes to
his uncle that his Kabul goes to his
uncle's amercan goes to another uncle
and then Kunduz goes to another uncle so
that me he's fifth one amongst the the
descendants of amid the moon
so the Central Asia divided amongst the
Tim rates and they all became very small
small principalities and they all were
fighting amongst themselves to get a
better hold of the territories Baba's
grandfather was the grandson of a son of
the moon you know and the moon had
conquered these parts so there was this
this understanding that this large parts
of upper North India up and job you know
a furnace on poorest Han is a merit and
that emirate legacy has to be rican
current the mood in turn belonged to a
Turkish drive with some and
dissidents you know so going back to my
goals at the changies Han horse of
course but also from his mother's side
bubbles mother soil you know and they
descended from Genghis Khan changies
Khan's son chat I since they dominated
that territory of just icon and they
started calling them such a tide turns
and that's what bobber called himself
chapter I test but at the same time
because he is also related to my own
goal he's tracing his origin from bong
goals also and we find that barber is
following yes I Changizi the rules which
have been laid down by Mao Chang guys
count the rules of government and we
find barber and amid the mood both
governing their area or the kingdom more
according to USA Changizi
then according to Quranic traditions
even after conquering Delhi in Agra
barber was fighting back and forth to
Farhana to hold his central asian domain
and that led to his vassals and
governors facing constant challenges
from the local rulers some of them very
strong and organized for IRA's known as
brave warriors the Rajput were the ones
to pose major challenge
now once rana sanga realized that barber
had intentions to stay in India and
perhaps even expand territories that he
has won in battle of Panipat its
distillation of local Confederates of
Rajput rulers and his lowly loyalists to
force bubble out of India that liquid
two sides clashing in battle of Anwar
the battle was fought near fatehpur
sikri on March 16th
15:27 result a decisive victory for
barbers mobile army or what was believed
to be too large strong army commanded by
Rana Sanga and his coalition
[Music]
mobile army was very different from the
Lodi army or the Rajput Rajput army of
conv or meybod also of Chan dairy
because Mughal first speed was their
main thing
second is gunpowder third is the LACMA
that is their commandos second is
anatomists they're reserved post Indians
never had this concept of reserved force
so when their armies tired fighting
there was no one to replace those tired
soldiers but barber army though he was
he was only twenty five thousand in
number in comparison to the one lakh
army of Ibrahim Lodi yet he has this
advantage of you know over this Lodi
well the Mughal battle strategy was
heavily based on the use of artillery
and gunpowder and that was the decisive
factor the Mughal army was able to
surround the advance from all you know
Oliver a tactics which is referred to as
to llama to love more tactics they are
basically in the entire army which is
you know which is facing the removals
would be surrounded from all direction
and you know there will be mounted
archers you know shooting arrows not for
nothing the battle plan which baba use
is called the Rumi battle plan the
Turkish battle plan in which there was
Turkish strategist who was
trying to build a new formation of use
of guns and muskets and cannons the
consolidation of Mughal Empire has thus
begun after convar and defeat of Rana
Sanga Barbara's army captured another
Rajput stronghold John Derry in malva in
what was is one of the major expansion
Airy engagement Baba Road eastwards
attacking low Connie and Lodi organs and
routing their forces along with their
alliance in the Battle of conquer now
that event made barber an undisputed
conqueror of the vast areas extending
past Bengal in the East Gwalior in the
south and caber in the West for the
expansion in central India and Rajasthan
an opening of further possibilities of
expansion
Hanwha was an important battle and occur
was yet another important battle but I
would still regard bonny path as the
most decisive battle insofar as the
history of establishment of the Mughal
rule in engaged concern the Confederacy
of Afghan rulers with air center in
Bihar was led by so gaunt ihlara themed
hondo Hani and Sultan Muhammad Lodi
the promise of baubles graders could be
assessed from the fact that sultan of
bengal nostra chaja accepted peace
proposals hastily a note allegiance to
the Mughals he didn't try to subdue them
he in fact bargain with them and he gave
them the territories to rule he didn't
interfere in the administrative matters
he just told them that he acknowledged
me as your Emperor and you keep on
governing new territories beat the
Afghani ruler of calfy or girlier of of
the heart and of bengal he is letting
them govern their areas but at the same
time he wanted himself to be
acknowledged as emperor fought for
barber the challenges to our firm
footing in India were only growing it
would take two of his successors to
counter before the established Opel
empire in North India of one's very
formidable force they might have been
defeated by you know defeated in the
Battle of Panipat but that was the first
led by Ibraheem duty the last section of
the advanced fair is still actually
unconquered in homebody movers they were
also pushed towards the eastern region
and therefore it was inevitable for
bubble to actually mass towards eastern
India Bihar all the way to Bengal for
him to be able to establish an impasse
here which we knew that he was actually
not able to establish when a firm
footing the difficulty of not being able
to crush entirely the opposition to the
Mughal newly founded Mughal rule why the
advance on the one hand rock cools on
the other and other principalities that
that all along both barber and
subsequently he knew my and together
also they were engaged in those
political campaigns you know
VARs and
and battles taking place which actually
continues for the next thirty years
period you know fifteen twenty six to
1556 period that we know that eventually
after the Second Battle of Panipat
that the Mughals are able to establish
themselves here
on a farm from fourteen the center of
power has now moved to our draft though
Agra was chosen as the capital of South
enough in low the era it was under the
Mughals the city touched his prime
after barber four of his descendants Oh
myoh Akbar Sahib and Shahji ruled from
the mighty Agra for the Condor lodi i
would say was the first one to shift or
to move towards agra in fact he's the
one who is founded agra agra if you see
strategically it commands the trade
route trade route to Rajasthan trade
route to Deccan and trade route to
western West Side so
Gujarat Malvo and also towards the
extreme northern side remember this is a
time in the 1415
early sixteenth century which is the
time of the emergence of the Rajputs you
know not put chief fancies are emerging
in a big way in this in this period and
controlling the Rajput could be perhaps
easier and controlling that region both
Rajputana and malva from their base in
Agra would be perhaps easier our graph
would also be safer you know in terms of
the capital city just to keep an eye on
the Rajput woman because Rajput swirl
his is very strong enemies and they were
the only counterparts as far as the
valor and bravery is concerned
[Music]
just like the salons and rulers of the
past barber began to sculpt cities in
his own ways coming in the tribe which
were now getting synonymous with the
terms like barbarians barber said to
travel within the confines of India in
between he also penned down his
autobiographical account of abenomics
[Music]
written in chalk thy Persian the 40-page
account is a compilation of magnificent
impressions a gather of India the
England method of counting the great
craftsmen and clothing to its flora and
fauna so it can be divided into two
parts the first part is about his life
in far Ghana and Kabul in Bosnia and the
second part is about India a people of
India culture of India and since he was
from outside India he documented many
things which otherwise would have
appeared very normal and not variety of
mentioned by any Indian historian so
that makes baba nama some kind of a
unique text for modern historians also
from the simple houses to great palaces
a Rajput kings
[Music]
Bob anima compiles his admiration in
create details in particular he had
greatly admired the palace completed by
Raja Man Singh Tomar of Gwalior his
fondness for horticulture his fondness
of music its fondness for singing it's
very well evident in barber nama in fact
marble is credited to have brought this
cha hot bath pattern or the square
garden pattern into India and he is
introducing that for example our
embarked in Agra in Thal pool a bargain
he'll offer he is laid down so the
systematic gardens were laid down for
the first time in India by barber as a
horticulturist he's improved the quality
of grapes and melons in India because he
was very fond of wine even the social
system of India it's caste system finds
a mention in Baba nama another of his
great emphasis was on natural beauty of
India
a forests animals birds wife type of
parrots about food banana the flocking
ease and even leaves of apple trees this
is a trait which is subsequently to be
found very very clearly you know in
amazing details once again under
Jahangir you know who early in the 17th
century when he arrives his
autobiographical narrative to schedule
Hungary he is also once again writing
about flora fauna in the same manner in
which he would be barber would be great
grandfather would be would be writing
early in the 1616 century so this is a
very accomplished people I mean these
were not some barbarians coming and you
know looting and massacring and you know
creating difficulties there the cave
they had a broad based framework
political framework they had ideas to
implement implement them to get an
empire and Kevon mentioned also a great
poet in his de Moyer he introduced the
concept of garden palaces in India
gardens are the Mughal installations in
Agra sikri and Hall poor are said to
have been laid during his times
but the story and abruptly is barber
died within just four years of his rule
in December 15 38 in just 47 it's noted
that in India most of his time was spent
fighting and traveling back and forth
ferhanna now that leaves his place in
the history more of a conqueror or a
fighter and less of an empire builder a
feat which is successor and grandson of
Burr and his grandson Shahji went on to
accomplish
in an accounts of his death it said he
give away his life for his son and
successor oh my god
wise men of his court suggested the
Prince woman who was very old might be
saved if barber gave away his most
precious possession but Baba was very
much troubled because of the illness of
him I you Baba was asked by he he got a
dream and then it was asked that if he
gets well what can you pay for his
well-being
so Baba said that I'll give give my
favorite dress and everything they said
no jewels and all it doesn't matter so
what what else can you give is it I can
give my life so that's a very famous
anecdote the Barton of Mughal Empire was
thus passed on to his son oh my own
bubbles advice to whom are you and the
whole you know empire that was
eventually created the character of the
Empire that was created is very very
important and it is about tolerance
you know ensuring that there will be
tolerance in terms of religious
differences etc it is also about justice
that you know where law will be equal
for everyone then in Islam also they
were very very eclectic and that
eclecticism
is to be seen in the in the discussions
often happening with regard to whether
and to what extent from time to time the
Mughals were able to negotiate with the
you know Safavid Persia which was
aggressively pushing for a certain kind
of Shia Islam barber was buried at first
since gardens on the banks of river
Yamuna at Agra
[Music]
but his body was moved to Kabul after
nine yours
for he had left a wish that his final
resting place should be in his favorite
garden in Kabul it was this very
interesting combination of warrior and
writer and ruler and yes he had very
little time to roll in India so we don't
know what would have been the shape of
the Mughal Empire had he lived but
that's a counterfactual question but the
legacy which he left for Hawaii was to a
very large extent something on which
Ohio built the further the second round
of expansion of the Mughal Empire

seeking to declare that Theravada
Tripitaka the sacred scripture of
buddhist as a unesco world heritage the
proposal was officially handed over
during a national ceremony held in kandy
on saturday to the UN resident
coordinator in sri lanka Tripitaka was
first preserved by memory and then
written on palm leaves in sri lanka and
finally scripted in stone we tell you
more in this report its origins in India
but Sri Lanka is credited for preserving
it with the country having majority
Buddhist followers while Buddhist
preachings were followed by thousands
it was propagated through word to mouth

finally written down in Sri Lanka about
hundred years before Christ they were
first compiled and written on palm

place where Lord Buddha achieved
enlightenment Buddhist followers and
monks are enthusiastic about the
proposal and consider it to be
recognition for Sri Lanka in preserving
Buddhism the repeat actor the Lord
Buddha's aims are generated and the

monks from Sri Lanka and all Buddhist
devotees of sri lanka preserve would eat
by using their hands and like a pen
so they have written in all our lives so
the first time the feelin and man who
preserved they are get in memorize they
are remember they 2000 years there they
preserve repeat again by heart this is
the miracle things the writing of

[Music]
some cases seem unsolvable throwing up
more questions than answers leading us
down blind alleys only to reach a dead
end but all these mysteries can be
unlocked all thanks to a single wonder
molecule nature's detective DNA but how
does this double helix contain the
secret code to all these Case Files
that's a question of science detectives
have always relied on biology to fight
crime in 1860 William Herschel a British
administrator in India first used human
fingerprints to stop frauds in pension
funds in keeping permanent records of
pensioners he realized that each
fingerprint was unique to the individual
and remained unchanged through his or
her lifetime and so fingerprints became
trusted investigative tools in the 1900s
another forensic tool was introduced
when dr. Karl Landsteiner showed that
different individuals could possess
different blood types
this radical discovery prompted
detectives to use blood samples to
identify suspects of crimes but none of
these tools were foolproof fingerprints
could be wiped out or prevented by a
simple pair of gloves and two unrelated
individuals could have the same blood
type
leading to inconclusive evidence
the question then arose was there a
biological material that would leave
forensics detectives with nearly zero
doubt for the answer they had to go deep
into the living body into the nearly 100
trillion living cells that make up a
human being inside the cell is the
nucleus containing 46 chromosomes 23
from our fathers and 23 from our mothers
these thread-like chromosomes are
carriers of DNA and it is here that
modern-day detectives can find solutions
to their mysteries deoxyribonucleic acid
the most powerful molecule in the
biological world found inside every
living cell it carries the blueprint for
every life-form be it a plant an animal
or us humans DNA is the common
denominator the complex molecule of DNA
is made of just four building blocks on
nucleotides they're named
adenine cytosine thymine and guanine
like partners in crime these nucleotides
exist in pairs a and T are complementary
partners as a G and C together they form
the rungs of the ladder that make up the
double helix of DNA there are over 3
billion base pairs in the human genome
itself that's about half the human
population of the entire planet so what
makes this double helix the blueprint of
all life just like letters in the
alphabet combine to form all the words
of a given language these nucleotides or
base pairs arrange themselves into genes
and non gene sequences
jeans are fragments of DNA that are
responsible for a particular biological
function or trade for example they
determine characteristics like how told
we are or how take a hair will be as
humans possess nearly thirty to forty
thousand of them but this only makes up
0.01 percent of our DNA the remaining
ninety eight point eight percent is
non-coding DNA or sequences that do not
directly correspond to any biological
function or trait for a long time it was
believed that each of us possesses the
same arrangement of genes the idea that
it could be different in different
people was not common knowledge it was
believed that the olives have the same
genes there is no difference between
different individuals but all that was
said to change and it would
inadvertently revolutionize forensic
science how the key is polymorphism
[Music]
polymorphism is a common phenomenon in
the natural world
it describes biological variations that
are common within the same species for
example all humans have blood but this
blood shows polymorphism that is it
exists in different blood types no
single type can be designated as the
standard each one whether a B or o is an
acceptable variation it turns out that
DNA also exhibits such polymorphism and
just like blood types its variations are
inherited from one generation to the
next in the early 80s
this startling discovery had geneticists
asking was there a way to observe these
variations yes as was discovered by dr.
Largey Singh an Indian scientist at the
University of
Umbra in the United Kingdom while
studying the sex chromosomes of snakes
he stumbled upon an intriguing sequence
of non-coding DNA or DNA that doesn't
directly result in a biological trait
this sequence of base pairs seemed to
repeat itself again and again along a
specified stretch of DNA
thanks to this property it was called
simple tandem repeats or STR for example
this segment of non-coding DNA contains
an STR made of nucleotides GC repeated
15 times another STR shows the
nucleotides GCT repeated 11 times the
fascinating fact is that just like blood
types differ from human to human
such STRs also show polymorphic
variation this was an exciting discovery
but it's full implications would only be
understood in a lab not too far from dr.
singh's the year was 1984 Sir Alec
Jeffrey's had a Eureka moment at the
University of Leicester in England he
had observed
Str variations in DNA samples collected
from different members of the same
family these STRs showed variations in
different family members they also
showed some similarity but what did all
this mean
it meant that two individuals could be
told apart just by studying their DNA
samples sir Jeffrey is proposed that DNA
could be used like a fingerprint to
conclusively identify an individual as
distinct from all other individuals on
the planet not only that DNA
polymorphism was hereditary so one could
determine Parenthood by studying DNA
fragments sir Jeffrey's discovery
revolutionized the world of forensics
and it shone a light on DNA's powerful
potential to be a detective
today we know that humans only differ
from each other by 0.1 percent and it's
this my new difference that provides the
clinching evidence 0.1 percent may look
like a very small number but in terms of
the actual number it is more than 10
lakh differences but perhaps the biggest
advantage of DNA over traditional
fingerprints or blood samples is its
inherent resilience it is such a
powerful tool DNA is very important
because unlike protein is a very stable
you know you can boil it created alkali
both the strand of DNA will come apart
the moment you put in neutral buffers
knives back again it gives a double
stranded DNA 1987 back in India the
Center for cellular and molecular
biology had caught wind of sir Jeffrey's
revolutionary new findings founder
director professor PM Bhargava saw a
direct link to dr. Lalji Singh's
discoveries with the snake called banded
Krait he asked me why don't I develop
DNA fingerprinting from I was a
reluctant saying that the discovery of
DNA fingerprinting has already been done
by Alec Jeffrey's what is there to
develop he said his probe is a patented
is not available
he's going to have a tremendous
application what exactly was this probe
dr. Singh had identified STRs or simple
tandem repeats in the DNA of the banded
Krait this STR g80
a repeated itself 66 times along 545
base pairs it also showed variations
from one individual to another most
significantly these variations were
observed in humans as well
this made it ideal to be developed into
an investigative probe to identify
individuals once this repeating fragment
was isolated it was coated with a
radioactive substance called P 32 when
it was exposed to other DNA samples the
radioactive G ATS segments attached
themselves to their complementary
partners if there were any variations
between different samples they would
show up on an x-ray film as different
lengths of radioactive bands the probe
was called B km after the banded Krait
and in 1988 it made India only the third
country in the world to have it's very
own DNA fingerprinting probe it was
first admitted in the Madras High Court
to solve a paternity dispute but it
wasn't immediately accepted it would
take another paternity case in
Tellicherry Kerala for the first DNA
fingerprinting evidence to be upheld in
an Indian Court since then DNA
fingerprinting has come a long way this
is C D F D the Center for DNA
fingerprinting and Diagnostics
it's where the country's most difficult
cases are cracked all using the
detective properties of DNA it's used to
identify suspects in criminal cases it
resolves paternity disputes it can
identify disaster victims whose bodies
are beyond recognition it has even found
great use in preventing wildlife crime
and food adulteration it's also used to
diagnose prenatal genetic disorders
and we're detectives once took two
months to conduct DNA fingerprinting
today it can be achieved in a matter of
days DNA technology has reached a level
of maturity where everywhere in the
world it is referred to as the gold
standard of Forensic Medicine we reach
levels of probability of a match between
an individual and a sample that are far
more than the number of individuals on
the planet by more than a factor of a
million so how do DNA detectives
investigate their cases they need
neither criminal records no eyewitness
reports all they need is a sample to
extract DNA from this can be extracted
from just about any biological source it
can even be obtained if the individual
is no longer present to provide it blood
saliva semen skin hair teeth and bones
are all powerful sources of DNA and even
small amounts can reveal a lot but each
sample needs to be handled differently
in order to extract DNA they are put
through different rigorous procedures to
extract the truth-telling molecule the
very DNA is isolated either from blade
or from this is you break open the cells
so that the nucleus comes out and by
using different chemical reagents and
then you isolate the DNA the decalcified
bone powder is now mixed with forensic
buffer and final chloroform for
isolating the DNA after mixing this the
components then they are centrifuge to
separate both the actress and organic
phases
thus after centrifugation we get two
phases the aqueous phase contains the
DNA and the organic phase contains all
the cellular components once the DNA is
separated from other cellular debris it
can be studied more closely in the lab
simple tandem repeats or STRs are
obtained by adding restriction enzymes
to the DNA sample just like a scissor
these restriction enzymes cut the strand
into STR sequences these STRs are then
amplified or increased in number by
millions in a procedure called
polymerase chain reaction or PCR real
breakthrough in forensic science came
with the discovery of polymerase chain
reaction you know the biggest problem of
forensic science was to get enough DNA
from remains and interactively those
deficiencies were overcome by the
technique of polymerase chain reaction
for which the Nobel Prize was evolved
once PCR amplifies the amount of DNA
it's time to study its STR fragments
more closely after all they are the real
DNA fingerprints of the individual this
is done through a process called
electrophoresis first the sample is dyed
into a distinctive color then it is
added to a gel called agarose
[Music]
when electric current is passed through
this gel the DNA begins to split into
fragments depending on molecular weight
these negatively charged fragments move
towards the positive poles now the plate
is put under ultraviolet light where the
dyed fragments of separated DNA will
show up as bands this sheet of DNA bands
is what makes us distinctive even in a
crowd of millions all that needs to be
done now is compare the number and
frequency of bands against other samples
in order to determine a connection in
1992 this technique was used to solve
the sensational assassination of rajiv
gandhi by linking blood sample DNA found
on site with that of the suspects tano
and sever asin more recently in 2012 a
decades-long legal dispute was
scientifically resolved when DNA
fingerprinting prove paternity between
politician mdf Avari and son Rohit
Shekar today DNA fingerprinting
technology is at its most advanced
however there are still challenges
especially when the source of DNA is
either too little or too damaged just
such a challenge was presented to CDF D
by the Gujarat High Court in the
aftermath of the 2002 riots mass graves
of unidentified bodies had been
discovered samples of the skeletal
remains was sent to Hyderabad for DNA
analysis and positive identification
that was important for two reasons one
it allowed the investigating authorities
to establish that this was indeed a mass
grave related to the 2002 riots
the second it was important from a
technical point of view because it
challenged us in terms of how we could
apply DNA technology to decomposed and
degraded remains then in 2010 CDFG faced
its biggest challenge yet a devastating
air crash along a steep slope of
Mangano's airport acclaimed over a
hundred and fifty victims many bodies
were beyond recognition
making positive identification extremely
difficult
once again DNA stepped in as Detective
currently CDF these research teams are
working on developing technologies where
DNA is either in short supply or badly
degraded to get a successful profile
from those degraded samples is a
challenging exercise so for now we are
looking at different technologies like
single nucleotide polymorphisms to help
in human identification single
nucleotide polymorphisms or SNP's are
the most common genetic variations found
between two individuals here there may
be a difference of just one nucleotide
in a specific stretch of DNA this single
nucleotide variation can help link an
individual to a sample even if the
available DNA is very less in amount but
DNA technologies don't just solve
headline-making cases they can also
bring comfort to family is grappling
with crippling diseases for many
families afflicted by genetic disorders
like physical and mental developmental
issues heart disease of cancers etc DNA
fingerprinting can help cope with the
situation and plan for the future
all these genetic disorders can occur
throw out right from birth of the child
to adult and whenever they have a
problem either they consult us directly
or they are referred to us by a
physician so then we examine them and we
decide what tests needs to be done and
then these genetic tests help us
to identify the reason we can counsel
the family and if they wish to have one
more child obviously the parents are
worried when that child also have this
error will that child also have this
disease how will we be able to cope with
it so before a child is born when when
the mother is pregnant we are able to do
certain tests to ensure or to check
whether the unborn fetus done one child
has that error or not and if that error
is there then the parents can be
counseled would they like to have the
child or undergo an abortion so a
therapeutic abortion methods
a single molecule of DNA a myriad of
complex cases as a life-giving molecule
for all things in nature its purpose is
much bigger than just human dilemmas and
so scientists at C D F D turn to DNA to
safeguard one of India's signature
products basmati rice this fragrant
flavoursome and elegant grain is a
celebrity in the rice Kingdom only grown
in this part of the world and highly
sought after by many basmati exports are
often victim of a terrible crime
adulteration luckily DNA detectives are
there on the scene we identified some of
the DNA markers which was specific to
basmati rice using these specific
markers we can actually detect non
basmati rice in the basmati rice samples
so what alteration level detection can
be as precise as one two three percent
level and we presented this protocol and
also we published these protocols and we
also have a patent and this protocol
most recently DNA fingerprinting has
moved on from protecting flora to
protecting fauna conservation groups
around the world and in India are
increasingly turning to DNA to fight
crimes like poaching and illegal
trafficking of endangered species the
Wonder molecule of DNA is not just an
accurate detective but also a versatile
one now the question is what is going to
be the future technology now latest the
development which is taking place from a
genomics to phenomics you have a DNA
scene of crime can you sequence the DNA
and make the picture of the criminal who
has committed the crime so you don't
have to go anywhere the DNA can tell you
the whole history
nearly 30 years after first being used
in forensics DNA technology in India has
come a long way
it has cast its lens beyond sensational
court cases to encompass a higher goal
twenty years ago when the technology was
first introduced there would be
questions in court
discussing particularly from the defense
lawyers discussing is this technique
valid enough is it accurate enough those
questions no longer apply future of the
technology I would say is really in
expanding its use within India with a
very conservative estimate we are doing
less than 1% of cases that needs to be
done right and I think our goal will
really be to expand with these
challenges to meet DNA detectives forge
ahead with renewed vigor in the coming
years they hope to tackle a far wider
variety of complex mysteries thanks to
the double helix many more case files
will then be conclusively closed if you

hello and welcome to a brand new edition
of policy watch I am Tina ha starting
October this year the government will
issue uniform driving licenses and waked
registration cards across the country
the new vehicle documents will not just
be uniform in look color and design but
will also have the same security
features the new smart driving licences
and registration certificates will have
microchips with QR codes they will also
be enabled with the near-field
communication that is the NFC feature
similar to what is used in the ATM cards
this will enable traffic and forces with
handheld devices to easily access
details stored in these cards in
addition the new driving licence cards
will have details of a driver's
declaration to donate organs and also
mention if he or she is driving a
specially designed vehicle meant for the
physically challenged the move to
standardize vehicle documents was
announced by the government last year
the nationwide rollout of the new system
is expected to be completed in a few
months from now on the show today we
discuss the benefits of the new smart
driving licence cards and registration
certificates we also try and understand
the changes it will bring about in the
way all of us dry joining me on this
edition of the program are mr. Sebastian
principal scientist and head traffic
engineering and Safety Division in the
CRI and Professor PK Sircar director
transportation asia institute of
transport development we're also being
joined by dr. Vikram Singh former DGP
youth the Pradesh on skype a very warm
welcome gentlemen for joining me on the
show let me begin the program let me
come to you first dr. C one of the major
problems that we face in India is the
rising number of road accidents all of
us know the Indian roads are very
dangerous to drive on every year we lose
about 1 lakh lives to road accidents
now with this uniform policy will we be
able to check those number of rising
cases especially the heat and grant
cases in cases where the drivers are
absconded and not even you know they're
not even brought to book
Tina very well said this is the best
thing that has possibly happened in the
year 2019 by subscribing to an
internationally best practice as far as
Road Transport is concerned about from
the fact that we pay a very heavy price
in terms of the casualties on the
roadside let me find you and the
respected panelists that the driving
licence is an important identification
paper and a document more often than not
you hear drivers brazenly telling the
law enforcement agencies and those who
are victims of accident that this is
India you can get any number of driving
licenses made for a fee I was not like
you believe but the ground reality is
that you can get multiple driving
licenses with just replace the two R's
and the intelligent features I think
that the end of licenses is here and now
the multifarious advantages that you
have mentioned the india will already
stand to gain and i think it is a
wonderful asset in the hands of those
driving and everybody who is traveling
on the road side Tina missus of car
coming to you now help us understand how
this uniform system the new smart card
system will help prevent the bogus
licenses that people are procure people
are able to procure at very cheap prices
actually I understand that there is a
bhajan and Sarathy is already been in
place right now and once I have a
uniform driving license I do not have
any kind of manipulative
approach to get another driving license
from other states so that means and it
is already all the details have been fed
in the microchip even if you want to
donate your organs and after Sam's I
eventualities that prohibition also
their blood group is there it's a unique
in in terms of its approach I feel that
once it is done nobody will be able to
manipulate the bogus license I
understand in my knowledge it is around
25 percent people having their bogus
license yes they have happy at least
multiple license I think that is going
to be totally eliminated that is the one
major benefit is that and once you get
caught and the aspect is that if you
have been get caught in another number
of times
so immediately only swipe through that
near-field communication or details is
going to be revealed so that means there
is no way that you can cheat policemen
or you can try to do any kind of
jugglery
so I think it is a very unique systems
and it should have been done I think
five years back I will also say that
once it is done when that intelligent
transport systems are in place I think
you will not have any place to
manipulate and escape the situation and
this is a wonderful move I will come
this move from my core of my heart mr.
Sebastian this new system enables the
government to have this central database
how is it going to it because all these
things that we discussed at the moment
what dr. Singh pointed out what mr. mr.
Sarkar said are something that benefit
the government how do we as drivers
benefit from the new uniform policy yes
Tina when there is its central data
system you know that you are a
registered vehicle owner and you have
your own driving license and nobody is
going to have a fake and nobody is going
to have a duplicate license or multiple
license so you own it you tend to then
behave in a responsible manner and you
know understand the responsibility also
on the other head government is going to
benefit because they have the track on
the errant drivers because our
infrastructure is becoming up to data
they are state-of-the-art roads nowadays
state-of-the-art vehicle are there but
we do not have the state of the art or
the even the learner loyal drivers and
then moreover that they are having
multiple licenses if you penalize you
you find some driver who is not fit for
driving they have another license so you
cannot catch hold of them so in doing
that Bey actually many of the drivers
who are responsible sometimes they have
to actually meet with the accident
because of the part of the these drivers
though those are
very very jealous for our safety so they
will feel safe on the other hand the
drivers who committed the mistakes or
they are not fit for that they can be
curtailed or they can be actually
rectified and there is sense of
responsibility definitely going to be
there is a huge change in safety
scenario in India mr. Singh let me come
back to you again mr. Subhash Tron says
that you know with this uniform policy
system those who have a you know who
pertain to procure these bogus licenses
will not be able to do so again but what
about those who already have these
licenses who have got these licenses
made without actually going through the
real driving tests what happens to those
will a fresh round of tests be conducted
for them before issuing them this
uniform new smart card I think there are
multiple prompt strategy that has to be
in short firstly every time a license is
renewed rest assured the new systems
will be in place now the police have
their own database of all the drivers
involved in accident or wherever a crime
has happened I think the police need to
update the data and have a database and
shared all over India of all those
Dilton drivers you don't have multiple
licenses I don't have multiple licenses
but there are special interest people
who have multiple licenses for a devious
purpose and it should not be difficult
for the police to identify them by
having a database to begin with in the
first goal all those involved in
accidents and criminal activity multiple
accident cases and then if this data is
shared I think it's only a matter of
time before the grave is shifted from
the shaft and you identify the black
sheep of those in the drivers the more
has I would like to add to Sebastian's
viewpoint that the roads will be much
safer when you have these medicated
people outside the road as John Donne
had said I run to death and death runs
to me as fast and all my pleasures are
like those of yesterday when you
identify remove those malignant
influence on the roadside then I think
you make the roads much safer for all of
us mr. Sagar do you think the states
have been given enough time to you know
get the
cards renewed the older ones renewed and
also to provide the new cards to users
because the announcement was made just
last year in October sometime in October
and now it's being implemented from
October 2014
so in just about a year do the states
have enough time to you know catch up
with the new policy the question is that
your mindset if you feel that it has got
to be done if you have a willpower I
don't think anything is impossible so
depending on the how the state is taking
consciously and take the matter
forward and see that it gets implemented
so it's a basically I said all keeping
in view the two days that I have
accident scenario I think all states
should rise to the occasion and take up
as a challenge there is a teething
problem I understand but we have to work
on this taking problems I think we
should do that because this is a noble
move and as watch someone misses seeing
also is trying to point out it is going
to ensure a value of safety and in fact
whenever we have a smart card like this
people will think thrice how the weather
will say do the word speeding or do that
that the the do that they follow the
traffic rules they should be cautious
and these cautiousness will bring down
the level of accidents the cost factor
mister is it cost-effective is going to
be very very cost effective as I learned
that the the cost involved will be not
more than 20 rupee and with that small
cost if you are doing such a huge
benefit which is country while expecting
it for the last so many years we have
been dealing with the problem of
accidents and road deaths which is more
than 1.5 lakh for air though we have
been able to just control it because of
infrastructure upgrade racing has
happened but nothing has happened to the
drivers who are using this
infrastructure which we are working hard
to improve it day by day now this is the
gray area which is very much in session
essential to cater to and once this is
cater to definitely Abrego tea is going
to get benefit and you know that we
cannot plan our infrastructure of design
all the infrastructure for the all the
irrelevant behavior all the everything
there are some scientific rules and
regulations can design in
structure for a systematic move of that
the driver has are expected to behave in
a some regimented manner then we can
scientifically design the rows but if
you do not know anything about the
drivers how they are going to behave
they are really dangerous to the people
who are driving safely on the road so
this move is going to be benefiting a
huge in the long run and as far as
professor Carr told there there is a
bill there is a way there is enough time
and state has nothing to do they have to
just enter one or two extra fluid in the
data everything design its features and
portals everything is already worked out
and the good thing is that it is all
paperless yeah it's going to be
paperless so there is nothing people
people do not have to actually go for
the agents and all that they can
directly apply for the licenses online
and they will be getting it without
hassle free
another thing required is in this area
driver has to be trained so there should
be a component of training which is the
committee's pressing that also there
they are uniform making it a uniform how
to issue a license but of the required
test and training for these driver to
issue a valid license so definitely new
licenses are going to be very very
strict and scientific and the older one
whenever they are going for renewal they
will get any chance and they will be
tested also and if there is some
modifications required or some treatment
is required they will be advised for
that there are methods to actually
rectify some of the problems like vision
problem fatigue problem or vision plan
or sight seeing activities that can be
modified with the help of spectacles or
some physiotherapy methods which are
available for drivers to become more fit
in near future definitely going to help
in safety in a great way but how can the
private vehicles be distinguished with
the commercial vehicles through this
card
Oh help us understand so if if I am a
driver with a you know with a private
car and I have a uniform driving license
so if suppose you know in the
future I intend to change to being a
commercial driver how does this help me
or affect me and what are the changes
that it brings about in the way I you
know procure my uniform driving license
yes I'd like to add one point because
it's a very noble move what you need to
do what I have seen all over the
particularly European countries
Australia they have having systems
called graduated driver's licensing
systems I do not know there you're aware
of that and this has been very
successful what you exactly said suppose
if someone here wants to get into the
commercial driving it's not that you
take the vehicle and go onto the road he
has got to be graduated to move to may
have to make his fast driving on the
roads under super under supervision okay
so what is being done in that country
when you giving a driving license
learning license then you are thoroughly
examine in the first stage and you are
given sometimes six-month time you are
being supervised under somebody's
control with more than 25 years aged and
then after supervision then you go to
the next stage and of course you have a
lot of respect
restriction you can only drive in a
single carriageway you cannot drive more
than 50 kilometres per hour
you cannot drive in the during the
nighttime you cannot drive in that
expressway so after having done that
then they they find the doer you are
efficient they'll get the supervision is
not needed then you drive for one year
or two year then after that you ask for
a full-fledged license so it's a
graduation move graduated move so
therefore if I have to go into the
commercial driving for IOT Hall this
arena I have to be supervised by
commercial driver in order to ensure
that I am driving with a great deal of
confidence on the rows that has got to
be done and I think this is going to be
the next stage this is a good move this
man this dude you're graduated driving
license has to come in the next stage
that is my feeling alright dr. Vikram
Singh another significant feature of
this uniform driving licence is that
apart from your personal details it is
also going to have an emergency contact
number and now this I believe is going
to be very very beneficial for the
police in cases where
sit-ins happen and the victims are
unidentified isn't it absolutely Tina
this feature
apart from being a lifeline to the
driver in case of distress would also
identify that this mobile and the number
that the person has given as the help
lined up by an emergency number
emergency assistance number this also
would be indicative I can disclose it to
you that one mobile number is like
disclosing your heart to the law
enforcement agencies the frequently
called number the frequently accessed
numbers the database that SMS has
received generated and what have you it
in facts open the window to the behavior
and conduct of the person indeed and
after subject to verification this
indeed will be a very strong key in the
hands of law enforcement agencies the
police the traffic police officers as
well
certainly mr. ton like he pointed out
apart apart from this emergency contact
number there is another feature in which
0 it carries a declaration or whether
the DRI the person who's behind the
wheels wants to donate the organs so I
mean you know god forbid if somebody
needs an accident and is you know in a
situation where the person is
unidentified taken to a hospital
so using this card one is able to
understand in the hospital whether the
person was willing to donate the organs
or you know ask for aid and this will
help them you know you know go down this
noble cause and not waste the person's
will that the person wanted to while he
or she was alive how good is that move
definitely deny it is a very very noble
move in that respect because many many a
person to want to actually donate if
they're actually organs on that if it
happens in the accident or anywhere
otherwise also so it will fulfill that
requirement because after accidentally
you draw this is the minimal thing one
can do even after the death so it will
definitely help the people who are
leading these vital organ organs which
are necessary and our society is
suffering from that so definitely both
are benefited society is benefited and
the the person who has died and he has
the
to to donate something or do something
for the society here he has lived his
desire will be fulfilled and definitely
many many people will be getting benefit
out of that because in many of cases you
are not able to identify the driver and
you don't identify his last bill but he
wanted to do that so it is fulfilling
both the requirements it's a great
movement in fact that Bailey so after
you know we've spoken at length about
the benefits of the uniform driving
licence card do you think it's going to
act as a deterrent for those who engage
in rash driving and you know lead to
such road accidents and knowing that you
know if you have engaged in a
hit-and-run case or even you know as
neither fine has been imposed on you the
data is with the police who has that
handheld device so just by you know
swiping the card your entire past doings
you know are present in front of the
traffic police so do you think it's
going to act as a debt is going to be
deterrent no doubt about it but I want
to also emphasize this is not going to
be the this is going to some fast move
in addition to their number of moves are
necessary that need to be built into
systems as I see developed countries we
have got to build your intelligent
transport systems which basically I you
must have seen Ring Road this operation
has already been started red light
detection of violations speed detection
violation systems once even but some
sometimes when there is an eye or when
there is an accident you get in the
details of driver sometimes I will say
somebody doing a rash driving who cannot
capture him on camera how do you are
going to trace him yes the question is
that when I TS also is in in built in
the in the form of red light violation
detection speed violation detection will
be captured their registration number
will be will be available and from from
the and it will go to the hardware cyber
will find the details of the the vehicle
owner and therefore in case if he does
any kind of violation all going to be
revealed with no time so therefore your
punishment will be much more deterrent
so that is the one that means what I
mean to say smart driving fantastic then
try to bring the your
graduated driving license cream which
needs you to be better trained to be a
good driver even you can graduate from
per passenger driving to the commercial
driver along with this then our network
system should be a forgiving network
systems which is basically have I TS
totally support so once you have I can
think I can tell you with confidence
then Sweden Denmark there have a vision
zero vision no accident no finally I
think that we'll get into that kind of
domain with the confidence that you will
lose no time we are going to have a zero
fatality and this is something that we
desperately want because our roads are
increasingly becoming more and more
dangerous dr. Singh this is one noble
step as all of us have been pointing out
what according to you are you know your
suggestions through which we can make
our road transport more and more safer
in the country we have already covered
those two topic the most important test
from Chandra has said
training of drivers I have spent more
half of my making us commuting by my
cars and my my staff car I find it is
difficult to find a well trained driver
upgradation of a database and
application of a record so that we are
not caught on the wrong foot ever when
you swipe the card you indeed come up
with the up-to-date and all the true
facts including his criminal history
violations and traffic challenge so that
you are in a position to check and
address the fault lines that may come
into your notice mr. sunder because
we've been pointing out about road
safety and how to improve it make it
more effective one area of concern in
our country is that you know people are
not afraid of for example a person
riding a motorcycle will bear a helmet
only because of fear of the traffic
police and not because it saves his or
her life similarly with those driving
cars they will put on a seatbelt
only when they look at the traffic
police so can we have a system in place
through which you know it is made
mandatory although we have this fine
system but it's still we have seen it's
not as effective do you think is the
system can be brought into place where
these two things that you know are the
first basic step to
a person's life India desperately needs
that as soon some has told it it will
help police in enforcement and pointing
out are targeting the those who are
committing the mistakes or those who are
not obeying the traffic rules so
definitely this will be a deterrent for
those people who think that this is a
system it will go like that so they have
definitely a deterrent for them they
will behave in a manner they should be
behaving says that now you know that
motor vehicle amendment bill has been
introduced and passed in Lok Sabha it is
everted introduced of us so once the
motor vehicle Act
this was passed in Rajya Sabha then the
question you error at the you raised
this is not going to be a problem if I
know if I do not wear a helmet I have to
pay 5,000 rupees I don't because the
punishment charge so therefore all is
going to be set right to it no is it no
no time yes is that please bring
themselves the motor vehicle amendment
bill immediately everything will be set
right as well the enforcement is
concerned but you know don't you think
that you know it gives rise to the
system that you know the back channel
thing that people always try you are
caught riding without a helmet you hand
over systems you cannot do any kind of
manipulation organ jugglery so you are
going to be get you get caught in the
camera so why do you do the bribery
business and once your systems so that's
why you will not find this kind of
bribery systems in developed countries
if we get caught you're punished it's no
problem
okay one quick closing comment from you
mr. Chandra how can we make our roads
safety and transportation more safer in
the country pan India I'm talking about
you know there are five pillars of road
safety unless these all five pillars are
working hand in hand the road safety is
not going to be effective the one is the
road safety management which is the
government of India is very serious
about it they are managing it across the
country from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and
and definitely it is going to work in
that way and there is safe engine
road infrastructure people are working
hard on that list is pushing it hard and
a che is doing three are rising we are
pushing it and we are making the
infrastructure state-of-the-art that is
comparative with the developed world and
another aspect we are talking about is
the vehicle that is the third pillar we
are trying hard even the vehicle
manufacturing industry is trying to make
their vehicles safe as safe as possible
and they are also of the international
standard now then the fourth component
of that that pillar is that that safe
users so that is being targeted through
this this is the one step we're in
uniform licensing system dragon license
system is built to cater to and Motor
Vehicle Act is being brought in to then
high-security licenses license plate
which is already being implemented and
is be is being implemented in a very
aggressive manner this is also going to
happen like another pillar is also there
which is education and enforcement this
new license system is going to help the
enforcement agency to to enforce it in a
better manner but on the other hand as
you told that the people do not bear the
helmets they bear it only fear of the
big particles like seatbelts so there is
an education part of that people has to
value their whole life you see there is
a very very rash and irresponsible
behavior coming out of these three
unruly systems when this system will get
rouille and they are going to be
transparent other system are going to
modify they will suspect the system and
definitely it is going to happen
so we need to actually assess ITIF you
pull about the life about the danger we
are killing more than 400 people per day
this is a panic nobody can believe it
and big business we have to have to do
it very urgently 400 people dying every
every day is a huge thing it's very sad
to know that crashing a day so this will
happen with the education people have to
more responsible they have to behave the
way they were by to their death they are
likely to behave in that manner
and definitely once they're valued a
life is going to change so education has
to be brought into the different users
and and from the school level accessible
from the children it has a huge impact
once your child restrict you do not to
disobey the rule you are not going to
disobey this said it has to come from
the culture it begins with our children
so I just add what he said he said five
pillar selves a 5v5 millions this is
similar to that engineering education
enforcement emergency and which many
people do not talk environment because
if they're in class weather is inclement
weather then there is a likelihood that
you do not get down that's a sufficient
distance yes so that means you need to
bring their ideas their ideas means in
case you're poor in vertical visibility
the vehicle will alert you that the
problem there is a problem be cautious
and you get a alarm in the vehicle so
that also take care so that means I TS
has to come as a part of your zero
visibility dr. Singh one quick closing
remark from you do you think the idea
system is going to transform the mode of
transportation in India it is going to
bring about a mini revolution and I
think for the very positive mini
revolution as also duly supplemented by
other technologies like satellite
imaging the Google Maps up gradation and
thirdly also the training of drivers the
training of the public and super super
imposed and smart CCTV systems so that
any flaw in the system is detected and
addressed immediately also not to
mention that apart from these value and
its additions we should also have you
know canals sitting on holidays to
address all the traffic jams on a fast
forward mode ok all right on that note
I'll have to call it a wrap on this
edition of policy watch thank you to all
my distinguished panelists for you know
putting forth such a fruitful discussion
and making us all aware of the changes
that are required in transforming our
road transportation thank you so much
all of you for your time

HNIKOu08GPA,Building Blocks of Bharat: Ancient Hydrology; Interesting Water Structures &amp; The Science Behind Them,"In this segment of 'Building Blocks of Bharat', we are going to explore the fascinating water structures of India. Case studies ...",2019-03-23T01:51:47Z,DD INDIA,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HNIKOu08GPA/hqdefault.jpg,"[Music]
in the next two episodes of building
blocks of para we are going to explore
the signs that propelled some of the
most fascinating water structures in
India
in the first round we will travel
through water management systems of
shingu very poor and Kolani damn one of
the oldest dams in the world the water
harvesting structures of Rajasthan
sports and end up with innovative air
cooling systems the moguls used in their
architecture
[Music]
the only universal need of every culture
across the world irrespective of
geography or time has been water
in India the history of water management
goes back a long way even before we had
begun settling down as organized
societies
there is evidence of Wells in the Indus
sarasvati Valley from the 3rd millennium
BC the great varta mohenjo-daro was
probably a water storage tank the
Harappan cities had excellent systems of
water harvesting and drainage
[Music]
in an earlier episode we explored call
Avira
which was laden with examples of
sophisticated water engineering
all this shows that ancient India had a
deep understanding of hydrology
[Music]
hydrology is the study of waters both on
and below the surface of the earth
hydrology also encompasses the
occurrence distribution movement and
properties of the waters of the earth
and their relationship with the
environment within each phase of the
water cycle a hydrologic cycle there are
many pathways the water may take it may
be captured for millions of years in
polar icecaps
it may flow to reverse and finally to
the sea it may soak into the soil to be
evaporated directly from the soil
surface as it dries or be transpired by
growing plants it may percolate through
the soil to the groundwater reservoirs
aquifers to be stored or it may flow to
wells or Springs or back to streams by
seepage and this cycles time varies from
a short period to millions of years
[Music]
let us travel to the most holy of
India's rivers Ganga to see how the
waters of these rivers were tapped our
journey takes us to a spot about 35
kilometers ahead of Allahabad
[Music]
this part of the Ganga has mythical
connections with the story of Lord Rama
[Music]
what we are about to explore is a
stunning example of ancient hydraulic
engineering that dates back to the 1st
century BCE the site was excavated in a
large scale with the Archaeological
Survey of India between 1977 and 1985
and these excavations uncovered a series
of large rectangular brick tanks which
were used to supply river water to the
city in the most innovative fashion
the most impressive feature of this
reservoir is the size it was engineered
to manage the drinking water needs of an
entire city quite something
let's explore how these tanks may have
worked this system tapped into the water
of the Ganga during the monsoon when the
level of the water usually rose by about
seven to eight meters so this water
would spill into an adjoining stream
Anala from this stream with a specially
built canal 11 metres long and 5 metres
deep
this stream carried the water into the
fringe of airport banks there were three
tanks the water from the river entered
the first tank which worked as a
searching chamber here the silk dirt and
debris would settle the relatively
cleaner water then overflowed to enter
the main rectangular tank which was made
of bricks the water was stored here a
stepped outlet from this tank allowed
only clean water to trickle through to
the next tank also rectangular in shape
this tank
apparently constituted the primary
source of water supply for shrinker very
poor there was also a circular tank at
one end of the complex this possessed an
elaborate staircase allowing access to
the lower levels of the water the
excavators of the site suggest that some
shrines stood along the edge of this
circular tank and that the waters of
this tank were used for ritual bathing
and prayers let's explore the
understanding of water that powered this
a little more the currents of the flood
water should have been enough to carry
the sediment along with it how was this
prevented well
device is called dissipation structure
within the tanks systematically and
progressively lowered the water velocity
as it flowed
the actual construction and dimensions
of the tank helped with this the tanks
have a narrow base and a wider top
they're also more constricted where the
water enters and broader towards the
exit each section also had a small
outward inclination as a result as the
water flowed through the system the
level rose it slowed down thus giving
enough time for the sediments to settle
an elaborate waste where provided at the
end of this tank carried water out of
the tank back into the river the excess
water was returned to the river through
this final exit channel a series of
wells in the bed of the tank allowed
access groundwater even during the hot
summer months
this site show us the hydraulic
engineering expertise that existed in
India 2,000 years ago
an idea that is still so workable even
today that it has actually been used in
the clean ganga program the science of
creating reservoirs and dams evolved to
help confine and utilize the flow of
water for human purposes such as
education since agriculture is critical
to India access to water has always been
a big challenge about 80% of the total
annual rainfall of India occurs in four
months from mid-june to Medoc Tovah
so it is essential to provide education
for production of crops to balance the
eight-months
so let's travel to see where the first
dam in India was built this takes us to
one of the great rivers of the south the
Magnificent Kaveri
[Music]
across the waters here lies one of the
oldest irrigation dams in the world
built around 2,000 years ago
[Music]
this stamp was built by King karikala
chola of the cheol dynasty in the second
century AD and the technology was so
modern that it is still in use making it
one of the oldest irrigation systems in
the world
[Music]
the Kaveri River splits into two
channels near the island of sri rangam
the southern channel continues down as
the Kaveri while the northern channel is
called kala dam or cauldron River
further downstream these two channels
come close can it is at this point that
karikala chola decided to build the
colony why did he do this
Karikalan build the colony for mainly
two reasons flood control and irrigation
having witnessed the river causing great
floods during the rainy season and also
forcing droughts during the dry months
he and his advisors devised this grand
project to maintain a steady flow of
water throughout the yard but did the
trolls have the technical know-how to
put together a structure like this we
know that besides being fierce warriors
and conquerors they had an immense
understanding of the arts and crafts the
enormous temples they built like the
Bria days for temple a tangible or the
air of a taste for temple at darasuram
stands testimony to their engineering
artistic and architectural brilliance
[Music]
the first-known dam was built in 2900 BC
across the Nile River to protect the
city of Memphis from flooding dam
building was continued into the time of
the Roman Empire dams are also seen in
nature beavers build dams to keep the
water deep enough to cover the openings
to their homes protecting them from
predators back to the dam we are
studying the cullinary dam which is a
simple jack Dam
[Music]
this particular dam is built of uncut
stone it is 329 meters long 20 meters
wide and 5 point 4 meters high at the
time of the British some alterations
were made on the original structure they
laid the grid separators and a bridge on
top of the old dam
in case of a check damn the most
important decision to be taken is its
location
this decision is crucial as the
effectiveness of the dam depends on this
the advantages of check dams are that
the store surface water for use both
during and after the monsoon they help
in groundwater recharge of the area
recharge of water helps in raising the
water table in the area check dams can
be of various sizes and built with a
variety of materials including stone
clay and cement this Dam is a big reason
why tangible is called the rice bowl of
South India it is believed that the
colony initially irrigated about 69
thousand acres though it now irrigates
close to 1 million acres the dam also
diverts excess flood water once the
floods were diverted to Kali dam they
flowed directly to the sea causing
minimal damage to agriculture
next up we are moving to a fort in
Rajasthan Chittorgarh but the idea here
is to study the stunning fort through a
specific lens as to how hydrological
science was used to plan many structures
like this in medieval India and how
technical know-how was used to manage
water as a resource a lot can be learnt
about the science of water harvesting
and management in medieval thoughts
first up let's look at the role of
hydrology in the selection of these fort
cities these forts could support human
habitations only because they had
elaborate water harvesting systems
invading armies would sometimes lay
siege to these faults for months during
such times there had to be enough water
inside the fort to sustain its defenders
and inhabitants for long periods let's
explore how to door guard works the fort
Nestle's in the Aravalli hills at the
eastern border of the thar desert
it is perched on the top of a huge oval
hill about 152 metres high the fort
supported an entire city estimates
indicate that at least 50,000 people
lived in the fort at a single time along
with a large number of elephants and
horses
in a year more than normal rainfall
average annual rainfall 700 millimeters
enough water would be stored to last the
next 12 months
even after water loss due to seepage and
evaporation and other causes an army of
50,000 could live in the fort for four
years without fear of thirst
the fort has 84 water bodies are to
which only about 22 exist today
these include the labs ponds Coons wells
and Baris stepwells
let us study how all this water was
tapped
it was basically through underwater
Springs and rainwater harvesting
groundwater is stored in and moved
slowly through the geologic formations
of soil sand and rocks called aquifers a
spring is the result of an aquifer being
filled to the point that the water
overflows onto the land surface and the
harvesting of rainwater simply involves
the collection of water from surfaces on
which rain falls and subsequently
storing this water for later use
in the fort at chatten går all the labs
in the fort have natural catchments the
builders of chat or not only harvested
surface water but also the ground
seepage the Coons and Bao Lee's are
located below the two labs so that even
the seepage from the latter is not lost
the fort spreads over 500 hectares 40%
of which are given over to water bodies
the average reservoir depth is about two
meters taken together this means these
reservoirs can store about four billion
litres of water let us travel to one of
the great mogul structures the Red Fort
in New Delhi to explore some of the
devices the Mughals put in place to cool
their stunning faults the red fort was
built when in 1638 Shah Jahan
transferred his capital from Agra to
telle this massive walled Citadel with
red sandstone walls took nearly a decade
to complete
[Music]
when Shah Jahan built the Red Fort it
was in the west bank of the river the
Red Fort is shaped like an irregular
octagon with two long sides in the east
and west and with two main gates one on
the west and the other on the South
called Lahori and delicates respectively
the one thing that the Mughals struggled
with was the Indian heat especially in
the capital city of Delhi so many of the
great moguls faults and palaces were
equipped with innovative cooling
mechanisms simple devices like latest
screens or jollies
filtered the sunlight the Jolley helps
in lowering the temperature by
compressing the air through the holes
and when the air passes through these
openings its velocity increases giving
profound diffusion the diwan-i-khas has
two sets of columns about four meters
apart each set of columns could be
fitted with curtains and screens
according to the need at anytime
then summer there were three sets of
screens use two of them of grass mats
kept wet by sprinkling of water heavy
quilted curtains was suspended in place
of these screens in winter in the
daytime these curtains were raised up to
allow the Sun to warm up the building
interior and they were lowered in the
evening to retain the warmth other more
permanent features were woven into the
fort many of the wall of the living
areas like the sheesh Mahal were extra
thick which ensured that they remained
cooler this is because heat flows
through solids at rates measured by
their conductivity the rate of heat flow
is also proportional to the thickness of
the material the Mughals came up with
other interesting innovations to cool
their spaces for example many of the
interior walls of the fort were actually
made up of two walls with a hollow space
in between this hollow space allowed the
building to be cooled by the water that
would flow between the walls along with
this there were vents that were carved
into the walls that cooled the air
further
[Music]
many of the forts structures formed part
of the hydraulic system like the Shah
Borge this controlled much of the water
entering the fort a system using
hydraulic pressure was in place to draw
up water from the river attached to the
Shah Borge where the white marble
pavilion bulges Shamli a sloping marble
chute sculpted in such a way as to make
the water spurt as it ran down into a
marble scalloped basin from where it
then spontaneously distributed into
successively connected canals which
constituted the nari bitched stream of
paradise the nari wished then made its
way through the grounds of the fort and
eventually led out of the fort into the
city of Shah Jahan Abad tucked away
inside the fort is also a magnificent
bow lay or stepwell believed to be older
than the fort and surprisingly in good
condition this bali is a unique
structure it has stairs from two sides
unlike the usual single staircases
leading down to the bottom water tank
the two sets of stairs at 90 degrees
mirror each other giving the bow Lee an
l-shape at the deep end where the stairs
meet is an octagonal tank measuring 6.50
metres in diameter and 14.2 7 meters
deep
the history and development of water
structures provide a fascinating
testimony to the science and culture of
the time there is so much more to
explore about water the essential for
any kind of settlement and so we will be
continuing our exploration of water
structures in our next episode of
building blocks apart don't forget to
tune in

namaskar and welcome to this episode of
Master Builders of India during the 18th
century India witnessed a period of
sustained political turmoil while the
central authority of the Mughals was
declining a number of European trading
companies were gradually assuming
political character there was a general
scramble for power as the old order was
changing the new one was taking its
place the earliest buildings of the
European colonial pass in India for the
residential quarters the warehouses
barracks Arsenal's etc and this was
strategically separated from the local
habitat by a fortified enclosure most of
these buildings were constructed to
serve a utilitarian purpose rather than
represent any architectural style but
with the emergence of British as the
dominant colonial power their
architecture came to represent their
political identity
[Music]
in the initial years the British saw
themselves as the successor to the
Mughals and sought to represent
themselves in the same manner just as
the Mughals the British to saw
architecture as a symbol of their power
and this symbolism was more eloquent at
the British capital cities
from the 1850s the British began to move
the headquarters of their provincial
administration's to the nearest hill
stations the madras government spent six
months at Ooty the Bengal government
went to Darjeeling for three months
the northwestern province government
spent five and a half months at need an
and the Bombay government was four
months at mahabaleshwar and four months
at Pune every year in 1864 this practice
was extended to the supreme government
in Calcutta and Shimla was chosen for
six months to serve as its summer
capital in the 1870s Shimla also served
as the summer capital of the provincial
government of Punjab
[Music]
Chatterley exudes old-world charm to
court or twentieth-century visitor Lady
Penelope Benjamin if Shimla is the queen
of the hills then chaps Lee is its crown
[Music]
Chadds Lee is one of the oldest manor
houses in Shimla it was built in 1835
and was soon after acquired by Lord
Auckland that then governor-general of
the East India Company it was here that
the Afghan manifesto was signed on the
1st October 1838 declaring the
commencement of the first anglo-afghan
war it was later acquired by Maharaja
Ranjit Singh of Kapurthala
who used it as a summer residence in
1976 the grandson of the Maharaja who
opened Japs knee to the visitors today
Chapter II is a Heritage Hotel it offers
six elegantly appointed Suites
a wooden stairway from the main hall
leads to the upper storey
the dining room with period furniture
evokes the memories of the past when the
late maharaja used to host the gourmet
parties
the morning room with its glass paneled
walls provide a refreshing view of the
valley the gold room the drying room and
the card room are resplendent with
heirlooms such as goblin tapestries
prayer textiles and cabinetry from doges
palace in Venice chandeliers from Murano
blue pottery chardonnays from Malta
peshwa vases
Persian carpets marble statuary and a
collection of Indian priceless antiques
[Music]
even before it acquired the status of
the Imperial summer capital a number of
buildings reflecting the British style
of residential architecture came up in
Shimla among these were Japs Lee and
wood will wood will is one of the oldest
and finest houses of Shimla it remained
the official summer residence of the
commander-in-chief's of India after 1881
the commander-in-chief deserted it for
snowed on and the wood will house was
brought by Sir James Walker afterwards
it was passed on to the Alliance Bank of
Shimla which used it as the manager's
residence after the bank collapsed in
1923 Maharaja Sir pogba think Sangram of
gunda estate in Kharkov are purchased it
for rupees one lakh 20,000 and in 1931
he gifted it to his daughter princess
Lila Raja Rana subjugation of Jubal
State the husband of the princess
demolished the old Victorian building in
1938 and constructed in its place the
present magnificent summer palace at the
cost of rupees five lakh the new
Woodville palace was designed by the
army and navy stores of London
[Music]
after the Rajah is dead the palace was
converted into a hotel by one of his
grandsons and was opened for public in
1977 wood will now called wood will
Palace Hotel has lovely surroundings its
gabled roofs and turrets set amidst the
lush greens of four acres of deodorant
pine trees beautiful wooded walks and
well-groomed lawns are reminiscent of a
large country house as the summer
capital of the colonial government a
number of buildings exuding Imperial
self-assurance were constructed in
Shimla during the 19th century diversity
and blending of Stein's was the hallmark
of the English architecture and these
trends featured prominently in most of
the buildings constructed in Shimla
during that period
[Music]
the new gothic features can be seen in
gotten castle the former imperial civil
secretariat and now the accounted
general's office
[Music]
the band's caught now the official
residence of the governor of Himachal
Pradesh has Tudor arches and spires the
unusual cast iron and steel structure of
the former railway board building
presently houses many of the central
government offices
[Music]
the present structure of the Ellerslie
building was constructed after
dismantling an old building of the same
name that housed the military department
of the punjab government till 1886 it is
now the seat of the homogenous
Secretariat
however the vice-regal Lodge is the most
important and the most imposing of all
Imperial buildings at Shimla standing
majestically on the summit of the
observatory Hills is the vice-regal
Lodge
now known as the dashed patina Vasa it
is quite befittingly the only building
in Shimla that occupies a hill by itself
this rambling Scottish baronial edifice
best I'll istic resemblance to the
English Renaissance architecture
designed by Henry Irving an architect in
the Public Works Department it took
about three years and 1.65 million
rupees to complete it
[Music]
it consists of a main block of three
stories and another block called kitchen
wing of five stories however three of
the five stories of the kitchen wing are
below the ground level of the main block
and thus do not belittle it a small task
amounts the lodge from which the Union
Jack once fluttered this star houses the
water tanks into which the water was
pumped from the main supply line of the
city
after independence the large remains the
summer retreat of the presidents of
India in the early 60s the then
President of India dr. s Radha Krishnan
a leading philosopher and a writer and
the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru
decided to make it a scholars den where
the best of minds could find an ideal
retreat
[Music]
accordingly the indian institute of
advanced studies moved into the lodge in
1965
in a magnificent coordination Darbar
held on 12 December 1911 George v the
visiting king of England announced that
Delhi would be the capital of India four
days later he even laid the foundation
stone of this new capital even before
any actual planning had been done
[Music]
in 1912 a delhi town planning committee
was set up under the chairmanship of
captain george Swinton the first task
before this committee was to suggest an
appropriate site for the construction of
the new Capitol by March 1913 the
committee gave its final recommendation
and it suggested a site not very far
from gentlemen third an observatory
built by the maharaja of jaipur an
empire in stone was constructed on the
hilly mound of rice inner
[Music]
this Acropolis was the place of the
government in its highest expression the
focal building in this group was the
palatial residence of the Viceroy of
India
[Music]
designed by the eminent architect Edwin
Newton's this building was originally
scheduled to be completed in four years
but due to the intervention of the First
World War from 1914 to 1918 the
construction dragged on it was finally
completed after 17 years in 1929 and the
cost of rupees fourteen million at the
peak of its construction over 20,000
laborers and 3,000 stone cutters what
incessantly to raise this building the
Rashtrapati Bhavan has been laid out in
eight shape and it covers a floor area
of 2 lakh square feet bigger than the
Grand Palace of UE 14th in Versailles
the main structure is six hundred and
forty feet wide and its sides are 540
feet deep
some 700 million bricks and three
million cubic feet of stone have gone
into building this mega house of four
floors and some 340 rooms of varying
sizes the rashtrapati bhavan is
approached through its eastern side
where a flight of 31 imposing steps lead
to a columnar portico there are 20
stately columns 12 in the front and 8
behind in the middle of these columns is
a pedestal
rising above a small rectangular pool on
these pedestals one stood the marble
statues of king george v and the Queen
Mary of England the most majestic Hall
inside the Rashtrapati Bhavan is the
Durbar Hall situated just beneath the
majestic dome it occupies the central
position in the building
this hole is designed on the pattern of
the Pantheon in Rome the walls of white
marble rise to a height of 42 feet
when's the dome begins to spring 72 feet
in diameter and 77 and a half feet in
height
above it is the majestic Dome of the
Rashtrapati Bhavan which is often
described as the symbol of serenity the
top of the dome measures 54 meters above
the forecourt
it is faced with copper blades which has
over the years acquired dark patina
on the eastern side of the Rashtrapati
Bhavan is a huge rectangular courtyard
measuring 1,300 feet by 600 feet in the
center of this court stands a 145 feet
high
Jaipur column the name of a column comes
from the fact that its cost was born by
the Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh of Jaipur
it is topped by a bronze Lotus from
which arises a six-pointed cluster which
together weighs a little more than five
tonnes the rounded shaft is of
buff-colored sandstone wholly carved in
pattern of oak leaves it rests on four
Eagles with stretched wings the pedestal
of the column contains a diagram of New
Delhi on one side and on the other it
bears an epitaph composed by Newton
himself and now your thoughts with faith
your deeds with courage your life with
sacrifice so all men may know the
greatness of India
a prophetic message from a master
builder indeed
[Music]
Herbert Baker was a close associate of
Edwin lewton's when he was assigned the
task of designing a secretariat on the
Rai Sena he set out to create to use his
own words a permanent record of history
learning and romance of India his first
project germinated not very far from the
Magnificent creation of his friend Edwin
Newton's separated from the Rashtrapati
Bhavan by a 14 feet high iron grill is
the government court comprising between
Secretariat buildings called the North
block and the South block each of the
two blocks is about the size of the
British houses of parliament each block
is three stories high and nearly a
quarter of a mile long
the total length of the passages is
nearly six and a half miles to an arms
of each block let's stretch out towards
the Rajpath culminate into the twin red
sandstone passage mounted by the
colonnade pavilions having fourteen
columns each each block is mounted by a
dome which is 217 feet high from the
ground that is only 21 feet lower than
the Kutub Minar each arched opening is
bound by twin blasters on each side
which culminate in a projecting cornice
above which beautifully sculpted
elephant heads are placed in the North
Block the dome sits on an entrance hall
while in the South block it surmounts
the conference hall the majestic Rajput
dissect the 2 blocks and travels down
the slope of the rise in a hill where it
converts into a large plaza it is a
rectangle with elliptical ends 26 and
1/2 acres in extent this is Vijay chock
from where each year on 26th January the
processional parade to mark the
anniversary of India's Republic
commences its journey this is also the
venue of the beatings retreat ceremony
that marks the conclusion of the
Republic Day festivities six red
sandstone obelisk fountains three on
either side of the Rajpath add to the
grandeur of this plaza each of these
fountain is 240 feet in length it
consists of two circular sheets of water
formed by an oblong on a slightly lower
level
the plaza is bound by a high Saatchi
style trailing with three stone gates on
either side initially the British had
not envisage any Trant building to house
the impurity Legislative Council however
by 1919 it became evident that
constitutional rights cannot be taken
away from the Indians and a large
Legislative Council was inevitable
accordingly on the backdrop of the
Government of India act of 1919 a large
Legislative Council was commissioned its
foundation stone was laid by the Duke of
Connaught on 12th February 1921 it took
six years and 8.3 million rupees to
complete it and was inaugurated by the
then Viceroy and the governor-general of
India not even on 18th January 1927
[Music]
designed by Herbert Baker the circular
building is located towards the
northeast of the rush but the Pavan and
the Secretariat blocks it is 560 feet in
diameter and is spread over an area of
two acres the circular perimeter is 75
feet high and is divided into three
levels the red sandstone foundation
story a middle story grit abound by 144
buff colored columns each 27 feet high
and a small attic story in plaster above
the coordinates
[Music]
it has 12 kids among which gate number
one on the Sunset Marquis is the main
entrance the whole architecture bears a
close imprint of the Indian tradition
the use of the charges and the varied
forms of Marvel jollies are reminders of
the story of the craftsmanship displayed
in ancient monuments and memorials
inside the Parliament House there are
three semicircular wings all these wings
are connected to a circular central hall
the central hall was originally used as
the library of the erstwhile central
Legislative Assembly and the Council of
states the chamber of the Lok Sabha or
the house of the people is semi circular
in shape with a floor area of about
4,800 square feet the chamber of the
Rajya Sabha or the Council of states is
almost on the same pattern as that of
the Lok Sabha chamber but a smaller in
size
[Music]
the Parliament is the most manifest
symbol of the world's largest democracy
its robust architecture and grand design
only adds to the high values and
tradition that this institution upholds
by the very nature of things the
parliament house estate in particular
and the chambers of the two houses are
subject to strict security precautions
throughout the year
[Music]
originally called as the All India War
Memorial arch this 160 feet high
gigantic structure of Imperial Delhi was
erected as a solemn homage to 60,000
Indian soldiers who had died fighting
for the British on the northwestern
frontier and in the third anglo-afghan
war of 1919 this impressive memorial was

the buildings of the British Raj added a
new term to the architectural vocabulary
it was ceremonial or processional
architecture as for the new capital
itself the name New Delhi did not come
into work till 1926 in fact the Imperial
Delhi Municipal Committee had forwarded
three names to the British government in
London these were resina
New Delhi and Delhi south of which New
Delhi was approved personally by the
Qing Emperor the new capital was
formally inaugurated on 3rd February

on 15th August 1947 India became an
independent nation the challenges before
this country which was impoverished by
colonial rule were numerous the biggest
of all was that of building
infrastructure for economic development
for social welfare and for governance
the post independent architecture played
a decisive role in meeting these
challenges the story of how modern ideas
and young dreams of our master builders
give concrete shape to ambitious
projects of post independent India we
leave to some other time meanwhile the
architectural past of India lives on
rubbing its shoulders with modern
buildings of our times every building is
part of a jigsaw of our nation and us
has a definite societal role to play
until we meet again it's goodbye and Jai

administration official has said that
China has a responsibility not to shield
Pakistan and should urge Islamabad to
take action against terrorists
expressing deep disappointment over
Beijing's decision to block a bit in the
United Nations to designate Jessie mama
chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist
the official said we think China has a
responsibility to not she Pakistan and
join the international
unity in calling on Pakistan to take
action against terrorists operating on
its soil she added he added we believe
that China and the u.s. share a mutual
interest in achieving regional stability
and peace and that any failure on the
Security Council has part to designate
Masood Azhar as a terrorist would run
counter to this mutual goal that China
and the United States have the United
States is warned Pakistan that another
terror attack on India will prove to be
extremely problematic as it asked
Islamabad to take more concrete and
Sistema actions to rein in terror groups
including the Jesse Mohammed and the
lush Curitiba addressing reporters at
the White House on Wednesday a senior
administration official said we need to
see Pakistan taking concrete and
sustained action to rein in the
terrorist groups mainly the JJ Muhammad
and the lashkar-e-taiba
in order to ensure that we don't have
really shion's of tensions in the region
asked about the steps taken by Pakistan
in the aftermath of the Bala Cote air
strike by the Indian fighter jets the
official said that the United States and
the international community needed to
see irreversible and sustained actions
against the terror groups he said in the
recent days Pakistan has taken some
initial actions by freezing the assets
of some terrorist group making some
arrests and taking administrative
control of some of cheshire muhammad's
facilities but we clearly need to see
more in terms of irreversible action
because in the past after they made some
arrests they released these individuals
a few months later the terrorist leaders
are sometimes still allowed to travel
around the country and hold rallies
New Zealand meanwhile has imposed an
immediate ban on assault weapons taking
swift action and response to the
Christchurch massacre and triggering
renewed calls from leading American
politicians for curbs
in the United States Prime Minister
Jason Dardanos said as salt rifles and
military-style semi-automatic weapons
would be banned with immediate effect
making good on a pledge to ensure that
nothing like last week's slaughter of 50
people ever occurs in the Pacific nation
again the time for the mass and easy
availability of these weapons must end
today I am announcing that New Zealand
will burn all military-style
semi-automatic weapons we will also burn
all assault rifles we will ban all [ __ ]
opacity magazines we will ban all parts
with the ability to convert
semi-automatic or any other type of
firearm into a military-style
semi-automatic weapon we will ban parts
that cause a firearm to generate
semi-automatic automatic or close to
automatic gunfire and short every
semi-automatic weapon used in the
terrorist attack on Friday will be
banned in this country but time now for

the European Union without a brexit deal
on April 12 if lawmakers fail next week
to back Prime Minister threes amazed
agreement with Brussels now speaking
after the meeting of streon Chancellor
service turned course said EU leaders
gave tourism a an extra two months until
22nd May to leave if she wins next
week's vote in Parliament well Prime
Minister Theresa May has welcomed the
European Union's decision to delay it
breaks it saying that lawmakers in the
British Parliament now had clear choices
about what to do next well the decision
today underlines is the importance of
the House of Commons passing a brexit
deal next week so that we can bring an
end to the uncertainty and leave in a
smooth and orderly manner tomorrow
morning I will be returning to the UK
and working hard to build support for
getting the deal through I know MPs on
all sides of the debate have passionate
views and I respect those different
positions last night I expressed my
frustration and I know that MPs are
frustrated too they have difficult jobs
to do
I hope we can all agree we are now at
the moment of decision and I will make
every effort to ensure that we are able
to leave with a deal and move our
country forward I think what this
decision tonight does is show the clear
choice that is available open to MPS
getting the deal through next week in a
meaningful vote means that we can have
that extension to the 22nd of May get
our legislation through deliver on the
referendum leave the European Union and
do it in an orderly manner not getting
that vote through means that we will
obviously as the council has said come
back to the council before the 12th of
April with a plan for the way for the
way forward but that if it involves that
further extension which meaning us
candidates being stored in the European
parliamentary elections I think the
choice is clear for people and I'm
appalled joins me live on this issue
well I'm red good morning to you first
of all now on one side I'm with resumes
looking for more time as far as big the
deal is concerned so on the other side
two million petitions have been signed
to reverse this brigade where is this
bread's it going actually now and so if
there is a man in a very very difficult
spot okay she cannot get the tea you
cheese worked hard for the past two we
used was with EU to get her Parliament
to approve it it's one party also been
peaceful in our own party that our would
to the deal that are--some a has worked
out they believe that he has not been
able to negotiate it's very much in the
favor of the United Kingdom they would
want Teresa made to get more concessions
from being you on a bracelet deal so you
know 1442 would write in the House of
Commons and lost very very badly in the
last round 119 wouldn't he lost by so
you know when she goes to the House of
Commons next week with this deal again
the results may not be very different in
that event she will have to come back to
the EU on the hills
a breather of two weeks on the 12th of
April to work out a forward way a way
forward but the voices emanating out of
the youth you look at you know what it
was a very clear and its own message by
the French president Emmanuel macron
saying that you know if it comes down to
a No Deal scenario or we're ready for it
how long can we keep delaying this so if
that happens it'll have very very bad
consequences economic consequences both
on the UK and also for EU and other
larger world as well well I mean now
what happens from 12th of April we're by
eus at the deadline for the brexit if in
case the ISM a and now also even after
the extension does not get the bribe of
backing on the brakes the deal what
happens on 12th of April okay well

one day she was going she she just sat
in the bedroom she closed her ears and
she said mommy please tell him to go
away I cannot stand and I never seen her
like that I remember she started
screaming and she said someone's outside
the house
and I thought there were thieves or some
you know no gangsters or something out
of the house and I was like what is she
saying
and then she's like closed two windows
closed two windows and I closed all the
windows and I say who are doing because
nobody was in the house nobody was
outside the house soon boom I mean they
are just making so much obliged tell him
to go away tell him to go her symptoms
were fairly severe or I would say very
severe because she had all the hallmarks
of schizophrenia
she had delusions she had hallucinations
she had suspiciousness she was acting
out on it
[Music]
he felt very weak he felt very weak and
we didn't know what to do
I remember and deep in my heart I said
no they there will be a way that she
will come out all of us got involved my
youngest girl was I think about 12 years
old that time
my wife and I it was very difficult for
me to accept what she was going through
and you know I remember you know I have
always had to follow her to the shops
later because you know something my dad
would always be like you know follow her
for the world
[Music]
[Music]
it's difficult it's difficult to
constantly have to deal with shuffling
between mixing realities I think you
know my friends who probably are on
drugs or do a bit of dope would
understand that oh hey I just don't need
anyone or them you know hallucinations
for cadmium all day it's about learning
to you know just live with them I could
she was holding on - right
oh yeah I don't remember what she was
holding something in her hand and she
wanted to I think either poke me or the
father I don't know what and then I was
wondering you know what's going on and
my dad held her and she started crying
and I I just don't know what was going
on and I was like totally lost then her
father also kept on you know trying to
grab the knife from her and she was
walking the hall d1 mattress so my
husband just pulled me and he said let
her do at least she will come out from
that and then when she calmed down
slowly my husband vented to her and took
the knife away
[Music]
it's now big time it really me up the
beam was not functioning at the level I
knew before it was just yes-no yes-no
kind of a thing she was a person you
could talk to but she would answer but
there was no response she would just say
it because okay yes this is the right
thing to say so she was saying it but to
actually voice her opinion that was not
there

from being this completely hyperactive
individual who would like you know swim
and you know when get involved in
martial arts and dance constantly and
all of that being just taken away from
you it was literally just and you just
feel like a goddamn vegetable I mean
when she's on match she's someone I
can't I mean can't put the name in the
face and the person together at all
[Music]
and just giving our medications was not
enough
it was just like giving medications and
waiting for a miracle we'll get our
child back to doses my headache will go
away that was not the answer we were
waiting and waiting and nothing was
happening so finally we decided that we
will look at other options all right and
these are all the other options
counseling helped and all our activities
in the art therapy
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
if someone believes that the illness
they have has been caused by some
external powers even if we don't always
agree with them if we write that idea
off it's highly unlikely that they would
continue a therapeutic relationship with
us so my personal thing is that even if
patients tell me something that I don't
necessarily agree I ask them to go ahead
with what they think would help them as
long as they do advise as long as they
to take sort of sounds big my admired
voice as well because both of it working
together helps sort of get them better
quicker and faster

dr. Ivan treated me as an individual not

see him I I hear that other psychiatrist
spend just five minutes and this it

them and see what they want you know
because if you're good enough they're
gonna follow you around and just ask

was probably what got me ticking I
started befriending these voices rather
than calling that that voice coming out
from there if she gives it a name and
says Stephen is talking to me so it
becomes very personal and becomes easy
for her to deal with
[Music]
it was because of the voices that I
started to paint colors started flowing
in my life the very voices that were
controlling me
controlled my painting also controlled
my artwork was helping me at the same
time what happened at action level of
cutting myself action level of taking
that knife and you know trying to kill
my friends or you know action level of
wanting to run away slowly transformed
onto paper as action but it's action on
paper now you know she's been able to
express her symptoms through her art and
through her paintings and that has been
a good cathartic experience for Reshma
[Music]
you know a colleague's they drive us
right so that's important that's
important that we aren't just not
surrounded by the service providers the
psychiatrist's the counselors the
parents but we're also surrounded by
people who knew us before friends who
knew us who we did trust and they would
remind us that you will like this before
anyway so why do you think it's a
symptom that this is where your
self-talk happens you question yourself
that no she said it's fine
you know why my parents saying any
different it's not I'm trying to blame
bands over here because you know hey
guys you know they've been seeing it for
years so eventually they also need to
read you to rehabilitate themselves they
need to go out and I keep time please go
out and hang around you guys haven't
done it for five years with being with
me please see that I have similar
problems with these friends you know
other grants Ares similar problems with
other 30 old daughters and then it gets
them thinking that hey yeah you know I
think we need to pass through this you
know
[Music]
[Music]
and I would say that's a very spiritual
part I mean I started reading up talking
to a lot of different spiritualist or
people who believed in other sorts of
worlds or realities or explanations for
things that science cannot still answer
I don't disregard science my dad's a
scientist you know but then why haven't
you answered my story over here why is
it that these are issues that you cannot
answer there's no course you say there's
no cause for such things as they say
there's so many causes fine acceptable
there's no cure but there's a different
way of doing things you can take
medications
why isn't and cure them if you think
science can answer all of this I have
nothing against it but then that there's
a time that comes I'm a very impatient
person I need my answers I am NOT gonna
wait for it to happen I'm not gonna wait
until sign comes up science comes up
with some answer to it yeah I would do
this you'd be all fine hello I'll be
like 50 with white hair actually start
looking old oh why can't we I want to
enjoy life I won my Ferrari I wanna do
stuff I wanna go out there and do stuff
don't want to be sitting here taking
meds until you guys come up with some
answer you know no is that there doesn't
mean
[Music]
[Music]
yes it did make me uneasy when she said
that she did not want medication and if
I remember correctly I think after
stopping the medicines within the first
couple of months she did become unwell
and my natural instinct was to put her
back on medicines she was dead against
it and I can't say that she was right
maybe because yes with medication I may
have been able to control her symptoms
quicker but yeah she took a bit of time
but she reached there so that sort of
made me think that are the medicines
always needed and are they always needed
according to the so-called protocols
that we have because now in medicines
everything has protocols and everything
has a sort of decision-making tree but
that does not take into account the
person the individual we are dealing
with
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
and if she does want to go what is it we
can do to stop her from going shall we
call the police and say that our child
is not well and tell him to lock her up
no we will not accept those things I
think that is worse than going sending
the child to prison right you say look
she is alright she will go she will come
back maybe she'll hurt us a lot in the
process no we can stand it and I think
many parents can't do that
[Music]
we are always kept in our comfort zones
with people who understand what we're
going through people who know who we are
people who will protect us who will
stand up for us
there was being the rebellious person
again no no I want to go out there I
want to go to the streets I want to do
this you know and nobody knew anything
about me
so my complete band-aid was actually
removed my wounds were open you know I
didn't have my parents I didn't have my
support system I didn't have my doctors
didn't have anyone at that point and I
always had I was having to deal with the
illness bit and facing the real world
having gone through so much I think I
will not say that dissolve no value I
think there are more value to him
strengthening your own result that's all
mr. catalyst that's such a good shot and
everybody knows gave me the tiger you
know they said that okay she cannot do
because she's not even that set of mind
[Music]
can you sure do you wanna eat through
the camera okay thank you we told that
you know what we can't even stress will
be triggered off yes will be triggered
off my question is who is not which one
of you do not encounter problems all my
friends were normal have problems they
get thrown into a pool of sharks every
day also I mean so nezumi you're never
gonna show me that pool of shocking
never gonna allow me to swim you're
never going to let me touch water

with the end of Turkic slave mamluk
dynasty and Turkic on origin tribe
called Hillary's annex the rules would
Delhi Sultanate their rule to daily
southmost was highly aided by cracks and
decline in the former Empire however
Jalal Udine Federal Skilled we the first
of the killjoy empires chose not to rule
from marilene rather to move further
down to establish his capital in a new
city called kilo Cree
the city's foundation was laid by
balban's
grants and Yaqoob are what would have
been his palace in those days kilo creed
or kilaguni as it was also called has
now transformed into a very busy
locality of southeast in Delhi opposite
what was once a broadside course of the
river Yamuna what kilo curry was the
second imperial city built in the
neighborhood of Kitab Delhi in the 13th
century by kappa bart the last of the
Turkish the Sultan's early Turkish
Sultan's it was built on the bank of the
river yamuna in an area which today
extends from Maharani Bagh to jankura
roughly and we know that there was a
there was some kind of military use of
the land or military encampment near
kilo creek loki later became a fully
fledged city but in balban's period
there was some kind of or even before he
also built a settlement called a sport
which is where the modern Nizam Athene's
to miss Shailaja think LG when he was
first assumed the throne he was actually
crowned
kill oakley and he ruled from there for
at least a year before he came back to
what was lolcode so nothing much is left
of kilo quarry
it was actually called key Luger he
because it was and it was built by cake
Awad who was the grandson of balbin and
his successor but kilo Cree the only
thing that remains now is the name which
is the name of a small village one of
the urban villages of belly while the
remnants of khilji rule here may be very
few in distant the place was once a home
to a rich Township and an established
market traders were brought from the
daily of old and bazaars were
established the life went on and perhaps
flourished even more in the new city a
sense of stability was slowly sitting in
Delhi Sultanate which allowed the
Indians caught gaining strength we have
a very lively description of the city in
the writings of a 14th century history
tarifa fear o Shahi of zeldin burning
and also a very lively account of
celebrations held in kilo Cree by Emir
Hassan
so if we put the two these two major
texts together we have a picture of
colloquy as a thriving City the nucleus
of the city was a palace built by
Kakaako bought for himself where he came
and held his court Delhi continued to be
the capital of the Sultanate because
major offices meant Secretariat were not
really permanently shifted from Kitab
Delhi but it's fair to say that when the
Sultan came and settled in kilo cream
his nobles also came and settled
merchants came and
that was how so the impulse was
political which is very which was very
important in those days for a city to
come into being gradually of course
shops of different kind civilians other
people working people they all came and
settled in the city acquired the shape
of a proper city rich people of Delhi
also came and it was called the NIOSH
ahead and people came and built their
own palaces next to the river and it
must have been a very beautiful place at
some point because it was inhabited for
such a short while that maybe the stones
were reused in later constructions or
the palaces and all were made of
relatively perishable material like
bricks and hoed and all and they have
now gone we really cannot say because
there's very little information we have
about it what happened later Jalal Aldin
kill she was already walking towards the
evening of his life when he took over
although the royal throne was still in
Mohali kill jury decided to stay put
here and rule from Kira Kree he was
unable to come to the terms if the
people of his kingdom will accept in a
sir / so what did it he decided to built
on the palace left by his predecessor
kakou bought several other buildings two
houses princes nobles and other officers
report over to be built in kilo Creek in
the words of 14th century political
thinkers Eldeen Bernie accountant in
tariqa Pharaoh's Shahi the excellence of
his character is justice generosity and
devotion in gradually removed a version
of the people and they accepted the new
emperor and his new city this is the
first time when we hear the phrase old
daily daily okona daily a berserk for
kitab delhi because there was a new city
in kilo curry which began to be called
sahara no or new city or if you like new
delhi to use a modern expression so the
moment a new
city came up this city began to be
called old he realized that they were
Turkish ruling classes in Kitab Delhi
who were not favorable to his rule and
therefore he avoided ruling the
Sultanate from what began to be called
Old Delhi now and he stayed in kilo
Creek
he started the second round of building
construction in kilo crew expanding Kaku
baths palace building gardens building
new houses therefore providing another
round of if you like political and
administrative impulse to the city to
expand
six years into his room Delhi was
preparing to see another of a throne
shaking while sitting his parched land
waited for the monsoon rains the blood
was spilling in the kingdom of Jalal ooh
uncle G on July 2012 96 he was murdered
by his nephew Cunha Mohammed who later
came to be addressed as an outing season
power allowed in assumed the title of
Sultana Delhi
well the murder of the reigning Sultan
his uncle Jalaluddin LG was soon
forgotten in the beginning it was a
stigma of course and the Jalali nobles
who were afraid of allowance ambition
truly afraid then they were against him
but he bought them with the gold he
brought from the South he bribed them he
took a whole lot of measures to bring
them to his fold and as I said he had a
nobility of his choice so frankly
speaking in the political circle very
soon his image as a regicide forgot was
forgotten d is after witnessing another
palace intrigue in blood lust for power
Delhi was decorating again to receive
her new Judo allow tlg entered the city
in great pong and with a large horse for
the procession leading him to the throne
before taking over the phone of Delhi
allowing began his military career as
governor of Kara province and from there
he raided and plundered Malwa in the
year 1292 and two years later in Davari
allowing LG was arguably the most
important ruler of the Delhi Sultanate
before Mohammed o'clock he ruled for not
a very long period of time 1296 - 13 16
which is 20 years but in this train
20 years a lot happened he built a new
capital in serie another city which was
a plane earlier he built a city there he
built an imperial palace which also held
the secretariat of the state and we know
that serie became a city almost of the
same importance commercial and political
importance as cut of Maharani
if we disregard his earlier career as an
invading Prince he was in these 20 years
was able to not only consolidate the
hal-g power in Delhi and in the Delhi
Sultanate but also take measures which
had very long lasting implications and
he had an image a self image of himself
he considered to be the second Alexander
or Alexander of the age a term which he
used in an inscription on the allied
Arase in the Kitab complex in his coins
also he called himself secondary sonny
or the second Alexander so he had a
grandiose image of himself as a powerful
ruler
considered one of the most belligerent
coolers in the history of Delhi Sultan
of who ventured southwards launching
attacks in Gujarat ranthambore Mahad
chaleur Warangal mobber
and Madurai among his most significant
of campaigns he successfully defended
Delhi against many Mongol invasions
there were many Mongol invasions the
Mongols were trying to capture India and
one major contribution of the Delhi
Sultan's to the politics of the period
was to protect the Delhi Sultanate from
the Mongol invasion the history of India
would have been very different with a
Mongol ruler but it's fair to say that
allowed in hell he played a very major
role he fortified all Delhi because the
population of Delhi was exposed and
people were crossing the river and
coming and settling in Delhi seeking
refuge in Delhi he fought a war a very
fateful war against Kudlow Hodja which
he won and also ordered a string of
forts to be built to guard the route
from where invasion was taking place he
Justin stopped at the defensive postures
leading ruthless attacks deep into mangu
territory in Kandahar gusseting and
Kabul in Afghanistan his forces ensured
that mongols never thought his kingdom

significant ones of his rule will allow

50% and stop payments and commercials on
the tax collected by the local scene
darkus direction and money controls all
these things added to the Treasury of
allowing children Treasury which were
attending for the needs of his growing
army and it's even growing military
campaigns allowed Thiel also took a
series of measures to consolidate his
political power by bringing in people of
his choice as officers of the state and
getting rid of the older nobility by
introducing a new taxation system based
on a measurement of land and conversion
of tax share of the state into cash
minted coins silver coins particularly
the silver Tonkov allowed Dean and his
gold Tonka were found later much later
in the mughal period also so the
circulation of these coins was very very
high he also introduced a whole other
set of measures to consolidate the
political and fiscal power of the state
and the ruling class at the center large
markets called Shahana money came up in
his room catering to the needs of daily
households to exquisite products Muslim
merchants were granted exclusive permits
and monopoly in these markets
though other merchants could buy from
farmers or sell in the markets those
found while eating these rules were
severely punished well it has said under
allowed lien killing his rules hewn
walls had ears and eyes his no boats
were under constant scrutiny even the
private households were not spared from
an efficient network of spies
he banned socialization among officials
intermingling and even banned marriages
between the noble families all that he
wanted to make sure was there was not
even a yota of opposition against him

earliest references we hear about city
are as a big claim not the city itself
it was a big flat ground it was a plate
the plain of City and it really came
into prominence because the armies of
allowed the LG here engaged with the
Mongols the Mongolian visions were a
constant feature of allowing LG city in
in fact particularly the early part of
his reign the Mongols made several
inroads into North India and a couple of
times they came there you know one time
they came to the outskirts of Delhi and
the second time in 1303 they were act
Delhi itself
they laid siege to the city of Delhi and
when you talk about the city of Delhi
you mean merrily the lolcode City but it
was here that the armies of the Emperor
were encamped in the plain of City and
they kind of
barricaded themselves and somehow
managed to keep off the Mongols and the
Mongols for various reasons left after a
couple of months but it is said that
then allow the energy woke up and
decided that he really need to do needed
to do something to protect the where the
army was camped

was transformed into a flourishing town
once known as the pride of a city this

thousand pillars built with marbles and
a beautiful stone work in Pietra dura
the palace is said to have a huge
beautiful gate that took a breath away
of its admirers today only part of that
fort with its walls and ramparts has
stood with the test of times

thugs who attempted to venture in his
kingdom what we have about your demeanor
is mostly legend and oral traditions and
it is said that this was built during
the time of allow Lincoln G at the just
outside the walls of City and the
significance was that it was it was a
tower where the heads of criminals who
had been executed those hence were
displayed over there you can see that it
has these holes on the top of the Minar
and these holes each one of them would
have held heads so it was a huge
deterrent that people entering the city
would see outside this Minar with thes
heads displayed and they knew how what
what a strict ruler allow the energy was
off establish in the new city on
build the first building in the history
of India that employed Islamic

called it on imanari no construction
began on a site running parallel to
majesty cooking Menard due to his death
the construction was stopped Midway and
as the feed will have it
none of his successors took up the
unfinished job he wanted to leave his
mark he wanted to be a great ruler and
there are you know one of those
important parts of his of his rule was
that he went and come you know made
inroads into Dickon for instance that
was one major feature of his role he saw
himself as a great Conqueror and great
conquerors try to leave these monuments
to their greatness so a lie there was a
the expansion of the Kitab mosque was
part of this plan so the building of a
new Minar which was never completed the
building of a grand gateway into the and
if you look at the inscriptions of that
gateway it refers to allow the energy in
very hyperbolic terms as secondary Sahni

his legacy in role is still remembered
for control or nobility agricultural

marketing reforms and price control in
Kenneth
besides several battles and warfare so
one has a mixed reaction when one
recalls the rule of the Sultan as a
stable regime oppressive to the
peasantry particularly and the
subordinate classes but many people
liked him
also a because there was a prohibition
against liquor consumption in Delhi and
the neighborhood he was also remembered
as a sultan in who whose reign things
were very cheap so much later in the
14th century people recalled his reign
with fondness by saying how cheap things
were in his reign and Nasir Uddin Shah
who was a chesty Saint in Delhi mentions
that people of Delhi go to his grave and
tie strings raghavan thing and seek
blessing so his image as a tyrant Sultan
which we have today was very different

the mandate of 2014 was epoch-making
also because it was for the first time
in the history of India that a non

complete majority when a government
works with the Spirit of India first
instead of family first it shows in its

parties have never been comfortable with

first constitutional amendment brought
in by the Congress government sought to
curtail free speech speaking truth to
power which is the hallmark of a Free

showed the extent to which the congress
can go to safeguard the interests of one
dynasty it was mrs. Indira Gandhi who
called for a committed judiciary which
seeks to make the courts more loyal to a
family than to the Constitution this
pursuit of committed judiciary made the
Congress overlook several respected
judges while appointing the Chief
Justice of India
the Congress's modus operandi is simple
reject discredit and threaten if a
judicial verdict goes against them they
rejected then they discredit the judge
and thereafter talk about bringing
impeachment motions against the judge
Prime Minister reminded that the former
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi called a
Planning Commission led by dr. Manmohan

to our correspondent Shama Mishra who is
joining us sir from Panaji Shama Manohar
Parrikar there made his mark as the
chief minister of core he's considered
the tallest BJP leader from the state
and he worked for Goa really till the
very end and you know he's remembered
he'll always be remembered as the man
who built modern Goa just take us
through the sentiments that you're
picking up from the ground the reactions
that the people of Goa are you know how
this morning the sad news came in last
evening how are they reacting to it how
are they coping with the loss and how
are they remembering their favorite
chief minister the four-time chief
minister of go up yes manse is
definitely very hard to cope with the
loss and this is not just the loss of
entire Goa entire Goins purchased as the
loss of the entire country we are here
at his residence and you can still see
you know the entire security artists
area has been still has been tightened
in a short while from now on we are
hearing that the you know mortal remains
will be taken out from here and then as
according to the plan would be taken to
the BJP office we were in the you know
BJP leaders
people across party lines can come and
pay their last respects that will be say
around 1:00 or after that the motto
remains would be taken to two color
Academy wherein all the ghouls and
whoever can come down to Goa and pay
their last respects to the beloved chief
minister would be coming down and you
know seeing their beloved leader for the
last time also after that the you know
procession for the last rites would be
carried out around 5:00 at the timing
has been given five but we all know that
since he's a leader of you know mas
following people would be then huge
numbers and for for a safe aside the
timing has been kept for five hours but
we are guessing that that would extend
and people would be coming down in huge
numbers so that is why we are expecting
a little delay also when we are talking
about you know a mass leader over here
or when the news broke that the Minister
Chief Minister breath his last three
days last all people over here are goons
they came here with a you know teary
eyes also now we are seeing that the
family members relatives are coming here
to you know control the family members
over here at his private residence
opposed so many leaders are coming and
we saw anything got curry Union Minister
coming down here and he also came here
and paid his last respects also he had a
meeting yesterday night on the
development of Goa for Attucks because
currently go worker politics is in a
very fluid situation and to decide the
name on the of the Chiefs Minister is
very important for now so he held a
meeting with all the you know alliance
partners alliance of the BJP who have
formed the government the MGP go forward
and also the independence so here we are
you know getting to know from the
sources that nothing on consensus has
been built and they are still trying to
you know take meetings The Cider dream
of Chief Minister but for now it is
about Manohar Parrikar and his followers
and if you are talking about ourselves
during the you know
the period when he was the defense
minister we saw him coming to Mumbai for
all the Navy events and further you know
commissioning of naval ships or
submarines and it was during his period
when you know we saw a boost in the
making india projects whether beat of
the master-builders limited whether he's
coming for the shipbuilding area or for
the commissioning of like I mentioned
the ionization of the submarines
whenever we used to ask him questions
which he did not want to answer he used
to you know tackle it very nicely but
never he used to say I'm not going to
answer that last when I am at him was
last year when he had come down to
Mumbai where vgb president Amit Shah had
taken a meeting of the my area and Goa
unit separately so that time he had come
on he had become very you know thin and
fragile at that time people were really
happy to see him that the Chief Minister
has you know has been lost back to
health we also complimented him sir you
are looking good today you're looking
very nice today very nice to see you
here that time he said it has all you
guys prayers that I have you know become
better so that is one thing where which
connects him to the people and not just
the reporters here also we heard that he
used to work out on the streets and take
his scooter without security and he used
to engage with people that was one point
which you know separates him from other
chief ministers other big leaders were
holding big posts that he used to you
know talk to people used to mingle with
people very often and this is one reason
he was very close to the guns and this
left I got to work till the very end in
the very last day of his life right
absolutely Shama you know if you talk
about the life and times of Manohar
Parrikar how he really became the
mainstay of Goa politics he changed the
go and politics for unsent for once and
for all and how he is a truly a rare
national leader from gorgeous take us
through the life and times the political
journey that terminal per acre has had
yes we are talking about you know how
this leader who became the chief
minister and also became a max leader
also became a beloved chief minister
over here when we are talking about you
know he entered politics he got elected
from his area people really hard really
could connect with this person with this
man and we are talking about a person
who was you know not chief minister
before that time also people really used
to like him for his values for the way
he used to connect people for the way he
used to respect people
he was - you don't mingle and talk to
people with respect across party lines
whether it be from you know the alliance
or the Congress he never used to
discriminate also when we are talking
about the alliance partners over here
they have this one thing that when the
government of state government of Goa
was being elected was being in the pole
was happening and they were forming the
government although the communist was
there in majority but the you know
alliance team supported BJP and Manohar
Parrikar was one reason why they
supported BJP Manohar Parrikar had to
come back you know from Delhi when he
was holding the position of Defense
Minister he came back for Goa and Goins
because he knew that you know people had
people and the alliance had his support
and that is the reason or we saw
yesterday also that those who are coming
to pay their last respects from the
other alliance partners they said that
we have been supporting Manohar Parrikar
and this is the reason we were with BJP
so that is the you know position of this
particular leader standing tall wherein
people used to work for him not the
party people did not used to look at the
party you know picture and only Manohar
Parrikar as a whole because they wanted
Manohar Parrikar to be at this position
and they knew that Manohar Parrikar
will steer the state of Goa and as we
know
he's the architect of modern Hoover
absolutely he has a duration only we saw
many many you know modern projects
happening taking place and he's getting
inaugurated you know also in the last
years during he used to have this tube
and used to work with that pancreatic
ailment he knew that he is battling such
a deadly disease even though you know
dedication for his work and dedication
for his people he came to we saw the
swari bridge opening the bigger projects
happening the cabinet meetings happening
he was there otherwise you know a person
who was not feeling well I was suffering
from this big problem wouldn't have been
able to do that but just because this is
the determination to work and the people
he did it and also he has been an
inspiration to all the people who are in
their tough times and they are really
thankful to this particular person we
are giving them a ray of hope
absolutely absolutely shaman in factor
you know talking more about the work
that is really left behind the the
impressive Civic infrastructure that
you're talking about and let's not
forget that even when he was so ill he
continued presenting budgets there and
continued attending the assembly worked
for guar till the very end and just to
you know leave with this quote that he's
had in joining politics and I'm quoting
him here I never anticipated joining
politics I was sitting by the river and
someone pushed me from behind into it

as India takes the information
superhighway to web's realizing it's
digital dreams it joins the ranks of
global consortium of IT enabled nations
that are lighting the path one of the
fields that has gained tremendous ground
in the last few decades is big data and
big data analysis what do these terms
mean and how do they affect every one of
us in some form or the other
keep watching to know more throughout
the history of the world human beings
have been collecting information in some
form or the other 20,000 years ago
Paleolithic tribes people kept tallies
on pieces of bone they would compare
sticks and notches to carry out
rudimentary calculations enabling them
to make predictions such as how long
their food supplies would last in 2400
BC the Babylonians used the abacus to do
the same thousands of years later human
beings developed a new way to preserve
information through words written on
pages and books they began to be stored
in large numbers in libraries where they
could be accessed and used by any member
of the public libraries are a way to
store and share information that
continues till date in the 20th century
a change was proving wireless and radio
technologies were being developed to
convey information
in 1926 Nikola Tesla predicted that when
wireless technology is perfectly applied
the whole earth will be converted into a
huge crane and the instruments through
which we shall be able to do this will
be amazingly simple compared to our
present telephone a man will be able to
carry one in his vest-pocket
did Tesla's prediction come true it's
clear everywhere we look
[Music]
in this digital era there is a new wave
of information
sweeping us and it is called big data
big data refers to the massive amount of
information that we as humans have
collected and continue to generate on a
daily basis today the internet stores
all kinds of information from academic
subjects like physical and Social
Sciences to current affairs
ever-changing data like stock markets or
the weather and so much more
we ourselves generate a huge amount of
personal information from typed
documents official records to photos we
take from our mobile phones how is it
all stored
unlike libraries where information was
stored as words and numbers in books
today it is stored as digital packets
measured in bytes so a three-minute song
stored in your mobile phone could be a
few megabytes a film could be a few
hundred megabytes the size of digital
file carrying data about the human
genome could be trillions of times that
size now think of all the data in the
world can you imagine the amount we
humans have collected till date for this
we will have to move beyond megabytes
vast gigabytes and terabytes and
petabytes add to petabytes you can
include all the data available in every
academic library in a country like the
US we need to still keep moving up the
scale past exabytes and reach zettabytes
approximately 3.6 Zeta bytes to be
precise obviously this amount of data
has to be stored somewhere where it can
be accessed quickly and easily that's
where the development of computer
software and hardware has played a huge
role
India's history of printing computers to
handle big data goes back as far as the
1950s
that's when professor Mahalanobis of the
Indian Statistical Institute at Calcutta
first sort of using computers for
population census at first India
purchased computers from the West like
the British made heck to em but the idea
was always to make computers of one's
own in 1960 India's first indigenous
digital computer was made at the Tata
Institute of fundamental research or T
IFR it was called TIFF rack and it could
store a maximum of one kilobyte and
process about 1,024 words but the world
was going digital at an electric bass
and big data was accumulating faster
than it could be processed
therefore India realized that it would
have to not just build computers but
supercomputers to keep up that fell to
the technocrats at c-dac or the center
for development of advanced computing
why can't we develop our own
supercomputer we're done well in the
nuclear program we are done in space
program which becomes Sarabhai so let us
give this challenge to our Indian
scientist so that let us develop our own
supercomputer and so in the late 1980s
India's finest scientists and computer
engineers came together to build India's
first completely indigenous
supercomputer by 1991 they
had built the param 8000 a one gigaflops
supercomputer it was just the beginning
over the next three decades the param
series kept india at par with global
supercomputing technology there was the
param 10,000 then came param Padma param
Yuva and param Yuva - which is the
latest and most powerful supercomputer
of India now that we have the technology
let's understand what can Big Data
actually do for us Big Data computing
can allow us to get the big picture that
would otherwise be difficult to do
without computers for example in keeping
India safe from crime and terror every
day hundreds and millions of bytes of
data is created by surveillance of
public through CCTVs and monitoring
online communications generating this
data is easy but how can it be studied
how can any human being or even a group
of people possibly go through hundreds
of hours of footage emails and social
media communications now just installing
the CCTV will not help because so we
need to also analyze these videos if the
video is being captured on a continuous
real-time basis we can understand the
amount of video data that the country
has okay but what are we going to do
with this data
until unless we are able to analyze all
this data ok so the analysis will
require huge computing power and these
computers will actually help us in
addressing this type of issues and
problems as well as seen in its use for
maintaining law and order big data
analysis steps in where human ability
gets exhausted nowhere is this more true
than in fields of pure Sciences and
academic research actually we know that
innovation is the key to any country for
being ahead or being competitive with
other countries in the global world and
we know that for innovation
research and development that is R&D is
key and R&D to in today's modern era
actually is extensively being carried
out by supercomputers with the
advancement of supercomputing a new
model for R&D has been infused in the
research and development area and that
is simulation and modeling
supercomputers actually enable
simulation and modeling of complex data
and enable us actually to model the real
scenarios of the world and do simulate
it on a supercomputer to enable R&D in
recent decades fields such as high
energy physics biology astronomy and
many others have used computers in a big
way to do their research this has
generated a massive amount of data in
fact such kinds of big data analysis
have led to an entirely new field of
science called bioinformatics where
biology meets computers if you look at
how biology has evolved over the past
two decades or so it has changed from
something which was purely an
experimental science to a high-end
computational domain basically now why
has this happened this is basically
happened because a lot of
high-throughput methodologies and
techniques i've been applied in the life
sciences a lot of automation is coming
in to life sciences just to give you an
example there is something which is
called as a genome sequencing a genome
is a kind of information carrier for
every organism whether it's plants or
animals or livestock or no
microorganisms for that matter
sequencing a genome gives you a lot of
information about the entire blueprint
of the organism now just to give an
example of how genome sequencing has
changed over the last two decades the
human genome was sequenced in 2000 and
it took something like 13 years to
sequence it it took something like 23
labs across the world to sequence it it
took something like 500 million dollars
today you can do it you know with one
machine you can do it in less than three
days and you can do it for $10,000
how does genome-sequencing qualify for
the tag of big data that's because DNA
for example human DNA contains billions
of chemical combinations or protein base
pairs that are important to study when
mapping the human genome these billions
of data points can only be processed by
supercomputers human genome analysis is
actually and better scale to an exascale
problem for example you know the breast
cancer study which we are doing
currently you know it's basically it's a
very small study concerning only the
genes involved in the breast cancer
regulation now if you are if you're
trying to expand it out to the entire
human genome you could require something
like a pata scale or exascale system to
really do and do a complete analysis of
the entire human genome basically
mapping genomes is just one example
because sometimes the problems of big
data are so huge they need the whole
world to join in in 2012 the world woke
up to one of the most stunning
scientific discoveries in recent times
physicists hunting for the smallest
units of matter stumbled upon the Higgs
boson a subatomic particles so tiny it
needed massive experiments to be
conducted by the Large Hadron Collider
or LHC when the LHC is running every
second nearly six hundred trillion
pieces of data are generated far from
any single research lab decoding the
LHC's results the task needs help
from the whole world in order to do that
a global network has been designed to
not only store and back a big data
generated from the LHC experiment but
also to send it to different parts of
the world where scientists and
physicists can analyze it
this network is called the worldwide LHC
computing grid or WL CG the grip draws
on the collective computing resources
around the world using different centers
or tiers for storage backup and
processing power we're here in the CERN
computer center this is called the to0
and this is where the data will arrive
where a first analysis is done and from
here it's distributed all around the
world so in the last year of running the
elites you produce something like 25
petabytes of data this is 25 million
gigabytes of data so even though we have
a big computer center here it's not
enough to analyze everything what high
energy physics is a global community
it's one community spread all over the
world this is one of the reasons it will
it produce communication technology like
the web and the next step from the web
which is sharing information was the
grid which is sharing computing power
every year the LHC generates 30
petabytes of data it is all sent to
researchers around the world including
India you can see it here starting at
CERN near Lake Geneva and if i zoom out
you can see the arrows are data
transfers and you can see transferring
across Europe and if i zoom out further
you will see data transfers heading
towards the Americas and heading towards
Asia so the data generated its own is
distributed all over the world for
analysis to places called tier twos and
in the case of the CMS and Alice
experiments data is distributed to India
and I can show you the CMS Center in
Mumbai here so this shows how an Indian
site this in this case Mumbai is is
connected to the global physics analysis
for LHC in India the data is received in
Kolkata by the variable energy cyclotron
Center or V ECC and in Mumbai and the
Tata Institute of fundamental research
servers at these locations act as
repositories that Indian researchers can
access depending on their field of study
what you see behind us in these racks
are a set of computing resources there
are many computers which are the basic
number crunching machines and there's a
huge rack of storage space which is
nearly 500 terabytes of storage and then
of course we have all the network which
connects of connects these all that is
in a local area network and then
connects to the external world in a
high-speed network big data is changing
the way we do science but how does it
impact the common man and woman find out
after the break
[Music]
big data is a buzzword in the 21st
century for digital India it is a
powerful concept that could change the
lives of even the poorest of the poor
thanks to Big Data and supercomputing
governance is getting a major boost in
delivering public welfare schemes the
backend digitization is and the digital
media and the computerization of all
streamline a lot of services through the
add whole number each citizen gets a
unique ID if all the billion plus IDs
are processed through big data
computation imagine the kind of
transformation workers keep track of the
prenatal needs of an expectant mother in
a village router can facilitate the
issuing of bank loans filing tax returns
or even authenticate one's right to vote
this is possible thanks to nationally
accessible and highly secure
infrastructure set up by the National
informatics center throughout the
country this includes ni sees cloud as
well as data centers across India so the
easiest way to do it is to employ IT at
the back end and cloud has become a big
enabler for that IT so that each
government department doesn't need to
buy their own services they don't need
to set up their own data centers they
don't need to really put huge in front
place so that this there's a back-end
infrastructure you're giving that is
easily available to the government they
can very easily just say that we need
five servers today or 10 servers they
start off on the application today
India's Big Data infrastructure is in
place to facilitate governance
scientific research and many other areas
crucial to the economic progress of
India
such as weather prediction big data
computation and analysis is the
cornerstone of current day weather
forecasting this is because today's
instruments to collect weather data are
based not just on visual observation or
measurement of things like temperature
and pressure
in fact satellites and radar are taking
weather observation to a whole new level
how different weather related objects
like rain bearing clouds or fog
formations emit different types of
electromagnetic radiations or radiances
satellites are equipped with sensors to
pick up energy amounts across different
spectral bands these energy amounts or
radiances are then recorded what we have
onboard satellites are not the cameras
they are called images and Sounders
images they seem they keep on scanning
the earth from one point to the other
point at the bottom say if you start
from the top to the bottom or if you
start from bottom to the top and these
whatever radiances are observed by the
satellite sensor while we're scanning
they are in the form of digital data so
it is not like a one shot camera image
so it takes about 20 to 6 minutes to get
a satellite image the satellite digital
information is binary encodes of zeros
and ones stored as bits and bytes these
bits and bytes of raw data are
transmitted down from the satellite to
IMD's earth station here they are passed
through machines to process it to make
sense of it during processing we have
assigned right value of latitude
longitude to the that particular
locations along with the energy amount
we have to apply certain number of
Correction to reach the exact value
radiated from the target miss our target
image is a cloud our target is C over
your target is Arthur these machines
also adjust for
changes in information along its long
journey of as much as 36,000 kilometers
so definitely certain amount of
inaccuracy in current that to compensate
that inaccuracy we apply the correct
cells atmospheric Corrections Jenny
Thank You Elka auxins and this is now
used for the further processing daily
nearly 400 GB data is generated here
it is processed into meaningful
information for example images of
weather conditions over a particular
area how exactly does all this happen
how does the big data generated by
weather instruments make for a forecast
that you and I can use join us after the
break to know more
did you know that in order to generate a
weather forecast every day it takes a
lot of big data to analyze in a very
short amount of time how to forecasters
do this luckily they have a powerful
ally because India is one of the few
countries in the world to have its own
supercomputing technology supercomputers
allow for phenomenon called numerical
weather prediction where large volumes
of weather data are fed into complex
mathematical equations and algorithms
supercomputers are able to do such
complicated mathematics much much faster
than you and I at the end of this
process you get a mathematical model or
a picture of what the future weather
might look like digital era forecasters
like those at AMD use a combination of
numerical weather prediction and their
own meteorological expertise to devise a
forecast now with these information from
the numerical models and the information
from the observing systems the
forecasters among themselves confer with
each other with the help of a video
conferencing and take a decision about
the today's weather in the forecast for
next 5 days
in fact so efficient has ICT made
forecasting that it has led to the
phenomenon of now casting or the
preparation of extremely short term
weather forecasts of as little as two
hours now casting is very useful to
track moving weather phenomena like
fast-moving winds sweeping rain carrying
clouds that may lead to heavy downpour
in a localized region if you were a
fisherman or a farmer or even someone
who worked on an offshore oil rig now
casting would be especially useful
the era of big data has only just begun
and things will only get bigger and
better as the technology to use it
improves for India especially progress
and development is linked closely to big
data so it's time to build our IT
capability and dream big please send

show patience as long as it takes and
that the country is cautiously
optimistic that Masood Azhar will be
listed there are issues China has to
resolve with Pakistan and joining us now
is our correspondent a be shaken char
for more on this story
Abhishek well we just learnt of how
France has spoken of freezing assets of
a Masood Azhar even as China continues
to stall India's campaign to ban him to
put him on the list of global terrorists
at the UN Security Council can we say
that all these measures and all that's
been happening these are a major step
forward in the fight against terror
India's the diplomatic outreach has
actually paid off well when it came to
banning or including Masood Azhar's name
in the prohibitory list of United
Nations Security Council how technical
whole India is still hopeful that they
will be able to negotiate it through
there is a time frame through which this
technical hole can be discussed and more
evidences and more convincing approach
could be extended from the side of India
because India is one of the you know
India most
wants this person to be listed in this
probit release meanwhile what support
India has gathered as a huge support 14
members out of 15 group of United
Nations permanent he was the council of
which four are permanent member and 10
are non permanent members all of them
have supported India's bid to ban Masood
Azhar was chief of Luschka Ray J
Mohammed in Pakistan and now when China
has put a technical goal India is still
hopeful that it will patiently pursue
this matter until and unless Masood
Azhar is not put in the
the banlist india's effort to effort on
this direction will not cease it will
continue to pursue this right but I will
shake what what what does it mean when
it's said that there are issues that
China has to resolve in Pakistan see
while putting a technical boost China
has not given any explanation or any
reason behind it it has just said that
it wants to that this this whole
technical hold and the time it will
entail further it will give a more time
for the members to deliberate on the
issue to share evidences and to be
convinced and create a consensus among
United Nations of Security Council are
to reach on a consensus consensual
agreement while listening this person
into this band or private release
meanwhile while this whole process of
deliberation will be on Indian sources
are telling that the direct talk with
Chinese diplomatic officials are very
much on in New York in Delhi and in
Beijing
especially India has been updating the
the whole especially p5 members of a
permanent Security Council on the issues
post Pulwama attacked that that all that
has and all the development that has
happened host Paloma Mata India has been
updating them on real-time basis and
this has been well appreciated across
the globe that India has been able to
bring on board all the in nations
important nation especially those who
have you know some sort of stake in
international geopolitics so that's why
India has been able to garner this much
of support while China's issues concern
China has its own geopolitical interest
in this region of the of this war of the
world while it uses Pakistan or China
and Pakistan alliance use is most of
time is used against a countering
India's you know interests impression or
perception in this region of the world
so it has its own of financial interest
because the China has a huge
infrastructure project project
developing almost across the length of
Pakistan till the Gua to the book to the
port of bother also it has it has a huge
military and armory support system that
it extends to Pakistan so Pakistan is a
huge you know buyer of art of Chinese
weaponry and this all has its own
interest so but at the issue of
terrorism when the
all the nisshin's were on the same board
China has opted to you know kind of site
along with its whole time a lie on the

President Rob Cohen will confer the
Padma Awards to achievers in diverse
disciplines and as the glorious Belgian
glass chandelier casts a luminous glow
and all present here at the Durbar Hall
the light of recognition will shine on a
few special individuals and these are
people who have excelled in diverse
fields and diverse disciplines ranging
from art Social Work public affairs
science and engineering trade in
industry medicine literature and
education to sports and civil service
the Padma Vibhushan is awarded for
exceptional and distinguished service
the Padma Bhushan for distinguished

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has arrived
here at the venue
[Music]
this year 112 Padma Awards including for
Padma Vibhushan 14 Padma Bhushan and 94
Padma Shree were announced on Republic
Day
and of course it is indeed a proud
moment for all the recipients as being
awarded at this ceremony sees the
recognition of years of hard work and
many of the recipients have doggedly
kept at improving the lives of those
around without a thought of it ever
being acknowledged success of course is
no accident it is hard work focused
learning sacrifice and most of all love
for what you're doing these are all
luminaries for us who show us the path
the path from dreams to success which
does exist and the achievers we
celebrate today had the vision courage
and perseverance to follow it
innovation creativity and service click
on myriad forms and the people who are
going to be celebrated here today have
displayed perseverance patience and
excellence in their respective fields a
proud moment for not only all of them
their friends families and loved ones

it's a pleasure and simply to the point
will be a lot of fun today John my
pleasure to have you on the probe and to
start with you first of all a very big
congratulations for getting the highest
an award from India to expecting this I
was not I was surprised I break I keep
it on that not sound and there were a
bunch of congressional my friends yeah
and I was wondering for was very much a
surprise a tremendous honor very humbled
back for to get into the larger cause of
the program like to ask you about any of
life you are not what the weaknesses
into strengths and you've traveled so
many years in life we want to know from
you how your journey has been began and
where to where you reach now I will
follow you with whatever questions along
those line I struggled in West Virginia
my parents were both doctors me a lot
about what to deal with opportunities
and challenges as dyslexic which means
that I put backwards and read backwards
and fortunately I had a teacher which is
why I believe so much in education that
taught me how to take that weakness and
actually make it a strength my parents
advisors in my life my mom taught me the
emotional connections and how to really
connections in
Gayatri and my dad was ob/gyn delivered
six babies and he how to deal with
challenges in life and how to deal with
the way it is even to the point at one
time when I years old and I fell into a
river we were fishing I got swept away
in the it's very dangerous and to this
day I can remember my dad from way up at
the river yelling he to hold on to the
pole he had told me not to get too close
to the edge but I did and every time I
was surfacing I'd get my head above
water he hold on to the pole ugly
fishing pole was $5.00
but he kept me focused on the pole and
we went a couple under came down and
swam out and got me pulled me in and he
set me down so many times in life and
said whenever you find yourself in a
very good situation
you cannot panic you can swim against
the tide
you've got to realize how you there and
how do you get out they need me a river
no my mom didn't know and he put me
right back in the rabbits and let me how
to do it myself
oddly enough about ten years later a
young man who was very similar to me
that time he was 16 and he drowned that
exact same spot because nobody was there
to tell him on the pole to really focus
on anything and how do you adjust and
how do you work your way over in tough
situations to get to the side and
realized how much you did yourself and
have done to you what's the biggest
turning point in your life when you look
at me backwards now I think that the
biggest turning point was clearly
education my parents we were they that
at the time was very successful West
Virginia with a chemical center of the
world six thousand engineers carbide
DuPont FMC coal center of the u.s.
125,000 miners and I think the education
I went to school for nine and a half
years and my high school sweetheart
she's put up with all these years and
but running with a business degree and
law degree and how much education life
and so I learned watching transitions
occur Wester he was in very good shape
more millionaires Virginia than in the
United Kingdom average per capita
incomes extremely good but we didn't
transition we kept doing the same thing
too long we got left behind and I love
this and very proud of the people I saw
the same thing happened in Boston 1:28
was the suit around Boston like 280
years
Silicon Valley and we were the high tech
role we could even spell in valley these
crazy Californians that didn't know what
they were doing and yet because we
didn't switch from mainframes to meters
the PC net Boston got left behind one
hundred six thousand people lost a job
at death 32,000 people lost been playing
so I've learned in life that you've got
to either disrupt you get disrupted that
when you see additions are either
technology or business model you must
transition with them or you get left
behind and I've learned to kind of what
I say is connecting the dots to see
around corners perhaps from lessons
learned of the past
so my growing up years I was very
fortunate loving family parents who
couldn't have been better into wonderful
sisters and a wonderful wife and I got
two great kids it's really wonderful the
way you explained how you know Boston
got replaced with Silicon Valley yes and
you also spoke about the loss of jobs
now the only worry which seems to be
around the world is is about the job
destruction especially when you know
because of the technology because of the
digitization so many jobs are being lost
so how do you really see the technology
in war evolving in the times to come
well in the sequence you raise the
questions first unfortunately I think
the people who are concerned the critics
are right that between automation
artificial intelligence digitization we
would destroy twenty to forty percent of
the jobs as we know them today everyone
from perhaps truck drivers to the
farmers to even the radiologists on it
and if you're going to really grow the
job market if large company
40% of large companies will also
disappear when I first started saying
that people said no I don't think so it
might be too conservative a number now
over the next decade it means that
startups and small companies getting
bigger will be the job engine for India
u.s. and for Europe and I think most
people now agree upon that so if you
have 1.2 million people entering the
workforce every month in India and you
have a certain amount of jobs also being
destroyed that will not come back
you've got to generate jobs in the 1.5
1.6 million range to really do that
that's why India has to be a startup
nation this is where I think your Prime
Minister has absolutely the right vision
and the strategy I've met every every
leader in the world for 35 years and he
is among the top three I've ever seen in
my life
his ability to get a vision and strategy
and say here's where we're trying to go
to inspire hope and then take hope to
possible other than probable and with
the digital India and the ability to say
here's what we can do with one segment
such as startups and understanding it
can't be just in six cities where the
majority of venture capital goes it has
to be in all 29 states and it is that
inclusiveness not just by geography but
also in terms of cast in terms of gender
that I think this Prime Minister is the
example for the rest of the world so to
play a small role in trying to help that
happen and to be the startup ambassador
perhaps for the world but especially for
India u.s. and France is very exciting
and I'm trying to change the world one
more time in my way and just like the
internet changed the world and Cisco led
the way there to play a role when the
startups and make it inclusive across
the country like India and the truly
partner between the u.s. and India is
the dream that I have you're talking
about the Indian scenario definitely
earlier what we saw was during the
earlier regimes there was no set agenda
for the startups as it's being taken up
now in the in the current regime but my
question to you is that India needs
about 1 million jobs per month if you
look at the the population so are all
these jobs going to come through the
startup I mean how do you really see the
start of culture evolving in
yeah the answer to your question if I
may use a couple examples is yes and it
has to be inclusive it can't be where
90% of your venture capital in other
words money being invested in startups
only goes to six cities we have 29
states every state population might be
50 million we have to go across all 29
it's the exact same issue in the u.s. it
can't be just Silicon Valley in New York
it's got to be across to all 50 states
and it is the exact same issue the
France state where the majority of its
investment is in Paris in France is the
last place you would have located jobs
just five or six years ago and it was
not creative not a good place to do
business or startups and just four years
it's become the startup engine for
Europe the number of startups are up
from a hundred and forty venture capital
backed per year to 743 French now the
exciting thing about India yes so many
of the people in this country a teaser
gate incubation area grass that it's not
only about education but it's also about
startups and I see this country becoming
a startup engine for the future
and even in the u.s. out of the 18
companies have invested in over 60
percent of the founders are first or
second generation Americas from India so
I have a tremendous amount of respect
for the talent in this country and I
think we we need to take the prime
minister's vision of a digital india of
which startups education health care and
the environment all feed toward a common
end goal of employment across all
geographies across all genders and
across all castes I was seeing a couple
of your interviews and various channels
and you all said that one should reach
us and compete with the US market why
have you always been an advocate of the
US market when it comes to promoting the
startup culture well I think it's very
important let's use the examples in
India and I have two that I'm very proud
of in their early stage and and they
have you know when I look at startups I
look at a market transition with a
technology transition I look for a
visionary potential CEO who knows what
she knows or he knows and those what
they don't who wants to
coached one that my customers say you
ought to look at this company and one
that has the chance to be the number one
number two in India the startup
community all companies will become a
technology or digital company regardless
of food and healthcare manufacturing
consultants government etc so it's the
two combined which creates a tremendous
opportunity but if you really think
about where this is going business to
consumer in India is doing very well at
first these startups were I u.s.
look-alikes but the market here is so
large with 1.3 billion people that
you're now seeing them start to be
innovate India's move from a slow
follower to a fast innovative leader who
would have thought five years ago and
the reason that I talked about you you
startups in India coming to the US or
more the business to business startups
there have been very few successful
high-tech business to business startups
blossom just in India alone so many
people believe in clean myself that
you've got to bring them to the US that
doesn't mean the company has to move but
you've got to come to the US market
where this unbelievably competitive so
you hone your skills here in India you
learned how your product can really
differentiate such as loose idiots has
done with socket Modi such as unifor is
done very very well with ramesh Sanchez
and both i'ma growing to 300% by the way
but to really be successful they had to
move to the US and challenge in the US
market you give an example of you
serious and unifor which of course are
Indian startups which made big after
reaching the US market but we've seen
that there is a certain kind of a hiccup
when it comes to the Indian startups
going global so what according to you
are the real challenges which the
startups here are facing and when you
look at it from from the point of view
of United States what do you think are
the major problems well I think there
are more opportunities and problems your
education system is amazing your top
CEOs often with a technical background
are very competitive on global basis but
there aren't the role models to learn
from and one of the things I'm trying to
do is coach young
companies on how they skill I've bought
a hundred and eighty companies when I
was at Cisco twelve of them for over a
billion dollars I've seen what requires
a company to be successful I've made
every mistake there is to make and so
what I try to do is help these companies
grow and skill to become a mentor for
them and that's often what the venture
capitalists ask me to do to they say
John we don't compete with you but can
you come in and help my company really
grow and scale and I love coaching young
CEOs I get I get my pick of the litter I
get to pick almost any startup in the
world and I'm not sure I deserve that
but that's what's being offered and then
I get a chance to be a proud parent or
grandparent and really let them grow and
to give them advice and then on Friday
evening I say here's my advice I know
it's gonna be tough call me on Monday
let me know how it goes and I go have a
burger and ginger ale but John nope
India is a budding startup nation lots
of things are in process as far as
policies are concerned capital cement
distance
you
you
you
you can connect them to the fortune 500
companies I got you and it's same as
true also for a startup that's gonna go
to the consumer the first thing I look
for to startup is they've got a market
transition that means a business model
change either in healthcare or
transportation like uber or v-tail like
an Amazon combined with technology the
second thing I look for is a young CEO
who she or he knows what they know knows
what they doesn't and they don't know
and wicked smart there's no substitute
for that then I look for who are their
flagship customers that they're able to
hold out as an example using the example
of Sidious the Bombay Stock Exchange or
the top manufacturing in the top bank
and the top government using an example
of unifor who are their top customers
and what do they think about them and
then I look to see if they have a chance
to be one or two in their industry being
number 20 in a fast growth industry you
won't survive so they do they have the
differentiation not within it and then I
look for the quality of their team the
quality of their investors so it's a
replicatable innovation playbook that
allows you to move with tremendous speed
very similar to what I did at Cisco
where we wrote the PlayBook the
innovation playbook for doing
acquisitions I think everyone in the
world would say we are the best there
isn't technology about doing the
acquisitions another 180 we did probably
two-thirds were successful where 90
percent normally fail in a market but it
wasn't that we're smarter worked harder
it was we developed what were the
criteria we wanted to do for
acquisitions just like the criteria
outlined for what you want to do in
terms of successful startups but when
you know there's an evolving startup
culture the biggest question which comes
to mind is that if the startups will be
the order of the day what is going to
happen to the large companies which are
already existing what happens to them
the number one thing when I coach a
young CEO or a fortune 100 CEO a number
of which I do coach in the u.s. the CEOs
job is for things strategy and vision
for the company to develop retain
recruit and change the leadership team
to implement that strategy envision
culture and communications and
communications extremely important for
what most young CEOs miss is how
important culture
culture is what you're about you never
have a great company without a very
strong culture you may or may not like
it so to your point how do you coach
these young companies on culture and
then the second element is how do you
really get them to dream what as
possible how do you help them build the
organization out how do you help them to
have no fear yet realistic on the
challenges that could occur and that was
one of the fun thing about the Padma
Worlds words which were talking about
later when I watched every word
recipient first I was humbled by them it
didn't matter if they were a social
worker or a doctor or an artist or a
musician they took great pride in taking
what they did will and teaching others
how to do it and to scale that's what I
love I consider myself a teacher more
than anything else in terms of the
direction and to appoint your babies
earlier that's often what it's missing
here there haven't you've got tremendous
large consultancy organizations but the
number of startups that have really
scaled over the last couple decades
we're just now seeing them start to take
off in India so those are the type of
things that I look at Anna replicatable
playbook if you will to how to go after
it so which means that the larger
companies have to grow alongside with
the startups they will have to hold
hands they will have to partner together
that's where the actual growth will be
you you've I think restated that exact
right way it used to be the large
companies in India or Europe until the
large extent even in the US would not
partner with small companies the risk
was too high they felt they could
innovate on their own the large
companies aren't going to be able to
innovate with the speed your top
students here in India out of the
eyeties they no longer want to go to
government or the big companies they
want to go to the startups and so if
your talent is going to the startups and
they can move with the speed and a
creativity then large companies for the
first time have to not just do business
with startups they have to actually
partner with them in a very unique way
that's been the major change in the last
two years large companies before even in
the u.s. wouldn't partner their test it
with a small start-up now you have a
very innovative company like Boeing
partnering with a spark cognition 200
people artificial intelligence you
t-50 joint-venture to outline the future
of aviation for unmanned technology
across the u.s. you suddenly have arise
and making interfaces to a company
called ASAP which is still in stealth
mode about how do you dramatically
change your company where you interface
to your customers through artificial
intelligence etc so that's in what is
different in the business world where
many of the established companies for
your question or suddenly look into
startups as innovation engines and how
they bring that startup culture into
their company because the CEOs know they
have to change but often you've said
that India is almost on the cusp of you
know having the next Silicon Valley and
probably it's the Khan Valley could be
displaced soon how soon do you see that
happening I think it's not a question of
a zero-sum game I think the exciting
thing is startups regardless of where
you are in the world whether you're in
France or Germany or the US or India or
the Middle East or Africa or China it's
how do you evolve and I think the
countries who really outline a clear
vision of where you want to go and
execute off of that are going to be the
ones that win now interestingly enough
going back to India I think your prime
minister's vision is the best udders in
the world I've met every leader and as I
said earlier he's in the top three but
he takes the vision and then it's able
to break it into the components and then
keep focused on a digital India a
manufacturing India a environmentally
sound India startup India a smart city
and brings all the parts together toward
an outcome coming to the us-india
relationship and especially talking in
context with this strategic partnership
forum which is doing a lot to promote
the startup ecosystem how do you see the
indo-us ties
developing in in the framework of this
forum well the exciting part to me is
that I believe the relationship for the
u.s. the most important country in the
world strategic partner wise needs to be
India and I'd argue for India the most
strategic important partner they have
needs to be the US and
think about partnering not in an
old-world way and talking about trade
and how companies make money but in a
new world way about how do you create
jobs together how do you incorporate
startups how do you bring innovation to
life how do you do this in an inclusive
fashion both by geography by gender as
we talked about earlier that's what the
us-india strategic partnership forums
about and its ability to dream what can
occur between our two countries and then
be able to work with government and
business leaders and academics about how
do we make this happen and have the
courage to set audacious goals about how
many jobs can we create and how can we
do this across the entire country and
how do we educate the citizens both in
the US and India of the importance of
our partnership and how that will
benefit each of those perhaps it's a
dream that people say or is it's not
possible but while I have a lot of
weaknesses in life most of the
predictions I've made on connecting the
dots because the experience I've already
seen the movie is the ability to say
here's the outcome that's what dyslexia
forces you to do to go ABZ and to get
people around you can say how do we feel
in the pieces as we go I think looking
back 10 years from now the relationship
between our two countries will be the
model for the rest of the world and that
doesn't mean there won't be bumps along
the way and at times one side gets
irritated with the other that's part of
a partnership but if we as long as we
keep in mind out of both countries with
how the citizens win in each other way
how do we do this in an inclusive
fashion for all the geographies I think
this will be the example for the world
absolutely and when you talk about
thinking global and you know taking the
Indian startups to America and you
always said that if you can compete in
u.s. you can compete anywhere that's
what all your interviews have said
invariably but here what about barriers
like h-1b visas when it comes from the
US government
and how does one then deal with barriers
like these because they are are a big
stumbling block then well first you need
to know in my opinion and now speaking
for John Chambers jc2 chairman of the
us-india strategic partnership forum I'm
a huge believer in immigration
and I think trying to attract the best
of the brightest in the world to the US
it's what has made our nation a great
nation and I think we need to continue
to do that at a tremendous tremendous
speed that when we have barriers to that
I think we've got to say how do we knock
those down and how do you do it to the
point of realizing that 40% of the
startups in the u.s. finden orange and
in Silicon Valley alone and they create
a huge number of jobs there I think also
educating people throughout the country
on why that is in their best interest
and how do you do it in a true win-win
way for each country so I'm a believer
strong believer in structural
immigration and quality of leaders and
I'm also a huge believer and many of the
people that have come out of that I t's
accepted to come to start companies in
America then come back to India as well
and I think it is that type of
partnership that the future holds for
both of us I think educating people on
why that's important not just on h-1b
visas but in general to the point that
you raised indirectly France as an
example and they have become the startup
nation in Europe is almost if you've got
a higher education in engineering or
technology it's not makes them come to
our country we want you here so I think
the future is about talent I don't think
anyone geography has a monopoly on that
as the popular saying goes that you know
politics is always an instrument of
socio-economic change in the society and
in India elections around the corner is
going to be my last question to you what
do the political parties really need to
focus on when you talk about startup
culture promoting a start-up culture
promoting an entrepreneurial spirit
because very soon the political parties
will come out with their manifestos as
exactly what they're going to do so how
should they really focus as far as the
startup second sir and if I control that
parallel to us I all my career even
though I'm a moderate Republican we're
just kind of endangering you
especially in California I've always got
along with them saying this no I don't
have any problem saying that but I get
along with the Democrats the Republicans
you know get along very well with Nancy
Pelosi the speaker in the house I get
along very well with Kevin McCarthy the
leader from the Republican side in the
house
John McCain was my idol before he he
died and I get along with Chuck Schumer
so I tend to separate politics from
results and I always try to figure out
who can outline the right vision to
change the country and make it inclusive
and so in this country is an example
it's up to the people in India to
determine who their future will be but
as I said earlier I'm hard pressed to
say I've ever seen a better leader than
your Prime Minister and somebody who can
outline a vision and a strategy and then
spare the hope and the possibility and
then probability of execution and hold
himself to a level of accountability to
drive this through he is respected
around the world and I talked to all the
other world leaders I he when he when he
goes toe-to-toe with the President of
the US or key leader of Europe or China
or Pakistan he represented the country
in an amazing way but most important he
has a vision and strategy which you
can't argue with it's the number one
economy in the world growing seven to
ten percent India used to have such a
bad image in terms of Ease of Doing
Business it's improved more than any
other country in the world we still have
a ways to go and startups there were so
many hurdles in front of startups and
they've knocked him down and the courage
on D monetization I'm glad he didn't ask
me because I'm not sure I would have had
the courage to say do it but it was
absolutely the right move but digitised
in the country and the goods and
services tax the angel tax fixing for
startups I see such a progressive vision
of the future here in India and as I
said I think it is the best strategy and
implementation in the world but it's up
to the citizens that have continued to
decide their future but this is one of
the top three leaders I've ever met in
my life
I think his vision for a India inclusive
across all geographies gender caste is a
and that's perhaps what I learned in the
Padma Awards when I watched my peers and
how good they were and it wasn't just
the past India and the achievements it's
the present but it's the hope for the
future and the ability to dream together
it was really heartening to hear from a
person like John Chambers that India is
on the right track and was really lovely
talking with you a great inspirational
talk as well thank you so much
program the honor was mine so that's it
on this episode of to the point see you
next time with another personality

LJTlrFYxGTs,Filigree in Stone- The Hoysala Temples,DD India 24X7 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 'DD India' is the News Channel of ...,2019-03-14T01:03:59Z,DD INDIA,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LJTlrFYxGTs/hqdefault.jpg,"[Music]
in the eleventh and twelfth centuries in
North and Central India great temples
were being made in the negara style the
Dorado South Indian style prevailed in
magnificent temples which were being
constructed in Tamil Nadu
[Music]
in the deccan which lay in between north
and south india hill chieftains named
the hoysalas were gradually coming into
power and creating a kingdom in southern
karnataka Hoysala history is clear from
the time of vishnu vardhan ah who ruled
from eleven hundred and eight to eleven
hundred and forty two inscriptions show
that the king his wife and his ministers
were generous patrons of temples king
vishnu vardhan are defeated the imperial
Cholas in eleven hundred and sixteen
this was a landmark in the establishment
of his dynasty to commemorate his
victory he built the temple of Keshava
or chennakeshava at Balu in present-day
Karnataka he named it the vision arena
or the victorious Vishnu
the temple is a classic example of the
ornate style of temple art under the
hoysalas they inherited a rich tradition
of temple building from the dynasties
before them the Chalukyas and the cholas
the Chalukyas had made magnificent
temples at but radical in the 8th
century and at other sites further south
the Cholas had created great temples in
the region of tamil nadu the hoysalas
borrowed freely from both traditions and
created a style which is a rich blend of
northern and southern influences Vishnu
or Donna who was a subordinate of the
Cherokee and ruler who fought endlessly
against the Cherokee has to see in the
Cherokee territory
and merely won most of the battles felt
at the end probably that while he could
rebuild an empire which was earlier she
was was the monopoly of the Cherokees
whether he would be able to rebuild the
kind of an empire which they had built
up in terms of of decorating his entire
landscape astray with beautiful temples
that was the question he didn't want to
appropriate to their territory but they
want - he wanted to appropriate there's
cultural skill also their culture also
their art also so doing the long marches
that he had in the Cherokee territory he
could not help but wonder add to the
moral SSA temples there so when he
ascertained his power independence and
he established a new capital the first
thing that happened to him was recruit
her to create something which the
Cherokees had created in his own Empire
the cache of a temple dedicated in
eleven hundred and seventeen stands in a
large courtyard it has a pillared
mandapa or hall an antechamber and a
shrine it rests on a plinth which
follows the shape of the temple itself
the Chikara or tower of the temple is no
longer there which gives a flat
appearance to the structure
today the mandapa would originally have
been a pillared open Hall the later
hoysala King Balala the second added
carved window screens
please give the mandapa a more closed
feeling now
such screens continue the tradition of
Western chalukyan temples in the deccan
such as the lad han in a holy the
exterior of the temple is more profusely
sculpted than ever before in a manner
which has come to be known as the ornate
Hoysala style horizontal rows of
carvings run around the temple in an
ordered and highly organized design
every inch of wall surface is sculpted
often in miniaturized detail the temple
has the richest surface texture seen in
any in India the bands of carving which
go around the structure run for over 700
feet the elephants we see below number
about 2000 the exterior walls present
the world forms the material universe we
perceive around us here at the temple
the world is seen in its true
perspective it is seen as a
manifestation of the truth beyond which
is in the garbha Griha
or womb chamber deep inside the temple
[Music]
the Hasan artists paid the greatest
attention to detail every limb of each
figure every decorative design shows
this preoccupation there appears to be a
limitless devotion and time which the
sculptor must have put into his
laborious work every unit of work is
remarkable in its intricacy of design
depth of detail and skilful
craftsmanship
[Music]
however the sense of fluid movement and
balance to be found in other
contemporaneous Indian sculpture is not
here the figures and decorative motives
are deeply undercut and standout most
effectively against dark shadows the
best-known sculptures here are off the
Madonna Kai's the braket figures beneath
the overhanging roof of the mandible
bracket figures are also a theme which
continued from the art of the western
chalukyas of the deccan these are
nikasaur beautiful women who were seen
in Endicott from early times they
represent the fertile abundance of
nature the fullness of the figures and
ornamentation is somewhat similar to the
idiom of nearby Kerala
the sculptures are a celebration of
beauty the depiction of youthful maidens
is considered by medieval texts to be an
essential ornament of temples
of all the themes presented by the
Hoysala artists dance appears to be the
most favored we see men and women
dancing with and without musical
instruments almost all the deities are
also seen in dance postures here this is
a celebration of the beauty and
possibilities of the human form which is
here imaged as divine the emblem of the
Hoysala dynasty is a man killing a lion
this is based upon the story of salah
who was a tribal he saved a meditating
jain son who by killing a lion who was
about to pounce on him
with the blessings of the sod who began
the rise to power of salah and the
Hoysala dynasty he founded
[Music]
to create the images in such detail the
artists used an appropriate stone when
quarried pleuritic schist is extremely
soft and easy to cut it becomes harder
and long-lasting with exposure to air
over a period of time the softness of
the stone made it possible for the
sculptor to chisel the minutest details
[Music]
the interior of the temple is as richly
adorned as the outer walls each of the
pillars of the man depe or hall is
finely sculpted some have figures made
upon them while other pillars are so
smoothly chiseled that they appear to be
late turned there is a central ceiling
panel which is also carved in great
detail this is in keeping with the
tradition of sculpted ceilings in North
Indian temples
there are bracket figures of beautiful
women at each corner of the central bay
of the mandapa
[Music]
one of the finest sculptures here is a
pillar image the fluidity of lines and
the subtleties of body posture are
remarkable there is far less
ornamentation and the figure shows a
close relationship with the chola idiom
many finely carved temples stand in the
present-day village of halibut which was
the grand capital of the hoysalas known
then as doris a mudra built between
eleven hundred and twenty one and eleven
hundred and sixty the profusely
decorated temple of horus Allah Ishwara
is the most prominent structure here
in the words of historian Percy Brown it
is without exaggeration one of the most
remarkable monuments ever produced by
the hand of man the Hoysala shuara
temple has two separate but connected
shrines made on a single platform as in
the case of the chennakeshava temple the
towers of Vimanas are missing which
gives a low and flat appearance to the
temple like the previous temple the
horse Alicia is profusely and
intricately carved there is no effort
spared in creating a world of fine
details and ornamentation it is as if no
labor is too great in attempting to show
the glory of the manifestation of the
divine perhaps the splendor of
ornamentation also reflects the tastes
of the hoysalas who were originally hill
chieftains it is certainly very
different from the simpler and graceful
forms made unto the Chalukyas
and the Cholas
[Music]
miniature Vimanas and grand whare pallas
are made at the entrances to the shrines
the carving is dazzling in its minut
work and wealth of detail the dois
Rapala stand in swaying postures and are
heavy in the fulsome portrayal of the
life force of nature past them we come
into the spacious interior of the temple
the polished and carved pillars are
reminiscent of the earlier temple and
balloon the ceilings are again richly
carved
[Music]
the exterior of the temple as in other
Indic temples provides a view of the
world of separated forms that we
perceive around us here they are seen as
a manifestation of the deity enshrined
in the garbha Griha in its wealth of
detail this is a highly ordered
presentation of the numerous shapes in
which we see the formless divine
in all these our attention is drawn to
the beauty and grace which underlies
everything that exists the deities are
manifestations of philosophic concepts
and the fine qualities within us in
response to their beauty we are to be
transported away from worldly cares
our thoughts taken to the divine which
pervades it all what strikes us most in
ancient Indian art is that the deities
animals plants and common people are
made there are no portraits of kings or
other specific individuals of course for
a brief while these come in during the
rule of the Kush Ana's who hailed from
faraway China in this late period of the
12th century in some schools of art such
as this there are still no portraits of
Kings in Indic belief it is the ego
which is the main source of all pain and
confusion in the world the object of art
is to help us to realize the oneness and
divinity of all of existence
[Music]
however by this period and more so in
this school of art a change has occurred
artists who preferred earlier to remain
anonymous have inscribed their names
with pride upon their works however a
stylistic analysis shows that we cannot
distinguish the work of one artist from
another
as an earlier index schools of art it is
a collective style rather than
individual ones the region had a
tradition of ivory and sandalwood
carving which continues till today
hi solace captcha was probably
influenced by this form of miniature art
the lowest section of the temple wall
has rules of reliefs of animals and
birds elephants stand for stability and
power and have traditionally been made
at the base of the temple as if to hold
it up lions symbolize the courage within
us with which we must face the confusion
and turmoil of the material world
the care and patience of the artist is
seen in the fact that no two liens are
alike in the relief which runs for 700
feet the imagery on the horseless the
Heisler temples in this in this sort of
you know this schist this sharp stone
that captures in miniature form so much
precision of detail is one of the
wonders of the history of Indian art and
the range of figures and animals that we
find in horizontal reliefs as well as on
panels is perhaps unparalleled
throughout the whole temple architecture
of India but in the 12th and the 13th
century in this part of Karnataka we
have this extraordinary range of imagery
some scholars have studied the
representations of Ramayana and
Mahabharata on the great temples at
halibut and bill or somnathpura and
other lesser-known temples but equally
fine artistically other scholars have
studied for example the representations
of machinery for war all the trappings
of the elephants and the horses the
chariots the weapons which the soldiers
are carrying the costumes that they wear
their shields their helmets the stirrups
that are on the horses all sorts of
extraordinary details are there for us
to study and some of these have already
been recorded examined and studied and
we begin to ask how is it that these
artists in this particular milieu for
these patrons were particularly
concerned to record all these things
which perhaps they weren't in other
environments again this is something we
don't understand why is it that artists
working for a hoist of a king in the
12th century in central karateka should
be concerned to show these things but an
artist working for a king in Tamilnadu
in the 9th century should not is
something we can only speculate but
there is something to do with the 12th
and 13th century it's very great
emphasis on
the tree aspects and on war and on the
representations of military aspects that
is I think a general feature of Indian
art if we compare the reliefs on the
hoist or temples with those at Cana Rock
let's say in the 13th century we see a
similar obsession with showing the
paraphernalia of kingship in a military
guys and that the temple is a place
where this has to be shown it was
obviously the king as a military leader
as someone who commands these forces is
extremely important for the worship of
gods above practically the whole Hindu
Pantheon is depicted with an emphasis on
the forms of Shiva scenes from the
ramayana the mahabharata-- and the main
episodes of the Bhagavata Purana are
also made in the walls at halibut are
also finely sculpted temples made to the
jannah deep Ankara's in keeping with
Indic traditions there were no barriers
between the patronage of the temples of
the different parts towards realization
many queens and generals of the hoysalas
were Jena's the cache of a temple at so
not poor was made in 1268 the vimana of
the temple survives and gives us an idea
of how the modest-sized stars of Hoysala
times would have looked rather than
impressive height the emphasis remains
on profuse sculptural decoration the
three shrines of the temple have almost
human size figures of Vishnu in
different forms as Venu Gopala he is
seen in his incarnation as Krishna
playing the flute the husana temples
mark one of the most exuberant periods
of Indian art the artists of this time
must have been among the most assiduous
in their detailed work and most prolific
in their output it is the stylization in
Indian art which is marked here with
less of the naturalism which was also
seen before while every fingernail is
carved the breath of life which animates
much of Indian sculpture has given way
to profuse ornamentation

grandeur of the hoysala court and empire

among thousands of galaxies and millions
of planets earth is the only planet we
know which sustains life
the light heat and energy given out by
the Sun are vital for all life-forms on
earth the sun's energy is converted here
into food
this is a prime foundation of all life
on Earth
to ensure a constant supply of food
nature created pollinators insects the
most prolific pollinators is the
honeybee
along with butterflies the honeybees
pollinate over 70% of the world's food
food crops and grass
[Music]
this interdependence has been the
supreme law of nature a food chain where
each link each strand is dependent on
the other
for survival binding all life on earth
in an intricate and complex food chain a
delicate web of life
[Music]
life first emerged in the oceans nearly
three and a half billion years ago water
air light and energy these are the
elements that made life possible
about 425 million years ago life began
moving obscene to land vegetation
covered the earth for millions of years
an amazing variety of habitats and
ecosystems developed this enabled the
diversity of life forms to proliferate
on our planet from tiny microbes
invisible to the eye to enormous Giants
of the oceans the richness and variety
of life is astounding because of the
diverse climates and landscapes
different species evolved to survive and
thrive in different habitats survival
was the prime instinct of all life-forms
animals and plants began developing
strategies to find food and to defend
themselves against predators
[Music]
for example the jellyfish it may appear
harmless and fragile but is actually
quite a lethal predator
for 650 million years old the jellyfish
is found in oceans all over the world it
has no eyes brain heart or breathing
organ this body is more than 95% water
[Music]
it uses a complex network of nerves to
find food
millions of stinging cells line the
tentacles of the jellyfish
the powerful venom the discharge
contains paralyzing toxins that can stun
and immobilize play within seconds this
enables the jellyfish to capture food
and defend itself against predators this
survival strategy is a result of
millions of years of evolution
evolution occurs through a process
Charles Darwin called natural selection
genes that give some individuals and
advantage such as speed fertility
superior sight better camouflage or a
sharper sense of smell are passed on to
the next generation eventually these
genes spread to the entire population
and the species changes in time a new
species emerges while its ancestor
becomes extinct
this is why change is crucial to
survival as species evolve they become
more in tune with the environment they
adapt and blend in one of the most
successful strategies for survival is
camouflage hair body color and texture
play a crucial role both in finding food
and in avoiding predators the ocean
world is a highly competitive arena prey
and predator must match skillful skill
[Music]
the octopus has survived here for
millions of years because of his amazing
ability to melt into the surroundings it
is a master of camouflage chameleons of
the sea if attacked a pursuit it can
change its color and texture within
seconds a octopus has special color
cells all over its body these contain
bags of pigments by squeezing or
expanding these bags the octopus can
change the color of each cell
[Music]
this is an effective defense strategy
click play and hide from predators
such survival strategies and adaptations
are honed over millions of years these
genes are passed on to the next
generation
as the species evolves adaptation that
help it survive and hunt for food are
passed on to his progeny each new
generation becomes more evolved more
refined and more adapted to its
environment breeding behavior is an
important strategy to ensure that
distribution and continuation of the
strongest gene a powerful urge to
reproduce is inherent in all species
finding a suitable mate is crucial to
the survival of a strong gene pool a
healthy strong and attractive mate will
produce superior offspring better
equipped to survive in a harsh
competitive world
[Music]
seasonal changes also play an important
role triggering of hormonal changes
leading to breeding displays selective
breeding is the law of nature it's a
built-in evolutionary logic a peahen
always picks a well-endowed suitor with
vibrant plumage a healthy bird with
flamboyant feathers will father healthy
babies male vivo birds build highly
intricate complex and sturdy nests for
their offspring a superior nest means
more dexterous and skilled male a female
always inspects the nest before choosing
a mate approval of the nest amounts to
approval of the mate breeding time and
behavior and even the number of
offspring produced is all part of
nature's intricate design
got predators like lions and tigers
produce only two or three offspring
every few years having no predators
above them their survival is ensured
species lower in the food chain breed
more often and produce more babies a
higher number and show the survival of
at least a few the majority become food
resource for other species
each year thousands of Olive Ridley sea
turtles travel across the vast oceans to
arrive simultaneously on the Orissa
coast Hamas nesting
contemporaries of the dinosaurs sea
turtles have descended from land turtles
the one stumpy legs evolved into
flattened flippers perfect for life in
the oceans
agile and graceful in water they make
slow clumsy progress on land
each female lays about hundred to 200
eggs with the instinctive knowledge that
only a few of our eggs will actually
survive
the first onslaught begins with the high
tides that expose and scatter that
carefully hidden eggs
these become vital food resource for
many life forms on the coast this
coincides to the breeding period of the
crows and other shorebirds this is
Nature's Way of providing much-needed
protein to the birds while keeping the
turtle population under check this
interdependence between and among
species is the most crucial survival
strategy among all life-forms across
diverse ecosystems on earth
even in the hostile terrain of the
desert interdependence permits survival
the camel has adapted to the harsh
conditions of the desert for millions of
years the camels droppings and show the
survival of one of the hardest beetles
of the desert beetles are the hardiest
most prolific creatures on earth
one in every five life forms on our
planet is a beetle often overlooked
these small defenseless looking
creatures have millions of years of
evolutionary experience
to survive and thrive nearly anywhere on
earth the specially adapted dung beetle
is ingenious it specializes in
collecting camels down using its hind
legs it rolls down the dung tenaciously
hanging on the ball of dung maybe
several times a size yet the beetle is
undeterred rolling that dung downhill is
no problem but getting it into its hole
safely requires greater skill dexterity
and sometimes aggression this precious
ball of dung will ensure moisture warmth
and a steady supply of healthy food for
the beetles eggs when they hatch without
camels the dung beetle would have no
chance of survival another survival
strategy is developing partnership
between species a symbiotic relationship
that ensures survival for boards
coral reefs are the cauldrons of life
out here there is intensive competition
for food and space
[Music]
to survive many reef dwellers have
developed symbiotic relationships
survival is not just about aggressive
competition it is also equally dependent
on intense cooperation animal fish and
sea animals have evolved a symbiotic
relationship they share living quarters
without any animosity
[Music]
the flowers of the sea sea animals
resemble plants but are actually
meat-eating predators they have the most
poisonous tentacles capable of
paralyzing prey for intruders
within seconds animal fish are immune to
the sting of the tentacles in fact
animal fish and their babies find refuge
among the sea animals poisonous
tentacles retreating into their safety
whenever threatened
in return for this favor the fish
protects the honeymoon from its natural
predators of the sea and also removes
decaying morsels and debris from within
the tentacles
[Music]
[Music]
interaction and dependence between and
within species is among the most
powerful evolutionary forces on earth
even the most feared and powerful
predators are willing to share their
food or something in return
sharks are the supreme predators of the
ocean
small and gentle sucker fish and pilot
fish are often seen traveling along with
a shark some firmly attached to the
shark's body with their powerful seconds
these schools of scavenging fish feed on
the small amounts of food scraps
released at the shark feeds yet the
shark does not harm them these fish
remove parasites from the shark skin the
shark benefit from the cleaning service
and the scavenging fish is rewarded with
a meal
the Sharks presence also keep other
predators away from these tiny fish in
the deep oceans or on land of fragile
strand binds all living things in a
unique partnership
[Music]
in spite of diverse ecosystems third is
a unified pulsating living system in
which all beings are connected together
over millions of years species have
evolved as allies adversaries and
enemies developing strategies to adapt
survive and reproduce a delicate fragile
web binds all living things together if
even one species is lost a link is
fractured and this web of life begins to
unravel
[Music]
of all the species that have ever
existed on earth 99% are now extinct
asteroids volcanoes ice ages and other
natural events have continuously altered
and transformed life on our planet
scientists believe that among these mass
extinctions there were five so
devastating that most life on Earth was
wiped out mass extinctions can last for
millennia dirt freezes over and ice ages
lasts for thousands of years with each
Ice Age the nature of life on our planet
is forever changed 65 million years ago
a meteorite struck the earth
earth wasn't shrouded in a curtain of
smoke and dust for thousands of years
this changed the Earth's climate
drastically many species including the
dinosaurs became extinct after this
great extinction mammals began to
dominate the planet humans are new in
the evolutionary race modern Homo
sapiens appeared just over a hundred
thousand years ago yet we now dominate
every part of the planet in a short span
of time we have become the top predators
our intelligence sets us apart from all
other species unlike other species
humans can influence the course of
evolution and determine what genes and
traits are passed on to their progeny in
the near future we may even be able to
alter the genes of a developing fetus
and create life by design
we are the only species that can adapt
at will to changing conditions and
environment yet man has chosen to change
the world to meet his insatiable needs
in the mindless race for progress man is
creating a new world transforming the
whole planet as he plunders it
we have ravaged our forests polluted our
water systems poisoned our air altered
our environment impacting climate and
pushing thousands of species to the
brink of extinction and beyond
almost 300 species are disappearing each
day mankind may have triggered the next
mass extinction a planet has never
before witnessed an extinction of this
speed and magnitude
the tiger is the apex of the food chain
and today it is critically endangered
the presence of the tiger is the
indicator of the health of an intact
ecosystem and the delicate balance of
the dynamic web of life that binds us
all together destruction of habitat loss
of prey species and relentless poaching
has pushed the tiger to the brink
while intensive efforts are on to
protect it from extinction it is
important for us to understand the tiger
can survive only if it's fractured
ecosystem is revitalized
every species and life-form has been
designed with a specific purpose and
plays a crucial role in maintaining a
healthy and vibrant ecosystem
even the tiny bee is as important as the
tiger and vital for the survival of all
other life-forms on earth including man
if the bee and other pollinators
disappear a tiger will vanish within a
year man will disappear in three years
and all other life on Earth will soon
follow life on Earth as we know it today
will cease to exist
the entire web of life will unravel and
mankind will have been responsible never
before as just one species been
responsible for the destruction of so
many others according to scientists
within the next 30 years one-fifth of
all living species could go extinct
species that have evolved over millions
of years will vanish in a few decades a
global tragedy is unfolding right before
our eyes and this is the world our
children and their children will inherit
for millions of years life has ebbed and
flowed on our fragile planet
but in a haste we have forgotten that we
are not the supreme commanders of the
earth but only a strand in the delicate
web of life
our own survival and evolution depends
on learning to share this planet with
other creatures that have been here
millions of years before us
maybe another mass extinction is not
inevitable
if mankind is the cause it can also be
the solution we also have within us the
ability to protect and conserve and
learn from our mistakes and once again
learn to live in harmony with nature

the future of this fragile planet our
home is in our hands

hello know why warm welcome to the
brand-new edition of policy watch i'm
Krita mishra today we'll take a closer
look at the draft ecommerce policy the
draft policy has been divided into six
categories DITA infrastructure
development ecommerce marketplaces
regulatory issues stimulating the
domestic digital economy and export
promotion through e-commerce the policy
seeks to identify the paths to achieve
the objectives through a multi-pronged
approach theme of the policy is to
enable stakeholders to fully benefit
from the progressive digitization of the
economy and for more on this I'm joined
by dr. Jen Dasgupta former ambassador to
WTO dr. SP Sharma chief economist ph.d
chamber and dr. HP Kumar former CMD NS I
see mr. Das Gupta let me come to you
first a well defined policy is required
for providing the level playing field
and also facilitating global trade
negotiations for instance at the WTO
take us through the importance and the
crucial highlights of the draft
ecommerce policy the first thing which
we need to bear in mind is that
ecommerce has been evolving very fast
over the past decade or so and most
jurisdictions are still not very
familiar or conversant with the
developments that have taken place
globally and the direction in which
things are moving and the pace of the
developments so it is important to have
a set of policy guidelines which will
enable our domestic stakeholders our
industry the MSMEs the larger players
all to benefit from a policy framework
and one of the things which also needs
to be borne in mind is that the customer
the consumer also has to be enabled to
reap benefits from this framework so the
draft ecommerce policy has tried to
address all these issues through its six
facets and it has put together a package
which has been developed through
intensive consultations with
stakeholders across the industry from
consumer protection organizations from
different ministries of the government
and it has also taken a cue from the
developers that have taken place
elsewhere in the world in the advanced
economies for instance things have
stabilized to a certain extent but
they're also things are evolving so it
is a mixture of experiences which have
been gathered from different countries
different kind of frameworks and our own
concerns and the bottom line is that we
need to provide a level playing field
for domestic industry for domestic
consumers and that there should not be
any exploitation there should be
transparency in all the dealings of the
e marketplace absolutely so there should
be no exploitation and there has to be
transparency but awesome status Gupta
the Indian market place or e-commerce
space was pegged at around thirty eight
point five billion dollars in 2017 which
is expected to touch two hundred billion
dollars by the year 2026
despite this high growth rate it is
still at a very nascent stage accounting
for all around three percent of the
retail sector how is this policy
structure the entire ecommerce space one
of the things which I wanted to point
out in this context is that if you look
at the global population above 14 which
is 5.5 billion 50% of this population
has access to smartphones and it is
going to go up very rapidly over the
next decade or so
so ecommerce it may start from rather
humble beginnings but it is going to
that is a projection made by many
economists it is going to be a very
posed a very serious challenge to the
brick and mortar stores to the
retailers who do actual physical
deliveries across the counter so
ecommerce is something which perhaps
will you know be the future in in many
ways in developing countries of course
it has already started posing a threat
to brick-and-mortar stores in the
developed world so that is why it is
important for the government to come out
with a policy and to try to fill up the
regulatory space have a regulator for
instance the e-commerce policy talks of
a data regulating Authority before we
get into agreements at the WTO or other
fora on various aspects of regulation if
we have our own regulation in place it
always helps us to negotiate rather than
doing it in a policy vacuum and being
guided by the developed countries or
those who have already put in place a
regulatory framework that then makes us
feel handicapped absolutely so it is
important to have a regulatory framework
and also to implement it in a very
effective manner
coming to you dr. Kumar de data is the
new oil that is what this policy
accentuates how will this policy ensure
that the data generated in India is used
for the progress of its citizens see
that is the main objective of this
policy one of the main objectives of
course that presently all these foreign
companies which are operating in India
we have no control over the information
or the data being you know generated by
them through various ecommerce platforms
whether it is you know purchase and sale
of products or payment systems or others
so one major objective of course which
is very important of course the policy
clearly lays down that data generated in
India will remain in India first of all
data generated outside which is you know
which is used in India may be
communicated and
shared with other with other so it's a
clear you know clarity which was not
there earlier but besides the data data
of course becomes a very valuable thing
as you rightly say data becomes a new
oil because it has a value it has
because all these future developments
which are going to take place with the
digital India you know virtually
expanding data will become a very
valuable resource particularly with
artificial intelligence based you know
enterprises coming up whether it is in
large industries or micro small
enterprises everybody would like to you
know structure their products around the
data
so naturally data is a very valuable
resource but besides the data sharing
issue see data protection also becomes
very important and the clarity about the
rules and laws about data protection and
all and coupled with data protection is
the privacy laws which are you know
needing some refurbishment absolutely so
I would say that as a as a policy we are
I think on track because there was no
clarity earlier even other countries
also have been you know on the verge of
bringing out these these similar
policies particularly India Brazil South
Africa that if Sephora I was part of
that ecommerce framework so all the
countries are interested in fact to
protect their data and India being the
largest you know generator of data so we
have to be really very you know
proactive in doing that but besides the
data there are other policy issues which
have come up in this craft policy and
which are really welcomed absolutely as
mrs. Gupta rightly mentioned that the
competitiveness of small Khurana and
moment shop traders and micro
enterprises you know more than 90
percent of the countries enterprises
into business enterprises are in the
informal sector so
they need some kind of a policy
framework which really can protect them
from the large you know companies which
are coming from various countries and
spending a lot of money their financial
muscle is so large that it really
overtakes all the wherewithal so of
these small and micro enterprises so
actually they need some kind of a policy
which can really protect them so that is
another area where I feel that the
policy is good and is welcomed by the
small traders micro enterprises and
those informal enterprises which are
spread all corners of the country so I
would really welcome the policy and some
more clarity may be needed of course
because various people are giving
different suggestions which are being
collated and particularly inventory
based model what is going to happen some
suggestions have been given but then
that is not enough we need some more
improvements in that model so I think as
the time goes we will surely come up
with more suggestions so that the policy
can be very fine
but as of now the policy seems to be
quite acceptable so policy is acceptable
and I'll take your concern to dr. Sharma
Petra Sharma dr. Kumar has pointed out
on one hand there has to be protection
of the moment pop stores on the other
hand has argument about providing level
playing field where do we find the right
balance I believe after the lemon crisis
this is the most significant development
in the global economic system that
advent of e-commerce know globally
market sizes more than 33 trillion
dollar and as you mentioned that we are
at around 38 39 40 billion dollars and
anticipation is that we will become two
hundred billion dollar economy
e-commerce economy by 2026 that is true
that we are the green market and we have
the largest consumer base in the world
ecosystem the youngest population so at
this juncture is become very crucial to
to protect our walls environment firstly
and to provide a level playing field for
the for the domestic players because
there should not be any first mover
advantage firstly the
of certain parameters like sometimes
some business conglomerates they have
access to the data and they have a few
strengths that's why they capture the
market some times and the second mover
advantage is totally totally demoralized
or or undermined so at this Center the
policy of Government of India the
e-commerce draft policy is very very
crucial to implement that and to end to
move and to give a shape to the economy
because this is the emerging area this
this area is providing a major growth
momentum to the economy because this is
not only the e-commerce that will
provide the growth momentum this is the
overall development of the economy
through e-commerce we have to generate
our digital India also digitalization
should also be boosted up with the
e-commerce policy Bay and the
distillation is also in complementarity
with the e-commerce because side by side
we have one on so many reforms starting
from make in India digital India all
these reforms are very complementary
between the e-commerce and the growing
economic sites so at this juncture this
becomes very very important that we
should provide firstly the level playing
field to our domestic players this
should not be undermined because of the
certain stance like detoxes and other
parameters so Government of India has
very rightly provided that there are
norms and regulations for each and every
player in the market because India is a
growing market firstly we have to
develop our infrastructure in the
e-commerce and second we have to provide
the data protection which is very very
important as mentioned by dr. Kumar and
dr. thus that data data data are our
national asset actually because because
we have here we have a largest consumer
base and we have lot of data and with a
lot of developments in our economy we
are a dynamic economy or here we were
slow then steady and fast now we have
the fastest moving economy in the world
economic system and projections are that
that we will shortly in the next few
years we are going to touch the
double-digit growth rate so at this
juncture our consumer base gender or
demand is increasing each and every day
and and the size of t Commerce is also
increasing thirty eight billion dollar
is is a significant increase during the
last few years and
a few years ago we were only twenty
billion dollar so if the size of the
economy and size of the e-commerce
market is increasing very significantly
then there must be some reforms and must
be some regulatory environment worthy
for the domestic as well as for the
foreign players so I don't see any any
protectionism in this policy this is
only for the level playing field for the
domestic players that the the foreign
players and the domestic players should
also be at an equal platform to perform
in the market you talked about
protectionism now certain industry
voices have called this craft
excessively protectionist in nature now
talking about China protectionism helped
China build its tech economy in a giant
manner many argue that why can't India
also follow that path and why can't
India also adopt that strategy because
we are different from China China's
market and India's market are to keep
different from each other do the size of
the economy and the economic growth
rates are similar but the but the
economic behavior and the economic
policies are totally different so we
cannot adopt the policies adopted by
China because China is different model
of growth day earlier they were focusing
on the external policy export policy now
there they are tilting towards the
production ISM and to boost up their
domestic economy because they are not
finding any place in the global
marketplace because of the increased
protectionism by the advanced economies
so at this juncture I believe our policy
environment should not be tilted towards
the thought process of the China's
policymakers because we are different
and we are growing and that growth
projections are now higher than China
now we are the fastest Marconi we should
have our own momentum and of old thought
percent and own policies so I believe
the government of India has very rightly
focused on this policy at this juncture
and the policy framework is very good
and in line with the expectation of the
industry absolutely so the policy is in
line with the expectations of the
industry and also the fact that we have
our own economic trajectory and also our
policies but talking about data
protection now dr. Dasgupta at this
juncture we do not have any legal
framework that would impose restrictions
on cross-border flow
data how do we ensure data privacy and
protection I think the data protection
bill of course is under consideration
and the Supreme Court has also given
guidelines so to say in how we should go
about it and it should it's just a
matter of time before we have the Data
Protection bill converted into an act
and there would be other acts and
regulations required to fill up the
regulatory vacuum in the e-commerce
space so data protection the the data of
a private citizen is something which on
which the Honorable Supreme Court has
said very clearly that the citizen must
have control over that data so there are
different kinds of data for instance the
data which is generated by banking
institutions and insurance institutions
for appraising the credit score there
are data which you know are in the
public space for instance data at a
traffic junction and then there is data
about consumer preferences which is
collected from a market places social
web networking sites etc now that data
can be utilized in a very useful manner
to predict consumer preferences to
tailor the particular product or a range
of services to cater to a particular
individual and that information if for
instance I am a producer and I know that
this is the kind of a watch which is
being preferred and which will probably
sell very then I will use my
manufacturing facility or my vendors to
provide that kind of a model and I will
have that advantage now with these very
large corporations coming into the
picture
the smaller people as dr. Sharma
mentioned the first mover has tremendous
advantages and because of you know near
monopoly conditions existing in other
markets some markets abroad
there has been distortions in the market
market prevention of market distortion
when protection of consumers is one of
the underlying themes running through
the e-commerce policy and that can only
happen when we you know put in place a
net framework where data generated from
e-commerce platforms let's say social
networking sites this is available this
is owned by the government and anybody
can access that data so it is neutral to
who has collected that data it could be
a very large corporation which collects
that data and keeps it to itself and
then sells it now it has been generated
from the marketplace the citizens are
the owners of that and the government is
the trustee and retains that whole over
the data that is the underlying
philosophy of this ecommerce policy
about data protection I'll take that too
dr. Kumar Dao sir mentioned about
Distortion
how does the government create a
regulatory environment where there's
genuine competition in the market
specifically in the e-commerce space
well that is a very important issue in
fact bringing in regulation and an
ecosystem which really encourages the
competition and removes the
anti-competitive practices it should be
the hallmark of any policy and we in
India would look at what in fact the
policy should address what policy should
address the consumers interest on the
one side it should address the you know
markets interest the industry's
interests the traders interests on the
other and also protect the data as well
as our country's interest vis-a-vis the
foreign players who are working in India
so if the policy takes care of all these
three issues I think the policy should
be good enough in fact to be implemented
now if we compare the policy if we
really evaluate the policy draft draft
of the policy which is in domain I find
substantially it addresses the issue
there is a there is a talk of setting up
a Consumer Protection Authority that's
right I think that should be a very
welcome step because as of now the
consumers under the e market system are
you no not at all protected at all I
would say absolutely it is only
one-sided second thing the
competitiveness of amongst various
players whether it is foreign players or
Indian players the healthy
competitiveness really has to take shape
because still it is not there although
these foreign companies who are
indulging in anti-competitive practices
are bleeding they're losing money but
still in order to capture the market in
order to defeat the smaller player
players they are indulging in those I
would say I mean as I see it
anti-competitive practices so naturally
the provision in the policy draft policy
to bring in regulation to bring healthy
competition in the whole sector is a
welcomed measure and we should really
welcome it I'll get industry perspective
on that dr. Sharma the draft sees that
consumer protection is of utmost
importance how do we ensure that there's
effective grievance redressal mechanism
for the consumers yes that is very very
important because this is one of the
objectives of the new e-commerce policy
draft e-commerce policy because now
consumers are the backbone of the Indian
economy because because of the consumer
development we cannot grow in the higher
and higher trajectory that is the base
of our economy and similarly data are
the national asset and these data are
for the development of the Indian
economy so at this juncture this becomes
very crucial that how to protect the
consumerism and consumer protection is
becomes important now the regulation
provided is that that that there are lot
of developments from this sometimes they
provide the disconnects and they
sometimes they provide the heavy
discounts and there are some bulk buyers
also in the market that they capture the
whole market and they provide the
benefits to the
rumors one-by-one and in a very
strategic manner so at this juncture
sometimes the sometimes consumers are
not aware about the developments in the
marketplace and there must be some
regulatory to check this all the
developments so this policy pervades all
the checks and balances to protect the
consumer and to how to howto complained
about the if something is happening
wrong in the market then they have every
right to inform the regulatory
environment that this is happened and
they should be addressed to the for the
for the benefit of the consumer so I
believe this pulse is very rightly
focusing on all the parameters starting
from the development of the economy data
protection and the consumer consumer
protection and for the overall
development of the economy and to create
employment opportunities because level
playing field we are talking about the
level playing field because because of
level playing field our economy or our
industries impacted earlier you were
sending so many free trade agreements
butter but our ease of doing business
work was not in our favor we were at
around one hundred and fifty six or
hundred and sixteen days of doing
business and all the free trade partners
were in in the in the ambit of 50 they
were very good in these of doing
business and they were trading with us
and the advantage was in favor of the
other trading partners now with the
increase in the ease of doing business
now we are at 77 we have improved a lot
during the last four or five years now
the level playing field is becoming
important and becoming visible at the
mark at our domestic level so now the
services sector like the e-commerce we
are so we are opening up market for the
e-commerce and ER and the other
liberalized financial financial era but
at this juncture we should also improve
our domestic environment in deregulatory
terms so that is the need of the over
and government has very rightly focused
on this and they have implemented and
drafted this policy so there are all
checks and balances for protecting the
consumer I have lost one minute dr.
Dasgupta what are the
anti-counterfeiting measures in this
policy and how could this poll
promote exports from India as far as
I'll take up the second question first
the MSM ease and the smaller
manufacturers and exporters they find it
a difficult problem to you know when
their way through the the regulatory
maze different forms have to be filled
in money has to be deposited so there
are things which the government has
talked about and that is about providing
an interface electronic interface so you
can press a few buttons and deposit
money for instance get bank realization
certificates you know to government
agency for the dispersal of duty
drawback for instance so this is part of
the Export Promotion measures for
e-commerce the other aspect is about
anti counterfeiting I think this has
already found a place in a very
prominent place in the policy and it
says that anybody who sells on an
e-commerce platform will have to get
will have to ensure first that ecommerce
platform will be responsible for any
counterfeit items getting sold on its
e-commerce platform the second thing is
it must have guarantees from its sellers
or vendors that they will not be selling
counterfeit or pirated products on the
platform so that and there are checks
and balances even in the in press note 2
which talks about retail right of FDI
FDI there the compliance has been sought
through an audit and the report will
have to be submitted to the RBI every
year so there are things which are in
the able on the evolutionary path and I
think this is a very very welcome step
because counterfeit items were getting
finding their way into the e-commerce
platforms so this is a very welcome step
and I think the direction policy
direction is the right one and of course
the regulatory vacuum will have to be
filled in through acts through
regulations rules etcetera
absolutely so it's a welcome step and
this policy will further ensure ease of
doing business in India on that note
thank you so much for joining us so the
draft policy takes forward the digital
India initiative and puts in place",True,en,33,0,0

India has the largest child population
in the world each of these 400 million
children represent the future but for
many the odds are stacked against them
four percent of India's children never
start school 58% don't complete primary
schools and 90% don't complete school at
all only ten percent of India's children
go on to higher education in colleges
and universities these statistics are
especially decimal in the information
age can the tools of technology help
India's children reach for their dreams
let's find out
[Music]
since independence India has moved
steadily towards progress seven decades
later it stands on the cusp between
developing nation and the developed one
[Music]
for India to push through its barriers
it will have to empower its people one
of the biggest tools of empowerment is
education
however the dream of achieving 100%
literacy and quality education for all
is still a distant one India especially
in its villages and remote areas lacks
adequate infrastructure and trained
teachers there is some good news in the
last 10 years school enrollment has gone
up by almost 14 percent more children
are going to school the question now is
with limited education resources how can
they receive quality education the
answer comes through information and
communication technology or ICT today
the Internet is the largest source of
information in the world the most
empowering feature of the world wide web
is access
at the click of a button we can use
computers to find answers to just about
all our inquiries it begs the question
can some of our most underserved
children have the same access to
knowledge this is the village school in
Harrow Holly in Karnataka but it's not
what you'd picture when you hear the
word school instead of a teacher at the
head of the class there is a screen
instead of learning from a blackboard
children are watching lessons beamed
into their classroom from Bangalore City
more than 40 kilometres away welcome to
the world of distance learning as the
name implies distance learning uses
technology to spread quality education
across vast distances there was a time
when distance learning tools like radio
and television we used to teach lessons
in areas that lacked proper schools or
teachers but today things are very
different
[Music]
this is the virtual classroom the
teachers lesson is recorded on video
cameras in a studio in Bangalore
real-time notes are scribbled on a
touchpad and they replace chalk and
board textbook images are replaced with
animations all these innovations help
difficult and complex concepts come
alive no matter where the student is I
am able to learn much more from the
television programs then I do in the
classroom it is better to view on the TV
than on the board in the class the
experiment using flasks is very clearly
shown on TV and these children aren't
alone there are 2 lakh more who benefit
from lessons taught to them from
Bangalore how does it all happen
what technological marvel lies behind it
all in a word II do Sat September 20th
2004 Shri Hari Kota
the Indian Space Research Organisation
or Israel launched the geosynchronous
satellite launch vehicle or GSLV
[Music]
on board the GSLV was an almost 2,000 kg
satellite swiftly making its way past
the Earth's atmosphere the GSLV
travelled nearly 36,000 kilometers away
from Earth and placed the satellite in
orbit
this satellite was called a Dios at and
it would revolutionize Indian classrooms
EDIUS at had one job to uplink school
and college lessons from teaching in
studios like the one in Bangalore and
transmit them to classroom ends across
20 states of India the teaching end has
tools like computers digital cameras DVD
players and touch pads by which the
lesson is created for uploading the
lesson to the satellite teaching ends
use modems switches and dish Antony a
single uplinked lesson can reach out to
nearly 1,000 students the classroom end
is equipped to receive the lesson with
dish Antony modems web cameras mics
sound systems and personal computers
thanks to the audio set teachers sitting
kilometres away from their students can
share lectures notes and even pictures
as multimedia files within seconds so
the content is multimedia animated
content so that brings in some
joyfulness in the students to learn more
we get the best teachers we get them at
one single place get the content
developed all together work up on a
single content developer content and one
of the best delivery teachers deliver it
from the studio this not only allows
teachers to teach over distance
it also allows children to ask questions
and clear doubts when we listen to the
teacher we can understand about 75% of
it balance 25% we understand through
animated teaching in this way we get
100% the diagrams are drawn on the board
but in this we can see them as colorful
animated pictures and diagrams which is
very helpful
edu sad has transformed the way distance
learning is done in India information
and communication technologies have
beamed in fresh hope for the children of
this country it is providing access to
primary and secondary school education
in even the most underserved regions but
what about those who aspire for higher
studies or professional qualifications
the Indian Institute of Technology is
one of india's top engineering colleges
the hallowed halls of its Mumbai campus
educate some of India's brightest minds
lakhs of students aspire to study at IIT
but less than 10,000 make it for those
who don't
getting taught by the best professors in
the country is a luxury
that's denied but as one IIT professor
realized that needn't be the case this
nation has 371 million Indians who are
younger than 14 years of age 106 million
are younger than 6 years there is no way
you can reach out to all these people if
you keep building the brick and mortar
convention schools and colleges you have
to use whatever you have but you have to
buttress that technology is the only way
to address this scale retaining the
quality
professor Deepak Potter teaches at the
department of computer science and
engineering at IIT Mumbai he takes
regular classrooms not just on campus
but also in recording studios the
professor contributes to an online
education platform driven by the
Internet it provides top quality courses
for any student with access to the world
wide web the platform is inspired by
move or massive open online courses a
concept developed by American
universities like Harvard and MIT the
courses were designed by some of the
best faculty and are available for free
to thousands of students in any part of
the world all they need is an internet
connection and a laptop keeping in mind
the needs of Indian students professor
Bartok took the mooc model one step
further
if team has designed an online learning
platform that blends classroom teaching
with online courses the course includes
video lectures online discussions and
assignments just like it is on MOOC but
the difference here is that students can
back up online learning with classroom
sessions we in fact encourage teachers
in the blended model to actually hold
regular classes except that is love
wasting time in delivering lectures you
spend time in discussing problem
solutions practice problems descriptions
agencies and so on online educational
platforms like these throw open
countless possibilities for furthering
one's knowledge one of India's biggest
development goals is providing the right
education to all students not just in
schools but also young adults seeking
higher education that's where
information and communication technology
or ICT has taken great leaps in the last
decade by the turn of the new millennium
the buzzword in ICT was connectivity
internet connectivity to be precise the
most students were connected through the
virtual world of cyberspace
the more educational resources they
could get from the best universities and
teachers not just in India but the globe
instructional videos and lectures one
hour online across various professional
and research fields for this India
needed a strong internet network that
would not just be fast but also carry
heavy files like those accessed through
YouTube if you really see today's world
the YouTube which sounds like you know
just looking at movies
some kind of entertainment has got a
plethora of information on health on
various of their engineering subjects
you just click on YouTube and you get a
beautiful high-definition picture
for about two let's say five minutes
within five minutes is enriches your
knowledge to how to use that particular
stuff and more importantly if you go to
medical colleges you will see that the
YouTube is heavily used why because
there are a number of operations a
real-time operations surgical stuff that
is kept there with a high definition
high resolution so when you look at that
if you have a small network you will not
be able to download that particular
video file whereas if you have a huge
bandwidth you will be able to
immediately look at it after the break
we take a look at one of India's most
innovative networks that's connecting
universities like never before
[Music]
in 2009 India launched the national
knowledge network or nkm to provide
high-speed connectivity the n gain is a
state-of-the-art fiber-optic network
that offers high-speed connectivity and
an ultra high bandwidth to handle large
volumes of online data that includes
text audio and video this national
knowledge network was basically created
to cater to the demands of governance
demands of higher education and
basically the demands of scientific
community now we have a national
knowledge Network which has multi
gigabit its span India it goes up to the
districts every state is covered except
for you know islands like on the mana
cover and luxury we are trying to find
out mechanism by which we can bring them
together otherwise if you see all the
terrestrial places everyone is connected
and that's connected with the scalable
network today the nkn connects over
1,400 educational Science and Technology
institutes with the numbers set to
increase a common network backbone is
there so this backbone now can be used
by all the communities and these are
major communities so when you talk about
Institute's you take about all IITs talk
about all NIT s talk about all Iams all
central university state universities
agricultural universities so you got a
mix of all kinds of people so the
collaboration which is the key for
success in science that's possible today
so just how powerful is the backbone of
MGM's connectivity let's compare it to
an average home user of the Internet who
gets about 40 megabits per second or
just about 0.005 gigabit per second
at its core the engine has a speed in
multiples of 10 Gbps or gigabits per
second which means that as it fans out
across India's Institutes students get
speeds of at least one gigabit per
second today if you see the connectivity
is taken for granted so with the result
if you go and talk to any professor in a
central university or IIT he knows
connectivity is there and the
connectivity is scaleable so we started
with for instance one gigabit for IIT
Kharagpur or certain other IITs and
today all of them have crossed more than
1.5 in fact one of them as cross 2.5 so
we are just Kaling it up to 10 gigs with
such incredible speed and bandwidth that
can handle mass amounts of data the
endgame also connects all its institutes
to heed your fat global knowledge
networks like the grid at CERN in Geneva
virtual labs where Indian students can
access and remotely operate machines
across the world special online services
like digital libraries and of course the
Enghien
ties it in with the World Wide Web all
through a high-speed seamless network
the engine has control centers across
India that are on duty 24/7 a typical
control center monitors the network and
makes sure everything is running
smoothly the control center also keeps a
lookout for any glitches and it
troubleshoots
as soon as it shows up on screen this
task force is especially critical in
today's day and age when cyber security
is an ever increasing concern
it's not like you know 30 years 20 years
back when an when a small ant even a
small virus breaks down and let's say or
comes up in us it takes about 24 to 30
hours to come to India that was the time
about 25 years today if something
happens there within few second it
happens here so you can see the impact
of the network very fast because all are
very well connected so we have to be
extremely agile to recognize that
particular stuff and that is why we
created this control center we have a
sock so that they can continuously
monitor any kind of abnormalities and
take the calls from users help them out
in their issues the result today Indian
students can safely and securely
participate in big science like never
before
students from Jammu and Kashmir Punjab
and Ranchi can contribute to
cutting-edge particle physics at the LHC
material scientists can run experiments
in labs across the world all while
sitting in India researchers can join
the quest to decode Chandra ins findings
while budding engineers from different
campuses of IIT can brainstorm over
complex concepts the revolutionary
thinking going beyond the 2 megabits per
second or 10 megabits per second has
been achieved by an gain at a cost which
is much much economical for the for the
government really offered and an gain in
the world is one of the biggest research
education required in the whole world
ICT has brought about a sea change in
how we perceive a school a college or
university
it has provided access like never before
but for education to truly empower it
must be about more than just access it
must be about high quality so how is ICT
ensuring high standards of education for
our children join us after the break to
know
[Music]
classrooms like these represent the
future of India not just because these
children will be the citizens of
tomorrow but because they hold in their
hands the tools of Education in the
future these tablet devices are powered
by touchscreen technology they are so
simple to use that even small children
are those unfamiliar with computers can
interface with them with just a light
pressure
we now have information literally at our
fingertips most touchscreens have a
flexible upper layer which is a good
conductor of electricity just below it
is an insulating layer that acts as a
spacer then there is a layer of
conducting glass when we press the
screen the two conducting layers are
connected completing a circuit that
sends electric impulses to the computer
this simple idea is the cornerstone to
interactive teaching lessons and then
perhaps it is interesting because we
know how to operate it we can learn from
it it is different from lessons with
teacher teaches in a classroom of 60
children or 40 children the teacher does
not know every child's level so the role
that we see technology playing is being
able to collect that data so when every
child moves to a technology station and
is doing a test or is doing a video
there's some amount of data on how they
have learned that we can capture and
help guide that process of you know
differentiated learning and
differentiated instructions
technology tools aren't just helping the
children they are enhancing teacher
training too when it comes to education
there may be no replacement for the
classroom or teachers but the
traditional ways are slowly transforming
with ICD as the ideal teaching aid India
can look forward to empowering its next
generation with the most important tool

hello and welcome to in-depth
Antonacci India has a very large land
border covering around 15,000 106
kilometers the country shares its
borders with seven countries Bangladesh
China Pakistan Nepal Myanmar and poo
town as well as a small portion with
Afghanistan very terrain
climatic conditions and hostile
neighbors make our borders complex and
border management an important aspect of
our security effective border management
calls for proper planning and measures
that secure our frontiers and also
safeguard us from the risks involved in
the movement of goods and people from
India to other countries and vice-versa
smart border management with
technological solutions is one step
towards improving border security in
September last year Home Minister
Rajnath Singh launched two smart fencing
pilot projects of five kilometers each
along the India Pakistan international
border in German on the 5th of March
this year the Home Minister inaugurated
the electronic surveillance project
along the Indo Bangladesh border asam's
debris district shares border with
bangladesh comprising mainly of the
Brahmaputra River and a little portion
in the godard her River which makes it
the longest riverine border in the
country so how will electronic
surveillance help the BSF in guarding
our borders and how effective will the
system prove to be towards effective
border management we are alive today in
depth
Oh Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an
electronic surveillance project in
debris district of Assam along the India
Bangladesh border the project is called
bold quit border electronically
dominated quick response team
interception technique under the
comprehensive integrated water
management system under this project a
wide range of electronic gadgets have
been installed along the indo-bangla
border in the doobly district of a cell
now this 61 km/h is highly porous and
riverine and that's why guarding it is a
daunting task
therefore to check illegal immigration
smuggling of arms ammunition drugs and
cattle the riverine border has been put
under round-the-clock surveillance
underwater and underground sonar sensors
have been installed along the riverine
border in debris to detect any legal
cross-border activities according to the
Ministry of Home Affairs with the
enabling of electronic surveillance in
the unfair aeverine badr area of debris
now the entire span of the Brahmaputra
has been covered with the data network
generated by microwave communication ofc
cables DMR communication day and night
surveillance cameras and intrusion
detection system these modern gadgets
installed under the bold quit project
will provide feeds to the BSF control
rooms along the border and enable the
paramilitary forces Quick Reaction teams
to throw out any possibility of illegal
border crossing and crimes single-tier

yelling idea the BSF is responsible for
safeguarding the 4096 kilometer long
international border with Bangladesh the
decision to employ a technological
solution besides the physical presence
of BSF personnel at the border was taken
by the Home Ministry in 2017 in January
2018 the information and technology wing
of the BSF undertook project bold quit
and completed it in record time with the
technical support of various
manufacturers and suppliers the project
will not only help the BSF curb all
types of cross-border crimes but also
provide respite to the troops from
round-the-clock human surveillance

on the Bangladesh border because there
is really no military threat per se
infiltration still continued because it
is despite the fact that we have these
border posts of the BSF and the fence
there are many gaps in that area and the
gaps are there because of the nature of
the terrain there are sandbars there are
charged in the monsoons the whole area
gets flooded so now to prevent that they
went on to something called eserver and
this was the project which had been
started but the BSF a few years ago
India shares vast porous borders with
its several neighbors including Pakistan
and Bangladesh battalions of the
border security force and other security
agencies guard the international borders
round-the-clock but several stretches
become difficult to guard following
inhospitable terrain or riverine borders
in this report we take a look at the
comprehensive integrated water
management system and the need to
introduce this modern surveillance
system for our borders project bold qit
or border electronically dominated QRT
interception technique under the
comprehensive integrated border
management system or CI BMS will enable
the BSF to equip the indo-bangla border
in the unfenced riverine area of the
Brahmaputra and its tributaries with
various kind of sensors to check illegal
immigration and smuggling of arms
ammunition drugs and cattle along the
porous borders of India the government
in 2017 decided to go for a
technological solution to aid the BS of
guards manning these borders in January
2018 the information and technology wing
of the BSF started the board qit project
and was completed in record time with
technical support from various agencies
with this the entire span of the
Brahmaputra will now be covered with the
data network generated by microwave
communication ofc cables DMR
communication day and night surveillance
cameras an intrusion detection system
these gadgets will provide feeds to the
BSF control rooms along the border and
will enable the paramilitary forces
Quick Reaction teams to prevent any
possibility of illegal border crossing
and crimes the vault is called the
border electronically dominated you know
bold that's the name they are giving it
for bold bold border electronically
dominated and uit is quick interception
now this quick interception which
they're talking about it enables these
people on the border force then any more
battle detective from thee from this
particular base of this we are carrying
out this electronic surveillance they
know something has happened and we can
move these
beam's quickly to that area and
intercept them which is not possible
India what it really means is that we
have got a series of electronic gadgets
right the we are looking at rally in new
ways we are looking at sound waves we
are also looking at optical fiber cable
for communications light waves anything
which can detect in the presence of
human beings and there are multiple
moves up from off of multiple modes of
actually detecting human beings because
of one system doesn't work and another
system didn't work so it could be based
on sound it could be based on light it
could be based on various other various
other electronic means see IBM s is an
integration of a number of new gadgets
and technologies to ensure electronic
surveillance of India's international
borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh it
is designed to guard stretches where
physical surveillance is not possible
either due to inhospitable terrain or
riverine borders the purpose of the CI
BMS is to eventually replace manual
surveillance of the international
borders by electronic surveillance and
organizing the BSF personnel into Quick
Reaction teams to enhance their
detection and interception capabilities
the use of high-tech solutions for
border security was being considered by
the Ministry of Home Affairs since 2012
in 2014 the BSF also submitted a
detailed report on CI BMS to the
Ministry of Home Affairs but a decision
to implement the system was taken in
January 2016 after the attack on the
Pathankot airbase but when the
Bangladesh border because there is
really no military threat per se
infiltration still continued because it
is despite the fact that we have these
border posts of the BSF and the fence
there are many gaps in that area and the
gaps are there because of the nature of
the terrain there are sandbars there are
charged in the monsoons the whole area
gets flooded so now to prevent that they
went onto something called a
surveillance this was a project which
had been started by the BSF of you
years ago it got conceptualized and now
I think what we are doing now is in the
final phase of this surveillance among
major components of CI BMS is the
virtual fence that enable human less
real-time invitation of borders these
include infrared based and laser based
intrusion alarm systems that can create
an always-on invisible fence thermal
imagers for detection of camouflage
breaches aerial surveillance using
aerostats sonar systems for guarding
riverine edges and ground sensors to
pick up real-time data through tunnels
or underground the CI BMS enables
round-the-clock surveillance on border
and other different weather conditions
be it in dust or fog or rain command and
control centers which is the second
major component of CI BMS we'll keep
receiving all these data at nearest
proximity through fiber optics in
real-time and take action as and when
necessary an important component of the
CI BMS is the use of satellite imagery
which helps security forces to find out
details of the terrain across the border
it also helps in planning operations and
also in infrastructure development
another component is power management to
keep CI BMS running while CI BMS is
touted as a more robust and integrated
system that is capable of addressing the
gaps in the present system of border
security by seamlessly integrating human
resources weapons and high-tech
surveillance equipment several
challenges lie ahead for this
sophisticated surveillance system in in
the air india shares a vast border of
over 7,000 kilometres with Pakistan in
Bangladesh and the operation and
maintenance of sophisticated border
surveillance equipments remain a problem
at present many of the high-tech
surveillance devices deployed by the BSF
are not optimally utilized because the
required technical expertise is not
uniformly available among the forces
personnel the high cost of the
electronic devices and the lack of easy
availability of spare parts act as a
deterrent against their use the lack of
technical expertise
erotic power supply and adverse climatic
and tarrant conditions in the border
areas could also potentially undermine
the functioning of such a sophisticated
system modern technical solutions have
become imperative to complement the
traditional methods of water guarding
against infiltration and trans-border
crimes and a judicious mix of properly
trained manpower and affordable and
tested technology is likely to yield
better results Bureau report
Roger Saba TV due to the India
Bangladesh border being highly porous a
large number of illegal immigrants have
entered India over the years the influx
is mainly in the adjoining states inside
the Indian Territory leading to serious
burdens on state resources
infrastructure and contributing to vast
changes in the demographics of these
states besides there are various other
challenges which India faces relating to
its security and that's why these border
areas require a strong surveillance
system
borders dividing India from Bangladesh
and Pakistan were based on revenue maps
and ethnic differences such demarkation
created a unique set of problems
India has 14,000 818 kilometer long land
border and a coastline of seven thousand
five hundred and sixteen point six
kilometers all states except Mother
Pradesh Chhattisgarh Jharkhand Delhi and
Haryana have an international border or
a coastline 92 out of 640 districts are
water districts in 17 states Indian
waters run through Plains hills
mountains deserts River in territories
and marshes managing such an expansive
border is a complex task challenges
related to border security include
unsettled maritime boundaries lack of
fully democratic lat waters and borders
based on artificial boundaries the India
Bangladesh border is highly porous
illegal movement of people and goods is
a perennial problem the terrain and the
demographic composition make it easy for
illegal migrants to sneak in and get
easily assimilated into the local
populace migration from Bangladesh
specially in Assam an through pure is
driven by the quest for better economic
opportunities many Bangladesh she's also
crossed over to escaped political and
religious persecution the increasing
influence of Islamic fundamentalism in
Bangladesh also resulted in a
large-scale push into India of foot
soldiers of fundamentalism
besides arms trafficking human and
narcotics trafficking smuggling of
cattle counterfeit currency kidnapping
and thefts are quite rampant along the
border on the Bangladesh border it is
different on the Bangladesh border what
we are looking at is smuggling of a
different nature European cats and
smuggling which takes place in a very
large
scale but something which has happened
over the years is illegal migration a
large number of people from Bangladesh
have moved into India and they are in
the millions and that has changed the
demography of some of the northeastern
states including SM and when we are
looking at the conflict which is there
in the Northeast a large part of that
conflict is due to this illegal
immigration which has taken place over
the years and this is why it is the
present government has found it very
very necessary to actually look into the
cause into methods to prevent this
illegal immigration and to at least stop
giving those people the water rights the
BSF is responsible for safeguarding the
4096 kilometer long international border
with bangladesh but at various places it
is not possible to erect water fences
due to geographical barriers
construction of fences was undertaken in
two phases with phase 1 sanctioned in
1987 and phase 2 in 2000 a nine point
three kilometre fence has been erected
between mantra char and Calabar each our
additional border observation post along
the hilly paths have also been built for
emergency evacuation for or deployment
Global Positioning System gadgets nitro
vision binoculars and handheld thermal
image intensifiers
are used by the forces India and
Bangladesh have jointly established a
number of institutional mechanisms these
includes the biannual meeting between
the BSF and the BDR the Home Secretary
level talks and the annual meeting of
the joint boundary working crew along
the border vulnerability mapping and
strengthening of the opiez which are
identified as being prone to illegal
migration or cross-border crimes have
been carried out steps like deploying
observation posts along the
international borders with reverence
sections being patrolled using
watercrafts speed boats floating Bo peas
aerial raki procurement of
state-of-the-art surveillance equipment
including day and
VDS have all been undertaken to act as a
force multipliers use of drones for
surveillance have also been one of the
emerging technological trends in border
security management system the project
bolt kit will put the highly porous
riverine section of the Indo Bangladesh
border in Assam under electronic
surveillance it will cover the India
Bangladesh border in the area which
consists of char or sand islands and
innumerable river channels Bureau report
Raja samhati V India is now set to use
space technology to secure its borders
his role will soon launch a satellite
exclusively for the use of the Ministry
of Home Affairs to help it further
strengthen its frontiers both with
Pakistan and Bangladesh amongst several
other countries invisible yet vital
borders define where one place ends and
another begins
every prosperous nation feels compelled
to defend its border from intrusion even
as they struggle with some practical
challenges well keeping this in mind the
Indian Space Research Organisation will
soon launch a satellite exclusively for
the Home Ministry the satellite will be
used for the purpose of utilizing space
resources for security operational
planning and border management the move
is part of recommendations made by a
Task Force on the use of space
technology which have been accepted by
Home Minister Rajnath Singh the report
has identified the following areas for
the use of space technology like to
strengthen Island Development border
security communication and navigation
and facilitate the development of
infrastructure in border and island
areas the report was finalized after MHA
had a consultation with all stakeholders
including board regarding forces its raw
National Security Council Secretariat
and Minister of Defence
space is a very important platform for
securing India you can from the top from
space you can look down and monitor what
is happening across India on its borders
that is one capability you can also use
India's now ik system use it to target
missiles onto your enemies you can also
use satellites for communication both
the Navy and the Air Force have
dedicated satellites for themselves
now the Ministry of Home Affairs is also
asking for a satellite which will be
dedicated for their own purposes for
securing India's borders to execute the
project in a time-bound manner a short
medium and long term plan has been
proposed for implementation in five
years in close coordination with Israel
and a Modi in short term immediate needs
of board regarding forces would be met
by procurement of high-resolution
imagery and the hiring of bandwidth for
communications in the mid term one
satellite is being used by Astro for the
exclusive use of Ministry of Home
Affairs over the long term MHA will
develop ground segments and network
infrastructure to share satellite
resources by user agencies develop a
central archival facility for storing
various imagery resources and
dissemination of the same to user
agencies we have a special satellite
which can read keep a track on our
borders now that satellite in fact we
have lost a similar satellite earlier
also this satellite has a peculiar real
or characteristic in the sense it can
image even in a cloudy weather you know
because it is a sort of radar satellite
this set it's called so it can keep
track of the border continuously no but
many days together because we have now I
think three reset satellites so it can
keep a continuous check on the borders
and since it is always there because
there are remote sensing satellites
they cannot image if there is a cloud so
this this typical satellite that we have
lost already they can keep track of any
movement any and they're very sensitive
you know they can detect a small car
also passing near the border deployment
of central forces and remote areas will
be also coordinated by satellite
communications
besides the Indian regional navigation
satellite system based GPS will provide
navigation facilities for operational
parties in high altitude remote and
difficult borders and natural areas the
task force would be headed by joint
secretary bottom management in the Home
Ministry and will have members from BSF
and the Department of space
BSF has been designated as the lead
agency for implementation of drone
segment and network infrastructure
including the establishment of archival
facility the Home Ministry will
implement the project with the
assistance of the Department of space

Honorable Prime Minister assumed office

Red Fort on 15 August 2014 is slowly but
surely assuming the shape and form of a
genuine John Andolan therefore I want to
begin by welcome you all to the award
ceremony of the swatch selection 2019
when this project commenced in the first
servation the coverage was limited 72
cities that has gradually increased and
as the secretary pointed out the SWAT
selection 2019 has scaled even greater
heights covering four thousand two
hundred and thirty seven cities and that
too in a record time of 28 days in a
completely paperless digital format for

21,000 commercial areas sixty-nine
thousand residential areas 75,000
community
public toilets and more than 3,100 ways
to compost plants across the country but
most important apart from the very
comprehensive coverage is the spirit
evident of the city's positive intent to
provide their citizens the best of
service delivery sixty-four lakh
citizens in these 4237 cities with a lot
of passion and excitement participated
in the survey which is a testament and
testimony to the way the mission has
captured the mind space of citizens the
positive trajectory and the capturing of
people's mind has not been an entirely
easy process we have combined
encouragement using a margin of
persuasion with also a slow sometimes
disguised but clear policy of naming and
shaming just as we celebrate the cities
who are repeatedly getting the top two
or three ranks in the last two or three
years we are also finding ways of
encouraging those who were at the bottom
of the ladder and that we have been able
to do so and it is evident many of those
cities have registered very impressive
jumps is also I believe testimony to the
fact that this policy is working one
point five eight crore complaints
honourable president G were registered
and one point five seven crore
complaints resolved on the swatched I am
four point five crore citizens were
reached out through social media and
more than four thousand seven hundred

would go a step further and i would say
that the urban transformation that is
being attempted through the prime

programmatic interventions is the most
comprehensive and ambitious framework of

tea between the u.s. and Pakistan was
that it will never be used against India
and if Pakistan
they provide enough evidence to to the
world that f-16 was actually you during
this in this operation in the last week
it would be a very difficult situation
for Pakistan to defend itself and that
is why this question has become very
important also the spokesperson of the

Pakistan should stop hovering terrorist
organization and individuals those who
have been operating and having involved
in this and Palestine should abide by
the UN resolution I mean every time that

the other major p5 countries have been

hello and welcome to another edition off
to the point on the show this week
governor of Assam mr. Joby schmucky I
welcome you on the program sir so you've
completed a little more than a year as
governor in the northeastern state of
Assam and would like to know from you
that one of the kind of changes as far
as the development of Assam is concerned
what are the kind of changes which
you've really seen sitting on that
constitutional post I try to study
sitting or they're about this
functioning of the northeast about the
development of northeast rating about
the development northeast and I find
surprisingly growth rate of a northeast
or if I put it per capita income of
northeastern was much higher than the
per capita income of the country as a
whole today we have been left leg behind
why I try to study that and I reach at
this conclusion that because of the
division of the country in that year
1947 our relations were snapped with the
ASEAN contingent and Eastern country all
together right because of data
unemployment started why because
northeast had developed their economy on
the basis of the trade with these
countries because of snapping relation
with these countries unemployment
started which ultimately started with
the insurgency insurgency went on
increasing and that became the real
problem
our successive governments are tried to
handle the insurgency but
they took every problem of Northeast
from the security angle law he thought
it from security angle and whenever any
problem they had to sort out they will
give a package and then hand over that
area under some army or BSF CRPF or some
agencies I said successive governments
this was the practice over there

popularly known as hermit Kingdom Ladakh
is bounded by two of the world's
mightiest mountain ranges the great
Himalayas and the Karakoram it has
plenty to offer to everyone in recent
years river rafting in Ladakh has become
an attractive option to complement
sightseeing and here's on the itinerary
of most visitors
[Music]
Indus is one of the most scenic
whitewater rivers in the region it
provides tourists with whitewater
rafting and camping options in absolute
wilderness
[Music]
this water compared to what we used to
it's usually very very steep and rocky
where we come from so is this nice to
get your pedals in some good water it's
very awesome
[Music]
the stress Spitak and Nimue or softball
is ideal for the professional rafters
and one from speed oak and kuru is ideal
for beginners
[Music]
passing through densely forested
mountains and through steep gorges a
trip down the river is one of the best
ways to have a view of the splendid
countryside in all its glory
no wonder more than 10,000 foreign
tourists come to Ladakh especially for
river rafting every year
[Music]
I think it's a great adventure activity
for tourists so this allows you to get
out and see nature and enjoy the river
and have a good time as well
the thrill of emerging triumphant over
the swirling waters unmatched by any
other

gonna the capability to lay for three
rounds in less than 15 seconds I mean
less than five seconds each round will
go they're firing three different
trajectories low and high so as to
ensure that all the three rounds land at
the same time to create the effect which
you are looking at second the other
important thing about this gun so very
very important things is that it has got
and the most important thing of azimuth
positioning system it's got that match
system which is the latest positioning
pointing and azimuth system it's got the
latest fire control system it's complete
drills are electrical as also its fire
control system is very very accurate as
far as brought out this is one of the
front running system in 155 52 caliber
around the world its predecessor being
kick and also this gun is the future
looking gun which we have now been able
not just imagine out of 100 guns who is
going to make the 50 and 40 then have
come already it is a big boost to make
in India because we are going to get the
capability to produce the front liner
only 10 guns came in this semi knockdown
condition skd condition which was
assembled and the gun fired on 9th
November in the blurry range but the 50
and the 40 going to come in this more
importantly then we are only to prove
the version I work a 9 let's talk with a
bigger slightly bigger picture will let
me jump in here will will come to the
bigger picture as well but let me first
bring in Nadja here because staying with
the virtual apart you know last year in
the member when these guns were inducted
all of us know that it was after almost
three decades that the indian army had
finally got some new artillery guns in
the form of canine was rye as well as m
triple7 howitzers so if you look at
specifically this timing is is really
really crucial because this was a very
very much needed as far as Indian Army's
artillery evening is concerned we shall
to put it honestly should have happened
a decade ago
put it in real terms in today's time it
is a very important development because
I'll go out to take what made you know
checker birth is saying please
understand
other than the areas which are in
Punjab's out of the subtle edge this gun
can operate everywhere it probably
cannot operate north of the surface
because it's very reverent it will take
some time to adapt to those conditions
because of its track conditions is not a
visa gun other than the south of set
logic all areas these can be used by
this gun so hundred would be a small
number probably we need much more we
have three strike cores facing the west
out of the three strike course as I said
north of subtly without the rest of the
country from down from I would say if a
little car down below the row school
down below till Gujarat you would have
to have more number of guns especially
to when the tanks will move in as a
check officer pointed out of the armor
and breaking it down in simpler terms
when a tank column moves in it moves
into deserts into swamps into marshes
moves on not on roads but everywhere
else now you need a gun which also moves
with it
a normal actually gun Vishal is wheeled
it could into those areas so it remains
a few kilometers behind which is not an
ideal situation now to put it in in
simpler terms this gun will actually go
with the tanks one to the crew of the
gun is also protected like a normal tank
it is purchased rating inside the tank
tank type vehicle the normal at origin
does not provide the crew with such such
protection so this provides that kind of
protection so this is like a tank
mechanized and this kind of a gun track
gun moving with those tank columns into
offensive when we go at the breast in
Sector Vishal that is the crucial part
of it okay and one more thing at the
indigenisation aspect which are John
section also brought out you know the
first time some Indian company Indian
private company will be associated in
bringing out a self-propelled artillery
gun so that itself is also a significant
aspect when we talk about the
involvement of the private sector in the
defense manufacturing we shall LNT the
company which is being named here has
done some tremendous work not just in
this gun they put it in right
perspective they have made the hull of
the nuclear submarine re hunter it was
in public domain that's why I'm naming
it whereas the Indonesian part is
concerned I will still not think that we
hold the technology for this k9
we hold the technology political guns
called the himesh which is being made
the ofb which is a copy of the buffers
and improved version the buffers rather
and the a tags attacks the ranch stored
at Larry gun system the gun has been
designed by DRDO beshal and it is being
made by two Indian private companies
Tata and Barak forge the guns 40 of
those have been ordered by the you know
that is where I'm looking at when you
talk of indigenous Asian that is a more
focused area according to me because
those are the numbers which we need the
punishes in huge numbers the attacks
will be in huge numbers those are the
things which will bring in a nation and
we will hold the technology for those
Michelle and and the one which is
educating William at the larger picture
which are jealous ex and I was talking
about China ah coming back to at the
larger picture point which you were
earlier raising you know if you look at
the way artillery is to be used in the
conventional warfare system and
mechanized you know aspect of it which
is brought out by a joint chakra busy
earlier how do you see you know the
entire scenario developing from here
onwards now that we're talking about in
an army having almost 100 Vajra our
slogans and hobbitses would be required
an ultimate analysis and it is not only
just k9 Vajra or m1 77 or 80 AD we have
to say that we require tor guns of 155
millimeter we required SP guns and
howitzers we require towed howitzers all
the three variety not only that we
should not stop here we require multi
barrel rocket launchers merchant pinaka
we required better locating a target
locating radars we require the UAVs we
require battered management command and
control system unfortunately much like
the Army Air Defense the artillery
modernization program has also been a
very slow-moving and it smells moving
program has sir prod out Jacko these are
brought out that the last gun actually
the last gun which was inducted in 1987
to 1991 for one for Beaufort girls were
inducted and after that there have been
ably three four times the abomination
program started but it just fizzled out
but today utterly reason of great flux
now as I talked about the advanced old
Oracle system I want to talk about it
yes it is our 150
Winterthur gun I will say it is the
flagbearer banner holder do you know
that this program is one of the largest
public partner PPP model largest why it
is the largest many companies have come
together do you know that the gun barrel
has been made by first of all the gun is
designed by Dion you but then who are
making it the DRDO of me have come
together to make the barrel portion of
the gun then you have mahindra defense
which is making the recoil system then
you have Tata advanced system Tata se
trata power
SCD and pooja Lloyd which are doing the
other parts of the garden that is the
muzzle brakes and so now this gun
actually the gun we require is about two
thousand numbers are required to this
gun and the orders will be forthcoming
slowly and steadily now come to just
leave this 155 we are also talking about
155 millimeter next gun and Albert gun
together which is of the CNC state I am
talking of my indigenous capability as
make in India the a tax is our flag
bearer okay dear do you have done many
pools of stagnation but somewhere there
has been success 88 years success now
talk about 155 millimeter gun Hammad's r
which is not Vajra which is Dhanush you
know themost something which we started
with buffers all right we started with
the buffers gun but we modified the
range from 39 to 42 kilometers we have
version 2 of the measure if you visited
the two zero one eight deaf Expo you
does seen my it guns system of the
notion which the gun has been mounted on
it by a touch aces of BML today we have
that variety of our room and then coming
to the towed 155 millimeter gun the tour
155 when you integrate ownership bill as
much as M 177 okay as I was talking
about south of subtle but what about
north of circle what about the
mountainous area we are now having going
to get 145 m 177 ultralight L coated
ultralight hamed's ours in which who is
a major player okay ba system and made
it fine
it is Mahindra defend which is going to
make
rest of the car so there is a
collaboration between the private sector
and the difference is use and the
foreign companies as well and we are
making strides that let me bring in a
junk shockable to hear on the larger
picture as Jen Saxena brought out indeed
the kind of guns we are looking forward
to in future as well and the kind of
guns we have we're working on but Jen
Chakraborty coming back to the canine
watch ara how do you think k9 bajra adds
to this larger picture well firstly let
me put it out very lucky to be there in
dev lolly
I was invited at a retired stage to be
invited for a firing and I was with the
rock shaman tree and she asked me how
did I feel I mean it's like a dream come
true trying to be very simplistic
because I would like to put it firstly I
will answer your question and then
answer a little more well Cain I'm
buzzed rough it's when you have to have
mechanized warfare remember a tank
consumption of ammunition even in an
intense battle is ten to fifteen rounds
per day normally it's six to eight
rounds per day
artillery which is accompanying them
will be firing anything to up to two
second lines which would go from 100 to
150 rounds so the bulk of the firing
which is to be done is to be done by the
artillery artillery guns in the US they
always call that their that Trump you
know when you are marching general
subchannel mass and pure are they also
must have done some marching and we all
march somewhere and you always you know
even Subash Chandra Bose has their
Khadem Kadamba Rajah so you have a drum
at Trump so if the canine is there the
armored division and he called it the
mechanized forces the drum is moving
with you all others have to be deployed
and ground as he said it both of them
said and then they give you by their
range to deploy or leapfrog whatever you
keep naming it so k9 occupies an
important role next C as I think both of
them have described India as a variety
of terrain and artillery fire has to
reach every place you'll be surprised
there are still areas in India
the artillery does not reach because of
lack of road the lack of communications
I'm say is very clear about that areas
particularly the in the extreme
northeast if I may put it which is known
as the rest of Arunachal Pradesh but
today with these guns coming in a
variety of come in and why have this
variety come in since we were all in the
decision-making process at least I just
come from J&K and when I found it when I
had to capture a militant I always had
to have at least five or six plans
moving together it was so difficult so
when nothing was moving as they both
said I said let's apply six plans
together what are those one private
sector second we must get the foreigners
third we must get the DRDO because we
should get them because they themselves
said I remember the the dvd-audio said
that we've got nothing from the
artillery they were busy maybe arguing
at that time we must get the DRDO we
must get the of' me and also make them
all combined and we must also get
BrahMos going now most was enabled this
thing so I said let's attack all fronts
and everybody said that even the Marines
with the Ministry of Defense because I
was intimately involved they've all said
general you are you workload is
increased six times I said one out of
these six as luck would have it today
all six have succeeded and it has
succeeded it has taken as they have
correctly said it is not something which
is happened yesterday out of this the
most difficult was the k9y because we
wanted one thing very clearly as they
say the making India come and make in
India comes in when the ammunition that
is being fired is a making is an Indian

careful about is to not think in terms
of the fixed and rigid religious
categories and religious boundaries that
we are there with today it seems that
throughout history day ordinary

generosity to more than one religious
order of it but there is plenty of

represents bountiful abundance of nature
Lakshmi continues till today in Hindu

surprised at the fact that they have so
many things in common it is because we
are looking at these as religions but we
have to be aware of the fact that these
so-called religions the Hindu Buddhist
and Jain religions have been created a
Dera constructed there a colonial
construct created by people who were
writing the the colonial scholars who
were writing about these faiths
there are no gods in the early
philosophic vision of India there are
deities deities negations of concepts
and qualities the qualities are within
us and by responding to these deities
brought to us in art we awaken those
fine aspects in ancient India people
were free to adorn the deity of their
personal choice
within families husbands wives and
children often followed the path of
different deities it's a misconception
that many people think these images of
the Buddha's and Bodhisattvas are in the
registration of the gods no but the
other deities Reedy's means one of the
aspects of the of the Gypsy curse and
because is a consciousness it's a factor
of the one of the consciousness ISM so
they are not truly existing we find for
example that in a Buddhist temple while
the principal deity the object of
worship would be Buddha but the scheme
of sculptures in the temple as a whole
would also show in the gods like Indra
or Agni being depicted that's only the
and the degree of importance given
duties which changes in different
religions in western India
the 2nd century BC are showed in one of
the greatest periods of the entire art
Buddhism over a period of about a
thousand years more than 1,200 caves out
of the mountains of the Western carts
the first phase a prolific excavation
was from the second century BC till the
3rd century AD great Buddha's prayer
halls and viharas for the residents
amongst made under the rule of the South
varnas and the shutter AAPIs though
these kings revered Hindu deities they
patronized all religious establishments
the Buddhist cave number 18 and Bahji of
the second century BC brings us some of
the earliest known representations of
the Hindu deities Indra and Surya they
continued and worshipped till today in
Hinduism and his temples in Japan a
gunner of the 2nd century BC made at the
Buddhist site of ptah kora carries an
inscription which states that he the
nation of a goldsmith can Hadassah which
means servant of Krishna a Hindu deity
[Music]
one of the grandest Buddhist caves is
the great chat there at Carlie of the
1st century AD inscriptions record the
names of numerous individual donors who
paid for the carving of various parts of
the cave and its pillars these include
Greeks many Greeks and Romans visited
and even settled in India during this
period of flourishing trade many of them
are known to have become devout
followers of Indic faiths among the
earliest known Hindu antiquities
theodora's pillar at Vidisha in Madhya
Pradesh of the 2nd century BC the
inscription on it states that it was set
up by a Greek devotee by that name in
honour of Vasudeva who Lord Vishnu the
inscription around 150 AD found that
Nasik inscription issued by one
Gautama Bala shape who was the mother of
some various classes of life to the
Buddhist monastic so it is obvious that
though the ruler said their religious
preferences there was no pressure on the
population to follow the religion of the
rule
the only dirty is in early Indian art
where yuck yuck she's Nagas and Lakshmi
there were no figures made of Buddha
genitive shankara's or Hindu deities
these came to be made for the first time
in the 1st century AD under the rule of
the Kushan
whose homeland was in southern China the
inscriptions show that the Kushan rulers
worshipped Hindu deities themselves
however in keeping with the Indic
traditions they were fully benevolent to
Buddhists in China stance
