release tomorrow the Central Board for
Film certification has given a you a
universal certificate for this film's
release it will be released tomorrow
it's a two-hour 10-minute long film
starring Vivek Oberoi much effort was
made to stall this film charges were
levelled that this is propaganda for the

forest the CBF sea finally giving a new
certificate vivek oberoi and the makers
of the film will be heaving a sigh of
relief

the week oh God
because the release was in a limbo
because the BBFC had not given
certificates what we now understand is
that our youth certificate has been
given and the movie will be 2 hours 10
minutes long what we now need to see is
what decision will the will the Election
Commission take because now the ball is
in the election commission scores
however what we do understand from our
sources in the Election Commission is
that we should expect their decision on
the biopic in the cup in the next couple
of hours so what's the matter that's
before the Election Commission will it
look at whether this movie is election
propaganda separately outside of what
the CB FC is doing yes that is what the
Election Commission will be looking into
now because all the complaints that were
submitted to the Election Commission
from opposition parties including the
Congress party all the opposition
parties at the moment saying that this
film is propaganda if this will also is
being released the timing was questioned
by the opposition parties opposition
parties also blamed PGP and the Prime
Minister saying that this is a new way
to which they are trying to get voters

decision that the Election Commission
will now have to take the Commission
will see whether the movie is propaganda

[Music]
[Music]
good morning and welcome as I am taking
my first lesson on this surfing boat
trying to balance myself we have reached
Puducherry from chennai
[Music]
okay that was my first lesson at surfing
at least I gave it a short always wanted
to do and it's all thanks to some I from
the Cali Li surfing school here in
Puducherry and you've been here for a
very very long time 24 years so what is
it that you'd really like about
Puducherry surfing it it was a great
time thank you so much good evening and
welcome
where else where else in the country
would you get the amalgamation the
melting point of so many cultures but
voodoo cherry
yes I'm in the state of Puerto cherry
it's only one Lok Sabha seat though and
it goes to pole in the second phase of
election we are coming to you live today
the election Express is live today from
this beautiful beach and behind me is
the mahatma gandhi statue as well and at
least the evening breeze has made this
variable otherwise that they heat could
only you could only cool off in that
fantastic surfing lesson that I had I
know a lot of you would be getting very
jealous about that but when you talk
about the politics usually of this very
cosmopolitan Pondicherry in fact we are
rather this is called the white
treatment behind me my camera person
Ashok will show you that's the very
famous cafe it used to be at one point
of time the port this is where the port
used to be when the French in fact made
it their colony quite beautiful and as I
said it gets you the flavour not only of
the French culture but also of the Tamil
culture is a mixture of too many
identities too many cultures here today
when we are talking about this very
Beach which is behind me I met a group
of young people they call themselves
keep Pondicherry clean and they came up
with a very very strong message and
especially in the election season
because they believe there are a lot of
political parties ignore the issues of
environment people come here litter
massively just about in half an hour
when you are shoe
we were able to collect two big bags
take a look at the story of these
youngsters how they are trying to keep
the beaches opera sherry clean also an
appeal to all the tourists those who
come here please please please a very
eco sensitive zone
don't litter so much take a look at this
story and what their expectation from
their politicians is
[Music]
[Applause]
this lovely beach here in puducherry the
first thing after you are stunned by
this beautiful visual is the litter on
the beach and there is a group of
youngsters which is trying to change and
in fact you are potentially for good
they're cleaning the beach it's our
these volunteers come here every weekend
on weekdays when there are more tourists
here and they come and try and clean the
beach let me just try and get these
youngsters on camera and try and
understand what motivates them this is
the place where people you know gathers
here and they simply eat and they throw
everything here and we thought we
thought there is a dustbin yeah even
maybe 50 to 20 50 they have less been
here but they are throwing this in there
with the water it goes into the sea yeah
so are you getting some support from the
municipal authorities you know of course
most of them are a very aged for
cleaning this place and all they are
very good they cannot do cleaning here
area you can find very difficult to
stand in the rock and clean right so
they are almost at 60 60 days class the
ladies they cannot come and clean here
political parties do they pay any
attention to environmental issues yes
they are supporting us as fellows and
government bodies they are giving
support coming when you go out and when
you hear your candidates talking about
environment issues in the campaign or
that is something that nobody talks
about it's neglected truly speaking no
one bothers about the internal issue in
Pondicherry
you can't wait for anybody else to in
fact do the clearing for you ultimately
it's the responsibility of everybody
it's mine and your responsibility to
make sure that we make this sustainable
we make the environment more livable not
only for ourselves but for the future
generations and this is what these young
people not only are sending out a
message with but they are also hoping
that the political parties will be more
active when they come out and vote this
will be on top of their agenda",True,en,733,0,14

share of Notah was even more than what
21 parties in the fray got about 60 lakh

the list of voters where lota option was
the third most popular choice a similar
trend emerged in states like
multiplication Rajasthan where wrote

seats in chapters girl no doubt was the
second runner-up on five seats so the
trend so far shows that more and more

mr. will be holding a rally there and an

interesting part is there is of course
scarcity and poverty of ground in those
areas and the kind of crowd that has to
be accommodated with the security of the

Kings xi punjab have made a strong start
in IPL 2019 and a lot of credit for it
goes to their top water batsman KL Rahul
and monk Agarwal when jobs Canada boy
spoke to India today about their season
thus far and hopes of being on that
flight to England that's what we fought
to scale to play the way that he is is
amazing it's tremendous you know to
watch the way the way he's hitting the
ball the way he's striking the way the
way he's playing he's had a tremendous
series against England as well he's come
his comment form also you know me and
him are friends for a long time but
we've known Chris also for five six
years now when you were there together
it was our first couple of years was
with Chris and I went back to our CB I
played another 2 years with him so again
here two years so known him a long time
now and it's great to have somebody like
that on the team and not just a batsman
what what does he do to the
dressing-room see he brings he brings a
lot of energy he brings a lot of
positivity we were to laughter and
pranks and you know he just brings a lot
of good life and his sense of confidence
it's also be refreshing while you back
definitely because he uh the the kind of
pressure he he creates without even
going to back is something there's no
obviously the opposition bowlers now
start thinking you know how do we get
him out but we plan him out know if
Chris Gayle can play 10 overs then then
you know it's the other team's kind of
doom yeah and this year remind the last
six seven months been good for you you
played for India
you scored runs in Test cricket people
are now also saying that mine Kaka ball
should be playing in the ODI sense men
say I would definitely like to play all
the format's of the game for the country
and you know I'm looking forward to if
and when given a chance but you know
selection is not something that that's
that's in our hand also you know talking
about the five six months they have been
really good playing Test cricket for the
country which is which was my dream has
come true and I'm quite happy that you
know both of us were part of a very
historic wind down under who to achieve
to achieve those feats in
international cricket especially in in
in the in the test and the test format
is something that you know we're looking
at and you know we've been the number
one team for third year in a row now and
then having been there then it also adds
a new dimension to your batting they're
definitely confidence
I feel plays a major role in in cricket
you know it it could be that you know
I've played just desk cricket it's a
different format and t20 is a different
format but the basics of the game remain
the same they can the confidence carries
through and and kala the IPL you know as
a cricketer as a batsman do you think
this can also form basis for the World
Cup selection somebody like you who's in
the reckoning for maybe as a back up
opener people are saying maybe as the
number for do you take the IPL games as
some kind of a trial for the World Cup
selection looks right up
I don't know again like what basis the
World Cup team will be selected
maybe form of course form will play a
very important role and I think you know
it's it's it's not just these two months
I think the the selection committee and
the the Indian support staff the
coaching staff the captain the team you
know they've worked for the last two
three years trying to get that
combination right so I don't think it's
just these two months and the
performance in these two months in the
IPL it is very important to carry for

of the longest and most staggered
elections in our democracies history
whether I take you through all the day
things are gonna be starting very very
soon in fact they kick off on April the
11th they're gonna be seven separate
phases the first starts on April the
11th and the last is on May the 19th
results day is a consolidated day which
is on the 23rd of May let's first start
with phase one where the polling date is
April the 11th that's a Thursday very
important because this is the kickoff
phase the first phase where you
basically have 25 constituencies from
Andhra Pradesh Arunachal Pradesh to a
Sam five Bihar for a third Pradesh 800
TRACON five and many of these other
states that go to the polls in the first
phase cut to April the 18th that seven
days after the first phase that phase
number do that's when polling happens in
the second phase here again you've got
five parliamentary seats in Assam five
in Bihar Chhattisgarh 3 Jammu and
Kashmir - Karnataka kicks it off with 14
seats Maharashtra has 10 money put 1
Odisha 5 Tamilnadu with 39 seats in that
second phase 3 para won eight important
constituencies in Uttar Pradesh 3 in
West Bengal and Puducherry has one seat
in the second phase then April the 23rd
that's a Tuesday is phase number 3 which
kicks off at that point of time just
short of the Midway mark in this
particular election in phase 3 you've
got a lot of more constituencies going
to the polls right from Assam number 4
four constituencies 37 the hard 5
Gujarat 26 go out to Jammu and Kashmir 1
Karnataka 14 Kerala 20 Maharashtra 14
orisha 6 10 more constituencies in the
large state of Uttar Pradesh West Bengal
5 Dodd rinoa Rivini 1 and Thummim and D
you also has one constituents we going
to the polls in phase number 3 then
phase number 4 this is way past the
halfway mark half the election is now
completely done
you know half the constituencies have
been polled April the 29th is when phase
number 4 kicks in in this particular
phase you've got a Jammu and Kashmir one
seed Jharkhand three seats BR 5
parliamentary seats 6 important
constituencies in Madhya Pradesh go to
the polls
7
see the large number 17 seats in
Maharashtra go are the polls in the
crucial fourth phase orisha has six
Uttar Pradesh has 13 seats from West
Bengal has 8 so the fourth phase is
gonna be very crucial in those large
critical swing states during this
particular election come to face on the
5 you're into may may 6th is when
polling happens in phase 5 in this
particular phase you've got 5
parliamentary seats in Bihar that go to
the elections West Bengal 702 Pradesh 14
more seats mother pradesh 7 rajasthan 12
char cont for again very heavy you know
voting will take place in these
constituencies in the large states of
the country may 12th is when phase 6
kicks in this penultimate phase of this
election is May the 12th that happens to
be a Sunday there will be heavy voting
14 seats in Uttar Pradesh in phase
number 6 West Bengal has 8 delhi-ncr
kicks in with 7 Jharkand for Haryana 10
Madhu Pradesh 8 so that's another big
one Delhi NCR enters the fray in phase
number 6 and the final phase is phase
number 7 that's on may the 19th just
four days short of the results day when
the election results will be known in
this particular phase char country
Madhya Pradesh 8 punjab 13 west bengal 9
Chandigarh 1 utter Pradesh 13 and
Himachal Pradesh 4 so there are states
like West Bengal that have constituency
is going to the full across the 7 phases
so this is going to be a staggered phase
very protracted election there has been
some criticism over why there are so
many phases but there are many
complications and implications in
extending an election in this many
phases crucial States going to the
election the Election Commission has
applied its mind to make sure that they
have the capacity to deploy forces
ensure free and fair elections in many
places where things have happened in the
past so this is going to be a critical
election the longer you extend it the
more difficult you know it perhaps is in
some areas but the logic really is that
if you stagger it and phase it in this
manner it actually is easier to control

India today's fact-check team head val
krishna who's you know whose hands are
full you know Bala I can imagine your
team must be one of the busiest during
election time every day there must be
you know more than a handful of things
that you guys have to fact-check what's
it been like you know people are curious
I myself am curious what's it been like
with this speeches is your team finding
a lot of work to do with the speeches
also by big Methos interesting
leadership yet we can see that there is
a pattern to the speech you have
interacting the speeches off especially
around Gandhi and Narendra Modi animate
can see there are not too many facts
these leaders are talking right now if
you talk about hard facts that mean
shake what we see is there a definite
pattern to the speeches offer Narendra
Modi and Rahul Gandhi if you analyze the
patterns of the speeches of Narendra
Modi we can see that there generally
three layers in his speech the first
thing is this try to connect to the
public audience with
some emotive issues like subbu's versus
support referring to the two to our
media vans referring to Castagna then he
brings in some work about his flexible
schemes and how Congress government was
corrupt and white or why people should
not even think of coming back Congress
and then he touches some issues which
are hand-picked which touches about the
local issues what we see we'll see in
each other for he definitely picks up
some local issues that specific to the
conscience he that says he addressing to
while Rahul Gandhi will see that Rahul
Gandhi is straightforward he's very
aggressive his questioning Prime
Minister Shaukat our versus Joe kadar he
is we can see that he has been referring
to chalky that you're often in his
speeches and then is talking about
unemployment crisis absolutely so very
interesting layered speeches highly
structured nothing left to chance you
know these are hardly extemporary
speeches or shri Jenner I want to bring
you in on this as well because Rahul
Gandhi is about to begin speaking do you
do you see or do you notice a you know
an evolution in Rahul Gandhi's speeches
as we get closer to the elections I
think there's been a sort of steady
evolution shift in his speeches in any
case I think the the kind of watershed
moment came in Gujarat when his speeches
suddenly became much more aggressive
much more cutting much more ironic
that's when he first mentioned the
Gabbar Singh - yeah he seemed far more
confident so I think there has been a
sort of steady evolution I think Raphael
was a bit of a setback because he wasted
a lot of time and attention on a topic
that didn't actually spark off much
response so I think he's had to
backtrack obviously from Raphael it will
be interesting to see how he now tackled
the Prime Minister on jobs etc because
as I said the automatic response of many
people not just the Prime Minister is
what was your government your party
doing for so many decades employment and
unemployment are not new issues to India
which have suddenly popped up in the
last four and half years yes they have
been plaguing the Indian economy and
society for decades so he is on a
slightly weaker wicked there as well I
personally think he's going to try to
use the love peace goodwill lots of hugs
and kisses card let's see how far that
actually goes he is going to talk about
the Prime Minister's attacks on the
family etc I think he's probably going
to have to confront that far more
centrally than he has done but let's see
because Rahul Gandhi is not known for
making speeches that actually inflame
crowds he is not a charismatic speaker
of light mr. Modi is and hence
it is always interesting there's always
actually an element of surprise in what
he might come up with okay so what could
he actually come up with on Jumanji I
want to bring you in on this because you
know ultimately the voter you know is
being confronted with two threads and
two narratives with both of these
leaders you know both prominent leaders
Rahul Gandhi in the one side and
Narendra Modi or the other
pretty much sticking to their formulas
you know they're not they're not
stepping out of their comfort zones
right now so you know isn't that going
to be complicated ship as far as
Maharashtra is concerned they're 50% of
the geographical areas under drought and
these are the areas which are actually
under severe drought so probably in
Maharashtra the drought is the core
issue Farm distress is the core issue
and even mr. Modi and BJP will have to
go that they'll have to talk about that
yeah and if you see the campaigning of
foreign lease in the last few days days
here also also going but going back to
the farmer issue and reminding them that
what they have done for them
this is where the thing is that actually
and in Maharashtra the thing seats are
getting closer because of the late
alliance between Shia and BJP is now
settling down here now so probably Rahul
Gandhi is going to hit upon form
distress which is which is going to be
the more core issue of the elections
okay I I want to play out for you know
you know since this happened just a
short while ago when Rahul Gandhi was in
Hoonah where there were chants of Modi
and he was forced to respond on that
interesting point if the sentiment that
he's expressed before that I have no
hatred for Modi this is a man he's
actually hugged in Parliament as well I
just want to play out that interesting
segment for you now I love mr. Narendra
Modi
I genuinely I genuinely I genuinely have
no hatred towards the man at all
I have no anger never doubt me say
something it
I have no angle but I have no anger
towards or hatred towards mr. nerim oh
he has he has he has anger towards me
[Applause]
it's fine it's fine no problem I have I
have no anger towards the middle
[Applause]

cNr0T-IZ5w8,Christian Michel Moves Court: &quot;How Was ED Charge Sheet Leaked To Media?&quot;,"AgustaWestland case middleman Christian Michel has moved the court, demanding to know how his statement in the ED charge ...",2019-04-05T10:49:15Z,India Today,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cNr0T-IZ5w8/hqdefault.jpg,"a day after the Enforcement Directorate
chargesheet coated augustawestland scam
accused Michaele as saying that aap
means the Commission's MFA tale and F
a.m. means family now we hear that
Christian Michele has a question just
how the IDI chart sheet has been leaked
to the media
Christian Michele's lawyers claimed that
this is clear contempt of court le côté
is to take up his application tomorrow
when he joins us for more in this Manish
now it's the turn of Christian Michele
who raised all these questions about the
supplementary Chachi that was filed by
the Enforcement Directorate and the
contents of this charge sheet that are
in public domain novel Christian Michele
through his learn has filed an
application before the court and he has
alleged that before taking cognizance by
the court the charge sheet was leaked to
the media now it's very technical
because remember this is not the first
time when charge sheet was filed again
Christian Michele this was a third
charge sheet and the first sheet against
him was filed in 2016 so the matter of
cognizance doesn't matter in this case
because as far as Christian Michele is
concerned the court the court doesn't
need to consider cognizance of this
entire charge sheet but as far as the
entire charge sheet is concerned there
are three new accused in this case and
that is why the cognizance is required
so it's a little bit technical and that
is why I quote we'll be hearing this
matter tomorrow at 2 o clock but as far
as this charge sheet is concerned it's a
very sensational charge sheet because
remember just before the election the
IDI is now in black and white mentioned
the name of a mod Patil and FM that is
family and also they have mentioned mrs.
Gandhi so it's going to have a
far-reaching political implications as
far as this election is concerned back
to you

yBKWHZiyYTo,Vivek Oberoi Vs Congress&#39; Nagma: Is Narendra Modi Biopic BJP Propaganda? | Bollywood Faceoff,"The Election Commission has cleared the release of Vivek Oberoi's Narendra Modi biopic, sayng that it did not pose a threat to ...",2019-04-03T10:35:37Z,India Today,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yBKWHZiyYTo/hqdefault.jpg,"[Music]
hello and a very warm welcome you're
watching the big Bollywood face-off
we've been having youngsters face off
we've had senior politicians face off
cutting across the political divide it's
now time for the big Bollywood faceoff
joining us on this special broadcast the
special debate I want to introduce first
vivek oberoi whom I last met in Varanasi
in the middle of the campaign for the
Uttar Pradesh elections he was at that
time canvassing for the Bharatiya janta
party he is now coming out with a new
film a biopic on Prime Minister Modi
multiple charges being flung his way on
the issue of whether this is a
propaganda vehicle for the Prime
Minister and the BJP will put some of
those questions to him squaring off
against him well-known face on
television actress Nagma politician from
the Congress party welcome to the both
of you and welcome to the big Bollywood
face off I want to take question number
one on the showdown on this India Today
debate question number one is Vivek
Oberoi's new film the biopic on Prime
Minister Narendra Modi a propaganda
vehicle for the BJP and the Modi sir car
that's the first question and I want to
put that question first to wave a Cobra
is your film sir a propaganda vehicle
for the Modi sir car coming as it does
just days before the first phase of
polling you couldn't have timed it
better people have a Diwali release they
have an easily Salman Khan is famous for
that Vivek Oberoi has a election release
come at the election and come with X
movie well I like the way you position
it thank you thank you all know in
absolute clarity clarity and clear terms
it is not a propaganda film in any way
it is not a surrogate advertising kind
of film I'm experiencing now what I
think the Prime Minister has been
experiencing over the last five years
baseless allegations you know our OPR
rope lake in Cebu tahini there's no
proof we've been
you know put subjected to all kinds of
grind to say that okay show us financial
evidence show us paper trails show us
everything's and we've presented
everything in absolute clarity to the
Commission's to the panels that have
asked us the courts that have asked us
and we've come through a legal problem
here the judiciary doesn't have an issue
the Election Commission doesn't have an
issue the Constitution provides me a
sovereign right to release my film and
yet there are people attacking there are
major grand parties who I would assume
have much more important things to do
before an election coming on an attack
point you make that days ahead of the
elections when there's a lot of
campaigning to do like my why is your
party and your top legal eagles running
to courts running to the Election
Commission saying they want remakes
movie Ben don't you have campaigning and
can you sing to do why you're wasting
time you do your job let him do his
that's a fair question Rahul and I think
that it's very important to understand
that
we live in a democratic country people
have the right to vote you know thinking
about what they should be doing how they
should be doing and they have the
freedom of expression of course we
always spoken about that but having said
that I think these kind of movies coming
right at the time of Elections on one
hand you see a movie like this coming
and the EC wants it to you know is
saying nothing about it but on the other
hand you see that a book on Rafael which
is going to be coming out of which you
know it was coming out has you know been
burnt all the copies of it have been a
warrant and confiscated the copyright
correct that's an important point that
you know silly Cobra even though it's
now clarified I haven't finished
I mean hero worship is not something
that our country really needs at this
moment I mean the marginalised are
really oppressed people are you know
like we don't need hero worship what we
need is reality if we speak about
reality this they compare a Bala court
to Bangladesh what I'm trying to say is
that's your exaggeration because nobody
even knows what happened in Bala code
there is a
oh did kind of a you know scenario
off-off Bala code around us as yet we
don't have the answers to it still so so
therefore comparing it to something is
is simply not fair because it's a very
vague and opaque picture at the moment
apart from that if you see what rajiv
gandhi ji did to the Tamilians who were
you know for the millions who were
situated in sri lanka at that point in
time he sent the peace force of the army
peace force went there but he never took
credit he lost his life for that he
never said you marry say not here so
it's like say nice sub cocina it is not
that on the block or sienna don't bring
nationalism into democratic voting if
you have nationalism correct Wi-Fi
direction on nationalism why not on the
work that you've done in the past is
worth using a boy of hero worship
sure under bhakti blind europe what are
you about so I'd like to actually refute
all those points so I think I think I
think the party that she represents
would rather not have hero worship but
have the worship of a last name which is
what's been going on for the last seven
decades I think they're not talking
about say the realities of Bala code and
stripping the credibility of heroes that
this country needs like Wing Commander
AB in London and today the doublespeak
is ridiculous you're talking about
removing the Sedition law with somebody
can stand in my country burn that
Taronga can say harakiri
tokido hunger in those fans motive oz
can say that but at the same time you're
saying I can't release my film so it's
that okay it's okay to have an anti
Sedition law being ripped apart and say
no no golly no - go easy - Mike how pure
oh you see this kögel IDO but we may go
broke if you go girl isn't that freedom
of spanned what is this then I'd like to
see then I'm also the all-india
you know a general secretary for the
woman's being I
I am in charge of Jammu and Kashmir and
I exactly know what's been happening
there
I mean why take credit of something like
surgical strikes have been always doing
it's nothing new there's nothing to
respond is point let me say ester
Pradesh Chief Minister yogi are the
cannot go out and say in a campaign let
Modi - Aniki makes is why should this be
called Prime Minister Modi's army
this is India's army it's not his army
it's Miami it's your army who you're
dousing whether actually went in and did
the job at a time where our men are
giving their life fighting and killing
those damned terrorists that need to be
neutralized
we are undermining our own voice saying
oh the minute we come into power we'll
pull the army out we'll reduce the
numbers that's how you boost over all of
our army who's fighting they're gearing
up your life your family is losing real
heroes who really fought for this
country
I like the fervor he's talking rubbish
because yet in front of the camera the
CAG I'm not a politician
surely that our army did not have the
guns did not have the ammunition did not
have it for the longest time and now you
are providing Rafael is a very big scam
which is happening and it is still to
unrevealed what has happened is the
files are missing everybody knows about
it who is firing offense aside from the
fact that I'm not so I don't have not
I'm not obliged to show wrong
but I have presented it to the Election
Commission in thorough detail for
thorough inspection and come through
with clean flying colors there was a
story people who are closely associated
with the BJP and have done multiple
project I belong to India I don't belong
to the BJP because I believe in the man
I believe that he's a true hero he's the
near of the off of this country and he's
doing what he's doing and he's done a
great job over the last five years you
state whether you've done for which
sector which women be busy trying to
find it's not what has happened with the
world can see no harm is done for this
country recently and we won we won that
we won that because we took issues on
the ground all I know Ellie hi ko trying
to fight a film Rangers so confident
about your way if you're in such a
political high why are you sending the
biggest legendary royalty like Kapil
Sibal
I'll be shaking Manu Singhvi I'm sure
they're more important it's okay to talk
against the country I can make a film in
this freaking day can't be surreptitious
advertising I'll tell you why there is a
bar on opinion polls and campaigning
48 hours before the poll actually
happens right however it does the film
that's playing and that film ionizes the
Prime Minister talks highly of what he's
done and you're already saying that you
think highly of what he's done then that
film Khun tin
so does that then not constitute
surreptitious you say 48 hours is the
only period in which a person can be
influenced are you saying that route can
well who runs a show an opinion making
show an opinion maker like the uncommon
or or somebody like magma who's a
spokesperson cannot go out on television
and and and here you are you're a
general secretary you're in power you
represent the Congress part but we need
to shut down everybody
will you shut down the speaking about
the combination I'm allowed to make I'm
surprised that being from the industry
and this is the tragedy of being from
the industry people don't support it
like Hirsch is my senior from the
industry doesn't come out and support
the fact that a film should be allowed
to release made a move made soft targets
we've been attacked early in the history
I mean right from the time that you band
on the right from the time you band Kiss
our core Zika you've been going after
films why over 40 years why what's the
point
I I want to quote to you some of our if
you're so sure Bollywood stars have sex
I would there are many stars in
Bollywood which when spoke against this
government or made certain kind of
comments like you know the society is
intolerant and things like that whether
it was nice to thin shava that it was
Americans wife whether it was Shahrukh
Khan where there was many spoke and they
were really ostracized for what they
then why not stand up for physics
why not stand up today so once again I
want to ask on this big body honest
opinion has freedom of expression under
the Modi circa gone up gone down or
stayed the same that's the question that
I want to ask both the vivek oberoi
enigma and as Nagma was saying you know
i want to quote to you what different
people said karan johar at this zj
portlet of literature festival says
freedom of expression is the biggest
in today's world revealing your mind in
today's time can land you in jail
americana the ROM not going car Ward
says when i chat with Kieran at home she
say should bemore move out of India
that's a disastrous and big statement to
make she fears for her child she fears
for the atmosphere around us Shahrukh
Khan says there is intolerance there is
extreme intolerance there is growing
intolerance sharmila tagore says the
last 1 year has been unprecedented the
intolerance that we are experiencing is
against our constitution is against the
basic principle of democracy Dibakar
Banerjee says people are being murdered
for their beliefs and opinions Anurag
Kashyap says the voice of dissent is
being suppressed for me any civilization
that tries to suppress the voice of the
artist is in grave and love ownership to
start by supporting my film because this
is what tolerance is all about tolerate
my film go out tomorrow if there is a
Padma being stopped whether it is right
wing left wing or Center I'm I don't
belong to any for that film and say
that's wrong needs to be banned so I am
the face of no matter what right left or
Center whoever opposes a group belongs
to leave it's a political party it's not
my government is your government -
you're an Indian citizen well I say that
in order citizen of India he's your
Prime Minister - and this is your
government - yes I would like to be
Prime Minister millions and billions
across the whole because is happening
love jihad is happening lynchings are
happening are these things were these
things happening earlier I may leave at
all beauty but how look in the kind of
budget that they've given more than more
than 56 percent is just for advertising
all they've done is advertising they not
have been allocated the money to the
states I mean look at the reality for
things and just movie yes
this is what we are doing in this
country and together doing about the
well you say with our with money let it
release that just shows left the debate
to the issue of freedom of expression
do you believe Nagma freedom of
expression in the last five years has
gone up is it stayed the same
has it come down not now look it's not
only me there are many people in the
industry like I've just named a few
likeness luden shah like Aamir Khan's
wife like Shah Rukh Khan they're people
who are well respected people in the
industry who really made
big name for themselves if they has
something to say like that it's not me
who said these statements it's their who
have given all these statements they
must have seen something change in the
atmosphere for them to have said this
what they have said so it's not it's not
one arrogance it's about something that
the people are feeling it's about all
that you know all those people who got
those awards who are returning their
awards it's about the arrogance of Smith
irani who wanted to give the awarding
son of the president you know giving the
awards to the the the people who deserve
to be taking they refused to take the
award so go to the arrogance of BJP stop
saying that names over democracy my only
response to them is I'll give them my
number let them start the influencing on
social media start with my film because
my film is about saving the body who
does anything professionally anybody are
they ever asked by people why now the
way I want to release it the way I want
to when I want to end it is the
sovereign right of the viewers to watch
it when they want to make employer makes
robber if Salman Khan can have an either
release heat nobody selling him don't
release any value so he said I would
have an election really what is wrong
thing what's wrong with it yeah I can
you how can you ask me that question and
I think that's against the fundamental
principle of democracy pattern that is
following aside nationalism because it's
deflecting from the real issues whatever
the real issues is form assistance
really
it's showing on that channel these
people after coming to power when you're
saying all these people are concerned
about the atmosphere in India and the
tolerance and
[Music]
we was talking about and he talks about
how many has he because understand party
of yours what is in it for them to give
a Cobra I just want to make this point
that at the time of the emergency and
right around that time the films that
came out were very strongly
anti-government they were taking on the
system so I want to ask the other
question that I want to put on this body
would face off a Bollywood film makers
now going out of the way to curry favor
with the Modi circa at the time of the
emergency just before that 1975 year
Gulzar's and II which featured two mm
and Sanjeev Kumar then you are correctly
then you had kissed Socrates I'm talking
you abandoned their two separate issues
I'll deal with both over who banded I'll
deal with both those issues both are
equally important issues but then there
was
which is America's figure 1977 which
came out one second which short what was
going around your idea emergency second
at that time filmmakers were taking on
the system now it seems filmmakers want
to join the system and propagate the
view of the system
tell me something that if somebody has a
contrarian view they're great but if
somebody wants to celebrate the fact is
only country in the world where a chai
wallah who's selling peaches without
money without drama Raj America family a
business house without having great
influence and political backing from a
massive political legacy can reach this
status it's inspirational I feel when I
see this film that anyone can become a
prime minister it's an aspiration to
aspire to a chalky that can become a
prime minister pakora seller can become
the prime minister in your party in your
party you can't become Congress
president ever can you because you don't
have the Gandhi surname
whereas in dbgap
a chalky that can become more influenced
by no backing behind it excuse me was
Alba Duchess ready there's so many Prime
Minister's who've been in the Congress
UPA regime who have not been from the
Gandhi family wasn't from the party
exactly look but Sonia Gandhi didn't
become the Prime Minister when she had
the opportunity she sacrificed her
position for for informant but ameesha
and the razor Modi come from very super
families audiences that's aspirational
and that's what the film encapsulated by
drowning the voice of the Opposition she
say
there's an e-minor no no no let us say
mother why is Amit Shah not an elected
president of the party why is he not
free and fair elections in the BJP we
have no problems talking about it in the
cabinet with other voices in the loose
I'm just saying that there is no
democratic you know structure of or
anything of that sort in in the BJP
first of all then you see Modi ji
everybody talks about him how he tries
to be like a Hitler around the Empire
party
everybody knows look at the EC look at
look at it look at all these the
Constitution look at the judges who came
out and said against the Congress
contrarian voices in the BJP abuse those
who have a different point of view are
being shafted from acknowledge that
charge I am disappointed with my own
industry I am disappointed why you
despise of my industry that I have loved
respected admired worked with I am
disappointed with seniors of my industry
who instead of standing up for a film no
matter what its political representation
we need to stand up together and
tomorrow
that is praising the Durga
that Indira Gandhi was called and maybe
wearing Bangladesh war and people turned
around and hey now I didn't talk when
you were talk okay come on don't be
uncool tomorrow if somebody makes a film
about Indira Gandhi being Durga the way
she handled Bangladesh and from Ganga
Korea the transformation booga it's a
great story I'd love to see that film
and if somebody from the BJP the right
the left the center whatever wing
turnarounds they shot the film down I'll
be the first person to shut it down
throwing allegations without proof tell
me something if you are making a film
that's aspirational okay forget me I'm a
small filmmaker it's a small film PM
Narendra Modi is a film is a small film
let's talk about a film that Gandhi made
by Attenborough multiple Academy
award-winning film I'll give you critics
of that film also who say no no it's not
an accurate depiction of Gandhi you the
man you've made this out of him because
I'm sure he's a baby
how can you tell me when to release the
film yeah you are in the kingdom anymore
this is a new Indian democracy
kanakam telugu kanchana silicon this is
a very filmy line when is it is it a sin
- awesome
yeah I know so am I so am i and I've
done so I'm just I'm just telling you
one thing that it is not a sin to belong
to a family Rahu D is most humble he
doesn't get the slacker suit
he doesn't wear he doesn't do all those
kind of things what do you talk
everybody saw the suits right everybody
saw a movie written all over it is so
self-obsessed about himself
watch IVA at TK shyvana's life is not a
sin no every Chive Anna's very
respectable but if he calls himself
every choice for what he does Amari
chalky Dario gotta marry building kebab
will choke either let's go Hussein who
say we Putrajaya
but he tries to go into an election mode
and tries to say his sorry chalky daro
for a new tie what is he trying to do he
calls himself a jockey done and then he
doesn't want to be accountable about a
Niro movie running away about the Mayhew
chokes in running away about the vijay
mallya running away about abscond all
these people he doesn't want to be
accountable to anything what sort of a
talkie that is he okay in the end who's
better for Bollywood Prime Minister Modi
around Gandhi I think the progressively
that this government has shown to help
with Bollywood and the way Bollywood has
gone out there and like how Atma says
there are a lot of people pointing
fingers there's also a lot of people
pointing selfies at the Prime Minister
right taking pictures with him and that
basically shows that he is very popular
in Bollywood
you know people I didn't see the camera
shaking oh my god
somebody who oh my god singer dialog is
sounding like a screen of a bad film he
didn't hurt the officer Cal Julian hit
me with mine fear right now it's not a
question of who's better for Bollywood
is a question of who's better for the
common man who's better for the country
is better for the country because
yesterday forever something important
about is what we okay you've heard from
Vivek Oberoi you heard from Nagma as
always in India today I don't tell you
what to think we don't tell you who won

Arun Jaitley has lashed out at those who
has questioned his remarks which has
falled veterans like es with a part of
the kukri to create gang Arun Jaitley
has now put out a tweet but if I just
read out that tweet there and I quote
left it in general Diaz would have
submitted his report with the Congress
president on 31st of March had any of
the objected suggestions on national
security being suggested in the Buddha
report it appears that the committee was
only for optics so Arun Jaitley there
slamming the Congress manifesto on
national security but to that tweet we
also have a letter in general DS Hooda
who has responded to our own Jaitley's
attack in fact laughter in general
Buddha has responded saying and I quote
wait for that report to come out in

Ideas it's it's a lie

Jaitley heading out to act you know
those who were behind drafting the
report with a swipe being taken at left
and general ideas Hooda wenyan yesterday
when I wrote Jaitley address the press
conference on the goal this manifesto
basically said that it appears that some
very dangerous and frightening ideas
have been incorporated into that
manifest obviously in reference to the
Congress was promised that it would be
reviewing a spa in German which means
it's brought to power now he said of
course that it appears that the Congress
president chief of the Congress
principle is that you think to have you
know the drafting committee himself you
know taking a lot of suggestions from
this to create to create class a gang
who are friends of the college president
obviously he received a lot of flak for
the same because leptin and general
giacinta is quite a decorated officer
and his contribution energy on Kashmir
is very well known so many questions
whether mr. Cheney was referring to the
French energy who doesn't agree to the
Ganges well so in response to the same
what is a key advantage if the draft
report that mr. khuda the trusted energy
is set up

the submitted only the 31st of March and
the benefactor without printing
published and you know unveiled a for
the public on the 2nd of April already

finally know if the much-touted Congress
up alliance is happening or not in Delhi
Congress president Rahul Gandhi chaired
a meeting over the proposed alliance
with former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila
Dikshit and Congress heavyweight PC
chucko this morning but the entire
exercise is still shrouded in mystery as
the Congress remains completely
tight-lipped the meeting comes in just a
day after op chief and Delhi Chief
Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that there
will be no Armani party in Congress
Alliance the 2019 Kejriwal claimed that
Rahul Gandhi has refused to tie-up with
the aam aadmi party remember seat
sharing in Delhi has been a flashpoint
between up and the Congress for very
long now up wants to contest on five
seats in Delhi giving just two to the
Congress
so today of course Congress president
Rahul Gandhi has chaired a very key and
crucial meeting on a possible time
between the Congress and the aam aadmi
party in Delhi for the Lok Sabha
elections
details on that meeting and the final
decision is still awaited yesterday
speaking to journalists in
Vishakhapatnam where Arvind Kejriwal was
in fact addressing a rally a day ahead
on Sunday he said that there is
absolutely no possibility my colleague
Milan Sharma is on the phone line with
me right now
millon is there going to be an alliance
or not
well follow me are the possibilities of
alliances between the Armada party in
the Congress have been thwarted and for
now we can say that the last meeting
that happened between Delhi Congress
chief see Sheila Dikshit as well as
Rahul Gandhi where PC choco and kc
venugopal were also present
they had allied their fears to or Al
Gandhi and said that the alliance would
not be able to take the Congress unit of
Delhi forward so currently what we know
from the party sources is that Rahul
Gandhi has not agreed to an alliance
this is a sentiment that as you rightly
pointed out Delhi Chief Minister Arvind
Kejriwal has also been reiterating for
many days now and today the meeting that
was called at our G's residence what
sources have told us was for the
manifesto and that there were certain
points that needed to be discussed or
which Sheila Dikshit for the manifesto
that is why you saw only Sheila Dikshit
and PC choco were called for this
particular meeting at Rahul Gandhi's
residence at Douglas Road and after this
also are they are expressed the party in
Delhi has expressed that it's delaying
the fact that they want to field our
candidates from all seven seats in Delhi
or for the Lok Sabha election so these
were the core points that they needed to
discuss with Rahul Gandhi in this
particular meeting today palmy right

has dismissed the public interest
litigation seeking a stay on the release
of a biopic on Prime Minister Narendra
Modi till election 2019 results I
quickly want to cut across to India
today's initial matter for the latest on
the story
Anisha who filed the PIL what was the
plea what did the court say well this
petition has been tried been fiber for
the Delhi High Court claiming that the
movie should not be released because it
is effectively going to be affecting the
campaign that is going on election
campaign for the upcoming elections
however the Delhi High Court has
dismissed the petition but we need to
remember that even the Election
Commission has moved losses producers
and filmmakers in this case and under
this seminal case is also pending in the
Inaba and high pot so multiple of the
cases have been filed against this
particular movie which is the biopic of
Narendra Modi claiming that it is a
promotional event it is a promotion of a
particular political leader which cannot
be done on under the model for the son
conduct this movie should not be the
means however the Delhi High Court
noting the fact that the TV SP has given
clearance to the son has refused to
interfere in this particular manner but
okay now the filmmakers had gone and met
Election Commission officials they
called it freedom of expression there's
been a reaction even from Union Finance
Minister Arun Jaitley earlier on this
the filmmakers insists that this is this
is not promotion of Prime Minister
Narendra Modi with an eye on elections
isn't that Anisha well that is the
standard the filmmakers have shaken this
is not supposed to be promotional so far
but I'm Lorena McGinnis is a freedom of
expression that Bollywood has the option
of making of film on anything any
political side or on any public forum
backing what they sold the next
information as well
I know considering the fact that the CBS
is a centrist in Central Board of Film
certification has
even clear and super to leave of this
movie the High Court also declined to
interfere in this issue but remember the
film had created a political storm with
a lot of opposition parties as well as
other person saying that they're leaving
a movie like this right now - the model
for the contact because it was only
talking about and praising the trial
order refers to things I'm Alistair and
in the election season the reliever such
a movie it would be seeing as
influencing the public via a definitive
however with the force currently
refusing to register the course
currently declined to interfere we'll
have to keep what the election on this
human has to say about ok the Allahabad
High Court meanwhile and Anisha have
they they adjourned the hearing of did
they give grounds for adjournment
well multiple methods like this issue
has been brought up both in the Delhi
High Court and the Nagas high posture I
just right now but there are they will
be appearing on this issue
today the Delhi High Court which had the
trying to hear this particular matter
the Lama I quote had on Friday adjourned
till next week till this week hearing on
this plea seeking a state a bench that
comprised such two speakers Miguel and
Pankaj Katya had adjourned the hearing
the petitioners contention was that
release of the film during elections
would influence voters and a violation
of the model code of conduct
incidentally this movie is now slated to
be released in another four days from
now on the 5th of April just six days
before the first phase of Lok Sabha

wZz-uUXvGoA,Karnataka I-T Raids: Political Vendetta Or Crackdown On Corruption? | The Burning Question,"After the Income Tax department allegedly raided the residences of 24 PWD officials and ministers, the Karnataka CM has hit out ...",2019-03-29T06:36:36Z,India Today,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wZz-uUXvGoA/hqdefault.jpg,"well you can catch the entire interview
with MK Stalin the DMK president at 10
o'clock but moving on now and speaking
of those raids that have been going on
day after protests raged on in Karnataka
over the income tax rates police over
the IT raids have politics rather has
exploded while the JD s has slammed the
crackdown with the Karnataka Chief
Minister HT Kumaraswamy crank political
vendetta by the centre the party supremo
HDD recorder has levelled poor Qing
the BJP saying rates conducted because
the Chief Minister had refused the BJP
offer BJP meanwhile has slammed the
protests by the ruling coalition calling
it undemocratic and unacceptable this
even as the IT department in a statement
claimed that no MP MLA or Minister was
covered during the searches the income
tax officials had launched a large-scale
search co-operation against multiple
people who are linked to the ruling JD s
and the Congress on Thursday
why if they were not taken the
assistance of State Police why they
bring CRPF here to investigate saying
that is background for the Prescott
which was released by the direct office
I know it's a background how he is
working on which direction with whom
direction is doing its job I know that
they'll try to persuade commercially to
form the government with the support of
the birthday gender party before
election they also extend
want to exchange huge money for the
expenditure of the JD's with all this
temptation Kumar Sami refused to budge
an inch
before election after election to go
with parties in the party I am making
this statement its responsibility how
things were in town so that brings us to
our burning questions the income tax
rates are they politically motivated or
simply a crack on corruption the second
question is the timing of these income
tax rates which is also suspicious it's
happening just before the elections why
is the Congress JDS of paranoid if there
is nothing for them to hide and why was
the CRPF deployed during the IT rates in
Karnataka was the BJP trying to poach
Kumaraswamy like they've got a claim so
those are some of the questions that I'm
going to put across to my guest China NC
from the BJP and Rahul srivasa for
national affairs editor China this is a
startling claim made by the former prime
in the stage to David gora he says that
the raids are a fallout of failed talks
between the BJP and mr. HD Kumaraswamy
he claims that the BJP had been
persuading HD Kumaraswamy to form the
government and therefore when he refused
when he refused to fallen for that
temptation this raids are the result of
the same how do you respond
firstly I don't understand why the BJP
should be blamed for being behind a
particular rail now this is not the
first time that you have had a rate in
the country and legitimately so you have
independent agencies whether it is
sometimes the Election Commission that
you target sometimes the income tax
authorities are we here for one minute
suggesting that the sign of insecurity
expressed by mr. kumara Swamy and the
Congress party in Bengaluru is
correlated to the election I think it
would be a very low-grade commentary on
the democracy and on our country
please understand that just day before
or yesterday there was a read in chat
this card of one of our senior leaders
family member is that suggesting that
the BJP is behind a BJP leader being
targeted absolutely not
there are investigative systems in our
country and thank God for that that they
work in a free and fair way and you have
no kind of manipulation and there this
kind of insecurity suggest that there is
nothing I Congress and it is it is the
BJP in security they are the ones who
are rotting in fact they say that
whenever election is nearing it's at the
behest of the central government that
the BJP unleashes central agencies to
harass to defame to intimidate political
opponents
well I have something else to say if the
raid proves that there is no wrongdoing
what are they worried about why this
cover-up why this hullabaloo why
protests I mean if there has been a rail
in Chhattisgarh as I cited an example of
one of our tour leaders family members
and we have not for one minute
interfered and said let law take its
course
let the income tax department do what
they want if you have a case of an
independent agency like the CBI or the
Election Commission doing something even
there the opposition makes it out to be
as if this is about timing and this is
wrongdoing so I only want to say if the
IT records have nothing to hide
are they worried about why this is a
routine procedure they have nothing to
do with it it's it's at the behest of
decision taken by the income tax Lutz
none of the members of the Congress and
the JD s was touched this is a routine
affair offices of the PWD Department in
fact were raided how do you respond I
think it's hilarious that the BJP wants
to hide behind technicalities and
formality while everybody knows this is
nothing more than open political
vendetta let us talk about what happened
during the Gujarat Rajasthan by election
and you saw what happened to mr. de
queijo Kumar that was in 2017 but the
charge sheet was filed when please ask
the BJP they did it during the 2018
karnataka election and then let me
remind everybody that then mr. Yadav
powers have openly making a you know
offers of inducement of crawls and
crawls through the Congress and the JD s
there was a letter and a representation
made to the Election Commission and the
IT department saying please prove by
this money's coming up um what happened
to that what happened to you rapper's
diary and what happened to any sort of
throw the government cannot stand behind
the sort of these are independent
institutions because everybody knows the
sort of um you know the denigration of
institutional integrity that has
happened under the BJP government okay
JD s and the Congress coalition very
firmly has
that and let me clear this this is not
about whether there is something or not
this is a perception battle when they
raided mr. de queijo Kumar he came out
and said please look at the punch nama
the punch nama tells you that everything
is in order
but the BJP went to town saying he's
been graded they're so much money and
you know how the media spends it you
know you know let's respectable how do
you respond to what Aishwarya is saying
and it's not just the Congress in fact
even the BSP the SP they have repeatedly
accused the BJP of misusing central
agencies to target political opponents
and therefore they say that the
credibility of the central agencies
today stand compromised there is no
manipulation of no agency and if the
Congress and the Jas are protect throws
protesting they have reason to show
their insecurity on the streets maybe
they should go back home and see what
they've done wrong and why's the income
tax going for this kind of a raid do
understand that if nobody is spared in
this country for wrongdoing money
transactions and this is not about
election timings what rubbish if this is
not about elections why is it that every
day that the bgp decides to mount of
each want against then someone else the
fact of the matter is it's not for
motifs found or not our politicians here
can go out and declare right because we
have their affidavit they filed a writ
on ITA respect even if you find nothing
the fact that ideas have happened
he's a huge perception battle point for
the BJP they can say oh they had ideas
what happened with sinlessness a number
um he clarified the same mr. veerbhadra
cygnus the DK show come on mr. CS
petraju
you have the BSP NS okay and even the
TMC all political parties that do not
fall in line with the BJP seem to be the
only one being pro what about the other
party folks about your allies it's not
like you know that you are you
holier-than-thou and you let China
respond now China go ahead and that's
fine
Romancing son-in-law was raided - look I
was not going to get into personal names
here but mr. Ramon Singh's son-in-law
has also been raided we have not gone
out and said that this is political
vendetta this is about independent
agencies doing what they feel is in
accordance with lies now stashed in the
homes of Congress and radius leaders at
the time of Elections it needs to be
exposed if the Election Commission has
got close to 6100 cross seized we need
to bring this up gone are the days of
malpractice gone are the days of corrupt
waste during elections and do I
understand it's the Election Commission
or the income tax all right yeah
national affairs air talk in accordance
hearing China and an Aishwarya both the
sides of the BJP in the Congress you
know there was a time when anand sharma
and couple simple said that governments
do not have any permits in fact he was
heading out at the BJP they have said
that the timing of these raids are
suspect a big revelation being made by
HT they recorder once again be a seeing
rahul that this raid politics taking
center stage and these raids happening
just before elections which gives you no
an opportunity to the opposition to
attack the government accusing them of
misusing central agencies
I want to go it's it's perhaps the best
kept secret in this country that during
election time money a money moves ground
from one point A to point B and a large
amount of money much beyond the 70 watt
lakh which somebody a candidate can
spend in his constituency for his
election for Lok Sabha is spent during
elections now let's go to the facts
which are available today
Sybilla Tory top sources have told me
that the raids are largely against
certain contractors and engineers to be
specific 13 contractors and four
engineers have been raided in this now
what has been found as a malpractice in
the PWD Department the PWD Department
officials were forwarding advances on
projects way beyond what to a sanctioned
largely the money was being sanctioned
way beyond the cleared amount say 10
percent was sanctioned 40 percent was
being given to contract and bribes and
other cash was taken from those
contractors now definitely this is
happening as a fact but there is a
political attempt behind it that the
money which is taken by contractors is
going to political parties just before
the Karnataka elections last time around
there were raids in Andhra Pradesh and
Telangana where contractors were
diverting money from there in to
Karnataka elections this time around
also there is a political angle to this
because the money was going into
elections and that is why definitely
there will be a hue and cry over the
timing and perhaps from the recipients
of the money which was being diverted
from the from the bride's but that still
has to be established Aishwarya and as
Rahul Shrivastav was putting out more
facts about the raids
it's the contractors and the engineers
errant contractors and the end engineers
who have been accused of taking bribes
all of that investigation will have to
happen while the JDS and the Congress
making so much noise we have absolutely
no problem with you conducting leads
we're seeing when you read either people
associated or leaders and
not what you do more than anything is
that you convicted even before their
trial the fact is this is a media
battery you realize this is a child
before media and the public and during
elections if there is wrongdoing we will
concede if there is wrongdoing we will
take action why not the BJP they're very
responsible when it comes to the way
that we deal with for our politicians
and he will do that but what you are
doing here is you're perpetuating this
idea of some wrongdoing on the
politicians path or his family's part
when it being blasted in the media and
we don't know what is fact what is
fiction and we're seeing when you're
proving us why is it that even though
we've given you a finish corner of the
KPCC president has written to the EC and
the IC talking about mr. Yeddyurappa
and the diary and this is happen photons
what about the ready brothers read
anybody you want when you believe there
is suspicion of any wrongdoing but we're
saying this is not something that is
impartial all right absolutely
politically motivated and why aren't you
doing it to the BJP don't give me one
example of somebody son-in-law
and it's mr. Raman Singh and if you want
to get into the nuances of it you
realize the jelly and now move on to the
mouth which is why and that's the
perception China at least that's what's
being raised by the opposition and some
of your earlier allies your former
allies who claim that everybody who has
a fallout with the BJP or everyone who
decides to leave the BJP or anyone who's
not part of the government is corrupted
and and it is corrupted and and are
tainted while everyone else in the BJP
except that one example that you
mentioned about Chhattisgarh are above
are all clean have a very clear image
and everything is fine so that is really
something that's being spoken about
umpteen number of times in the past by
the opposition that how can it be that
everyone else was not associated with
the party in the government is tainted
has a corrupt profile and everyone else
in the government are absolutely clean
with a spick-and-span image
well I don't buy that logic at all I
just feel that independent agency should
be allowed to work in accordance with
law and based on evidence you and me are
not going to decide if somebody is
innocent or guilty if there is money
procured and if there is evidence to
suggest that this is disproportionate to
their income or some fraudulent sauce or
some kind of political insulation that
needs to be exposed please let's not get
into trying to meddle with the ways of
the Election Commission all the ways of
the income tax or for that matter even
the Central Bureau of Investigation we
need to understand that there is ZERO
tolerance to corruption as far as the
BJP is concerned under Prime Minister
Modi and if we take some tough stances
which are probably not popular with
people who have been manipulating the
system and using influence whether it's
mr. Shiv Kumar or many others I don't
want to get into that kind of commentary
because I believe that that independence
should be allowed to the agency to probe
and not for you and me to sit on
judgment and as I said if they have
nothing to hide what is the big hue and
cry why this big protest and agitation
but you know Rahul do you foresee the
great politics intensifying because this
is not just a claim that has been made
by the Congress it's been said by Maya
thee--by Akhilesh Yadav now you've had
two alliances also which has happened
which just might you know complicate
matters and the big question that arises
is that if this was a normal routine
affair by the income tax department to
check errant officials in the PWD
Department to check for corrupt
contractors and engineers why was the
CRPF then deployed during the income tax
rates
I think that's a very good question
because we have specific knowledge that
income tax officials have told us that
in at least three raids three states
over the last few months the local
police has refused to provide police
protection local police protection to
the police force / to the income tax
department when they are going inside
info raids and we saw that there was a
fracas even in Kolkata over a very
similar issue though it was a different
agency but the fact remains in this
there is a political angle to it
the timing is largely because of the
politics it's election time this is when
the money turns this is when the money
moves and that is why income tax
department is not the income tax
department of 1950s it is keeping
because money trail now is more it's
easier to keep tabs on and that is why
raids will happen but definitely there
is one point which the opposition can
raise is that is it moving only for the
opposition the point is that money moves
for everybody in this in election period
last time around as I said EC alone had
some seizures what some hundred odd
crores in in Karnataka another hundred
or Scrolls is a whopping amount because
even if it means that ten percent of it
was seized you had some thousand crore
illegal money floating around in
elections right what's our bought
inducements are provided and that is why
this action is necessary I think it
every political party has misused
agencies in this country and that is why
this fear and this apprehension but I
think got correctly there is a political
angle to it the tap on K legal cash is
being turned and that is where the UN
cried

Shatrughan Sinha he has been meeting
supporters at the Congress headquarters
before the big announcement he is
expected to join the Congress and there
is Shatrughan Sinha all smiles pooja
shali my colleague joins us for more on
this pooja so what are you hearing now
Shatrughan Sinha alright I'll go back to
pooja in just a bit we haven't really
got connected to our correspondent but
yes
Shatrughan Sinha being denied a ticket
this time around BJP in-house critic who
has been very very vocal about his his
disagreements with the BJP leadership
and the latest one him expressing the
special with LK Advani being a denied a
ticket he in fact said that was in poor
taste and Shatrughan Sinha meeting with
the Congress party workers ahead of that
big announcement all right now pooja
shali is joining us she is outside the
Congress headquarters pooja over to you
tell us what's happening Shatrughan
Sinha who own multiple equation multiple
occasions has expressed his unhappiness
with the Prime Minister and the BJP
leadership today might be part of a new
party altogether well it is very
surprising and you know we've just been
now told by our sources in the Congress
party that the press conference that was
scheduled at about 12:30 to 1:00 p.m.
for official announcement of Illustrated
actor a Shatrughan Sinha dad has now
been delayed and if sources are to be
believed even cancelled because delayed
could mean that we may have a press
conference later but now we are being
told there is a press briefing at 1:00
p.m. where a senior leader of the party
Randeep Surjewala will address but it's
on a different issue when I asked some
of the leaders when will chatter against
inner join they clearly have no answers
for now so something has definitely gone
wrong it seems now remember party is not
alone fighting these elections it's also
in Bihar in an alliance with other
parties including the our jury and
therefore it will have to be a
collective decision not as much for
shatru consider joining but where will
this two-term MP from Patna Sahib now
contest from when he joins the Congress
party and that is why it see
there could be some issue of clarity on
ticket that has not come so we would
like to wait for an official
announcement from the Congress party but
we have now been told at least the
briefing that was scheduled for
Shatrughan Sinha has now been delayed
now Avantika at some level it does show
the Congress party in a poor light
because this is a painted space
it's a rebel BJP leader yes what
precisely could go wrong for him to join
the party very interesting what's the
space closely I'll come back to you in
just a bit for now thanks so much for
joining us the Prime Minister meanwhile
has already reached merit he has hit the
campaign trail and he is going to begin
his journey from Meerut like he did in
2014 the prime minister in Meritor he's
going to be traveling from merit to the
other places as well and finally he's
going to be in Jammu in a canoe district
where he will be addressing a massive
rally so there's the Prime Minister the
shots coming out right now and one can
expect some important not really
announcements because that would be
violation of the model code of conduct
but everyone is excited to hear the
Prime Minister as he hits the campaign
trail he's going to begin now his active
election campaigning BJP star campaigner
who's right now in merit will be
addressing a rally and merit in north or
pradesh then he's go also going to be
headed to autre khan where he's going to
be addressing a rally in ruth rapport
and finally he ends the day by
addressing a rally in Jammu Melon Sharma
is joining us for more on this millon
all of these three seats that I
mentioned will be going to pose in the
first phase on the 11th of April and
everyone had been waiting for the prime
minister to kick-start his campaign
trail and finally he begins active
election campaigning from Meerut well
certainly Avantika this is going to
start the prime minister of the star
campaigner for the BJP their rally that
will begin from Mirror today and it's
going to be an action-packed day for the
prime minister as well because he's
going to address a rally in Meerut and
from there he will be moving towards
Luther poo which is in Uttarakhand and
further on he will be traveling all the
way to Jammu in a queue
well remember these three places will be
going to falls in the first phase on
April 11th and what is expected from the
Prime Minister's address is that he
would be speaking on issues and the
campaign that the BJP has been running
me going to be speaking on national
security and in merit especially he
would also be addressing issues of the
farmer and that happens to be our
crucial area in Asia
absolutely antiag he my colleague is
also joining us a nun kid the BJP would
have been eagerly awaiting for their
party's star campaigner to begin his
election a campaign because in the past
we have seen how the party has literally
banked on the Prime Minister's
oratorical skills on his charisma which
has in fact to also swing votes in the
party's favor you know I think it's the
same situation this time as well
Avantika there is no change when it
comes to the BJP it is the Prime
Minister and despite having you know a
sea of stars as for the BJP is concerned
there is no match to the Prime
Minister's popularity and they would be
once again hoping that it is Prime
Minister Narendra Modi thanks for

P-6gs8kSzOU,4 Terror Camps Shut Down In PoK Fearing Retaliation By Indian Army,KashmirTerror #Pakistan Subscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so ...,2019-03-28T07:40:41Z,India Today,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P-6gs8kSzOU/hqdefault.jpg,"for terror camps in Pakistan Occupied
Kashmir have been shut down fearing
retaliation by the Indian Army amid the
increased skirmishes between the Indian
and Pakistani forces an alert has been
issued for terror groups shutting down
their terror camps in Pakistan Occupied
Kashmir this is the latest which is
coming in from our sources in the
Ministry of Defence and the Indian Army
so Pakistan now asking Tara groups to be
a to in fact be cautious and have asked
them at least the Tara camps which are
in the vicinity of the line of control
and in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir to be
shut down so that Indian they go beyond
Indian Army's reach
[Music]
let me shake Butler my colleague now
joins me for more on this story Abhishek
clearly Pakistan expecting more action
as well as the there is group are
concerned because they are not doing
anything clearly yes I get in fact over
the last few days when skirmishes along
the line of control have intensified
anti-terror operations within the
Kashmir Valley have also increased in
fact even today there is an operation
there are two operations going on and at
this amid all this escalation
since the Palama attack Pakistan has in
fact alertly terror groups along the LOC
and in fact what we've learnt is that
four of instead of terror camps have
been shut down and copies were being run
by just one by lashkar-e-taiba and one
by Shia team there is also chatter that
intelligence agencies have picked up
that terrorist groups have been told not
to roam around the LOC or no two-way
army fatigues that they usually do so
clearly there is some kind of panic as
far as Pakistan is concerned during a
huge retaliation by an abhishek this
also comes out a day when Pakistan has
completely refused to even acknowledge
the proof that India is given on the in
the dossier to Pakistan on the Pilbara
attack it seems that there is no other
option left now but to read out these
terrorists and these camps by the Indian
sirens own yes the way Pakistan has
responded to Indian
those fears regarding the Obama attack
and you know the complicity of gesture
mamas and how terror camps in Pakistan
were training terrorists to carry out
attacks like in Peru amma also pushing
terrorists through the line of control
trying to make sure that they can
infiltrate into Kashmir and carry out
attacks on security forces clearly shows
that Pakistan is not very squat and the
way ceasefire violations are increases
over the last few days it clearly shows
that things have still not be escalated
since pala food even though there is a
perception that the matter higher he
escalated to to a large extent
but as far as the activities on the line
of control effect on it will remain 10

underneath that the verdict was based on
a very biased observation not only that
universities in the hall he also lashed
out at India over its capability to take
your waters because he was talking about
you know their chains next to anyone
that didn't crash you think that their
condition is much worse than what
Pakistan has and not only that is also
said that some Zuppa accelerated parties
for Pakistan because they were partisan
imagine we had died in that attack and
that is why Pakistan is definitely going
to consider taking the view for head to
the in fact for this problem
all right we leave it at that Tom's our

story about the massive accomplishment
by India the Prime Minister talking
about mission Shakthi and India also
registering itself as a superpower
entering the elite club in fact one only
has seen countries like China US and
Russia with this big accomplishment that
has been achieved in the past and also
the Prime Minister talking about the
anti-satellite weapon is had
successfully targeting a life satellite
as well am guru go straight across now
to India today Sandeep or Nathan and
Sandeep you know there's been a lot of
talk about military powers and how space
is becoming the next battleground god of
with me here was talking about China
Russia and the United States taking all
state steps to secure themselves and you
have India now entering into the elite
club by entering into the league of
these nations by having its own mission
Shakti which has been a resounding
success yes of Antigua and the choice of
the title is very interesting because as
you know in 1974 when India announced
that it had to clear weapons the T
conducted what was called a new peaceful
nuclear explosion the name of the test
was called Shakti and today also the
name of this and this at like the test
is being called it's been called Shakti
now the fact is that India has had an
anti-satellite capability for some years
now we know for a fact that at least in
since 2012 India has had the ability to
track and destroy satellites in orbit
and this comes from a very interesting
program run by the DRDO called the
anti-ballistic missile program and
during which time they acquired a lot of
long range radars from Israel and
developed our own missiles to track
ballistic missiles which has you know
coming from outer space as in like they
take a trajectory going out into space
and coming back in bringing dr. V kisara
swath with he joins us from DRDO he
joins us from the broadcast some many
many congratulations this was something
you were talking about in 2000
well it has finally happened dr.
Saraswat yeah thank you very much
and III would like to take made use of
this platform and congratulate my team
of the early scientists who will achieve
this wonderful milestone by intercepting
a satellite in the low Earth orbit and
with a Dalek ship and showing that we
have the today's capabilities fall
taking it to the right attitude with the
right velocity with the right precision
to make sure that we can destroy a
satellite in the orbit this is one of
the greatest achievement what the nation
can have we are now number four as far
as the world is concerned we have the
deterrence capability and our
adversaries we now have not dared to do
anything with our space objects
absolutely dr. Saraswathi in 2012 when
Agni 5 was being tested that's the time
where you know when we had spoken to you
you had indicated that we have we can do
this did we have the capability then or
was it developed post 2012 launch of
magnify do you recall when we had the
discussions on the capability of 45 and
it I had mentioned that we had the
building blocks for doing the ante
satellite operation yes because by the
time we had acquired that John based
long range radars which were already
doing the tracking of the satellites in
the orbit we had the propulsive power in
the form of what my father and other
missiles which were able to go to those
altitudes and those you know velocities
and we had the precision guidance system
which with the help of a infrared
satellite infrared seeker into the right
zone of interception
now all these building blocks were
existing and these have been now
integrated by our scientists in a big
way and with you know kind of push from
the government I think it has been
possible it's only through the major
decisions which this government has been
able to take that we have taken this
very very advanced adventurous
you know move and the monster changes
capability to the world it indeed is
huge doctor satisfied I have to take a
quick break at this stage but my request

QXRo8xLQyMA,"AAP-Congress Alliance Likely To Take Place In Delhi | No Tie-Up In Haryana, Punjab",AAP-Congress alliance likely to happen soon. Congress conducts phone survey with the party workers on AAP alliance.,2019-03-26T12:12:54Z,India Today,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QXRo8xLQyMA/hqdefault.jpg,"[Music]
almost a month before the capital goes
to polls the Congress has reportedly
given the green signal for Alliance for
the aam aadmi party sources have told
India today that the Congress president
Rahul Gandhi might soon decide on
representatives for further
deliberations on the seat sharing
formula and if both the parties agreed
then an alliance could be announced this
week itself India today has accessed all
the inside details of the aam aadmi
party congress seat sharing talks
wherein both the parties are bargaining
hard sources say aam aadmi party wants
five seats for itself
leaving aside to say feed one more seat
if the Congress gives it two seats each
in Punjab and Haryana Congress however
wants three seats out of Delhi seven and
isn't really ready for any alliance in
Punjab however it can give one to two
seats to aam aadmi party in Haryana
[Music]
something the final decision will be
taken today we had discussions with the
Congress percent senior leaders of Delhi
in my presence and the discussion is
over and the as today's meeting left
that final decision recorders
participant Congress presently will take
a decision today and then it will be
communicated to us we are waiting for
that okay let's go straight across now
to millon Sharma and on kaitiaki million
coming to you first now what are the
inside details what are you hearing
about the from the Congress party and on
the free speech sharing in Delhi if they
are given to Singh is not in agreement
with is not willing to any seat sharing
with the party even the leadership in
Haryana this point of time is not
willing to share seats with the aam
aadmi party so the two seats that they
need in Haryana as well as stuck to it
and they will only if so on Kate even
before an alliance can be announced it
seems that the seed sharing talks could
hit a speed breaker because Sheila
Dikshit had very confidently declared
that the Congress party I go to contest
on all of the seven Lok Sabha seats she
completely ruled out an alliance with
the aam aadmi party so much
has changed both parties going back and
forth what are you hearing from your
sources one is expecting the Congress
also to to really drive a hard bargain
with the amethy party well there has to
be some basis to whatever both these
parties want and the kind of formula
that they will agree on I can tell you
with a certain degree of confidence
Avantika that there has been a green
signal from the top Congress brass as
far as the Alliance is concerned now the
only hitches the seed sharing formula if
they agree on this formula by the end of
this week this will abate a formal
announcement between the Amida party and
the Congress late last night till late
last night I was in touch with the few
senior sources of both the parties and
they said that today at least the talks
on the lines will begin now as millon
was also pointing out and we have put it
out for our viewers as well see Sheila
Dikshit what she wanted JP Agrabah there
are two reasons to that Sheila Dikshit
son is all the candidate for the
Congress party or it was expecting a
ticket from the Congress party from
easterly that seat in this alliance most
likely is going to the aam aadmi party
so he's going to lose JP Aggarwal wanted
to contest from northeast constituency
of Delhi that most likely is going to
develop one day of the aam aadmi party
that is why both of them are maybe
meanwhile RJ McCann feels that he will
his chances of getting elected from New
Delhi will will in fact get a jump if
our McGhee party also comes together
because then there will be no division
of the votes between the anti-bjp voter
now this is exactly what the aam aadmi
party in Congress are working on at this
point of time I have been told by senior
sources that there is the Congress party
already willing to accommodate the aam
aadmi party in Haryana Punjab remains to
be the hitch but at this point of time
both the parties will try and gain the
maximum among the parties you know logic
is that they have for sitting mla's in
Punjab and the both the aam aadmi party
and of course so the Congress doesn't
have any ml MP in Delhi but a Magna
party at this point of time is in a
better position to take on the BJP when
it comes in comparison with the Congress
party and that is why they want to drive
this bar gain of five to if they don't
get anything in punjab and haryana what
i am being told is that most likely
there will be
climb down from both the sides this five
to four three is only the best-case
scenario which has been put forward okay
on both the sides by the end of the date
today we'll get more clarity on this all
right keep a close watch with the
developments really moving faster on
this front I'm Kate and villain thank

gRTwcqrRHaw,"After Delhi Congress Rift, Rahul Gandhi To Take Final Call On AAP Alliance",Rahul Gandhi will chair an important Congress meeting with the Delhi unit to decide an alliance with the AAP after infighting ...,2019-03-25T05:15:00Z,India Today,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gRTwcqrRHaw/hqdefault.jpg,"now the Congress remember still
struggling with its alliances the
Congress president Rahul Gandhi has
called a meeting of the Delhi Congress
leaders at 10:00 a.m. the Delhi Congress
chief Sheila Dikshit PC chaco is in
charge of the state and other senior
leaders will participate in this meeting
Congress Delhi's unit still is against
the alliance of the aam aadmi party PC
choco had done a hole in campaign
apparently at the behest of Rahul Gandhi
this was a survey which was conducted by
the Congress party for its workers in
which they were asked whether they
should join the alliance with the aam
aadmi party finally after a lot of delay
we are hoping that a final decision will
be made in this regard
remember the aam aadmi party already
after asking waiting leaving and
everything else in between has now
announced all seven candidates and the
Chief Minister of Delhi and a larger
party chief Arvind Kejriwal has already
started campaigning in the national
capital for the seven seats of jelly the
gadna party is extremely miffed with the
fact that the BJP so the Congress so far
has been unable to in fact get the whole
act together when it comes to the
alliance formation with the aam aadmi
party in Delhi much missing my colleague
moushmi already a very very late effort
already questions being raised on Rahul
Gandhi himself about how they want to
conduct these collections about the
seriousness of this election are we
going to see a final decision on this
because it has been dragging for a very
long time in Delhi that side of the
reason that I see I would say that this
is going on for a long period of time is
that there is an internal rift in the
Delhi unity and you have on one hand the
working class built and the president
were mentally opposing the alliance and
you have PC choco the in charge of Delhi
Congress not a mark and I think for the
Alliance and that's why one reason we
have to call in campaign
they will be the decider I will not even
see the figures as far as the : campaign
is concerned and the opinion of the
Congress workers on the side but this is
actually very late if you look at the
preparation of the BJP in Delhi even the
aam aadmi party has preached itself as a
as a victim trying to get sympathy from
the fact that the chorus or
dilly-dallying of the b-team of the via
t so really I need to understand what is
the message that our Gandhi actually
wants to give it his Carter in Delhi

in amid speculations of being upset with
the party Japan Prasad the Congress
leader is now again meeting Congress
president Rahul Gandhi sources are
telling India today he has now been
given options chiton Prasad the young
leader of the party has been given an
option to contest Lok Sabha elections
won against Raj not Singh from Lucknow
the party has assured him arad service
seat in case he loses the election
different Prasad has also been given
another option of contesting from
Carrara which he seems to be unwilling
okay let me get an update now from my
colleague Maz missing mas me so clearly
deliberation is on not switching to the
BJP yet but is he going to take one of
these options clearly they're all the
speculation over different switching
sides to the BJP and that would have
been a big draw for the Congress
consider considering the design was a
common face of the party in yupi and now
we do believe that there's been a lot of
persuasion and maneuvering and the
Congress leadership including Priyanka
and scindia have persuaded him to fight
the elections from idle Lucknow or Sita
/ is also an option that has driven not
horror as it is the traditional seat
Reggie thing is to fight but he's saying
that there is a lot of polarization his
neighboring seats have been given to
people who further worsening his
election and that's one reason that he's
ruling out the water option but
apparently the big question is that
Japan is still with the Congress and he
has been persuaded to stay that all
right also must be if I can ask you that
are more deliberations to continue
possibly with jetan Prasad or this could
be the last round you see I am spoken to
people who were close to Jatin and jetan
Prasad the source and my sources say
that Jatin is now ready for whatever the
Congress leadership decides he has
agreed to fight the elections from
wherever the leadership actually
fertilizes his candidature that could be
luck so again sir I was not saying that
good Ishita put or even more era but
behind this entire agreement there is
actually a verbal commitment by the
leadership that they would compensate
him for taking a tough seat which is
majorly considered a BJP seat and
fighting against Rajesh right machine
let's wait and watch what will be the
final decision of this and Prasad and
the Congress party thank you so much for

well situation seems to assumes not very
good hub for jet a base for the last
four to six months as we saw there their
employees were initially supporting the
jet officials they did not say anything
they've not come out in fact they were
not getting salary paid for the last
payment right now looking out for some
bailout process but that doesn't seem to
be happening we saw one of the Saudi
Arabia Airlines was actually looking

seems to be happening there by talks
going on with the nourish world lead jet
airways but detox really did not happen
that they we're going to take the take
to take away this jet airways Ln but now

hitting out at Sam Pitroda saying that
he is helping Pakistan by making such
statements that's the government's first
reaction coming in on Rahul Gandhi's
close aide and his remarks about the
pull vomit error attacks he said that
attack cycle Varma continues to happen
all the time but it was wrong to attack
Pakistan and therefore huge boil coming
out and slamming Sam Pitroda for his
remarks
okay so we are just awaiting now for the
first reaction from the government and
the first one has come in from mr.
Pishko who has denounced these remarks
he in fact I said that it's rather
unfortunate that such remarks are being
made at a time when the armed forces
have been fighting for the nation's
security he says that by making such
remarks and Pitroda
is only helping Pakistan so these are
the words of the Union Minister Mr
Pioche coil in the wake of this new
controversy that has been raked up by
Sam Pitroda who has said that India
shouldn't have attacked Pakistan after

new Kushnick yet oh I see and it's not
just a huge goal the Prime Minister in
fact has hit out at the Congress and Sam
Pitroda in fact the Prime Minister
saying that the most trusted advisor and
guide of the Congress president has now
kick-started Pakistan National Day
celebrations on behalf of the Congress
ironically by demeaning India's Armed
Forces shame loyal courtier of the
Congress's royal dynasty admitting that
the nation already knew that the
Congress was unwilling to respond to the
forces of terror but this is new India
we will answer terrorists in a language
that they understand and with interest
so the Prime Minister now heading out
slamming Sam Pitroda
saying that the most trusted adviser and
the guide of the Congress president
breaking this new controversy starting
Pakistan National Day celebrations on
behalf of the Congress by demeaning the
Indian Armed Forces the Prime Minister
and the BJP
not taking those remarks too lightly in
fact the Prime Minister even say that
India will answer the way it deems best
this is a new India we will answer
terrorists in a language that understand
and with interest a very very strong
response they're coming in from the
Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi to
the remarks that were made by Sam
Pitroda
a close confidant of Congress party
chief Rahul Gandhi in fact he has
criticized the
the Indian Air Force's airstrikes he
said that they were unnecessary and he
also said that he didn't agree with that
approach that was taken and he felt that
it was unnecessary to attack Pakistan
after pull vomit terror attacks very
shocking a remark they're being made by
mr. Sam Pitroda that has invoked a very
strong response now from the BJP and
from the Prime Minister summit Patra the
BJP spokesperson also joins us for more
on the remarks from Rahul Gandhi's close
confidant somebody thank you so much for
speaking to us so Indian Overseas
Congress treats and Pitroda
says these are his personal views he
feels that India shouldn't have gone in
the manner that they did there he feels
that this approach was entirely wrong
and India shouldn't have attacked
Pakistan how do you respond thank you
once again for mostly to remind you of
the fact that families know that is no
small leader he's a torturer of the
Congress party and he is the chief of
the Foreign Affairs of the Congress
party and he's one of the key advisors
or the Congress seat mr. Rahul Gandhi so
whatever he says I would say that comes
out to the horse's mouth it should not
be taken as a personal remark and
remember since he fed before any unit of
the Congress party look at the dichotomy
at one end we have the whole world
standing with the Indian Prime Minister
with India as such when India takes a
tough stand on terrorism while we have
the fungus parties pouring tea at
convincing the world that what India has
done was wrong injure should not have a
fact that there are targets in Pakistan
India should have light load just as
they did in 26/11 and what the Congress
party has tried to do through Sam
Pitroda
is to feelings terror and Pakistan
remember Pakistani dispensation and
terrorism are intertwined as a marriage
to each other so when the Congress e
spokesperson said that well look the
only six to eight people who crossed
borders and came to Mumbai to attack on
26/11 he thought had nothing to do with
it it is something like giving a clean
chit to Pakistan and rightly pointed out
by Indian Prime Minister that this is
new India there is no place for any
terrible losses India is a change India
we are not a substrate anymore
we will protect that with even a new
India that piranha Pakistan is still
getting used to isn't it some big butt
you know about this mixed messaging
what's the BJP stake you know on one
side you have the Congress saying that
they will support security forces in its
end over two and terrorism and then you
have Sam Pitroda who's believed to be a
very close confidant off the beaches of
the Congress president Rahul Gandhi
saying that it's wrong to blame Pakistan
as a nation and this is the same
Pakistan that is being pulled up by
almost every nation across the globe for
creating this ecosystem for terrorists
to thrive in you have to understand one
thing remember as far as the statement
of mr. Sam Pitroda is concerned this is
not one of the off-the-cuff remarks it's
not one of these remarks in partly in
the sense that he was trapping somewhere
about Hassidim eye candy just gave out
this remark without realizing the
importance of this remark this is a
well-crafted remarks because an
interview and to another important to
recognize organization he has made this
remark but this remark comes with a
great deal of afterthought and this
afterthought they never be constituted
as a personal afterthought because at
the end of the day he gets a very
important sell of Congress party the for
instance oath and coat the for himself
and his remarks would be even the more
that's an important point you make there
some bit because one had thought perhaps
that after Punjab Minister and abroad
singh sethu who faced backlash over his
remarks things would have settled in the
Congress by you know expressing the
support for the security forces and the
Indian Air Force chief also giving
bosses and and satellite images to prove
those air strikes things would have
ended but now you have mr. Sam Pitroda
once again breaking up the issue all
over again Peter Boyle unfaithful well
fought over and across the statement
because of the fact that remember mr.
fancy soda is a whole dance he's not no
he's Indian quality he understands what
are the fallout of each state will make
but despite that when in a
well-organized statement remember it so
he says you it is given out to an
important that you should organization
so when the statement comes out with I
mean from the mouth of one of the most
important politicians of the Congress
party I would not say it is just a
stupid song or it is not without thought
it has a lot of thought attached to it
and a very strong message has been sent
I would say formally by the Congress
party through its foreign head
and the question that remains for this
travel wanted to answer a is this what
you want to convince the world that
India can visit Pakistan and Sarah was
wrong what you want to do remember is
local um also travel grant you got to
take to the similar stand which was
unsigned India and so China is again he
he parked the car have been round and be
doing the same right some big paths are
there thank you so much for joining us
follow me Saha who is also joining us
right now getting in more BGP reactions
and this controversy that Sam Pitroda
has raked up follow me is bound to
trigger a lot of anger evoked some very
strong reactions from the BJP and from
other political parties as well the
prime minister in fact hitting out and
criticizing the Congress party and mr.
Sam Pitroda that's right in fact the
shop of criticism in fact also water at
the Indian Overseas Congress chief Sam
Pitroda has that had come from none
other than the Prime Minister himself
basically yes this is of course uh you
know the concrete parking kick-starting
the Pakistan National Day celebrations
notice the partisan Asha day
celebrations are happening at the High
Commission and India has chosen not to
send any representatives this time or to
are the High Commission obviously
because of our stance on has decided you
want to be separatist leaders and also
in the Waco for what happened in
Pakistan
in India it's just all for the attacks
orchestrated so on Indian soil
specifically on February 14 in pull
gamma on for the CRPF for Japan's were
caught off guard by Pakistan India stand
at that point of time but Sam Pitroda to
make a statement like an entire nation
cannot be blamed for the attack and you
know eight people and each person's only
just attacked and that cannot be the
reason I put an entire nation on the
path is something of which are the PGP
is very strong challenging all right

I'm beginning to agree Michael elope

and during election time these kind of
cafes are not unknown but here we see
the AI DMK a leader campaigning going
the extra mile to campaign for the rival

LEGz2jAwEG8,What Happened In Saragarhi 100 Years Back? | NewsMo,The Battle of Sargarhi where 21 Sikh fought 10000 Afghan soldiers 122 years ago. But do you know what happened there?,2019-03-20T14:46:51Z,India Today,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LEGz2jAwEG8/hqdefault.jpg,"the bravest battle ever fought 26 versus
10,000 invaders of carnies
well is it a true story kayseri starring
Akshay Kumar is going to release this
wholly but before that let's talk to my
colleague on me tell me it's an
extraordinary story absolutely if you
get into it I've silly but I just want
to know the details
is this an urban legend this is a
two-story it is a true story it is too
strong and it is commemorated in fact by
the British Army now it's I think one of
the not I think but I am sure it is one
of the most respected events in SiC
military history one of the heroic
battles the laughs and battles ever
fought so here you have 21 6 from 13 big
thick regiment of the British Indian
Army they were there at saraburi now
that's the hilltop food in British India
then in the north western frontier
provinces now in Pakistan which is now
called Khyber Khyber Pakhtunkhwa so they
were there 21 6 soldiers were there and
the connectivity was lost and there was
no reinforcements and that period a
Sushant it was the period of great game
in history if you look at history it was
a period of heightened tensions between
Russia and Britain and there was some
agreement sign and you know it was all
about occupying territories in Central
Asia the Afghan part included so those
were the heightened tensions in and
there were a lot of tribal unrest as
well in the nwf be at that point in time
so there were 10,000 enemy tribesmen of
khan tribesmen there who were who
attacked this allegory fort held by 21
six of the 36 six regiment and this
infantry in fact was erased by the
british army to deal with the tribal
unrest in NW SP so they were there they
held the ground and they fought to that
and a later they were you know you know
honored with the
posthumously of course with the highest
British gallantry award the Indian order
of merit but they did not give up the
fort the David defending or the area
that they would absolutely no absolutely
not possible yeah that's that's that's
that that's the question and if you look
at it and I was going to different
accounts and different research papers
done by the British people themselves
and what they wrote was that there was
an element of you know six spirituality
plus a Sikh military tradition and that
mix that gave them the strength to hold
their ground and now you know it
illustrates a certain features of the
thick military traditions which is like
courage discipline commitment loyalty
and all those things and they were all
initiated six and all those things came
together and they decided okay we are
not going to give up come what may so
there was a there was this fearless
mirror of graphics and discipline of aid
discipline and loyalty the time that we
are talking about what time period are
we talking about and wasn't there
hand-to-hand combat I mean it's
impossible almost to believe that you
know in a hand-to-hand combat sort of a
situation to anyone can hold up against
enter 12 September 1897 and equals a
10-hour yes a 10-hour battle which which
happened there
so what six were using was ammunition
and their bayonets they're like you know
and like the tea pants so they use it
was a hand-to-hand combat towards the
end and Afghan tribesmen later admitted
that they lost a 180 of their men
hundred and eighty 180 of their men in
this battle and of course the 21-6 who
lost their lives so let's see if the
story of case three will be able to
justify this amazing unbelievable true

him by India today's Raveena Tandon but
finally now his arrest that was imminent
following an arrest warrant issued by UK
court has happened now the UK court had
it should be arrest warrant against a
ddiamond Joe Lanier of moody taking
cognizance of the sanction that was
granted by the UK Home Secretary on
India's request that Edie's request to

us for more on this Davina over to you
just fill us in with all the details yes
so near of Modi has been arrested and is
now confirmed he will be produced any
time now in the Westminster magistrate
court which should be a really
procedural matter unless someone a
little less they are handcuffed
otherwise it's all very civil and he
will be appearing system and Somalia and
there are going to be notes it will be
what are the conditions where he'll put
on himself
usually there are two definite
conditions one is where he is residing
and the other one is of course
accessible 24/7 to have that number on
him which was two very major conditions
apart from the money that they have to
pay on expedition so we find all that
out in the day so we will get something
station on when the case might start now
that is possible that we they get an
indication because now at this point
thirty friends in the persecution will
be it will be here in bones and they
have to revisit judgment everyone has
signs of but still we should have a
inkling of the timetable of this now in
oh absolutely and this indeed would
expedite the legal proceedings for her
his extradition but Lavina just to take
you back to the big news about his
arrest when exactly did it take place if
you could just fill us in with all the
details at that point okay tell me
something now
levena the last time I spoke to you you
said that the legal proceedings are
going to be procedural it's pretty much
a similar to what happened with Vijay
Mallya it does set the ball rolling for
more these extradition but what happens
here on when will he produced when will
he be produced at Westminster coal
any moment I only can be produced in the
vacuum informatics 814 in very
interesting and he's been evading
punitive action for the longest time
isn't it it's only because of the ADEs
efforts that an arrest warrant has been
issued against him Lavina he's already
changed location multiple times within
the UK say on with me Shankar who sent
for mercy be on the broadcast right now
mr. Shankar who said we're just getting
in news about need of Modi being
arrested finally the arrest warrant that
was issued based on Edie's request for
near of Modi's extradition your thoughts
your comments what happens next
well the extradition proceedings will
now begin and as previous example in
Vijay molesky's and after so many others
that bookie Chawla you know they are
still being extradited there is not
going to be anything happening
immediately it's going to be a long run
process give or take
seven to eight years that's a long
period if you could just enlighten us
why does this take so long first of all
after is the rest yes on affidavit
evidence of witnesses from India will
have to be presented to the Crown
prosecutor we have no right of
representation in the West Minister
Court so that will be done the other
side will get a chance to rebut yes
they've got the contentions of all the
witnesses who are there on affidavit
having heard that then that will go on
for some time then they'll be right to
appeal
we appeal and win the Home Secretary
orders again there is an appeal lvj
Emily and each other already doing it
after all win every day major - orders
have been used the cricket book each
other's orders have been issued yes yes
they are not coming back anywhere yes so
they're a people said you know the
judicial process as it takes in India it
takes time there - 30 days time and then
the government of England is the final
arbitrating Authority it is not the
court order which has a final say and
that is a political decision as you know
England is the country of businessman
those who make heavy investments in
business have protection they are looked
after
after why Duke why do most Indians who
escaped from India head furring them
it's not it for you still there have you
even touched so now that he has been
arrested
the proceeding has begun and we can
expect anything between 7 to 8 years I
remember when I was in England interrupt
you there what kind of protection do
these defaulters get I mean you you
sound rather despondent we strike of
rather respondent note with regards to
the length and the legal proceedings
don't you think that this is this is a
very positive mood and you know all the
efforts that have been going on has also
paid off with his arrest and you know
it's really setting the ball rolling for
his extradition exactly I am telling you
the facts there is no question of
respondent see the law protects
extraditing okay
yes Terry escape from India yes it's the
first fault of the Government of India
if you look back and see well how did we
hear my mayor and observe this man was
wanted from 2014
and then there were others against him
in 2017 once you allow a man to escape
your Shores then he has a right to the
protection of the law of that country
and extradition is a long-drawn process
whether it's in United States over there
is okay I read the experience England
issue if English people escape to UK USA
all right it takes the same amount I
thought there will be time but the
process began all right the process has
begun mr. schacter descent thank you so
much for joining us
Lavinia Tandon is with us as well before
I come to you Lavina puja shali is also
joining us for now puja what happened
next will a team or from the IDI in the
cbi also be headed to London because
it's going to be very important for them
to be present in the Westminster Scott
when he is going to be applying for bail
well that's right this is the big news
that's coming Avantika that one of
course our leader mode is likely to be
produced at the Westminster court very
shortly and remember the extradition
proceedings against him will likely
begin as well and that would be big
because as opposed to Christian Michele
being brought to India
Mido Modi is one of our own to have
flees the Punjab National Bank to the
tune of 30,000 has fled the country and
if the extradition proceedings then will
go on by the court and if approved if
he's brought back remember it's still
not very easy mera Modi will again want
to challenge the proceedings
nevertheless this is the big step that's
finally come Ministry of External
Affairs had maintained that yes they
just because they know about the
location does not mean it's not easy to
bring needle Modi back however there is
a legal procedure that the External
Affairs Ministry was also going to use
and this is the legal route that they
have approached now and now that need of
Modi is going to be produced in the
Westminster Court now will be the
proceedings that shall begin and we'll
wait and watch in the next few days and
very likely yes teams of Enforcement
Directorate and the CBI will also be
heading to London soon
/ - okay levena coming back to need of
more the evading punitive action for the
longest time evading arrest and finally
being spotted by you
London he himself has been on the run
chaining changing multiple locations
within the UK and finally setting for a
swanky apartment in in London your
interactions with mr. need of Modi him
coming up with his favorite response of
no comments he looked completely unfazed
and unperturbed with the kind of
investigations and the charges leveled
against him I must say that to me he
definitely said that I'm stalking him
yes but I guess he's on Purcell but and
he can't be hiding anymore because he
has been arrested and I have details
here can I please update quickly that
need of Modi this is from the Met Office
this is the Scotland Yard meet of moody
48 years old was arrested on behalf of
Indian authorities this afternoon
Tuesday 19th March in Hagen he will
appear in custody at Westminster
magistrates court today which is on the
20th of March and I think this is gonna
happen in the hour time he was appointed
ran PMB scam accuse Needham OD arrested
in London Manish Pandey joins us for
more in this Manish what next what will
be the next move by the ad and the CBI
yeah well I want Iike this development
starts the long process of extradition
it's a kickstart you can say because
this was the first step after this
entire arrest warrant now he has been
arrested and what we have been told by
the agencies here that authorities have
informed them that in next half an hour
he'll be produced before the Westminster
Code now the Indian authorities have
been formed the officials will be
reaching tomorrow from the Central
Bureau of Investigation and the
Enforcement Directorate and now Crown
Prosecution Service will be given handed
over all the evidence against Lee remote
this so that the official extradition
process can be initiated against me
Ramadi
okay but Lavina coming back to you Neera
Modi has now been arrested in the United
Kingdom as I've been saying before it
has already started now the extradition
process but as I was speaking to head
back to India from the BGP is also
joining us so big news coming in after
the arrest warrant need of Modi the PNB
bank accused finally being arrested and
will now be produced in court yes I mean
the you know the government of india and
the government of India's various
agencies have been working on it and
pushing for it so all this has been
going on very quietly without any noise
and without any news and you have you
are there you can see the results now
and with the government agencies results
will only be when he will be brought
back to India and he will have to face
the courts here in India and an answer
for all the charges that he faces yes
you are right I mean here we are forced
everything to the bosses you know first
we have to make sure that we bring him
back here so we are working on that
there is a certain process and procedure
in the United Kingdom according to their
laws and then and the we can change the
laws there so we have to go by that
established laws there and that's
precisely what we are trying to do but
our effort is very clear and it is to
bring him back to India and as soon as
possible and also to make sure wherever
he has kind of you know hidden his money
to bring their money also to all those
people to the best money belongs to the
depositors of Punjab National Bank and
so we are working on it we we are quite
quite aware that how suppose s like the
government agent
are working very quickly on this and we
are quite confident he will bring him
back to India and make sure that every
single paisa that is run away if it is
back to India but you know what efforts
are being made undoubtedly mr. Taneja by
the investigative forces there is much
criticism coming in from the opposition
on your party as to why was need of Modi
allowed to flee India in the first place
because this case is going to follow a
very similar pattern like that of Vijay
Mallya who still remains on bail since
his arrest on an extradition warrant
well if we want to go back to the past
then we can't do it selectively then we
have to start from 2011 when for the
first time you're needing leader what he
was allowed to borrow money and he was
not only allowed to borrow money from
Pernod nests of that thanks to the some
political intervention which evidently
enjoys some grand a shochet with the UPA
- and that's how the story started so
how comes that from 21 2011 to 2014 he
continued to borrow money from Devlin's
there are thousands and thousands of
thousands of crores now the question is
that who started who basically included
you know made necessary phone calls in
order to inflame the Punjab National
Bank so we have to quote in the past
then we have to hear we can't look at
the past elect thanks for watching the

KcRSBYHiE_M,Dharwad Collapse Kills 4; 56 Rescued,The underconstruction collapse in Dharwad has kiiled 4 and has yet to rescue people who are supposedly stuck. 56 have been ...,2019-03-20T10:27:04Z,India Today,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KcRSBYHiE_M/hqdefault.jpg,"okay we're getting in breaking news
about five people tragically losing
their lives after an under-construction
building collapsed in Harvard rescue
workers are racing against time so far
what we're hearing is that they've been
able to rescue 56 people who were still
believed to be trapped under the debris
the national disaster relief force or
the NDRF is using specially trained
cranes to sniff out people trapped under
the debris the collapse took place in
Harvard's tamari issuer another in fact
it's about 400 kilometers north of
Bengaluru but I'm going to go straight
across now to India today's Nolan Pinto
just to give us more updates it seems to
be a major collapse this under
construction a building Nolan what
exactly happened how many people were
living inside it given the fact that
there were 56 people who have been
rescued from the debris
you know it's extremely shocking of at
the moment we arrived over here to see
the situation let me just show you first
what's happening here this is basically
a five-story building so let's put it in
this way you had basement you had ground
and you had plus three so what's
happened now because of the collapse the
ground has now become the basement now
we have various teams from the NDRF two
teams from Ghaziabad who actually
arrived over here one from Bengaluru and
they also the state Disaster Response
Force so all of them were are working
together now the reason behind this is
not yet known but they say it could be
and most probably due to substandard
material being utilized em sand that's
been utilized over there not been cured
probably so as of now the police and and
local authorities are not wanting to
talk about what led to this because they
say that our duty is first to look into
the rescue work now coming back to the
rescue work 56 have been rescued four of
them confirmed dead now what we are
hearing from the NDRF is that there
could be about 15 to 20 15 between 15
and 20 people still stuck in politicize
this now we do not know whether the
chances of them to survive this because
this incident took place yesterday in
the afternoon somewhere around 313 312
313 exactly hence you can clearly see
what they're using they're using all the
big equipment over here the NDRF has
come and brought all your equipment
specialized equipment to see if they can
find what's happening in fact just in
one area towards the end over there you
have a lot of NDRF and strf personnel
they believe that a few students would
come last evening to get some sort of
photocopies at a cybercafe
are trapped so they are actually
concentrating on in that one particular
area we are taking the help of the
locals who know this building now that's
that's what's happening as if now you
have a few politicians few leaders in
this area who've come and also the BSF
were actually come over here on election
duty were brought immediately to the
spot to make sure that no looting takes
place and they protect the area so that
the forces can do you just just take a
look at how difficult it is for them
because it's a five-story building not
at all easy one by one brick by brick
they are using soils electric soils they
are trying to cut through in fact what
they are also planning to do is
basically you is you dig a hole over
there now their idea there is because
you have
build a tunnel as such because you had
the basement the ground flow has now
become the basement so they're not too
sure if people are stuck below that so
they're trying to build a tunnel from
the outside so that it can help the NDRF
personnel to move in and maybe get
access inside so this is the situation
as of now 15 to 20 people are still
feared trapped inside this debris all
right Nolan thank you so much for
joining us and giving us a detailed
account of what exactly happened the
rescue work going on a war footing four
people have been confirmed dead 56
people have been rescued and the
operation still going on and Nolan

ganga has been worked out
starting with shut knock in prayer grout
she will also meet people of the
villages and towns falling on route her
final stop at a Sikh heart in Varanasi
Priyanka store of the cities along the
Ganga is being seen as an innovative
move to reach out to a larger section of
backward communities the Congress is

right my colleague Neil and Ashok Lana
joins me live on this story in Milan
shoe it's a very innovative move by
Priyanka Gandhi bhadra to travel from
pre a garage to Varanasi via the Ganga
what prompted this move how is she gonna
reach out to the people as she uses the
waterway to travel from prior garage to
Varanasi see Paula me what we have been
told from the top sources in the
Congress party that this is being done
to bring PM modi's dream project namami
gangee under scrutiny and what the UPC
see chief Raj Babbar has told us that
during her River journey from Prague Raj
to Varanasi Priyanka Gandhi will be
interacting with villagers on the bank
of river and will also be holding new
casabas and this time interestingly
Priyanka Gandhi will also be visiting
popular temples starting from prior
garage to Varanasi she will also be
offering prayers at the win-win DHL
temple in Mirza poor and we have seen in
the past that the temple spree has
worked for Congress president Rahul
Gandhi particularly in Madhu position is
gone in Rajasthan and the same tactics
is being adopted by Priyanka Gandhi here
in Uttar Pradesh where she is going to
start her political campaigning in
eastern yupi let me also tell you that
the Congress workers have planned have
made arrangements to make Bianca
Gandhi's visit a grand success and in
Varanasi there is going to be a massive
celebration of welcome for Priyanka
Gandhi and let me also tell you that she
is also going to organize a roadshow in
Musa poor she is going to address women
party workers we are right now at the
Lucknow Airport and you can see that
preparations have already been made the
SPG have arrived here police is also
here and from the amasi airport she will
straightaway head to the party office
where she'll be interacting with party
leaders and workers this time
interestingly we have seen Priyanka
Gandhi focusing on restructuring of the
Congress party because a lot of people
belonging to other parties who have been
ignored who have not been given tickets
are joining the Congress party on their
own regular intervals however the BJP
has said that that Priyanka Gandhi has
been very inconsistent and unnecessary
hype is being created because let me
tell you that after the Palama attack
Bianca Gandhi went from Lucknow to Delhi
and she's coming here after a month the
BJP has said that for Priyanka Gandhi it
is going to be impossible to run with
her pradesh from Lucknow because all the
important meetings related to you pea
she has been holding in Delhi for the
last few days but now she is going to
finally start her
poll campaign and hurricane focus will
be on temple Spee and to bring PM modi's
namami canoe project under scrutiny and
that is why she's taking a river route

leading busy lives running back channels
working from morning late into the night
how in the world do they wake up at 5:00
a.m. so the Spartan warriors have a
great expression and it's sweat more in
training and you'll bleed less in war so
someone who says well I'm too busy
that's the very reason to join the 5
a.m. Club to give yourself that period
where you can calibrate your mindset and
work on your heart set and optimize your
health set and get ready for a great day
why do you think waking up at 5 a.m. is
so important look at the great sages of
the world look at Nelson Mandela Mother
Teresa the great writers the great
business Titans many of them had one
thing in common they got up before the
Sun to plan to think to prepare
themselves because the way you start
your day sets the tone for your day if
you wake up checking your email you're
distracted you're
you're not focused and that affects your
day hey but for example someone in the
world of news or even in the corporate
world you know checking your mail
knowing what's happening on the office
groups and what's that it's really
important how do you you know not
respond to those very pressing
emergencies there's a line in the 5 a.m.
Club which is an addiction to
distraction is the death of your
creative production there's also a term
coming out called digital dementia we're
losing our minds because of this we're
cyber zombies taking one hour while the
rest of the world is asleep to reconnect
to your primal hero to re-engage with
your best nature to think about your
values to plan your date to read from a
great book to sweat you know one of the
things in the 5 M Club is the
neuroscience behind sweating first thing
in the morning through exercise you'll
release BDNF cortisol the fear hormone
is high as first thing in the morning
you'll release serotonin which makes you
feel happier those are amazing ways to
start the day that will lead to better
results creativity and productivity so
you've got a 20 20 20 routine in the 5
a.m. Club will you help us experience
the 20 20 20 routine it would be my
absolute pleasure and just to let you
know that 20 20 20 formula that the 5 M
Club is based around comes from my work
with billionaires over the past 20 years
that work with billionaires famous
celebrities movie stars and I taught
them this morning routine the 20-20-20
formula and I was seeing Rahul amazing
results in their mindset their happiness
their performance their creativity and
so that's why I wrote the book I wanted
to share it with everyone and I'd love
to walk you through it come let's go
great
so the first thing Robin in your
20-20-20 routine is to hit the gym so
you're saying wake up walk out of bed
can our treadmill that's harder than do
that well the way you feel when you
first wake up is not the way you're
gonna feel 20 minutes later after some
sweaty exercise now why is it sweaty
exercise we all have the ability in the
brain to Purdy's BDNF brain-derived
neurotrophic factor and what that does
is when we sweat and that's produced we
think more clearly we're more focused
and we feel better
cortisol the fearful known as high as
first thing in the morning time to just
wake up we're studying and then how do
you think the trade went like 5:00 in
the morning you hit the treadmill or you
start skipping or you start moving as
quickly as possible because you're gonna
feel so much better when you get a
little bit of exercise first thing in
the morning
come let's give this a shot
[Music]
so I you running at high speeds no I
know you just keeping it very basic the
key is just getting your endorphins
flowing and that pharmacy of mastery in
the human brain activated and you know
get your blood flowing first thing in
the morning it'll wake you right up what
I'm encouraging people doing the 5 a.m.
Club is put mind over matter Asst uh-huh
win the battle up the bed people say
well I can't get up early grandma
couldn't get up early I don't have
hourly rising genes you get on the
treadmill or you do yoga or you go for a
walk you're gonna activate a pharmacy of
mastery that lives inside every human
brain and you'll start to feel better
very quickly and you'll start to
optimize your focus your energy your
creativity if you want hope for you to
wake up at 5:00 a.m. what time do you
hit the bank that's a very important
point to have a world-class morning
ritual we need to have a fantastic
pre-sleep ritual one hour before you go
to sleep meditate take a bath read write
in a journal record gratitude but no
technology no distraction you'll sleep
more deeply which allows you to get up
at 5:00 a.m. but given the kind of world
we live in is that even doable just
saying put the phone away put your iPads
away don't watch TV one of the best
things you can do is start your day well
one of the best things you can do is
give yourself 60 minutes before the
busyness of the day starts to work on
what I call your for interior emperor
pyres of your mindset heart set health
set and soul sad because what's the
point of being busy climbing the wrong
mountains what's the point being busy
climbing the wrong mountains where do
you get these one-liners um I think it's
it's it's all my ancient wisdom you know
they say many of the great religious
leaders got up before the Sun mahathma
gone
love the great artists a lot of great
entrepreneurs clogged a great
humanitarians understood when we get up
at 5:00 a.m. our minds are most pure our
hearts are most open we're not dealing
with the residue of the previous day
sleep has washed away all our
distractions and worries and doubts and
so that victory hour from 5:00 to 6:00
it's magic people are nicer the world is
so still so you spoke with your sleep
ritual but what time do you ordinarily
hit the second the latest sign says we
need between seven and nine hours of
sleep every night latest science says
when we sleep there's a mechanism where
the brain actually washes itself so if
we don't sleep properly our brain is not
working properly and it's the number one
way to cut out a longevity so sleep is
fundamentally important but it's the
quality of the sleep that's important
too how does have any weapon improving
the quality of sleep well be one hour
it's the one hour before you sleep no
technology be peaceful sleep in a cool
room make sure it's very dark
you know one of the really important
things to remember you know people could
say I don't have time to get up early in
the morning because I need the sleep and
I want to check my email I want to check
my texts but all geniuses have one thing
in common
acute levels of focus and am i a
monomaniacal concentration on the few
things that count so taking that time
early in the morning where you can
Center on how you want to live your day
and where you can center for what you
want your life to stand for you know I
want you to live your day on your terms
versus society's terms so roughly not 20
minutes in the gym is over the next part
of the rainbow a training routine is to
meditate there's three pockets to the
20-20-20 formula so we're now finishing
the first pocket 20 minutes of sweaty
exercise to optimize our cognition to
increase our energy because energy is
more valuable than our intelligence the
second pocket is about reflection which
we're gonna go do right now let's do it
after that first 20 minute pocket of the
5:00 a.m. club method the second part of
the 20-20-20 formula is reflection we
live in a world where so few people
pause and take the time to think and so
this second 20 minutes gives us the
chance to visualize who we want to be
during the day it gives us the chance to
think about how we lived yesterday and
release our weaknesses it allows us to
ground on our value so we're leaders
versus victims as we go through our day
ahead
so you're saying focus on what you want
to get done during that day because what
happens very often is you wake up you
get caught in emails what's that message
is you're not really thinking about
everything that you need to get done in
that day there's a huge difference
between productivity and being busy a
huge difference so it's not really how
much time you work it's what you do so
this second 20 minute pocket allows you
to ground in what's most important you
can pray you can meditate you can
visualize a lot of great athletes
understand when you visualize you step
into the person you've been visualizing
you can write in a journal or you can
simply just think like pause in our
noisy world and think what I want to
stand for today what will I say no to
today how do I want to treat people
today that'll give you a blueprint that
you could then use to live out a great
day and and you think saying no is
almost as important a thing yes it's
much more important right now the
majority that we're masters of yes yes
to every social engagement yes to every
text yes to every invitation but the
great leaders the great heroes the most
productive people are minimalists and
purists so this 20 minute pocket of the
5 a.m. Club method it allows you to
Center and reflect and meditate and
contemplate what's going to be most
important as you go through your day and
a culture like ours saying no it's tough
you know people get turned off they get
irritated and saying no is very
difficult I think you can be a yes
person and you can be liked by the world
or you can change the world and live
life on your terms in a very respectful
way
but you don't get to do both and if you
look at Mahatma Gandhi you look at
Shakespeare you look at Oprah Winfrey
you look at you know the great ones the
great women and men of the world they
had such a clear mighty mission that the
head the self-discipline and wisdom to
say no to all the trivialities so they
could say yes to what was most important
it's a victory over your weaker side all
change is hard at first and it's messy
in the middle and it's gorgeous at the
end you wake up at 5:00 a.m. every day
oh it's like a Monday to Friday kind of
I wake up most days except when I travel
sometimes I need a little bit more sleep
on the social media someone said to me
the other day you know Robin I work all
night I'm on a shift and I get home at
5:00 what should I do you know what I
said sleep I mean not everyone's going
to be able to do the 5 a.m. Club so even
if you get up at 5:00 am only three
times a week
that's better than sleeping in every
week let's do a meditation for the
second pocket called reflection so what
I often do is I'll just close my eyes
and I'll ground myself I'll just give
myself some positive mantras we know
from Suns Griffith modern means mind and
try means free so mantra is actually
free the mind and if you want to talk
about neurobiology we're gonna get out
of a thinking mind which is also the
seed of our inner critic the prefrontal
cortex and through some meditation and
just sitting here quietly we're gonna
get to a deeper state that researchers
called flow which is where optimal
performance lives so you breathe in
breathing is very powerful breathe in
through your nose and let go of any
tension and stress you're caring
breathe in peace exhale any anger
breathe in forgiveness
exhale resentment breathe in bravery
exhale insecurity breathe in love exhale
selfishness and you can see if we were
to do this every morning just 4:20 I
just tell me honestly how do you feel
just very nice no doubt this is also so
core to Indian values yoga and
meditation which is just the Indian Way
of life for the longest time it's the
Indian Way of life and it's also the
high performers way of life because we
know when we do this meditation we're
gonna release serotonin which makes us
feel better and when we feel better we
do better work I think there's actually
four interior dimensions to work on
between 5:00 and 6:00 every morning it's
mindset and heart set but that's not it
the third interior Empire your health
set you know if you want to change the
world and be an industry Titan or a
great appellate or a great journalist
such as yourself you don't want to have
disease so your your health set is so
important and then the final element is
soul set fourth interior Empire now you
could say Robin we're busy people we
want to do great things in the world we
have families we have responsibilities
soul set sounds very mystical with great
love and respect I would say it's one of
the most important things for every
human being because your soul set is
simply taking the time to turn down the
voice of your ego and that selfish weak
self and to rebuild a relationship with
our wisdom and our gifts and our talents
like we're when we're little kids were
born into awe and Wonder but as we go
through life and get disappointed we
lose that connection great so we're done
with our meditation we're thinking about
building a
Sol said finding the time to make this
happen and now let's head to the last
twenty minutes of what you call the
victory hour exactly so the final 20
minute pocket of the 20-20-20 formula
that the 5 a.m. Club met that is built
on is all about growth so I've coached a
lot of billionaires for the past 20
years I've worked with superstars you
know movie stars and the great athletes
and the great ones all have one thing in
common they love to grow and so I often
say to double your income and your
impact triple your investment in your
personal mastery and that's what we're
gonna do right now let's find out how
for the last 20 minutes jogging it's
about learning so at 5:40 in the morning
start discovering new things yes so this
is the final pocket of the 5 a.m. Club
victory hour and it's all about growing
the people who live remarkable lives
there they're curious and they
understand that you always want to
maintain a white belt mentality what's a
white bank mentality it's like the
martial artist the moment you think
you're a master you're back to being a
beginner so whether you're a corporate
Titan whether you're a firefighter
whether you're a teacher and
entrepreneur you want to always want to
be hungry to learn more whether that's
about your skills or whether that's
about your personal mastery so for these
20 minutes we're a hole it's really
about putting something positive in your
mind and in a negative world it's about
reading maybe a biography but there's 20
minutes enough to do two bio you can go
more you know the whole morning routine
I've walked you through is what I call
the minimum viable morning routine it's
just a really tight calibrated one hour
to optimize yourself but you know
personally I do three hours I'll go one
hour of exercising I just need an hour
to exercise every morning and while I do
that I'll listen to audiobooks
I'll hydrate there's some some good
science saying that when you hydrate it
improves the mitochondrial function so
you have more energy then I'll do an
hour of developing myself and journaling
and then I'll do an hour of learning
it's identical that you talk of
journaling in the social media era
everybody's on Instagram whatsapp
Facebook and you're talking about the
good old journal yeah that sounds 19th
century it's
19th century and it's very modern
because you know what science says
there's a great relationship to writing
and developing and optimizing your mind
for example habit researchers have a
term called pre commitment strategies so
if you take out a journal like an old
school journal I mean I brought my own
personal journal here because as yours
well I know you like little black book
little black book I know you like to
keep it raw and real so I'm still a
little sweaty but this is the this is
the 5 a.m. club and what I do is in my
journal look I'll do I'll do these
Deacons run school in college unless use
even now I'll do deconstructions alright
gratitude I will write blueprints for my
ideal day you're seeing lock yourself in
put it down in pay put it down on paper
and then because vague goals lead to
vague results writing it down is a
commitment it gives you precision and
clarity of thought also in my journal
and again you can do this during the
growth period of your 20-20-20 formula
but you can start to write about your
frustrations I mean I've gotten through
a lot of great times in my life I've
been on the top of the mountain and I've
gone through tragedy in my life and when
I've gone through the painful times of
my life this saved my life because I
poured my pain i poured my sadness out
onto a fresh piece of paper and so i
released those toxic emotions from my
system versus doing what a lot of people
do when they go through a hard time they
repress it which builds up and one of
the things you're right about is then
the possibility of expanding your
horizon and learning about new things
not necessarily related to work greatest
ideas incubate when we're not studying
our craft and that's the value of
reading strange things if you're a a
journalist if you're let's say a
business person go talk to a yoga
teacher go interview a child go talk to
a taxi driver you know it even traveling
like leave your home and go out and
visit new places like life is meant to
have aw and wonder it's about
reconnecting with the beauty of life in
this world where a lot of us are
half a life to life there's there's a
line in the book most people die at 20
in they're buried at 80
I believe that adults are nothing more
than deteriorated children you know when
we were little kids we did have a
sparkle in our eye we were curious we
were passionate we were authentic we
were fully alive and then as we leave
the innocence of childhood what happens
we get disappointed it would lose that
intimacy with our glory we lose that
fire in our belly and as I suggested
before a great life is nothing more than
a series of well lived a strung together
like a necklace of pearls you know for
those who've got high levels of
motivation and commitment and self
belief doing some of this may be easy
but what I want to talk to you next is
how do people who think that life is
drifting aren't fully in charge aren't
necessarily in happy jobs not doing very
well with their families how do they
take charge of their lives let's talk
about love too Robin as I hear you say
wake up at 5:00 a.m. run for 20 minutes
meditate for 20 you know this may be
possible for high performance right yeah
those were prime to excel but lower
passages drifting through life not
necessarily fully in control you know
they can't even get basics done how do
they reach peak performance levels the
very person who says I can't do it
because I don't have energy because I
don't believe in myself because I'm too
busy that's the person who needs it most
I mean it's not just for high performers
I've been I've been teaching the five
m-club method for over two decades it's
for any human being because what's it
really about it's about optimizing your
brain increasing your energy how do you
snap out of just being the way you are
and you know getting in those zone where
you want to be a better person
one step at a time one morning at a time
I think was either Lao Tzu or Confucius
who said the thousand mile journey
begins with a single step one step to
get up early the next morning another
step to get up early the next morning
and then when you stumble you get back
up you know in Japan they say fall down
seven times get up eight a great life or
a great career isn't
revolution one morning we wake up and
everything's magic and dancing in the
sunlight a great life is built by
evolution one morning at a time you've
spoken it out about waking up at 5 a.m.
why should I do it someone may ask how
do i benefit why should we get up at 5
a.m. so we become our greatness and we
live great lives and were happier and we
serve humanity better all right now
you're radiating positive energy of full
of positive thoughts and you're trying
to make the world a better place by
getting people to be better than they
are
it has this been the way Robin Sharma
has always been well I've been blessed
to have great parents my dad is actually
from Jammu Kashmir and he was a great
influence on my life and he used to
recite the words of her bender not to
Gore and my dad used to say Robin when
you were born you cried while the world
rejoiced live your life in such a way
that when you die the world cries while
you rejoice so I've always had this
instinct to be helpful but I'm not
naturally energetic I'm not naturally
full of this fire I work at it given
that we live in the technological age
what do you think people need to do
those who live busy lives but technology
is a key part of who they are they're
not monks only Ferrari these are people
with real jobs real responsibilities how
do they try and minimize the disruption
technology causes I would say this
technology is a beautiful servant and
it's a vicious God I use technology I
leverage technology I'm on the social
media but I use it strategically I use
it hopefully very intelligently have
periods during your day zero technology
zero distraction where you can focus on
doing real work versus fake work when
you're with your family have a family
meal no technology tell everyone put the
phone on the table don't touch it we can
organize our day so there are some times
where we can check our email and we can
check our texts we get our best thinking
done when we're not distracted and you
know a lot of us are not present anymore
because we're so addicted to our
technology
so you started with the monk who sold
his Ferrari and you've been talking
about the 5 a.m. Club for two decades
now which you finally turn into a book
what happens next
my biggest passion right now is moving
into more philanthropy so I've started a
children's foundation and there's two
missions I have one is to reduce as best
as I can
childhood poverty and also leprosy so
I'm on a mission to do whatever I can to
help children with leprosy lead better
lives
Robin we started really early in the
morning you know it seems to me as if
we've been walking for hours which we
have but you know my workday hasn't even
started yet so this actually in some
senses if we can carry this pure and
just this episode a jump image helps you
live a longer day you know just do more
with your day because it almost feels as
hey half my work start actually the day
hasn't even begun this has been a
fantastic interaction thank you so much
Robin Sharma for joining us I hope that
everything that you've said what you've
written has helped so many people and
the benefit from all your words of
advice well congratulations on the
impact you're having and thank you so
much thank you so much

tightened norms governing the operation
of Boeing 737 max a cough which
witnessed two crashes in the last five
months globally the DGC has also sought
information on the 737 max second
carriers like jet and spice jet in fact
only Indian operators flying these
planes Jet Airways has five grounded
boeing 737 max planes while SpiceJet
operates 12 of these aircrafts the DGC
has instructed only senior pilots with
at least thousand hours of flying
experience should command 737 max 8 the
DGCA is also advise stringent checks of
the aircraft's autopilot and install
management systems during long runs it
stays a number of countries including
China Singapore Indonesia along with
South Korea have grounded Boeing 737 max
aircrafts after an Ethiopian airline
crash on Sunday that killed all 157
people on board let me go across to my
colleague Nagarjuna to arcana joining me
for more on this story Nagarjun doh the
aircrafts have not been grounded but now
the DGC has come up with thousand hours
minimum
you know requirement for the captain of
these planes Nagarjuna just very quickly
want to take your focus to the two plane
crashes in which both the pilots had
more than 5,000 hours of flying
experience how much of a difference does
that make
well the end of the day what makes
difference is then the software update
that were given from the Boeing and also
what issues that the aircraft is facing
remember like you've rightly put it the
ethiopian pilots and also the lion air
pilots one of which was an indian pilot
from Delhi who died in the fatal crash
both had more than $5,000 pilot in
command and also at least thousand US as
piloting command on that aircraft on
that model alone so just making sure
that the pilot and co-pilot having the
enough number of us won't suffice the
problem is what the aviation experts are
saying 8 such airlines which you use a
737 max 8i have grounded their fleet
starting from Singapore Airlines
SilkAir and Kemeny Rando Comair which is
the part of British rivers in South
Africa all major airlines which operate
to have grounded the 787 max except for
India DGCA still is contemplating what
action to take that this issue two
advisory yesterday up to the maintenance
and how to go about it the maintenance
and checks off of the seven eight seven
seven three seven eight craft but still
a lot of purple aviation commentators
feel that this is not enough and the
fleet needs to be grounded spiced it at
the moment
flies twelve such aircrafts and Jet
Airways has five such aircraft and jet
as fortunately grounded all five because
of the monetary issues they are not able
to raise funds to pay the lesson so
that's one fortunate thing for Indian
aviation while spy state is still
operating all twelve seven thirty seven
or eight we'll have to wait and watch
if the DGCA will take a final call and
ground these fleet also Riley the Boeing
or FAA puts out a new notification now

single songwriter Cyril entrepreneur and
sign of one of India's wealthiest
families Ananya Birla welcome to job be
met thanks so much for having me on it's
a pleasure so Ananya has recently
reached out to a hundred and fifty
million people through her music which
is audio and video streaming with
someone who sings in English in India
those are big numbers yeah I'm very
grateful I think it's truly shown me
that music is a universal language and
there's so much scope for English music
in India super grateful and it's really
motivated me to continue to do what I
love so only everyone in there most
people sing Bollywood Hindi numbers yeah
and here you are banging away in English
I'm doing quite well thank you yeah it
was very frustrating initially Bollywood
dominates a country which is which is
lovely of lists you know listen to
Bollywood music and Hindi music all my
life so it's beautiful but people said
it wasn't possible people didn't accept
me because of my surname you're not good
enough you know you don't have what it
takes
there's no scope for English music and
India so it was very frustrating
initially but I think the most important
thing was I knew that my heart was in
this and I didn't want to do anything
else in my life I couldn't envision
myself doing anything else and I loved
it so much I was in Davos recently yeah
and we did an episode of job be met with
the likes of Rashad Premji other Poona
Wallis and Jim for George parotia
got rich all of whom have picked what is
the typical route or your typical
expectation around the sign of an Indian
industrial right you have a complete
extreme you've gone and said hey this is
my course I'll do my own thing so people
say never normal but it doesn't come to
a place of being rebellious so you know
any of that sort it's truly just what I
love doing my purpose from very young
age I knew was you know God given me
this platform and I need to reach out to
as many people as possible and clear an
impact on these people in the most
positive way possible and I think music
does that so it's not coming from a
position of angst in No
establish industrial order not at all
because I started for Tantra which is a
micro finance company which is
completely business oriented though at
the age of 17 so I love business as well
I support my father in many different
ways
I seriously look up to my forefathers
create Li and I would love to be part of
that at some time I would music happen I
was asking my mom that question the car
cuz I have no idea really I always
wanted to be a singer songwriter pop
star from went on I must have been like
12 maybe a lot of people want to be
single at the age of 12 and then they
kind of yeah so I used to like secretly
play my guitar and I was very into
poetry
I should have my guitar and I used to
lock my room door nice to play at 3 a.m.
so no one could hear me and compose my
own music but it was just that then I
went to Oxford and I again had a very
tough time my second year I used to get
very bad panic attacks etc panic for
what I think it was probably a little
bit of chemical neurotransmitter based
as well but I was probably not too happy
being in that environment knowing that I
wanted to do something else
so I started gigging I remember going
for one gig and I told Lola my best
friend slash manager dad this one gig
will determine whether I want to take
surf as a career or not it was a a
secondhand clothing store the music
system was crap and everyone was just
like shopping and stuff no one was even
listening to me but I still felt so good
and I was like you know I don't need any
validation this makes me happy I want to
do the rest of my life but it's very
tough performing in a bar or when people
are yeah oh yeah so you spoke up because
everybody's doing their own thing
yeah and we're okay with that at that
time I was okay with it but then
immediately once that happened I dropped
out of Oxford which many people don't
know about so secondly I dropped out of
Oxford you know college dropout I am a
drop oh yeah officially a dropout those
dropouts who do best in life you know I
don't know why it felt right to me I
thought I'm going to come back and walk
ins with Tantra but I started producing
my own music writing my own music and I
started pitching everywhere the head of
Universal Music Group
yeah he happened to be at the Taj Lands
End and I got a meeting with him I made
him hear a song called I don't want to
love I was going through a heartbreak
period so hurt in that song and he heard
it once and he looked at me and he heard
it again I was like no chance because I
was told he's like you know no chance
he's like very like impossible to get
signed and he looked up with me of the
second time when I was like oh oh
 oh and he was like come to our
office and we will sign you and then he
got up and he was left and I was like
wow I remember back in the cows like
literally shaking and I was like I can't
believe this has happened
and throughout this entire period I was
so into my head that I don't think my
parents knew what was going on at all
so I told my parents little later that
this always happened I've gotten signed
officially I was losing my own music so
this is your pad this is where you spend
a lot of time yes it's my space I feel
like home here there are many special
things around which mean a lot to me my
guitars are here which one's your
favorite this one actually the tailor
that's where I compose I don't want to
love on this song which got picked up by
Universal and then you see some middle
fingers pointing to the world as well I
don't think it's point to the world I
think it's just initially I got so much
hate you know people said some very rude
things saying you know what did they say
so there was one comment that really got
to me it says I'm gonna like heard your
song and got cancer
well like I got cancer and my
grandfather passed away with cancer why
would someone say something I don't know
fair enough I mean not the best thing to
say so in that period I I sort of
realized that to be unapologetic sorry
not sorry and I'm going to continue what
I'm gonna do there will be love hand and
hate and so when I have peers on scene
like why am i doing what I'm doing bla
bla I just look at that and I realized
that you know all the haters out there
you know and just you know there's so
many levels and focus on that and I look
at that and also realize that if there's
no hit you haven't reached out enough
people mm-hmm because everyone can not
love what you're doing
sure so I want to show you something
actually that I've not shown anyone one
of my favorite quotes that my mom
actually taught me whenever I used to
feel very pressurized she said
only thing that you can do is try your
best so if you stand here you can see do
your best and leave the rest of God
nice you got it all across yeah it's a
great reminder that all I can do is you
try my best the consequence of this
result is not really in my hand and then
there's a Doha which says calcareous
watch car art Carrizo up on me prolly
who Iggy Bihari Careca cub for me this
means that life is too short
follow your dreams do what you want to
do cuz all we have is right now the
present moment there'll be a lot of
people will be watching anime yeah
who'll see you on India today
yeah and say hey this girl's lucky
because of our service yeah here's at
the end of it
how father's daughter yeah and if
anybody else was trying to do the same
thing maybe a lot tougher universal
wouldn't have gone for them how does
this weigh on you does it so Universal
didn't get in touch with me I got in
touch with Universal Universal was very
hesitant initially because of my surname
and they wanted to knock my surname out
saying you should go ban Anya and Anya
what's the problem with the surname fair
enough they were coming from place of
that people won't accept you people
won't accept her so they were very
hesitant well there is one the name
there as opposed to having a yes
so I said no I want it there are many
things that I would not have if it
wasn't for my family especially my
personal life however I have built at
least 80 85 % of what I have today by
myself I don't want to come across like
I'm not grateful because I am very
grateful I live to hear them say I am
proud of you do they like the choices
you've made
yeah very much so I took my mom to a gig
in Hyderabad and she couldn't stop
crying I dedicated a song to her and now
you know all the fans coming up with
tattoos and letters and you know she was
realizing that my the vision that I have
which to actually impact people through
my music is actually happening and it's
all in my mother so happy that children
who make fun of her saying that she's
got a tear machine we say cuz she cries
after everything but she's wonderful
she's
parents are wonderful my dad's wonderful
so for your music Korea has the build a
surname been an advantage or a
disadvantage I wish I could say
advantage but it's been a disadvantage
for my music career people didn't
agreed to even your my music was of my
business or name prejudged you not a
prejudice she's got it easy not talented
enough but now I think they respect that
people are giving me saying that even
after she's gotten this her name she's
taking up what she's doing it so do you
think you have to work twice as hard
because of your surname could try and
prove to people that you are and
genuinely talented music - yes that's
right yeah oh no he's letting everyone
know where they go to get in his face so
she is very possessive about me super
progressive boom people finger snap ah
just she snapped so possessive no become
close to and yes she says you give me
key after so long
she's my John my next art was gonna be a
football ah nice God you wanna push the
dawn come on that's good
Sam's Tommy mommy mommy coming so I call
us a mommy could she let my second mom
she's a wonderful woman she's really
inspires me always possible welcome
thank you so much for having me you
taught her how to sing yeah she a good
student Sam or a bad student one of the
best I've ever had
how long have you been working on our
Sam almost two years now
so how does onion you compare with all
the other students this is like
assessment like after two years
parent-teacher meeting you call her
mommy so I think with an onion it's very
clear that when we started out it was
pretty much about us not just striving
to be good but just to be exceptional
and I think that's pretty much what
we've worked to you know making her
voice making her persona her performance
and everything really larger than life
is where we're heading to you know and I
think for me it's been an absolute
pleasure to see from where to where
we've gone like within months even when
I came on board for meant to be I think
it was the first song like in a few
weeks we had three or four weeks to get
her ready so she had genuine
good musician now is it just that you're
a genuinely good teacher
Jenny any good teacher but no I think
she's really Mormon she really has a
great musicality about her she's very
dedicated she plays some tour as well
she plays guitar and you can see that
there is so much passion for what she
does so we want to hear some free music
and you said that you had a song
recently yeah would you stand for your
mom when she started crying I think
that's a good places unstoppable of
course are you competitive like are you
always seeing on YouTube and Ghana how
many people are listening to my music
how many are liking it work in it I
don't think I miss that kind of person I
think it's about I think her focus has
always been about being better with each
song and I think that's what we're
striving for it's if within her case
because it's as I said it's not about
just being good it's about being
outstanding it's about being better than
okay so bring it on let's yes music all
right Sam are we all set absolutely all
right so coming up first under knee of
the song that brought your mom to tears
yes it's called unstoppable let's roll
[Music]
nothing can hold her back take out these
fears he fade don't believe what you
hear what if everything I do you could
be in my shoes the pain we've broken
through I believe it breaking all the
rules rules I'll go fight it ain't
nervous we can be unstoppable
I think you are speaking out the words
there were down behind the silence we
can be unstoppable
[Music]
suicide that was that that was that was
a great thing it was fine so what are
the kind of things you're looking out
for when you're coaching the lyric and
how strong it is and how powerful so
when she started it about you know like
tearing down the walls tearing down
every thing that probably holds you back
and that's exactly what all your songs I
write a co-write and I know you want to
stay in the space with English music in
India or do you want to do Bollywood one
day we were just discussing this
yesterday but I'm gonna stay in the
English space for sure because I like to
write my own music I like to express my
own experiences I think in English so I
write in English alright so music is not
the only thing you do you also have a
micro finance company that's apparently
doing really well are you gonna show
that to us next yeah we'd love to
I know Nia tell us about the story of
Swatantra so Tantra means Azadi yes
freedom so I started when I was 17
it's a micro finance company and now
it's your idea my idea okay I remember
went back home and Tomo wanna start
micro finance company and she said do it
but what is microfinance but now it's
become the FinTech what the idea come
from I want to do something to bridge
the income gap in our country burn away
sustainable manner and we just crossed a
thousand cross GLP we take acquired
micro-housing company as well and you're
the brains behind Smith and I mean the
team is wonderful so that can be taken
away and by 2022 we will touch your
billion dollars and I want to apply for
a banking license as well you want your
own company's banking license yeah yeah
so you were serious about this very
seriously
how much no forget about you managed to
spend microfinance it's not a daily
thing now cuz my team is absolutely
amazing but I oversee it very regularly
from strategic point of view
hi guys how's it going so I just wanna
quickly introduce our CEO his name is a
new jet verochka a genius - how's your
microfinance setup different from
everyone else first you were completely
cashless in all ways is digitized and
that is part of the United Nations
General Assembly is a huge huge you know
mission before the lowest interest rate
is well
we have acquired a housing company so
it's all just an urban but we've now
crossed pollinated into certain zero to
help our clients build their own homes
the way we interact with our clients is
very different from how other
institutions do it she a good boss she
Hitler it was yes to say this is on TV
she was boss even when she was 17 yes
did she know anything then all I can say
what chaga thank you so much guys risk
meeting a boy good job guys continue
please continue hi guys how's it going
good
hi how are you wedding congratulations
so nice to see you
how are you she's been with me since how
many years I complete seven years now
seven years so how many lives is Pathan
through touch so funny three million
women three million beneficiaries yeah
so I don't like to call them
beneficiaries because actually these
women repay principal plus interest so
it's not like I'm giving it free of cost
or just taking the principal with our
interest you know so what is the average
ticket size after so we started just ten
thousand rupees and now it's forty
thousand micro-housing touches about two
lakhs so this is your ten thousand
client this is a ten thousand which is
ages ago and I made my mom signed it of
course a dummy check but I keep this and
feel very motivated and yes now we're at
three million and this was when we
crossed thousand GLP which was a month
ago
our clients name was a ho dia by and
she's from Rajasthan and she is a small
farmer and the purpose of the loan was a
buffalo purchase so if you go back and
check what they did with the money was
it useful yes if we call it loan
utilization check so our field ox will
go back and see whether it's been used
and it's normally always used and the
NPA again is a huge your sign police
what kind of any case do you have
currently is a two percent which is a
very high for us because we were at 0.5
percent demonization hit us but I think
we'll reduce back to about all of your
clients couldn't repay because of the
monetization yeah but there's no
stopping us and it's getting better it's
getting better and I think in the next
six months will only see progress I had
the privilege of painting with Angela
al-amin Angie and now a joint
collaboration for joint collaboration
and the proceedings go to charity so
this was a I did a little bit of the
blouse and the background that means a
lot to me
I love churches I love cost work these
two paintings were in my dad's first
office aha I don't know whether he gave
it to me or I just stole it but I said I
wanted him I first office so what's the
one cred or that dad's taught you about
business a lot of freedom he let me me
he sort of allowed me to make my own
mistakes so but the one thing he said is
no shortcuts
I think morals is something that I've
grown up with and you know the port we
saw downstairs or try our best me the
rest to go it is something that I really
go by as well does he oversee operations
oh he's giving you a free hand
does he have somebody in this office was
reporting back to him in fact my team
it's very sweet day if the final
approval comes from me not from my dad
so my dad says something in jest they'd
be like we'll have a check with Miss
Bell or check with the nanny or whatever
they call me here your boss and boss I
probably call the leader whatever you
want to say I don't like I don't
typically like the word boss because the
neighbor you know it's not the best
sounding you know but yeah I am happy
very grateful I started from scratch I
think I deserve it
do you think of a time when you want to
focus full-time on being a businesswoman
that's all about it
politics is something that interests me
really
politics in what we see you CL see
yourself as Nathan and Mia Bullough one
day no but my purpose in life is to
impact people in the most positive way
and to change mindsets to break stigmas
so whether that's my music whether
through my businesses whatever it may be
and I think politics India has a hue
impact so that is a feel that interests
me but I'm a politician I'm not
answering this question around this
usual answer who's your favorite I think
they're all crooks I suspect and I'm
deeply doubtful of every single
politician so this is interesting I like
the idea of trying to give back to
society okay
giving back to society I think I just
intrinsically want to impact people so
even if a fan comes up and says I
listened your song early in the morning
and it pumps me up that makes me feel
like I have done my job well or if I see
a tattoo on someone's hansung and an
umbrella or Nonya I don't endorse that
often yes I've seen like me many many
people getting tattoos I don't endorse
anyone getting a tattoo of my name or my
songs what makes if you like if
someone's gotten it permanently it means
something to them as you simply I met a
girl who said that my dad and I just
listened to your music all music all the
time your songs all the time and he
passed away a month ago your songs mean
so much to me a Paralympic gold medalist
Niranjan came for one of my gigs India
gives them like a Indian flag with the
name written on it so he said that
people call me the pride of the nation
but for me you are my pride and he gave
that to me so that meant a lot so there
was a Javon who got in touch with me
through Instagram saying that I barely
have any network but I have managed to
get a radio and I know what time your
song plays at so I clip it on 94.3 so I
can listen to your music if that's what
you've been going nice no stories like
this I know my music is making a
difference I want to become a better
artist I'm gonna evolve I want to become
better person I'm very motivated to take
my artistry to another level so you've
got offbeat and interesting choices in
your life in terms of your work in terms
of your passions and I'm told even in
terms of your fitness routine do you
want to see me play football football
yeah are you gonna do I see me playing
so it seems there's nothing that you
like to do the normal way most people
would either go to the gym or run I see
I know Mia Bullough likes to play
football on a rooftop in Mumbai I love
playing football it's the spot that I go
to I've been playing since school since
rocky G when I was in London actually
people don't know I paid for Fulham FC
women's team the football club the
football professional football I have it
was for the B team though and then I
played for the a team in Oxford the
Blues you're a serious football player
huh I love it
Rahul you're in your diary as well huh I
didn't know we were playing football I
never brought spikes shoot actually I'm
wearing the wrong fizzy stuff so I
should be wearing your tie one bang
studs it's on a rooftop is a lovely nice
by breeze blowing we don't have this
kind of breeze you know that's too much
pollution so apart from football I was
reading somewhere that you've been a
swimmer and have played chess it appears
pretty serious level my mom is very much
into sports so I love come Sri
should we see you guys play frequently
so I've been like touring a lot so I
haven't played in like months you play
pretty well up that's not necessarily
true
football's now my main spot I play like
it sports much more so you're also
promoting mental health in a big way
right yeah the fight against depression
and yes because it's very real and the
stigma is so high as in it's so terrible
that it can get even more daunting
I think physical health and mental
health should be on the same platform
nothing to be ashamed of so what
position do you play on when you're
playing football left wing
ah well done then so it's time man I'm
here for the job be made showdown
here's what's gonna happen I'm gonna be
goalkeeper you're gonna give it the best
kick you've got you got five shots let's
see how many you can get in you would
say four I'll get one in okay so I have
to save for you gotta get one in later
yeah how this goes let's do it come on
oh well done all the great shot the
goalkeeper I had no chance to move
excellent well done now I need now you
lose four yeah no that was it a fair bet
you didn't tell me you'd go swirling
right kick on a kick like Messi who was
expecting that one
alright short number two oh that came
straight to the goalkeeper that was easy
short number three come on Antonia oh
hey good save man good say it short as
well you're early within okay so you got
one in three you can run out to you in
the bed underneath very safe one hey
that was straight again
okay last shot down in yeah one more to
win the wait okay so lots of pressure on
and yeah go for it
hey but anyway you stuck to the score
you predicted so in that sense
well done this was a super fun episode
of job beam it yeah but goalkeeper yeah
you hit a few straight ones but that one
in the corner a two-state mercy well
being proud of that is that but I want a
bet you did I'm happy to concede defeat
well done it's superb and you kick
really well at first short now I'm
wearing to the corner that was superb
when I went in my heart went to my
mother's oh boy
all five are going in this is going to
be disastrous and oh no no but this was
great fun thanks for having me it's a
pleasure

dlIUe-BHz6s,Nirav Modi&#39;s Lavish Apartment In London,India Today gets you exclusive details of diamantaire Nirav Modi's posh 8 million pound apartment in London's West End. As per ...,2019-03-09T10:34:42Z,India Today,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dlIUe-BHz6s/hqdefault.jpg,"rekka news is coming in near of Modi is
staying at a three-bedroom flat
occupying half of a floor of the
Landmark Center Point Tower we just got
this information coming in we've tried
and even placed it on a map for you that
you would get more information about
exactly where he stays
I believe it's an extremely posh area
and Western London levena Tandon joining
me live from London itself
novena tell us more about the apartment
he's staying in we believe that it's
extremely high-end in Porsche yes it is
as far as the report of a telegraph I
have to mention that the apartment that
they have mentioned that in Tottenham
Court Road near central point centre
point and it is indeed a very tall very
very posh building with the other end of
Oxford Circus and very well connected to
every place over go quick sale from West
End to officer consume a large to
anywhere that one would like it's a cool
point a very very expensive apartment
possibly about eight million pounds so
yes it is indeed a apportion location it
is indeed a sought-after try and and of
a man who is sought after in India now
venadu Stephen apologies are joining me
from the newsroom to tell us more about
where need of Modi is residing
right what we know vehicle so far is
that near of Modi is the residing in a
London which is close to Tottenham Court
Road it is an apartment a three-bedroom
apartment is what we're learning from
the piece which has been done by a
British uh publication The Telegraph The
Telegraph has reported that he lives
around Tottenham Court Road at centre
spot centre point which is a skyscraper
he practically owns half a floor in that
apartment building over there and he
lived so very close to where he set up
shop as well as per that Telegraph
report again which were quoting from
right now and we have independently
verified as to where his business
interests are listed as well in terms of
the company's house a website in the
United Kingdom as well in details that
are investigating agencies are privy to
as well this is an old Bond Street of
where he is officially registered in
terms of the in terms of the business
that he set up he set this up in 2014
Needham OD Private Limited but in terms
of the listing on the UK website the
Companies House website it is listed in
the name of another individual who is
not an Indian we do not have a complete
details as to who this individual is and
how is he associated with near of Modi
that amira Modi has in fact a partnered
with him and set up shop in a
clandestine fashion so he obviously in a
way can evade the law per se the law
cannot say that he owes all of this
money in India to this bank which has
obviously approached the investigative
agencies they have registered cases
under the PMLA Act against him they have
approached international agencies
including the Interpol a red corner
notice has been issued
he owes thirty thousand crores to them
and he still doing business elsewhere so
very cleverly what Neelam Modi has done
is he's trying to hoodwink the system so
he's partnered with a foreigner to set
up shop in London and we also know that
he has business interest in Hong Kong as
well and is living this very lavish
lifestyle that we can see in terms of
the images on our screen right now of
that three bedroom
apartment at Centrepointe call me to
stay with me I'm going to go back to La
Vina
levena let's just also talk about need
of Modi the changes that you see in his
appearance also a word on when he was
approached by The Telegraph
correspondent
he seemed to be unfettered he seemed to
be completely indifferent about the fact
that there is an extradition request
that has been issued by the Indian
government earlier requesting the UK
government to extradite him he looked
like he was really living the life and
my question there actually there's an
extradition request has been lying for
months in and now and nothing has
happened about it and as we have
mentioned before a journalist was find
his address out journalist Alfred would
find his address but what about the
government figuring out from national
insurance number from company house from
various other sources that they have are
the exact address of a need of Modi'in
you be saying that yes they have
provided all the addresses all and the
Xterra UK agustin was not moving on it
what is the hitch we would never know he
would be never told especially because
they never speak so yes he was
unfettered because he felt he could be
not touched and he's been living a
central London expensive lifestyle
he looks extremely different it took
evenly on this world to to recognize him
he put on a bit of weight he has is now
got a beard and he's been underground
for a while since his last picture how
he'd like to do to now and he I think
exactly knows what he is doing then
which is why he is unfettered because
and he is possibly watching all the
extradition cases that have been going
on and we have had two successes
recently with mr. Mallya Angeline's
table he measured his his faith he's
measured where he's going to mention his
responses measures and I won't be
surprised it is already doing all the
legal Rosen that is why the comment no
comment because he doesn't have to step
foot anywhere
easily so he is all right he is because
there one other thing that the jaundice
phases and as you applied for political

sethck2ITu8,Nirav Modi Got U.K Insurance Number Before India&#39;s Extradition request,India Today gets inside details of India's extradition request to Nirav Modi on Nirav Modi. Sources in the Indian High Commission ...,2019-03-09T10:05:43Z,India Today,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sethck2ITu8/hqdefault.jpg,"sources in the London Indian High
Commission in UK claim that feels August
28 in multiple requests have been sent
to the UK home offers the communication
from the Enforcement Directorate went to
a month back requesting UK home office
to respond on the extradition request
near of Modi in September 2018 former
Indian High Commissioner had sought for
a meeting with the UK Home Secretary
Sajid Javid but that meeting did not
transpire near of Modi's National
Insurance number which allows him to
conduct business in UK came and we
believe before India had sent the
extradition request punish Barney
joining me live Manish the ball now in
the UK government's court and according
to that MEA press briefing that we just
cut to life it seems that a word is
still awaited from the Home Secretary
Neville it is very interesting where the
car because remember in the month of
August 28th it was London who informed
the Indian counterpart that Nero Modi
has has been spotted in the country and
that is when the Enforcement Directorate
and Central Bureau of Investigation sent
to extradition requests before the UK
authorities and those acceleration
requests had also the addresses of Nero
Modi now recently there was an
intelligence input also from the
agencies is that Mira Modi has changed
his look and the agencies also shared
photograph with the Indian counterpart
now all these evidence and the recent
development in this case have been
shared with the UK counterpart but it is
very important to note that since last
six months there has been nothing done
by the UK authorities as far as
extradition is concerned now he owns a
business in London everyone is aware
that on which address that business is
registered people know where Nero Modi's
thing but as far as the local
authorities and his provisional arrest
is concerned nothing has been done so it
is quite interesting and quite shocking
also that why no action has been taken
by the UK authorities
explains the National Insurance number
punish what explains the swanky place
that is staying in the so office that he
is operating out of Louisville this is
very important for a person like me
Ramadi as far as the procedure to get
this number is concerned it is not very
difficult but for a person who is
fugitive and there has been I read
called notice against him issued by the
Interpol it is very important because
based on this number he can operate the
business and that is why in 2018 he
incorporated a new company Nero Modi
limited and that is why he is operating
his business and you came now o his
multiple companies like five-star
international limited solar exports
these are the companies which were on
the radar of Central Bureau of
Investigation Enforcement Directorate
and now the operations of these
companies have been seized by the Indian
agencies but now he has incorporated new
from his operating his business is
staying in London and all all is of the
UK authorities are aware of this so even
recently there was a meeting with the
Indian counterpart with the Enforcement
Directorate which India also once again
requested that you should take action
against him but the file is still with
the UK Home Secretary till late we are
not aware if the UK Home Secretary has
signed those acceleration papers or not
and once the one and if those papers are
not signed till the time he cannot be
provisionally arrested and extradition
process will not be initiated so till on
the way we have been given to understand
by the agency is that now the diplomatic
pressure can only help Indian agencies
as well as Indian government as far as
Mira Modi's extradition is concerned but
all right so from what I understand from
what you just said is the clarity needs
to be sought now from the UK Home
Secretary and the Home Office in the
United Kingdom do stay with me Manish

IBZG8jSuewo,Nirav Modi Tracked Down In London; What Happened To The Extradition Request?,"Fugitive billionaire diamantaire Nirav Modi, one of the prime accused in the Punjab National Bank scam, has been tracked down ...",2019-03-09T07:35:08Z,India Today,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IBZG8jSuewo/hqdefault.jpg,"good morning and welcome to India today
and follow me Saha the top story we are
following this morning fugitive
billionaire diamond 10 near of Modi who
has been absconded after defrauding the
Punjab National Bank is freely roaming
on the streets of London uk-based
newspaper The Telegraph has tracked down
neros Modi who has changed his
appearance and can be seen sporting a
handlebar moustache now he was
confronted by the newspaper on the
allegations levelled against him but he
refused to answer any of the questions
an extradition request against him
spending before the UK authorities the
red corner notice had also been issued
against near of Modi yesterday his
palatial Ali Baba glow was demolished by
the Indian authorities those are
pictures of native Modi the fugitive
diamond tere who was wanted in India for
money laundering for defrauding Punjab
National Bank off close to 13,000 crore
rupees now roaming quite freely on the
streets of London being accosted by a
British newspaper journalist who asks
him some very pointed questions about
the allegations against him about the
extradition requests that India has made
with the United Kingdom to bring him
back to face justice in India about his
own request for political asylum in
Britain but nearer Modi refuses to
answer any of those questions my
colleague levena in fact now joins me
from London
levena it appears that need of Modi is
living quite freely in London he has set
up business again in London he has
rented a very lavish apartment of Oxford
Street as well and he seems to have
acquired himself a National Insurance
number as well despite the fact that
there is an Interpol notice against him
yes it does seem like that now
absolutely correct but the extradition
request now the big question of course
his what happens to the extradition
request up till now
it wasn't clear it wasn't possibly known
which is a big question mark but yes
let's believe that it wasn't not very
exactly he lives but now one knows
according to the report where he lives
he lives near Tottenham Court Road in
Center Point which is a very plush place
in a fresh set of apartments so it
should not be a problem for the
government to now turn this extradition
request into a warrant an extradition
warrant that happened in the case of mr.
Mallya as well but he has been doing all
this what he has managed to do all that
a house of a company and all of the
national insurance number as well
because in this country and according to
the law here unless he is proven guilty
and he has done something in this
country they cannot take any action or
cannot restrict any of his rights to
work or live here because he possibly
carries a some kind of document which
allows him to do that so unless he is
proven guilty
he's charged with all of that he will be
allowed access to everything but the
fake question of courses will the
government of Ukraine now add will the
Home Office act and turn the extradition
request into a warrant right so hence
the question Lavina why have the UK
authorities not acted on India's
extradition request which was given to
them in September last year so many
months but the home office doesn't seem
to have moved forward on it
Home Office doesn't give answers to any
such questions or particular case but
what we are given to believe from very
sources is that the home office did not
have the exact address or the
authorities here could not provide the
exact address of need of money therefore
a arrest warrant couldn't be given to
the personnel but now that they know
where possibly he lives and he where his
shop is it should not be a very
difficult decision for home office or a
difficult act for Home Office to carry
out of turning the extradition request
into a warrant right levena thank you so
much for all of those details my
colleagues or Gita and Manish are also
with me let me know just stay on with me
because I take that one point with
Manish which you just mentioned about
the fact that the Enforcement
Directorate did not provide the address
the exact address for where near of Modi
is living and hence the UK authorities
couldn't move forward is that the case
Manish Javal as far as the Indian
agencies are concerned they have been
what we have been given to understand is
that there were two addresses of
neuropathy which were given to the
London authorities and the fact remains
that it was the London authorities who
inform the Indian counterparts that they
have located near ahmadies so as far as
location is concerned this is not going
to be a major issue because as far as
Nero moody and given the position of
Nero Modi it is not going to be very
difficult for the UK authorities or the
Indian intelligence agencies to find the
address of Nero Modi in London in fact
there was a photograph also which was
shared by the intelligences with the
Indian counterpart also that he has
changes look and he is staying in London
recently there was a meeting between the
Enforcement Directorate and the UK
counterpart in which the enforcement
directed again said that you should take
action against Nero Modi
they have given the address and as far
as the company is concerned now the
company's name is Nero Modi Limited it
was incorporated in December 2017
and in last year there was some reports
from the Indian agencies to the UK to
the UK authorities also in which they
shared the information that now he has
incorporated a new company near amudhan
Limited in which his business partner
may happen sally was also there but he
recently designed so as far as business
address all those things are concerned
Indian agencies maintained that they
have shared everything with the UK
authorities but it is up to the UK
secretary Home Secretary and the UK
counterpart to take action against him
but in the last six months what we have
seen is that nothing has been done by
the UK authorities right for taking that
with Lavina now Lavina so what Manish is
telling us is that the address was
provided by the Indian authorities to
the UK authorities their privy they know
where exactly near of Modi has been
living also that he did incorporated a
company in his own name near of Modi
Limited so he is doing business and
apparently it's listed on the Companies
House website as well so he's doing
business again in his own name this
website the address of the company is
linked to the flat he is living in in
London all of this information which is
concrete precise information doesn't
that make one question the fact that all
the UK authorities deliberately dragging
their feet on this case
the question of course it raises a
question mark in fact it puts the
question mark writes across the home
office and it remains to be answered as
to if they do know all the information
that Manish has been saying they do then
why has the extradition requests been
lying on for months in end but now that
there is a more concrete because the two
addresses apparently were possibly did
not show need of Modi to be there but
now that again he's been seen around
there is a website there is a company
and that's where I'm saying that we
would need to now see with more concrete
evidence coming what does the home
office do so all eyes on home office
once again absolutely because the
question again Lavina is that if a
journalist can find out exactly where
near of Modi is living can track him
from his residence to his office post
questions to him as freely as he did in
that video which the Telegraph has
obviously uploaded on the website for
everyone to see why were the UK
authorities not able to do the same
given on the basis of the information
that the Indian authorities have
provided to them may have been a little
off the mark here in there maybe but it
was quite precise as Manisha's been
saying
yes it does put the question in the
court of the home office they do not
answer any any queries to specific or
general cases at all they are absolutely
zipped and tight-lipped about anything
but from a past experience one can say
there would be some hitch or the other
some documentation or the other that
they might come up with or it might be
in process so now that there is as he
has been caught on camera a fair and
square it is very possible that they
should move and come out of the inertia
that they have shown for over months
also brexit has been a big issue here
it's taken over a lot of governmental
processes I have to add in the end but
this is a very serious matter India has
been pressing upon it Mallya has already
been extradited his case is pending in
the now the higher court and it is very
likely that he might get back so it is
there is a lot of pressure on the Home
Office to move I suppose now from what I
hear from Manish as well so indeed a
question mark that is looking for a very
concrete answer from the Home Office
right
levena stay on with me mr. ml Sharma
former special director of the CBI is
now joining us on the phone line so
those visuals that we're seeing offer
near of Modi roaming the streets of
London quite freely it appears that he
seems to have set up himself a quite
well in the United Kingdom now what we
know is that there was several requests
extradition requests has been put before
the UK authorities and several reminders
put before the UK authorities by the
Enforcement Directorate which is
investigating the case against Neera
Modi
despite that the United Kingdom is
chosen not to act so far what can we do
now what is in our knowledge may not be
in the knowledge of these competent of
quality UK therefore our mystery should
forcefully bring this to the notice of
UK authorities so since our extradition
request is pending against neither moody
you here authorities have no choice but
to arrest him and to proceed with
extradition proceedings this is the only
line of action that I can think of to
say that there is God maybe in our
statement because it will not be in
their knowledge this hole should be
forcefully brought to the notice by our
external affairs ministry okay so but
what we know from the authorities over
here in India as our colleagues have
been also pointing out is that we did
give them a fair amount of detail in
terms of near of Modi's current business
status where he possibly is residing in
London as well and address couple of
addresses may be in order to sort of
because we may not have been very clear
sitting here in India where exactly but
we did provide with a few leads aren't
they supposed to act on the same key
point is that my understanding years in
shifting places so therefore you know
due diligence has to be exercised by the
UK authorities to pin him down another
thing that is to be noted is that you
get a sovereign country so we can only
persuade that country diplomatically to
act on the extradition request and
beyond that nothing can be done I'm sure
Schama thank you so much for speaking to
India today going across to my colleague
Gita Mohan foreign affairs editor Gita
the question seems to boil down to what
do we do now those are images of near of
Modi that the Telegraph has put out
roaming the streets of London they have
given us addresses as to where he
resides where he works what kind of
business he set up in London what kind
of facilities he's acquired for himself
in London
itself possibly pushed forward obviously
by UK authorities in terms of acquiring
a national security number the business
that she's been able to set up as well
diplomatically what do we do now how do
we move forward because so far all our
requests all our reminders have fallen
on deaf ears right follow me and we've
had this problem with the United Kingdom
on various issues and various counts as
well UK has been has been allowing space
to such offenders there's this entire
concept of PR status through investment
the kind of money that these people have
put in in the United Kingdom is the
reason why it has become a safe haven
for these fraudsters and and a certain
amount of protection that is provided by
not by not pursuing these these cases
and and actually going and finding those
those people out and and and then
starting the procedure of either
deportation extradition or if there is
there has to be a case then registering
that case in the United Kingdom this
whole dragging the feet in UK has become
common practice when it comes to those
who invest in the United Kingdom and
that's the reason why we've seen India
pursuing after having a information of
need of Modi's presence in London we
know that there are other countries also
that India engaged with and sent a
request to when they thought that they
were there and then finally the
extradition request to the United
Kingdom but without exact address
if you know that the person is there you
send the request saying that we know
there is enough that we've gathered with
regards to his presence in the United
Kingdom but the details of where he is
are putting out a lookout notice and
having the authorities look for nirav
Modi UK or any individual for that
matter follow me India's had a very
bitter experience with UK when it comes
to these economic offenders and we've
seen a UK dragged its feet when it comes
to these cases and such individuals but
with
with the media house coming out and
tracking near of Modi down there is much
that that the UK authorities will now
have to do because there are exact
addresses they know where where the
individual lives India is going to
gather more details we'll be getting in
touch with the authorities and will
again refresh they request that they
have had they've made with regards to
the extradition earlier of movie
having said that follow me if near of
Modi is going to seek political asylum
speak of political victimization then it
becomes a longer and more tedious case
for India to handle with the UK which in
fact has been his line of defense kita
stay on with me requesting all my
colleagues to stay on with me we've got
some breaking news that's coming thanks

shattered the glass ceiling for women in
India's aviation industry meet Tanya
Sonia India's first and only female
firefighter in the aviation industry I
think actually woman always in awe
survives orbs and the prove herself in
this society so according to me every
woman is a fighter with the master's
degree in botany Tonya could have
settled for a more conventional career
but then she had other plans in my very
childhood I really want to do something
different which can bring positive
change to the society so when I saw this
advertisement I was very much sure that
this is it because I really wanted to do
something new fresh challenging
Fitness is an essential part of the job
and candidates are selected after
rigorous endurance tests which include
medical and physical tests along with
the driving skills Tanya says she feels
no insecurity working with male
counterparts in highly challenging work
ecosystem
actually I consider myself very lucky
because when I joined the last year here
my male colleagues are my male officers
are very you know supportive so now they
give me or they supported me every time
they guided me every time so of course I
am a very lucky in that case
[Music]
after completing her rigorous training
tanya was inducted into the airport fire
services last year
she's now deployed at the fire service
training center in Kolkata
yes sky's the limit in this area and we
should not say that ladies can be
restricted in this area or they can't do
this job and although we we anticipate
they can also perform very well all the

Hafiz Saeed Jamaat of Dava and its
affiliate fella and Sonia Foundation
under the anti-terrorism act now this
move comes after many turnarounds by
Pakistan on the issue
amid the growing tensions between India
and Pakistan over the pull Varma terror
attacks now in 4th March Pakistan had
claimed that it had banned
jod and fell on Sonia however an India
today television investigation found
Pakistan's tough stance on terror to be
false as it had only put the to terror
groups on the watchlist and not on the
prescribed list
meanwhile the Imran Khan government has
taken JJ Mohammed chief Masood Azhar's
brother mafia bill roof and Sun Hamas as
air into preventive detention along with
44 other terrorists in fact Pakistan
maintains that the action has not been
taken under pressure so Gita we have
been actually talking all along about
the sham trials by Pakistan they go
ahead and ban Jamaat agava reliance on

regards jesh now we hear that they have
taken Masood Azhar's brother in a son
into preventive custody well they have
taken Masood Azhar others brother and
son in preventive custody even after

Pakistan could very well be on the road
to becoming blacklisted if the review in

is not believing it

20 seats and its allies will be
contesting in the rest 20 so the option
of for the DMDK is only with the AI DMK
it is interesting lastly that the DMDK
has emerged as the flavor of this
political season because the DMDK was
actively would buy both in travillian
parties but what we are hearing from
sources is that the DMDK
has decided to go with the AI DMK but
they are bargaining very hard because
they want to be treated on par with the
PM k the PM k has got about 7 seats in
their idea new BJP allies and the DMDK
says that they are not too less and they
would want the same number of seats but
the IDM k has decided to part only with
about 4 looks of our seats and this is
not acceptable for the DMDK
all of today the DMDK was in a huddle
they were trying to speak with their
district secretaries and are trying to
send out back-channel talks with the AI
DM k and it is interesting that are they
still not successful in bringing captain
over to this alliance even as Prime
Minister Narendra Modi is set to visit
Chennai tomorrow okay Prime Minister in
Chennai tomorrow this is of course
remember the Prime Minister's Tamilnadu
outreach and it's an important state as
look Priya points out there thanks very
much for joining us let me give you a
sense let's go to a magic wall and tell
you how the Alliance's stack up in the
state of Tamil Nadu take a look at the
big numbers now in Tamil Nadu
this is how the alliance is stack up on
the countdown in Tamil Nadu 40 seats on
offer so it's a major state in this
election the DMK has 20 they've decided
to contest 20 the Congress will contest
end the vck the the
dominated party CPI CPI M will contest
two seats each the empty empty of yko
one but he's got an Raju Sabha seat
IG k KD m ki u ml one each so this is a
bit of a mahogany bundle forged by the
DMK Congress in team UPA in Tamilnadu
what about team NDA a IDM case the
dominant partner they've got a contest
twenty-eight the BJP will Qantas v the
PM a seven that's a total of four Tina

0Hw46m7DEN4,Pakistan Economy Badly Hit Following Recent Tensions With India,Pakistan's economy has been hit badly after the recent tensions with India. Two major trade exhibitions have been postponed and ...,2019-03-05T13:56:02Z,India Today,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0Hw46m7DEN4/hqdefault.jpg,"and we've got breaking news coming in
pakistan's economy
has been significantly damaged in the
last few days
two major trade expositions have been
postponed
due to uncertain flight schedules on the
back of the current hostilities with
india
trade losses are surging after the
latest episode
in pakistani waters it is expected that
some companies and shipments which were
scheduled to reach karachi port
are likely to be delayed as well the
pakistani rupee
is also getting hit badly as it has
already gone up to
139.8 pakistani rupees to the u.s
dollar so the economy being hit on all
sides amidst the current tensions
that remember was started by pakistan
itself with the pulvama attack
and it is harming every single pakistani
goods are likely to get more expensive
shipments are likely to be delayed
and the economy at large is being
affected i want to get in
india today's uh hamza amir for more on
this hamza
shipments delayed trade exposed
postponed
what is the current assessment on the
impact of the current situation on
pakistan's economy
uh will shift the current situation is
not that good because see
in pakistan there are two major trade
extra exposed efforts supposed to happen
in karachi and lahore
and now they have been delayed because
of the uncertainty on the flights and
airspace of pakistan
number two uh after uh you know this
the borders closed and india actually
raised the import custom duty or by 200
percent
uh we reported uh you know hundreds and
hundreds of tankers and containers
carrying uh cement and other things uh
they were stranded and they were forced
to go back so that's another
loss pakistan suffered then the imports
of pakistan have gone up only for the
fact that because the rupee is getting
badly devaluated
and the freight on board the freight
charges have gone up and that is why
import
quantity has actually fallen down
extensively
the rupee in pakistan right now stands
at 139.80
per one dollar and now in banks of
pakistan
like myself i get paid in
get foreign dollars in pakistan so even
though my money comes in dollars comes
into the dollar account yet my bank
calls me and gives me
a rate which is at least four to five
rupees less than
uh the actual open market rate of 139 i
get around 135
and they'd convert the money and put it
into my pack rupee account if i say no
to that the money goes back so this is
how pakistan is retaining dollars
to ensure that economy does not fall
down really badly okay so the situation
is not good as far as the economy is
concerned conflict
has these untoward after effects on
countries that are involved in them
pakistan currently reeling under the
present standoff with india
hamza thank you very much for putting
that into perspective
for us and the manner in which the
pakistani economies
has been hit and is likely to worsen in
the coming days

Modi government's order to Air India
which makes it mandatory for all its
cabin and cockpit crew members to sage a
hint after every announcement Mehbooba
Mufti tweeted and I quote little
surprise that with the elections round
the corner the josh of patriotism hasn't
even spared the skies
let there be joined that people should
all have sense of patriotism and the
victory of the nation in every field the
timing is suspect and they think that
they are the Takeda's of patriotism
which is I think very immature executive
editor Gaurav Savin joins us for more on
this and goddess there are mixed
you know opinions on the the chanting of
je Hin then singing the national anthem
in cinema hall some feel that if one
needn't necessarily wear their
nationalism on their sleeve some feel
that you know it's a it's a nice way to
instill patriotism what are you hearing
is it only going to be restricted to Air
India oval other flights and Airlines
also follow suit I want it I in fact the
airlines and private airline specially
as preceded Air India multiple private
airlines have been saying giant while
greeting the passengers and flyers for
quite some time in at least two private
airline pilots in the initiate
conversation when they give details
about takeoff or altitude or distance to
destination they initiate conversation
with JN and sign out with the JN for
quite some time it's only now that Air
India has started doing this but since
this is election season every every
action whether of the government or
government owned or run entities is
being viewed through the electoral
spectrum but as you very rightly pointed
out our ticket this is something that
comes from within so you know that tent
of patriotism so you know kts you'll see
and several others may wonder that you
know you have to wear patriotism on your
sleeve or is somebody or take it out of
patriotism all some may believe whether
it comes from within knows it doesn't
come from within

straight on at the big story of the day
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stored
into the opposition for demanding proof
of the airstrikes now speaking in his
home turf in Gujarat the Prime Minister
took a jive at opposition parties and
said that their statements demanding
proof of the airstrike are making
headlines in Pakistani newspapers the
prime minister also said that the
opposition can abuse him but opposition
leader should at least believe the army
on Monday senior Congress leader Kapil
Sibal demanded proof of the airstrikes
simple in a tweet also accused Prime
Minister Modi and his government of
politicizing the terror and said that
the international media is reporting no
terrorist casualties in the air strike a

Mallicoat India is witnessing massive
political sniping over the number of
terrorists killed in the strikes while
Indian Air Force chief has refused to
give the numbers the BJP president Amit
Shah has come up with an estimate of 250
here's a full report
Air Force is not in a position to
clarify that how many people are inside
it that way we don't count human
casualties we count
targets have we hit or not it
the Indian Air Force pulled off a daring
raid deep inside Pakistan when it formed
atterow camp of the Jesse Mohammad and
it's aircraft return unscathed
but the government of india has tied
itself in knots while projecting the
airstrikes as big success
the very first day sources in the
government estimated the enemy casualty
in the bomb attack at 300 a number that
made headlines since then many leaders
have floated several numbers through the
husband year while Union Minister s s
hallo alle acclaimed the aim was to send
a message and not inflict large-scale
destruction his party chief stuck his
neck out to give another estimate the
opposition very of being seen as
questioning the Armed Forces initially
shied away from commenting on the
airstrike success the first salvo at the
government was fired by mamta banerjee

jamaat-e-islami for five years under the
anti-terror law the government now is
likely to ban the oil India Korea
conference under the same law as propose
the government is indicated that the
move is under consideration earlier the
notification banning the jamaat-e-islami
group was issued by the Ministry of Home
Affairs after a high-level meeting on
security chaired by Prime Minister
Narendra Modi on Thursday my colleague a
Kemal cheats on do is now on the phone
line with me Kumari this will be a huge
and a big move if the government in fact
does go forward indeed and ban the oil
India hariette conference but follow me
absolutely and we've been hearing in the
past four and a half years but first let
me come to jamaat-e-islami because that
is going to be the main organization
responsible for propagation of
separatist and radical ideology of the
Kashmiri Valley and they have been in
close association with all party who
raised conference now we've been hearing
that all these a PFC members including
its top leaders are already under house
arrest now there has been a huge
crackdown on the jamaat-e-islami leaders
as well asking even the several schools
run by them which is the falaya
armed trust to be actually stopped
functioning now is the chance for the
all party who discontent leaders which
always being through the top leadership
including Yasin Malik Sahib re Shah
Geelani VY's / Faro and this is the
first first step which is being mulled
at this point of time several cases of
Ni slapped against separatist leaders
one of the reasons given being given as
the move by the centre but remember with
the country going into election mode the
government doesn't really have much time
if they have to come up with a
notification it has to be done as soon
as possible but this is being mullberry

terrorist bases within Pakistan as deep
as 50 kilometers inside Pakistan the
Pakistanis yesterday said they are going
to retaliate
now since morning there has been very
very quick and fast paced developments
which are coming in number one all
airports especially Srinagar Jammu leh
Amritsar pattern coat all these airports
have been stopped for civilian Jews the
traffic has also been stopped in India
and all these at this point of time all
flights have been canceled the Indian
fighter pilots are are on a two minute
standby but in two minutes they can take
off and are prepared for any eventuality
same is happening in Pakistan Karachi
Rawal Pindi sialkot Islamabad all the
airports have been shot and the Pakistan
Air Force is also on the alert since
morning
there is a lot of you know
misinformation which has also been
spread out in fact early morning we
began the day better even an encounter
in English in Kashmir in the show peon
area where to Geoff Muhammad terrorists
were killed after a four hour long
intense gun battle on the other side
Pakistan since yesterday has heated up
the entire LOC in fact at many places in
many sectors Pakistan is firing across
the line of control and Indian troops
are retaliating small arms fire medium
on fire and at some places even large
caliber weapons have been used by the
Pakistanis in desperation because they
have completely been rattled by what
Indian Air Force did on in fact
yesterday now very importantly in fact
today in a very sad incident one chopper
of the Indian Air Force crashed in the
bottom area and the Pakistanis were very
quick to take it take credit they said
that it was two Pakistani f16 aircraft
which entered Indian airspace and
dropped a few bombs
where did they drop the bombs nobody
knows because the fact remains we acted
on the terror camps where was Pakistanis
where did the Pakistanis drop this bomb
what were their targets we don't know
the
thus in the Indian side in fact that
sources in the Ministry of Defense and
intelligence agencies have told in India
today that as soon as two Pakistani f-16
aircrafts came near next to the LOC
su-30 sukhoi 30 aggressive patrol of
indian air force pushed them back this
was scared they ran back reports coming
in that one f16 aircraft of the
Pakistani Air Force has been shot down
by the Indian Air Force high-level
preparedness but what was most bizarre
in fact Erdem was claimed by Pakistani
media that they have shot down two
Indian Air Force jet and very quickly
they put out a video of what they
claimed was the Indian jet which
crash-landed in Pakistan Occupied
Kashmir they also claimed that the
foreign minister claimed with a
blusterous voice we have shown them we
made you know we give we have taught
them a lesson the fact remains if you
remember Pakistani Air Force tweeted
more than 24 hours back we are awake
Pakistan you sleep it seems that after
they were woken up by the thunderous
dropping of the bombs from India now
they can only dream of retaliation and a
fictitious story was created by am I
saying that this is the vid you know
visual or the video which the Pakistanis
put which an exclusive watermark as the
Indian aircraft which was short targeted
and crashed in the Pakistan's
retaliatory fire now take a look at this
very interesting piece Pakistanis have
shown this picture of an Indian Air
Force jet yes these are the Indian Air
Force jet marking it's a mid 27 aircraft
it says taeju six five seven is the
marking on this aircraft and it is next
to a wall which which Pakistan is show
as an area in azad kashmir as they call
it in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir absolute
false misinformation lies being spread
by Pakistan the bravado seems to be only
in the script written by is PR in the
Pakistani Air Force and beyond
[ __ ] which has been embarrassed so
badly that they just want to use any
Fischer story any claim to in fact show
to their countrymen that we are a lot
doing something and why am I saying that
it is an absolute nonsense because this
is the real picture this is the picture
of the same video which was taken in
2016 not today not last year not the
year before three years back this plane
crash did take place in India's jodpur
it's a mig-27 this day a plane in fact
crashed down because of technical
difficulties and Pakistanis are using an
old video right now to claim that there
they're very well-equipped Air Force has
done it has shown to the Indians that
they can hit back and this is the video
that they use in fact when they claim
that we have given a befitting reply
well as far as this lie which has been
busted the fact check which we have done
very clearly shows Pakistan not only is
nervous extends but a nervousness in
tension is resorting to its best
tactical response that is lies and
propaganda for the consumption of their
own countrymen who do believe that their
Pakistani Air Force really can come and
teach some lesson to the Indians
remember ladies gentlemen we are at
least five times much more equipped much
better than the Pakistani Air Force in
the Army in a conventional warfare
Pakistan doesn't stand a chance and
because they don't that's why they come
up with all these things just in order
to make sure that the pressure that they
are feeling from their own country is
eased off well better luck next time",True,en,44233,77,308

Air Force sources also are claiming that
you know the fighter jet struck a major
terrorist camp along the line of control
and also completely destroyed it
remember we are also talking in the wake
of Pakistan providing a VVIP shield to
Jess chief you know right when you after
in the aftermath of the pole vomit
terror attacks
so not really doing anything to cop
terror from its soil and in fact
providing VVIP shield and now this ample
retaliation by the Indian Air Force well
yes that's right you know a few things
are becoming clearer and clearer at this
point of time that this was an activity
that was carried out by Indian Air Force
during the night as we've been
maintaining that sources suggest that
around 3:30 during the night is when the
Indian Air Force's Mirage 2000 crossed
the line of control and they also did I
you know drop payloads which uh you know
of course means then that that bombs
were dropped the extent of damage is
something that still has not been
assessed and will be shared by the
officials perhaps later on but yes it's
a huge huge thing that an air strike has
been carried out you know let's just not
mince any words it is an air strike and
it has been carried out by India across
the line of control possible targets
seem to be the Jaysh groups launch pads
are dead
you know camps where we still not really
clear as to what kind of damage has
taken place but the fact that Indian Air
Force has actually crossed the line of
control in itself is huge it's
significant you know even during Kargil
war if the Air Force did not cry across
the line of control and if you know our
sources are saying that this was a very
well-planned strike there were close to
10 to 12
you know Mirage 2000s in the air and
there was complete technical support
that was provided to these aircrafts in
fact like you know Shivan Guru have been
saying and reporting there was mid air
fueling that was also carried out for
these mirage 2000 so
overall it does look like a massive
thing has happened we still have to wait
you know for official confirmations and
any responses at all but on the ground
here in Kashmir and in other areas of
the state of Jammu and Kashmir we are
seeing heightened activity reports of
jets flying in near the Pune a sector of
the line of control still coming in from
the locals so it does look like a
massive thing has happened and all of it
coming in to talk about the statement by
Major General Asif before when he's gone
ahead and took to social media to claim
that Indian Air Force jets actually you
know across the line of control and
targeted you know so he has not he's
used terms like dropping payloads not
really said that targeted it was a
targeted attack by the Indian Air Force
so he has used terms which are really
socks not really going ahead and
claiming that these are terrorists at
that these are basically targeting
terrorists outfits along the line of
control it into the Pakistani side well
yes that's right
DG is PR has in fact tweeted and the
manner he has explained these actions
seem to be you know a sense of
downplaying the entire incident but we
really have to wait for official
confirmation from the Indian side
probably which will give us some sort of
an assessment also as to what has
happened we just heard the Pakistani
side tweeting some pictures also calling
that the payload that was dropped by the
Indian Air Force jets you know cause
this much of damage but all of these
things still have to be sort of verified
and like it was mentioning our sources
in the in the defense's are Indian Air
Force here say that they still have to
wait for an assessment before something
can be said so we're hoping that there
could be some sort of a statement that
probably will be released from sometime
from now but you know you have to look
at the things in perspective put them in
perspective the important point here the
the significant point here is that a
strike has been carried out in an Air
Force jets have actually crossed the
line of control
that's huge that's big the impact the
kind of you know delivery what was used
what happened is something that we
assessments would tell us but the
initial reports which suggest that yes a
strike has taken place is big it's not
every day that such incidents happen
it's not easy that the aircrafts of one
country would cross over you know across
the line of control entered the other
area then carry out such an action like
it was mentioning even during Kargil the
Indian Air Force did not cross the line
of control but here
we are hearing that actually that action
has taken place so huge huge thing
happening here and all of this after
that attack took place in Palama on 14th

bhadram had filed to place in the first
petition he saw the documents while in
the other he thought court permission to
be called for Enforcement Directorate
interrogation while only after getting
the documents now during the hearing bad
wrestler termed his interrogation by the
probe agency illegal until he's granted
access to the documents his lawyer
further claimed that the IDI procedure
was unfair the hard copies of the
documents will be supplied except the
blank papers if there were any in an in
the files so all the files 185 files
running into a total of about 23
thousand pages those documents have to
be supplied within five days and whether
interrogation can continue before the
supply of documents is a matter which
will be heard at 2:00 p.m. right my
colleague Anisha is on the phone line
with me right now Anisha the court is
yet to decide on whether Robert Vadra
can be interrogated until he's had time
to peruse the documents which will he
will have now access to but earlier it
was not very keen on allowing permission
it was only after lawyer Katie Susie
persisted with his plea did the court
say we'll hear you were to be a well
follow me we'll have to wait to meet at
2:00 p.m. exactly what's the outcome of
this entire argument is going to be but
yet as you were saying before the court
had not found any orders on Robert Haga
plea which is the claiming that he
should not be interrogated till United
on it all the documents remember Barra
has been claiming that he does not know
the evidence or the allegations on the
basis of which CD once you interrogate
him and that is why he needs access to
all the documentation this morning
have given him access to the document
they're eating has been directed to give
her hard copies of all the documents to
Vadra increasingly with the Border's
path after the CD that was submitted by
the Enforcement Directorate did not open
on the 4th one of your support computers
and that is why she support accepted
lawyers argument that he has not
actually even given access to
information but yes we will have to
sleep in 2 p.m. to see whether the court
will give any further relief under
investigation
it exact money and money money
laundering is relating to the sale of a
property in London of any other
allegations that the Enforcement
Directorate is raising regarding sources
many Kentucky follow me right my
colleague Manish Pandey is also on the
phone line with me right now Manisha
isn't embarrassing for the Enforcement
Directorate that the documents which
they had provided on a hard drive to mr.
Vadra did not open on a laptop in court
and now they have to provide hard copies
of those documents to Robert Vadra and
his council and vote more crucially also
the court is yet to decide whether he
can be interrogated before he has had
access to see those documents within
these five days period develops far as
he's concerned they are saying that this
is an excuse from mr. Robert Vadra just
delay and derail the investigation
remember Robert water was someone's
before the agency to present himself in
the London properties case today at
10:30 but on Saturday he moves to
applications to give all the documents
seized from his office now
he claims that they have given up 183
pages of documents in a hard test but
Robert water claims that this party is
not functioning in his laptop
whereas Eadie says that whether the
hardest functioning is in his councils
laptop then it should function in waters
laptops also but as far as it is
concerned they are saying that they will
follow the direction of post they will
provide all the heart of a hard copy of
the documents seized from his office
there are 183 pages of documents which
is pertaining to the case as far as the
other documents series
that they will not provide to Vadra as
this case and in an ongoing
investigation they do not want to lead
Quadra in this case now as to Oklahoma
to be very crucial because what reward
Quadra wants to direct Eden or to summon

T3nJz2k46JY,Massive Fire At Bandipur Tiger Reserve In Karnataka Burns For 3 Days Straight,Over 3000 hectares of land have been destroyed as a massive fire has been ravaging Bandipur Tiger Reserve in Karnataka for ...,2019-02-25T08:02:39Z,India Today,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T3nJz2k46JY/hqdefault.jpg,"Morris fire in Karnataka's bandipur
tiger reserve which continues for the
third straight day 3,000 hectares of
forest land has been completely
destroyed in this fire till now hundreds
of forest official departments along
with the fire officials and local
volunteers have been trying to douse the
fire however strong winds and dry grass
have aided the fire to spread towards
the Rose roads on the national highway
67 very rapidly the fire which had begun
on Thursday turned massive on Saturday
after strong winds in the manticore
tiger reserve meanwhile all the safari
and the tourism activities have been
suspended till the time the fire can do
not in the control for department trying
to stop this fire another one or two
days first ascent is there so many times
it happens in this area to happen again
apparently my Odyssey going across now
to my colleague Nolan Pinto and we are
also being joined by Joseph who were
environmentalist let me first bring you
a mr. Hoover you know this is this fire
which is spreading all across the tiger
reserve what are the immediate dangers
and what can in fact the government and
the administration do to in fact bring
this under control sir yeah this one of
time this fire is out of control there's
nothing you can do to suppress it one
day it has to die down naturally the
damage it is cause is I mean you can't
measure it it's just you talk about land
we talk about 4,500 hectares but biotic
damage and the ecological damage that's
caused huge we will that impact will be
felt in another couple of years from now
but where I will have to come to is
saying I want to blame the government
for this total mess up it is the comment
which has failed the people of Karnataka
and India they have done the mistake of
not placing a field director in the
tiger reserve which is one of the best
tiger reserves in the country which has
140 tigers another 40 another 46 Tigers
there is no field director there so
without the head of the department there
how do you expect this force to
protected now even the range force
officers there I've been very
lackadaisical in their attitude in their
approach so they not done what they
should have done no fire lines have been
drawn no fire watches have been employed
so this whole thing comes to the
administrative collapse if somebody is
making money and this is in their great
to make money they've destroyed our
forests 4000 file vector is not a joke
absolutely happy let me at this point of
time bring in my colleague nolan pinto
as well known very clearly as mr. Joseph
Hoover is saying the government they
just don't care and with this present
coalition government which is busy
trying to save its government every
other day with operation low
just three four five six whatever number
you want to give this is the result the
governance is being neglected get the
Congress the JDS and the BJP over here
have just been playing games all want to
be in power all one minister posts all
one corporation workforce everybody
wants to be the Chief Minister but when
the fires actually started on Thursday
it was no one cared basically no one
even bothered about it
even while wildlife activists even was
people living in those areas inform the
range forest officers inform the
government that this is fired do
something immediately no one bother it
more so after a few mile of activist who
actually brought this out photo started
to circulate video started to started a
bank there as on Saturdays suddenly it
was only yesterday that okay

in it could be a big GST relief for the
homebuyers the GST Council has cared
only 1% GST for affordable housing the
Council for GST has cared 5% on under
construction apartments now there will
be no input tax credit benefit for these
two so after the meeting of the council
that took place some of the decisions
have been taken national affairs editor
Rahul Shrivastav joins us now Rahul if
you could just break it down to ours GST
counts in clearing 1% for affordable
housing but 5% on under construction
apartments hello
pooja what we didn't say is that this is
something which the real estate lobby
was asking for a very long time there
has been a huge slowdown as well the
real estate sector is concerned and that
was a major concern also for the
government because real estate is one of
the biggest and not only one of the
biggest employers in the country but
also it is one of the driving elements
as far as the economy is concerned and
it is related to the arm of these
aspirations because of the high GST rate
of 12% on under construction flat and 8%
on affordable housing though both of
them invited the input tax credit and
the actual rate used to be lesser the
fact is that the real estate sector was
saying that this is rather too high and
it is not making up the slowdown that is
why the GST council after long
deliberation decided that 5% or under
construction flats and 1% affordable
housing will be will be there and this
will not invite any input tax and it
means it will be only flat 5 percent and
1 percent at the GST council is already
defined that affordable housing will be
categorized as 50 percent of the floor
ratio of 60 square metres size of
construction so all the elements have
been put in place but now it is very
important that
how the real estate sector sector brings
down the prices because there is also a
possibility with this kind of that
structure that real estate sector may
not either pass on the benefit to the
consumers by hiking other prices or
inter also bike falling into the lesser
tax category there is a chancer chance
that they might be evasion of taxes I
was going to ask you that when the GST
council gives this relief it will be for
the real estate and for the builders but
will it also transform to the consumer
to you and I hope might be planning to
buy an apartment very soon
exactly put that the pertinent question
here because there are several shadow
prices which are operating within the
real estate sector the real estate
builders can hike prices clandestine Lea
and eventually tell the consumer that
whatever is the tax component can be
transmitted will not be transmitted to
the consumer and that is why the
government will have to be rather more
vigilant or the GST Council will have to
be more vigilant in terms that this
benefit is being passed on because in
the past on most items where the taxes
have been reduced the there's been a
track record that the tax benefits have
not been passed to the consumer that's a
very important update Roger Oscar thank
you so much for these details and

bsF-G0ydskM,"MoS PMO, Jitendra Singh Speaks On Modi Govt Decision To Stop Indus Water To Pakistan",PulwamaFallout #IndiaChokesPakistan Union minister Nitin Gadkari said the Central government was planning to build three ...,2019-02-22T05:09:17Z,India Today,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bsF-G0ydskM/hqdefault.jpg,"a big triple strike against Pakistan
first the Modi government withdrew the
most favored nation status then security
of furious leaders be drawn and now in
possibly the biggest decision of all
India's share of the Indus water will be
denied to Pakistan remember since 1960
because of our inability to construct
dams in Jammu and Kashmir a lot of the
water which was due to India which was
India's share of the Indus Water Treaty
had been flowing into Pakistan minutes
before now Union Water Resources
Minister Nitin Gadkari has tweeted to
say that new dams are being built and
the Modi government has decided that
excess water will be denied to Pakistan
65 percent of Pakistan's landmass
depends on waters of the Indus Basin
River this is a big decision this water
will now be diverted to the Indian
states of Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir
excess water flowing into Pakistan will
now be stopped
the Modi government taking a big
decision on stopping the excess flow of
Indus rivers in to Pakistan so as to
ensure that India can maximize the
potential of the water that is available
to us under the Indus Water Treaty dr. G
thinner Singh Minister of State in the
Prime Minister's Office now joins us he
comes from Jammu and Kashmir in Jammu
and Kashmir this has been a
long-standing demand grows fast in the
assembly in 2003 finally the Modi
government acting on that demand tell us
more about adopting welcome
yeah a record stated incidentally both
these divisions find mention in the city
go to three Street namely River AVI and
huija which also happens to be a
tributary of River Ravi they flow
through by constituency the water
district of keturah now let's not forget
that it according to the Indus Water
Treaty of 1950 there were three rivers
which came to India's share namely Ravi
Sophia's and three other Caleb's in
Denton out with Pakistan in that version
easy times no River Ravi was going in
two bodies and this will also be a
question mark for you to put to the
earlier comments why they had allowed
this happening was this of like an
animal taint being done or a callous of
those so there is because I am saying so
why because this will be something for
you to then investigate about dam called
sharp or Cundy which finds reference and
job in this regard agree Street was
conceived in 1970s for 40 years
it was gathering dust it's a joint
project on the Punjab side of the in of
the J&K Punjab border and it's being
funded by the central government which
would enable the entire water of river
Ravi to be used by the district court or
the border district of the Jammu and
Kashmir side and this in court a school
which is the border this job but in the
absence of this damn you entire water
from where through motherboard was
throwing into Pakistan so that was one
and Emily happening not that and at the
drop of hat some of our leaders would
say k Pakistan copani room to wear as
our own annual showing into Pakistan the
other Riverwood for which and this has
now been this dam construction has
started with the person
intervention of Prime Minister Modi for
which entire credit goes to him as far
as the other river or the tributary
called butcher's cuts on ugh this dam
has also now been conceived to be
connected the technicality involved is
that about one third of the water which
will be available after the construction
of the dam would be our utilization to
India but if the the manner in which the
dam had been planned by the earlier
governments would have allowed almost
2/3 of the water from this dam becoming
available to Pakistan again so we were
in fact to put it ironically were
creating a dam for Pakistan utility only
1/3 being utilized when equal to a
district off of Jammu and Kashmir
so now very pragmatically a meeting was
held at mr. has got very the corner of
Jamuna to be mr. Satpal well it was also
there I also happened to be there and a
plan has been put in place to do to
build a canal system which would enable
this sample s water which is not being
utilized when he went and him when the
dam is finally ready bypassed by Jammu
and Kashmir to be allowed to flow into
Punjab Haryana and partly to Rajasthan
but not a drop or you know but dr. G
then they're saying 90% of Pakistan's
irrigated area depends on the Indus bein
rivers
65% of the landmass in Pakistan is part
of the Indus Basin one of the reasons
why previous governments hadn't done
this was the fear that China would do
the same why Pakistan depends on these
rivers coming in from India India
depends especially in the Northeast
depends on waters coming in from rivers
like the Brahmaputra now the fear in
strategic affair circles had been if
Pakistan if we deny water to Pakistan
would have China turns off the tap for
important rivers like the Brahmaputra
then what happens but that that would
raise the question that what is the
sanctity of the Indus Water Treaty at
all then why have a treaty in place
because the treaty clearly defined that
the three rivers of Sinda gentleman and
and Jana would be utilized for Pakistan
Ravi's at illusion we asked why India
and if in spite of that treaty we
succumb to this apprehension that maybe
if we
our waters which are by by by the treaty
itself our share
then again somewhere is a failure of the
diplomacy or failure at the strategic
level okay and how soon will these dams
be built and I can see you must be
beaming because for the people of Jammu
and Kashmir this is a big decision but
it's tough to build these dams some of
these areas are terror throne how soon
will these dams be ready how soon will
be staffed Pakistan of the excess water
now to make this clear
India is not doing anything wrong we're
only stopping the excess flow of water
which is allowed under provisions of the
1960 treat of the same company goddamn
yeah the shower caddy work is already
started it's just on the the Punjab side
of the Sierra Nevada water I think it's
scheduled to be ready in three years and
then it will again because who are this
people who said they were outside the
puja project is to start very soon
because they are now simultaneously
trying to put in place a plan for the
canal system as I said no because if
they are gone ahead with the plan which
was which was prepared by the earlier
government then 2/3 of the water from
this dam would have been you know always
how can before you know when available
to Pakistan so that dam after it starts
would be again complete in another maybe
four years time and I think that would
address the entire issue of irrigation
as well as power generation in the
border districts of Jammu and Kashmir as
well as the job doctor let's get a
warden now from strategic affairs editor
god of solvent is joining us from
Srinagar Oh a big decision this finally
excess water flowing into Pakistan will
be withheld by the Indian government
that building capacities but these dams
are complex to build located in
different difficult places and be there
is a threat of terror search not easy
but it's a tough decision
Rahul better late than never this should
have been done much earlier but it's
happening now or at least a decision has
now been taken that it will happen now
and you know it won't happen overnight a
very complex system of canals will have
to be built all of this will happen if
it does at a war footing and as Nitin
Gadkari the Union Minister says that
these will now be national projects so
central funds is available for them they
will still take anything between three
to six years is what we here for these
projects to be completed even if the
work starts on a war footing now but
then it's a good step that's been taken
because these are our rivers as you very
rightly pointed out Rahul our rivers
water was unnecessarily flowing into
Pakistan now this water will be utilized
for Jammu and Kashmir Punjab Haryana
Rajasthan you can join us now for a
reaction on this he's been a
long-standing advocate of peace with
Pakistan mr. Kulkarni do you support
this decision this is the extra Indian
water we're not denying Pakistan it's
right this is surplus water which had
been going because we hadn't built
capacities now the Modi government says
dam yeah he burning up you know first of
all Rahul may I congratulate you on a
very important interview that you did
yesterday with Musharraf with General
Musharraf and you extracted from him
information that clearly demolished that
denial on the part of Pakistan that
Jesse Mahmoud is not behind this give us
proof and here was the former president
former Chief Army staff saying that
Jesse is involved so therefore I want to
congratulate you on this coming to this
most recent decision of the Indian
government I believe that sort of a war
every option should be considered which
will compel Pakistan to take action
verifiable action again Jesse a moment
which means arresting its leader Masood
Azhar and also this man
and demolishing the terror
infrastructure on Pakistani soil okay so

big general election so all the
questions about the state now come later
will focus on the general elections
first and the big question that everyone
wants to know who do people want as the
next prime ministers when access mine
they asked this question in the state of
Andhra Pradesh in September 2018
Prime Minister Modi was at 38% Rahul
Gandhi was at 44% so Rahul Gandhi
already sitting at a six point gap
what's happened between September and
February take a look at the data coming
on your screen now it's interesting to
note that the Prime Minister is pretty
much where he was a 38 percent in Andhra
Pradesh but Rahul Gandhi has jumped from
44 percent to 51 percent that's a sixth
that's a 7 percent jump just in the last
about five months that is quite
significant seven percent jump in five
months for Arun Gandhi in under Pradesh
remember this is a state where the
Congress had done pathetically in the
last looks of my
elections so from there a high level of
traction now being seen in favor of the
Congress party the next question why is
Rahul Gandhi's rating going up does this
have anything to do with Priyanka Gandhi
Watrous entry into politics we asked
respondents in Andhra Pradesh do you
support the Congress after Priyanka
Gandhi's entry 44 percent of the
respondents are saying yes which means
about half the respondents see even in
under Pradesh seem to appreciate and
approve of the fact that Priyanka Gandhi
Vadra is now in politics 28 percent are
saying no what do people in Andhra
Pradesh think of the performance of the
central government do they like the work
that the Modi government is doing are
they satisfied or dissatisfied when we
asked respondents this question
remember Andhra Pradesh has been one of
the problem states for the market and
the party even in our last tracker in
under Pradesh BJP had amongst its lowest
approval ratings only 31 percent had
said yes that number has crept up very
marginally to 33 percent now the level
of dissatisfaction was at 42 percent in
September that's now come down to 39
percent so 3 percent fall in the level
of dissatisfaction with the Modi
government those who think the
government is average is about 1 in 5 21
percent of the respondents in February
saying they're dissatisfied with the
Modi circuit I want opening comments
from sanjay kumar we're seeing a 7%
increase in the last five months in
rahul gandhi's popularity in Andhra
Pradesh how crucial is that 44 percent
of the respondents say they appreciate
the fact that Priyanka Gandhi is now in
politics other two factors linked very
difficult to figure out whether the two
factors are linked or not but there are
facts which stand alone and we can
clearly see that there is a jump of 7%
and this is significant while it will be
it will be very difficult to establish a
correlation see whether this jump is
only because Priyanka Gandhi has come
into an active politics but there is no
reason to expect why Priyanka Gandhi the
entry will bring down Rahul Gandhi's
popularity increased out that so no I'm
saying there is no reason to believe
that it will bring down
this popularity so I am sure there is
some correlations if that Priyanka
Gandhi is active entry into politics is
making some kind of a buzz for Congress
it may not be to the extent of Congress
winning the 2019 election but it can
only help Congress prospects going up in
different states okay I want
Kaushik Decker who also tracks the
Congress very carefully for us sanjay
kumar makes an important point that she
does the Congress and Rahul Gandhi no
damage if at all she's a fast multipole
we're seeing outside of other Pradesh's
well there is some kind of resonance
around the priyanka factor it's very
difficult to quantify the work share is
likely to go up conversion to see at
this moment uncertain yes certainly but
Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi both
have made it very clear that Priyanka's
impact they are not also expecting if
you carefully listen to what they are
saying that they are not expecting that
Priyanka will dramatically change
Congress for keeping expectations low
very low because there is having a river
that captures that no because the
significance is that she has been
launched in futa Pradesh which is their
home state also but more importantly it
has 80 seats so they believe if Congress
has to start somewhere
the revival has to start then it has to
start in a big state which actually
determines the national politics so 80
seats they know so they want to
strengthen the oh now Graham saga
Congress Andhra Pradesh has been one of
the last standing bastions of the
Congress as recently as 2019 the
Congress had at 36 and a half percent
votes share there that came dramatically
down to two point nine four percent in
the last elections in 2014 now it seems
that there is a bump whether the bump is
because of Gandhi whether the bump is
because of additional affinity towards
Rahul Gandhi we can't say for certain
but there's a 7% increase in the
popularity rating of Rahul Gandhi as the
next prime minister what do you make of
this interesting data set emerging from
this PSE data
as far as i'm the producers concerned
Congress is is gonna draw a blank it's
going to remain similar to the results
in 2014 they might increase their vote
share a trifle bit that might war way
boats from the ys RCP I suspect that
there will be a TDP Congress underground
understanding they might move away a
little bit of words from YS RCP but as
the Telangana assembly election shows
the Congress I mean you know on the
Telangana side the Congress cannot go
with the TDP and the Congress wanted to
go with the TDP in Andhra Pradesh that
was their only hope of winning seats per
se and they can't because if they do
that in Telangana there is a backlash so
given that the Congress is going to play
spoiler possibly to ice our CP not
really win seats they might have a small
bump in their war chairs they might but
they might take a few more elections to
recover in a state where the sentiment
against the Congress was was extreme
after the division of the united andhra
pradesh oh absolutely when your war
chair comes down to 3% then you're
pretty much scratching the bottom of the
barrel you may have been at 36 and a
half 10 years ago but that's meaningless
because 2.94 is where the congress is
starting from but the problem I met
Malviya is in a state like under Pradesh
there is a high level of dissatisfaction
with the Modi circuit that because
chandrababu naidu's been campaigning
actively against the BJP talking about
the need for special status the suppose
it betrayal he was in the capital this
week this cannot be one of the states
where the BJP hopes to do better you
were on the fringes in Andhra Pradesh
politics you continue to remain on the
fringes in Andhra Pradesh politics well
Rahul what is very important to notice
that in the 2014 general election the
BJP Zwarte share was a little above 7%
although the board share in the assembly
was in the vicinity of 2.8 2.9 percent
now that tells you a story that while it
is a stage where the BJP is it's in its
infancy it is not as if it's a
completely lost cause the principal
players in the
State are obviously the TDP and the vias
are Congress and the BJP is a rising
force in the state
I am also quite unable to reconcile the
numbers that you've put out with what I
see on the ground in the state of Andhra
Pradesh now what's going to happen in
2019 my guess is that the BJP is would
share in the assembly election will
increase over what it was in the 2014
Assembly election we will also gain both
share in the Lok Sabha likely to win a
couple of seats in the state of Andhra
Pradesh
but the TDP will have a tough going
because of the recent drought that you
saw in Telangana as a result of them
tying up with the Congress and that's
something that hasn't gone down well
with the people of Andhra as well and
secondly this competitive politics
between the TDP and the vias our
Congress of seeking a special status for
the state and running down the central
government has its shelf life and the
fact is that the BJP is now out on the
ground aggressively telling exactly all
that the central government has done the
promises that were made and importantly
that all the support given by the
central government is far in excess of
what the special status would entitle
the state for and that realization is
now sinking into the people but it's a
slow process but it will gather steam in
the next two months and I think that
will in the substantial manner change
the outcome in the assembly and the Lok
Sabha election that will happen in April
May of this year Nasir Hussain of the
Congress party joins us it's interesting
to see that there's a seven percent bump
in Rahul Gandhi's popularity in the last
five months in Andhra Pradesh his
popularity hasn't jumped quite as much
in any other state according to the PSC
tracking data but Valerio makes a very
important point that this bump may be
visible in terms of popularity but on
the ground in the Lok Sabha elections
the battle in Andhra Pradesh is between
the Wyss RCP of jag Andrade and between
Chandrababu Naidu the Congress was in
2014 and continues in 2019 at best to be
a fringe player who's part of this now
Sara said
Raoul I think we have some difficult
states in the country we are some states
where for some factors are the others
Congress has not then either well or has
been weak on ground let me accept that
Andhra Pradesh is one of them but
nevertheless in the past five years
Congress party has taken a stand
Congress party is being seen now in
Andhra Pradesh as a party which is
standing with them in terms of their
demands specially the special status for
the state mr. Rahul Gandhi president of
All India Congress Committee and all
other leaders both in armed opposition
at the national level consistently taken
a stand that whatever was promised by
the then government has to be adhered to
has to be implemented has to be taken as
and the state has to be taken care I
think that is that is the goodwill mr.
Rahul Gandhi and the Congress party has
in hand opposition and let me accept
that after the bifurcation of the state
which was in the interest of the state
of Telangana at that time that we were
not received very well people they are
not receptive at that time people
thought that we have divided this state
but in the past also states have been
divided for the administrator usain is
saying the Congress still very much on
the defensive in Andhra Pradesh there
may be a bump in the question around
Rahul Gandhi's acceptance as Prime
Minister but on the ground the Congress
in Andhra Pradesh continues to remain
weakened the alliance with Chandra Babu
Naidu despite all the public posturing
in Delhi isn't coming together quite the
way that they'd like at least in terms
of ticket distribution at this moment
not a location told me at Davos this
year that they're having problems and
the deal is in finance remember in under
Pradesh along with the Lok Sabha
elections they'll also be the assembly
elections so this question is also very
important who the voters in Andhra
Pradesh want as next chief minister when
we asked respondents this question Jagan
Reddy was at 43% in sip
but Chandrababu Naidu was a 38 percent
in Jagan's favor the data has moved up
by 2 percent 45 percent of the
respondents in February told access my
India that they wanted the young Jagan
ready son of Azhar as the next chief
minister of andhra pradesh Chandrababu
Naidu has dipped from 38 percent to 36
percent Sanjay Kumar signalling very
clearly that the man in the lead in the
Assembly election in Andhra Pradesh by a
fair margin is Jagan ready
that's the bandwagon which has momentum
behind it that's very clear out if you
look at the data it is very clear that
the people who the people want Jagan
Mohan Reddy as the next chief minister
but it also signals another thing which
is that it is going to be a close
contest between the two parties of
Andhra Pradesh and the two national
parties which is BJP and Congress why do
you think it will be a close contest it
is going to be a close contest because
if you look at the work if you look at
the popularity rating of the two leaders
it is it's not much of a difference I
have we have no idea about the vote
estimates but I think it's going to be a
close contest and the two national
parties are not so there's a nice
difference between Chandrababu Naidu and
Jagan one idea nursing is not much
it's see it's not much because we would
see more movement and these popularity
ratings of the current chief in is the
chief minister not always translate into
votes or so but remember and our viewers
must remember this in Andhra Pradesh the
gap between TDP which formed the
government in the state and Jagan Radice
party which came in runners-up was
marginal for forty four point four five
percent for the TDP forty four point one
two percent for the Y star CP so the gap
between the TDP and the Y's our CP was
0.3% that's how narrow the gap was and
now with a nine percent gap
sanjay kumar seems to think the backi
will be close
nine percent Veera Raghav seems to be a
big gap does that put Jagan ready firmly
in the lead to be next chief minister of
andhra pradesh
two things here Rahul one as the
Telangana assembly election showed that
if the PDP allies with the Congress and
the Congress allies with the TDP in
Telangana there is a backlash and there
will be a similar backlash I suspect if
there is any kind of understanding and I
think chandrababu naidu's credibility
was hit at a local level because of an
alliance with the Congress I think
that's the that's the that's the
indication that I'm picking up so they
might be very very of how this goes the
second and very important point
yes Jagan Mohan Reddy may have the
popularity but I'll tell you what
why is our CP did not have in 2014 was
organisation structure I think that's
where the PDP scores over Jagan Mohan
Reddy so while you may Jagan may need to
have a much more convincing lead to
sweep the TDP out of power in a state
like under padishah to win and Andhra
Pradesh because he at least in my
opinion lacks the organization power of
the TDP so I think it's still a flux
situation but yes you can say it's
advantage Jagan because there is
anti-incumbency that Naidu will have to
try I don't agree with veeraraju father
reason you state that over the last
several months in Andhra Pradesh Jagan
reddy has carried out one of the most
extensive podiatrists any Indian leader
has been has done he's been walking like
a man possessed
day in day out except for the one day
wish to go to Hyderabad for the court
hearing so and which one has now seen
him on the ground unlike last time when
his kind of untested use only his father
son
now they've seen him on the ground as a
politician you see this padayatra if you
go back to 2004 padayatra was the wave
is already brought the Congress back to
power sweeping that election in 2004
when the UPA came to power in fact one
main reason for the UPA to return on the
NDA Toulouse was under Pradesh where and
and Y's are reduced by the etre so
dragons following the footsteps remember
that in 2014 he had an extremely strong
sympathy vote in his favour he was seen
as the wrong son in the Congress he
split across and then the state was
split there was a total sense of flux he
was seen as the man standing in fact the
TDP was a little confused on its stand
it was Jagan who was seen as the
who had a crystal clear stand he does
have a mass base in andhra pradesh
especially in the royal Seema regions
and the red be cast vote is firmly with
with Jagan born ready but I repeat that
point once again that organization
matters in a close election and the TDP
has the edge there however in terms of
mass appeal I may still put the
advantage - Jagan Mohan Reddy
now Nasir Hussain the Congress is in a
bit of a mess in Andhra Pradesh because
first you announce that they'd been
alliance with Chandra Babu Naidu later a
seed distribution became a problem after
Telangana you saw the kind of blowback
you received the commas and the Reddy's
didn't work together and you were really
concerned and therefore you said okay we
will not have an alliance but yet when
there is a meeting tender Babu Naidu
Rowell Gandhi are on the same state so
you are confusing the waters you can't
go in the state assembly election and
say Chandrababu Naidu is there a
terrible job and that he should be voted
out vote for us we've ruled on the
predation earlier so you're in a bind
the Congress in on the predation and
attempt to stitch an alliance which
other way would I do has worked itself
into a corner Indian National Congress
understands that this is an era of
coalition politics in India that is the
reason why we had stitched up alliances
in 2004 and that's the reason why we
were they for 10 years in the Union
government now in 2014 we did have some
problems with the alliances in different
parts of the country that is the reason
I think one major reason also one major
factor also why we lost the election we
realized that now we are having tie-up
with wall allies and some new allies
also in different parts of the country
in an attempt it was an experiment to
have an alliance in Telangana the
results whatever could could have been
there you were also there I was also
there campaigning at that time it could
be the Alliance it couldn't it could be
the big organization structure that was
there in Telangana it could be in
various other reasons because of which
we didn't win win in Telangana but as a
political party I think we have to
stitch alliances state wise we need to
have alliance to build up not only to
have
but at the same time to have an alliance
which well which will have considerable
number of seats in the parliament so
that we can we can defeat the forces
that are there in power at the ebb in
the even end government so for that
reason we have been experimenting we
have been talking to people in different
parts of the country and Andhra are in a
difficult situation because we already
have have an alliance with the TDP which
really didn't take off in Telangana I
think as there's still time the the part
is still wandering neither the Alliance
has been called up nor the seat cheering
has been finalized the challenge is not
that it will not have a ticket Alliance
seed distribution Alliance there may be
some kind of a broad tactical
understanding but they'll put up
candidates now what do you go and tell
voters something about one I do is a
friend of me is a friend is a bit of an
enemy we don't we can't say anything
against him but yet you vote for us it's
a very complicated situation confused
about this word friendly alliance
tactical voting etcetera that doesn't go
well to the voters you can't go and tell
voters we have put up a candidate but
our candidate is not serious don't vote
for him so it's very confusing for the
voters I agree brows okay let's come now
to Telangana we'll focus for a moment on
Telangana before going across to the
northeast and looking at ourselves in
Telangana news for the Bharatiya janta
party is more promising than it is
another position under Pradesh the BJP
seems to be a complete write-off in
Telangana things aren't quite as bad
when respondents were asked who they
wanted as the next prime minister in
September 2019 when we lasted this
tracking poll 44% were rooting for Prime
Minister Modi 39% wanted Rahul Gandhi
now that number has come down to 41% and
Rahul Gandhi has gone from 39% to 43% so
what's interesting is that now Rahul
Gandhi is 2% up but Prime Minister
Modi's popularity is higher in Telangana
then it was in Andhra Pradesh however
the crucial thing is like in Andhra
Pradesh in Telangana to Rahul Gandhi's
up and remember between September and
February Rahul Gandhi has gone up four
percent which is quite substantial
what's the Priyanka impact in Telangana
in on the Pradesh we saw 44% saying they
were rooting
Congress now that Priyanka Gandhi is in
in Telangana not so enthusiastic 36% so
the level of enthusiasm lesser than
under condition no say 36% one-fourth of
the respondents are undecided they can't
say you know about 26% of the
respondents are saying that now I want
to go across to sanjay kumar on this
it's interesting that Rahul Gandhi's
popularity in the last five months has
gone up four percent Prime Minister
Modi's popularity in Telangana has come
down two percent I think the trend which
we saw with regard to the popularity of
the two personalities which we are
discussing the trend which we saw in
Andhra Pradesh that trend is also
continuing in Telangana and I think
something has to do with Priyanka Gandhi
taking active part in politics so we see
this these are the states where the
state leader are not seen as the prime
ministerial candidate so people make up
their mind either for Narenda Modi or
Rahul Gandhi and clearly Rahul Gandhi is
picking up and we can see we have taken
lead over never mid malvada this could
be a problem for the Bharatiya janta
party's reelection campaign in September
2018 you have five percent ahead of
Rahul Gandhi in February 2009 team Rahul
Gandhi has gone up by two percent this
is problematic
it happened in Andhra Pradesh where
already Rahul was ahead the gap became
bigger in Telangana why your man was
ahead and India's Prime Minister was
ahead now he trails Rahul Gandhi and the
Congress that's not good news well you
know Rahul first of all both Andhra and
Telangana like I said are states where
the BJP is still sort of building up an
organization it is still getting into
its own at the moment and Telangana in
particularly the new state just been
around for five years we've just had an
assembly election where the incumbent
TRS has done obviously very well for
themselves
the BJP remains an organisation that is
looking to expand and expand rapidly
again 2% gap is not is within the margin
of error and therefore one can't make an
opinion one way or the
the important point about the question
that you are repeatedly asking your
respondents about you know the entry of
Priyanka Vadra and whether that is what
is reflecting in the popularity that
you're seeing for Rahul Gandhi and the
Congress in these two states I'll just
like to point you to a survey done by
our sister organization for the state of
Uttar Pradesh it is showing that she's
not making any sizable impact and
therefore to suggest that she's making
an impact in Andhra and Telangana as a
bit of a far-fetched argument however I
do concede that in the Congress scheme
of things it's a bit of an exciting news
because so far all Gandhi has failed to
make any kind of a headway or dent and
now their hopes have moved on to
Priyanka and perhaps that is what is
getting reflected so it is bad news for
all Gandhi more than anyone else that's
how I look at the numbers that you are
putting out as far as the BJP is
concerned the looks of our performance
in Telangana will be much better than
what we had in the assembly relation and
naturally because of Prime Minister Modi
his charisma and the welfare program
that we've run on the ground and the
added awareness the people of Telangana
have about mr. Modi and what his
government has done so you know they are
going to think clearly on national lines
and not get bound by their regional
considerations or parochial politics now
you make an important point and I want
to put that point to Nasser Hussain that
the Congress could possibly be hava me
and I'll tell you why in the 2018
Assembly election the TRS was sitting at
a 47 percent what share was half the
state voted for KCR in the 2014
elections they were sitting at 35
percent would share the Congress was at
25 so why when people are asked who you
want as next Prime Minister Rahul
Gandhi's popularity may be going up but
when you actually come down to who's
stronger on the ground in the Lok Sabha
elections you may do better than you did
in 2014 but in terms of conversion into
seats the PRS could still have a big
lead over the Congress even in Telangana
so some of this bump may be a bump on
screen but may not necessarily immediate
translate into seats now let me make to
elect minutes to three points here one
the point number one you asked one
question to the BJP spokesperson what is
this why is this sudden increase of
opinion in favor of Rahul Gandhi is it
mrs. Priyanka water this is the question
which you're holding let me answer that
I think one big factor one big factor in
the last five six month is there a
fainting
it has gone done very well with the
people of the canal people of the
country that is one big reason I think
which is which is why Prime Minister
Modi is having popularity problems that
is one big reason I think that is one
thing second thing see there may be a
bit of excitement this is what NASA with
malware said see when we appointed a
Sachin Pilot is the president of
Rajasthan opposition Congress committed
there was excitement when we appointed
rutila casillas india in madhya pradesh
there was appointment and when we are
brought in Priyanka Gandhi ji Naveen
with reputation Jyoti Radha test and
they also in Uttar Pradesh there is lots
of excitement this happens this happens
with the voters this happens within
Kader there is lots of enthusiasm
because of new faces young faces people
think that there's more freshness more
energy more more energy more positivity
and that that ult's that also couples up
with the voting pattern I don't think
it's right a myth pal we are already
trying to get the by in the band to
fight but I think it's immaterial
whether car shake Rahul Gandhi's
popularity goes up by seven percent in
interpretation four percent in Telangana
because of Priyanka Gandhi because of
Rafael it's immaterial the data speaks
for itself the Congress is bouncing back
in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana but they
were so low down and even if you come up
quite a lot you're still not very far up
but the fact is that trend is very
easily visible
yeah because as you rightly pointed out
they were very low and if you see in
very low
2.94 percent that original player
marginal one-year-old party also gets
more votes here than that and if you see
in both Andhra and Telangana Congress at
one point of time they were big players
but after that they have been reduced to
fringes so that's where if we can see a
visible Minster it's like from a low
base they are making a jump so we are
seeing it as a big growth but at the
same time you have to understand that in
both states regional players are still
dominating case here is a big force in
Telangana and I believe Jagan 100e he
would not I would not see a close
contest in Telangana
I think Jagan 100d could probably sweep
Intel sorry in Andhra Pradesh why I am
saying so if you notice as general
wooden I do since January he has been
attacking BJP government they were
friends now he started attacking so he
is actually trying to find a villain
because he has somehow he is a seasoned
politician he has realized that there is
Hughes and team come and see in his
government so he needs to pass the buck
nobody is trying to blame Modi when his
battle on the ground of the Jagan ready
yeah but the point is that he needs to
fight Jagan hundred he but he needs to
find a villain to tell the people that I
could probably do things for you but I
could know the method of he has
understood that sweep let's now look at
the popularity of the central government
in the state of Telangana when we asked
respondents how satisfied are you with
the performance of the Indian government
in September 2018 forty-one percent of
the respondents had said they were
satisfied in Telangana that number is
down to 38 percent all the data points
so far are pointing in the same
direction the level of satisfaction with
the BJP government coming down the level
of satisfaction with the Prime Minister
himself coming down and Rahul Gandhi's
popularity going up the number of people
who are dissatisfied was 32 percent in
September that's now gone up to 34
percent the number of poor people who
thought the government's been average
was 24 percent that's marginally up now
to 26 percent so the pointers are all
showing the same direction the only
thing
still is that the gap is still so much
the Congress is starting from here the
TRS is sitting further up so the gap is
still there but if this momentum builds
then it's problematic for the BJP and
good news for the Congress sanjay kumar
but the time is very little first to
momentum to reach to such an extent that
the Congress would be able to convert
these votes in to see it you will find
this trend in most of the states rouse
that Congress would share is going up
Rahul Gandhi's popularity is going up
compared to what we saw but can I
counter argue by saying that in
Chhattisgarh your own poll other polls
also originally showed that the BJP was
quite comfortably in the lead then
Congress came up with a big jump in the
price at which penny would be procured
this was the paddy harvesting season
voters got excited they held back their
crops in nicer car again after it
suddenly became a big factor so when
you're saying that time is limited if we
are catching a trend how much time do
you need in the social media era now
penetration digital penetration data
connectivity is much higher than it ever
has been all what you have said is right
but if we look at the if we have talked
about chapters got Chattisgarh it was a
huge movement of farmers away from BJP
in favour of Congress and that we saw
that the Lord happened very quickly that
that happened at the line thought this
go to the state where half the state is
buster which has amongst the poorest
digital connectivity in the country if
it can happen in Chuck this god I think
some of the CSD how much time it takes
of momentum to be questioned we tend to
make a mistake yes people are active on
social media but how much does it
influence your vote in such a way that
you shift your vote so but I wasn't
making a different point no but between
announcement by a party and change in
voting preference even in a state like
suc this girl which doesn't have too
many urban pockets mostly a rural state
and very square cannot be an example for
the simple reason that why I think if
you look back in 2013 also the vote
share Congress and BJP for sure that gap
was very narrow so it was a bribe state
where the swing could easily move in
favor of one party and it was a two
party contest but in Telangana or in
Andhra
there is always a nominating regional
force and it's always free corner so
Congress role would be which is where
you have a very strong regional party
whether it is Bihar or UK or Telangana
Andhra Tamilnadu in all these states
congress votes here may go up by 10% 11%
but that's not going to be a good point
that I cannot convert into C and I want
to put that question to Veera raga there
are two theories one that the Congress
is campaign is picking up some momentum
point number two that sanjay kumar makes
that they were so badly off remember
that only 44 seats nationally so badly
off that even if the word check goes up
by about 10 11 percent the conversion
into seats is not enough the BJP will
still be in the lead nationally we're
another a 10 percent swing in favor of
Congress in 2019 compared to 2014 2
points only at roughly 55 very brief
points really one that's an important
point you're making like 10% increase in
voting only we only take them up scored
100 about 100 wow that's very
interesting from the numbers man himself
Peter Agha yeah look that there are two
points here there are two points here as
far as Telangana is concerned you can't
make it a Rahul Gandhi versus Moore the
battle it's not a tripartite fight it's
going to be a bar the bipolar fight
between the Congress and the TRS if you
take the 2008 e18 assembly polls the
Congress wins only one parliamentary
seat in fact it has a presence only in
one parliamentary seat in the state now
having said all this I think you must
not underestimate the fact that a new
state prefers to have a regional party
championing for it in Delhi and
considering the fact that you know the
TRS is the only regional party it has a
decisive advantage so the Congress can
hope to maybe gain a little in Telangana
but not not big enough your PRS will
still come up trumps
I think the Assembly election results
largely will get translated into the
parliamentary elections as well as far
as Telangana is concerned and you can't
compare it with Chhattisgarh or a BJP
versus Congress state where both parties
are the presence here the BJP has no
presence I mean it has a very marginal
presence around Hyderabad and
Secunderabad areas
you know it doesn't have a presence
across the state so we had some
depressing data points from the
perspective of BJP supporters from
andhra pradesh and telangana positive
data points from the perspective of
congress supporters but what's the
situation like in Assam Assam is the one
big state where the party Ajanta parties
despite having a demography which wasn't
directly favoring it was able to build a
government on its own might that
extended later even to three plus what's
it looking like in Assam at this time
let's start with the first question
about who people want as next prime
minister in October 2018 fifty-one
percent of the respondents told us that
they wanted Narendra Modi as Prime
Minister twenty-eight percent were
hoping for awhole gandhi noting the
Modi's popularity in the state of Assam
has crept up to 54 percent in February
2000 and 19 that's a 3% increase in four
months Rahul Gandhi was at 32% in
February compared to 28% in October so
he's also jumped up but there's a 22
percent gap between Modi and Rahul
Gandhi in stomp we're in there more the
way ahead of his principal challenger
what do people think about the
performance of the central government in
its interesting how Modi's performance
tends to mirror that of his government
quite naturally so if people are happy
with the government especially in the
government so closely aligned with the
image of its prime minister Prime
Minister Modi and the government's
popularity has both gone up 49 percent
of the respondents now say they are
satisfied with the central government's
performance compare this with the
low-30s we saw in the southern states
you'd seen in the first part of our show
the number of people are dissatisfied is
roughly the same from 25% to 26% now the
number of people who think the
government's performance is average has
actually come down to 17 percent what's
the mood around Priyanka Gandhi's entry
we asked people do you support the
Congress because Priyanka Gandhi is now
in there in the Congress party playing
an active role in politics remember in
Telangana and in on the British the
number of people who said it as a
positive was much higher than the
number of people who thought this was a
negative in our firm though only 34
percent of the respondents think
Priyanka Gandhi's entry makes a
difference to the Congress of much
bigger number 54% say it makes no
difference and that is crucial because
like on the Pradesh Assam for the
longest time was a congress bastion
Koscheck deca it slipped quite
completely out of the Congress's hands
and unlike Telangana and Andhra Pradesh
where we saw some signs of a recovery in
awesome there are no visible signs of
recovery
certainly there are two things one is
this long Congress rule obviously the
anti-incumbency against that Congress
rule is also very high at the center and
then in the state also second point is
that the Congress still doesn't have
strong leadership in the state so that's
where the problem is if the Congress
cannot provide an inspiring leadership
compare that with BJP BJP has serve on
anderson wall as the CM and Himanta
Biswa Sarma as his deputy both have very
strong leaders across the sampan or some
appeal they have so to fight that out
Congress still that Tarun Gogoi is still
their leader and he is aging so he
doesn't inspire that confidence in
people and when it comes to
anti-incumbency there is also a huge and
teen commune see towards the Gandhi
family I am saying that why because if
you notice Prime Minister Narendra Modi
in last five years that number of times
he has gone to Assam or visited or has
tried to connect with Assam some may say
these are symbolic some may say it has
been because of the Congress government
also did some good things and he is
reaping those benefits like inaugurating
bridges and all that but at the same
time he has made a visible effort to
connect with the people absolutely you
know the one thing that's very clear
sanjay kumar is in all my travels to the
northeastern states the one part of the
Modi government which I have a very
salient question most visible is the
infrastructure projects in greater
connectivity than North East which has
been taken up at a level which was never
the case I have a very simple question -
yes think of you piera
how many special shows you did for Assam
assigning half-an-hour
only a samso at the national perspective
also Assam votes the seats Assam
politics it's gaining the momentum so
that's where the connect is also and
it's very happy with that he's of course
a yahweh's of karate and Assam so he is
obviously very happy but you can
actually feel the difference if you look
at connectivity you look at
infrastructure you speak to people in
states like Assam Arunachal Pradesh they
say pensaba attack Pele Beach making
each other you can actually see money go
from the center to the state in the
Northeast you can see come dicta come
Volta I believe that when a government
does something there is a politics
involved behind that so if you look at
the states where BJP is has focused
enormously during the last few years
Assam West Bengal these are also the
states where a regional party is in a we
should not forget about the social
composition of these states and BJP is
very suitably placed to you know like to
polarize the voters on on religious line
and and and I am NOT saying that there
has not been a ground for that I think
Congress the kind of policies Congress
pursued in Assam or the kind of policies
which left parties pursued in West
Bengal they have created enough ground
for the BJP to because the minority the
minority people have felt kind of little
left out in these states so BJP was BJP
saw the Gromit they harvest the some
good news in the political stock
exchange for the Barclays Ajanta party
from Assam you were already strong even
according to October data that strength
has increased in the last four months in
the Northeast and in the state of Assam
but around you know there are a couple
of reasons for that
one that the Prime Minister's focus on
the north east has been unwavering and
he said so in the initial months in
office that he wants northeast to be as
progressive and as prosperous as the
western part of the country is and all
his efforts actually showed up the
number of visits that he made the
minister that were deputed to track what
was happening in Northeast and the
general perception amongst the people in
Assam are not health rapport in other
places that there is finally a prime
who's looking at their welfare all that
in the last five years has actually led
to a massive popularity search for the
Prime Minister and therefore the party
junta party the other very important
aspect and I was just listening perhaps
dr. Sanjay Kumar speak about
polarization and I want to make a very
categorical point there the BJP has
always stood for the indigenous
population in these northeastern states
it was the Congress and the left that
govern these states allowed illegal
migration mostly Muslims from
neighboring countries in an attempt to
dismember the demographic constituency
of these states because it helped them
politically the BJP is trying to rectify
that the NRC exercise that's happening
under the Supreme Court watch is a case
in point the citizenship bill that we
brought in was intended to go in this
same direction although some amount of
consensus building and wider
consultation process is still required
as it seems that there were some
misgivings by the people but in all the
BJP remains committed to ensure that the
indigenous people of these northeastern
states upper are protected and
particularly the people in Assam who
have borne the brunt of this illegal
migration over several indicators to
questions now to respondents for
watching this broadcast question number
one do you support the National Register
of citizens sixty-three percent of the
respondents six in ten respondents are
saying yes they support the NRC 29%
three out of ten are saying no they
don't support the NRC let's now look at
the second question and there you see
the divergence in the response do you
support the citizenship amendment bill
27% say yes a much bigger number 44% are
saying no explain this dichotomy they
want that there be Kaushik a register of
citizens but they don't want the
citizenship amendment bill the Martha
gentle party thinks it's part of the
same grand project voters on the ground
are giving us completely different
responses this is the most secular
response from the people of Assam
both parties Congress as he has pointed
out rightly for years they played that
minority politics they allowed that
immigration illegal immigration to
happen thinking that this Muslim
Bangladeshi immigrants illegal
immigrants will be a vote back now BJP
caught that they have also a vote back
which taken an cash which is illegal
Hindu immigrants and the people of Assam
through this survey and also during the
protest they have very categorically
said that we do not want any illegal
immigrant whether he is Hindu Muslim
Christian Parsi we do not care we just
outright ayakashi Dhaka says there is
secular opposition to the citizenship
amendment bill Amit Shah was asked this
question I think you were there at the
ashoka hotel when you were launching
your you know your campaign manifesto
and trying to get suggestions from
people for your manifesto and people are
an p and he said this is our ideological
commitment we will not backtrack forty
four percent of the respondents think
you're on a wrong political track they
don't support the citizenship amendment
Bella with malware this could cause
trouble in the Northeast view and it's
not only the sense in are somehow
distant states as well Rahul much higher
let me make one thing very very clear
and I think this is also an attempt to
reach out to the people in North East
who are watching this program the
citizenship amendment bill does not mean
that the pressure of those who we take
in as part of a wider opening of our
borders for the persecuted minorities in
neighboring Islamic Republic countries
in any way going to infringe on the
rights of the indigenous people of the
Northeast there are provisions like the
Bengal frontier AG the money poor act
and similar act exists in states like
our natural if I'm not from which
protects the indigenous proper
population Prime Minister Modi in his
recent address said that lost six of the
Assam Accord which has so far not been
implemented is something that's high on
his government's priority and that will
essentially protect the rights of the
indigenous population so we completely
empathize with the concerns that people
in Northeast happened particularly asam
because for so many years they have been
at the receiving end of this illegal
migration but it is not to be seen as if
it is only a summon the states of
Northeast that will bear the brunt the
rest of the country will support any
migration that happens into our country
from these neighboring states and that
is the wider consultative process that I
spoke to you about
but in Northeast the priety remains the
well being and the rights of the
north-eastern indigenous people and that
won't be compromised at any cost by our
government that has been said by no less
than the prime minister but you didn't
push it through in the last session of
Parliament when you had an opportunity
you thought okay let's not burn our
fingers a for the day do you think
either we come back in May and then
we'll see what needs to be done they did
have a bit of a panic attack in the end
they could have pushed it through which
they wanted there was a political
section in the BJP that red car though
there was a more pragmatic session that
is let's see if we come back Randall who
will deal with it Rahul the reason for
that is very simple and I have said this
twice already that there has to be a
wider consensus and if there are any
misgivings that have been there amongst
the people that has to be addressed this
is about the country it is about the
people of Northeast and at no point in
time they should feel that it in any way
infringes on what their rights are now
and we are going to ensure that that
happens Nasir Hussain Assam was for the
longest time one of the areas of
strength for the Congress party now
you're nowhere in the picture the BJP
government at the state at the center
getting stronger people appreciating the
work that Prime Minister Modi has done
his government has done you know this
will not be one of the areas where you
will make major gains in a state which
you've ruled for the longest time you've
now ceded space and the BJP has
entrenched itself very firmly
raoul i think somebody did mention that
then you are also mentioning that
Congress was in bar for the longest
number of period of time in Assam and at
that time it was between the Congress
party and the regional regional players
so to development had taken place one
the anti-incumbency was huge against the
ruling Congress at that time one second
at the regional parties who have become
relatively very B and then now there it
has become Congress versus BJP in Assam
I can understand the love of man and the
Medici and the BJP here for the
Northeast to the extent that they went
to manufacture and steel mandates in
Meghalaya and manipulate if they had
they didn't have mandate and the kind of
goodwill they think they have created by
peeping in the tunnels and waving from
the bridges which were started and
started and a large part was constructed
by the UPA government so let us not get
into that that that that debate as to
who has developed how it has developed
what of what all projects have been
completed who had started that let me
not get into that but the fact remains
that today the entire northeast and
specially Assam is in a state of turmoil
because of the because of the National
Register for citizen the kind of
amendment they are trying to get the
kind of faux pas
they have taken extremely think about
there is no support to the citizenship
Amendment will most people don't like it
that is very clear that's a message out
to the BJP there are green shoots of
recovery visible for the Congress
especially in the southern states of
Andhra Pradesh and Telangana but the gap
between the Congress and the regional
parties is so much that these green
shoots will take a lot of time to
translate into seats so this but you can
see a certain pattern emerging Priyanka
Gandhi is entry Rahul Gandhi's campaign
helping the Congress
bounce back but they were so far out
that a little bit of a bounce back is
not gonna be enough BJP still in the
lead
what we'll do though next week on the
political stock exchange is put out our
second national tracker we had one just
before the assembly elections in the
Hindi heartland we'll have a second pan

cvj5oc7wqdA,India&#39;s Diplomatic Offensive Against Pakistan : Foreign Secy Meets Envoys West Asia &amp; Gulf,India has launched a big diplomatic offensive against Pakistan in the wake of Pulwama attack with Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay ...,2019-02-16T11:08:22Z,India Today,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cvj5oc7wqdA/hqdefault.jpg,"latest piece of information I'm picking
up at this time a foreign affairs editor
Geeta Mohan reporting that foreign
secretary is meeting envoys from West
Asia and Gulf countries at this moment
envoys from Iran Turkey Albania Qatar
UAE Morocco Jordan Kuwait Saudi Arabia
Egypt Oman and Bahrain have met the
Indian Foreign Secretary the
highest-ranking Indian diplomat meeting
envoys from West Asia and Gulf countries
this is important because this is
usually where Pakistan draws its support
from these are usually the countries who
tend to support because Pakistan is seen
as an Islamic Republic tend to support
with Pakistan so key part of our
diplomatic offensive is to ensure that
these vests station and Gulf nations
understand exactly why India is going to
do what it will and ensure that they are
on board if you see even in the Gulf
Pakistan has increasingly being isolated
not quite enjoying the same kind of
support as it once did the little bit of
support it gets nowadays is from Southie
Arabia where a big delegation of the
Saudi prince is going to Pakistan or
business delegations that's the one
support they have get amojan our Foreign
Affairs Eric Turner joins us from right
outside South Block a very important
diplomatic offensive this Gita an
attempt to win over and ensure that on
diplomat
West Asia understand exactly what India
is intending to do and why Gita what can
you tell us
morale this is day two of India's
diplomatic offensive day one we saw g20
countries and and an important immediate
neighborhood are that ruling in foreign
secretary which I go clear engagement
they too is West Asia and a some
Southeast Asian countries Laos just went
in a while ago foreign secretaries
engaging with everyone okay who else
have the Indian diplomat spoken to we've
seen so far 48 countries come out and
condemn thus terror attack the United
States especially important get afore
the kind of statement that's come from
Washington DC absolutely wrong a very
important statement not just coming in
from the United States White House the
shastri Affairs was come and buy their
Pakistani Foreign Secretary yesterday
and after that to show that US stands
with India we had Secretary of State for
Mayo putting out another tweet naming
and shaming Pakistan so United States
completely standing with India or after
the Obama attack and what we are also
given to understand is that yesterday
foreign secretary Vijay go clay met with
the Chinese ambassadors separately and
then in batches with every other country
also very important move over here but
the second very important diplomatic
offensive that we will be seeing is in
the F ETF and the European Commission
where Pakistan who is most likely to be
blacklisted the review meeting is coming
up this week where we are looking at
gray listing moving to blacklist see but
it's in October when the final black
listing will happen this is where that
engagement is also taking place India is
not just engaging these countries to
isolate Pakistan or to say well this is
what Pakistan is done and this is the
role Pakistan plays around what our
India is doing is also to say that this
is how Pakistan is financing supporting
terrorism and terrorist infrastructure
and these are the very same countries
who are arriving here one after the
other
now these are the countries that play a
very important role in those groupings
37 member fa TF grouping as also the
European Commission European Union
Commission that normally as procedure
blacklist any country that has been gray
listed at the f8 year so the nomination
of Pakistan has already happened at the
European Commission a foreign secretary
met with the European Union countries
major ones at that yesterday Germany
France Italy all the ambassadors with
your hand it seems like this engagement
is going to continue so what happens at
the Financial Action Task Force very
crucial a group founded in 1989 on the

The call came from ...",2019-02-16T07:46:45Z,India Today,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/stwFgK179PE/hqdefault.jpg,"breaking news just coming in US National
Security Advisor John Walton has told us
count about Ajit Doval that America
supports India's right to self-defense
that's the very latest that is just
trickling in as we speak
Bolton in fact called up Ajit Doval to
express his condolences for the terror
attack in Jammu and Kashmir and offered
the United States full support to India
in confronting terrorism Bolton went on
to say that the United States of America
has been very clear to Pakistan on
ending support to terrorist safe havens
in a very stern message to Pakistan by
the United States the White House has
asked Islamabad to immediately end its
support to all the terror groups and not
to provide them safe haven to them
that's a very latest that is coming in
Gita Mona foreign affairs editor is
joining us on the phone I'm Gita walk us
through this entire conversation that
took place between US national security
advisor john bolton and his counterpart
Ajit Doval
that reflects that the u.s. is now
supporting India's right to self-defense
now the question really injured is Gita
will they end up walking the talk this
time around well the United States of
America when it comes to supporting
India on the issue of terrorism
particularly terrorism emanating from
Pakistan has been has been quite
tremendous they have been supporting
India and the and and the fact that this
came out and not only said that India
has the right to self-defense but also
went ahead and said that perpetrators
should be brought to books
invited summoned by the foreign sexual
freedom village and to our last evening
of the shouts affairs of the United
States of America to Islamabad he was
the the shouts Affairs were summoned
last evening after the statement made by
White House where Pakistan was named
after national security advisor Bolton
spoke with Ajit Doval which we broke
last evening and what we are what we
given to understand is that the United
States of America
is absolutely certain that there are
elements within Pakistan that are
supporting these groups and these terror
networks and they are they have been
walking the talk at least on which side
of the fence they are going to be on and
it certainly seems like they are with
India on this absolutely so you've got
the u.s. that is backing India and
supporting India as far as fighting
terrorism with Pakistan is concerned now
the question really is the compliance of
Pakistan on this front you've got Imran
Khan of the PTI who talks about Anaya
Pakistan but right under his nose he is
breeding these terrorists who are
killing our soldiers in the valley well
there is going to be no change in the
policy of Pakistan the policy of using
terrorism as a instrument of state
policy something that Pakistan has
employed for four decades now and is the
only reason why that their entire
economy is based on and run so there is
going to be no change no shift in how
Pakistan support service infrastructure
and terror networks and gives them safe
havens the only thing that one has to
look at this whether it's China is going
to continue supporting Pakistan India
can do all it wants on the diplomatic
front but unless and until China pulls
our support there is going to be no
forward movement or momentum created to
bring the perpetrators to justice or at
least bring us to that vegetable
absolutely Geeta thanks so much for
bringing us that breaking news coming in
right there the u.s. of course is here
supporting India and its fight to
terrorism that's the very latest that is
coming in will be on top of the story

saying this me there are lots of
reactions pouring in from all over the
world but none from Pakistan when it
comes to even a condemnation did August
on say anything when we had Mumbai 26/11
didn't so why are we expecting anything
from them I'm sure we all know who aids
who assists who encourages terrorists in
India and therefore let's go by that
pakistan-based terror network joshi
mohammed has claimed responsibility
Masood Azhar is in Pakistan yet Pakistan
is taking no action what is it that
India is going to do with regards to
this attack and how is it going to take
up the issue of Pakistan's involvement
see whenever incident happens action has
to be taken after assessing lot of
things so let's not jump the gun and say
oh let's get action immediately no
action has to be taken it has to be well
thought of it has to be its effects must
be realized and what you do must have a
result so I'm not going to go into what
what action should be taken there are a
lot of people who are tasked with this
and they will put their minds together
and do something about it all I can say
is it is a very sad incident in fact
having served for 12 yrs and Kashmir I
can say each incident is sad whether it
is one man or it is 44 people or it is
10 people each incident is sad I am sure
Indian Army is capable and the Indian
security forces are capable of making
people realize that they cannot go
unpunished
Pakistan cannot go unpunished that's the
very clear message going out from the
former chief of the Indian Army stuff
and now a minister in the Modi
government but he also makes an
important point on a press that for
everyone watching India today at this
time while we seek action we must not
put undue pressure to suggest that that
action be taken tonight or tomorrow
allow the Union Army allow the National
Security Adviser the opportunity to pick
a time of their choosing to pick a
method of their choosing revenge is a
dish best served cold this is when
Pakistan is expecting us we cannot walk
into a trap we will strike back when the
men who need to take the decision think
it's the best time to take a decision
not when Pakistan is expecting us to do

dastardly terror attack on the CRPF our

pakistan-based terror group was involved
in this attack the united state calls in
pakistan to end immediately the support
and safe haven provided to all terrorist
groups operating on its soil whose only
goal is to in fact inshore chaos
violence and terror in the region this
is insignificant in fact of story with
Geeta Mohan is breaking here on India
today let me go across to our Foreign
Affairs LT Gaeta Mohan DITA the entire
world
it took Pakistan several hours even to
acknowledge this terror attack
it took Pakistan several hours for their
prime minister to speak in support of
the victims as far as this era track is
concerned at least others showing them
the mirror well that's right I'll skip
out some not did not even mention a
condemnation in its statement and that's
a rather shameful given the fact that
the entire terrorism and terrorist
network at work proposes a piece of this
how the fast not having said that US has
come out very strongly against the
terror attack not just condemning it but
asking calling upon Pakistan to stop
again in support or allowing safe havens
to these terror networks have Masood
other a man who's the chief of the UN
designated terrorist networks he lives
right and is allowed space and Pakistan
United States of America taking note of
that and the serious condemnation coming
Pakistan's way despite the fact that it
has brought been a single word from
Imran Khan the Prime Minister and the
statement that was put out by the
Foreign Office of Pakistan was rather a
flimsy excuse to highlight what they
thought they needed to in terms of
diverting attention from the fat pockets
of urban forests
all right thank you so much Geeta for
joining us with all those details United
States standing strongly behind the
India and has advised Pakistan to rein
in and go after the terror elements on
its soil but this well it just keeps
happening these words of advice are
given to Pakistan nothing happens after

increased more significantly now thanks

yigL4SFAaYs,Did These Journalists Really Say This About Narendra Modi? #FactCheck,A video posted on a Facebook page showing journalists of the India Today Group praising PM Narendra Modi isn't the complete ...,2019-02-12T10:23:47Z,India Today,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yigL4SFAaYs/hqdefault.jpg,"a video clip has been going viral on
social media and it's been shared widely
as well depicting senior journalists of
the India Today group apparently
eulogizing the dynamic work of the
Narendra Modi government now this video
clip was put out it was posted it's four
minutes six seconds long put out on the
9th of February by a group called
politics today nama Bharat 2019 the
Facebook page politics today nama
Bharath 2019 which put out this
misleading video titled with the actual
caption why Modi again watch this is a
page that was created on December the
22nd 2017 well Indira days fact-check
team has found that this video has
obviously been very mischievously edited
select comments have been taken and
stitched together to provide a
completely misleading view of what this
video is really about it's been a
certain purposeful dynamic leadership
which mr. moody has provided there is no
doubt that he has given a certain sense
of energy to the office of Prime
Minister politically he seems
unassailable his credibility levels are
at an all-time high and the opposition
stands decimal is perhaps one of the
most hardworking Prime Minister's that
India has had he has a very clear vision
and direction in which he wants India to
go he has the people behind him
obviously as we have seen in the yupi
elections and he also is a very hands-on
prime minister if you look at the full
video of the show it's immediately clear
that all critical comments by senior
journalists of India today like Rajdeep
Sardesai Javed and sorry and Rodchenko
pav have been deliberately and
maliciously dropped
now that may be partly ideological
baggage that this government carries
from the fact that it is spawned out of
the womb of the Sangh Parivar analysis
but I do believe that if I'm a minority
in India today I feel a sense of fear if
I was a minority and when I hear about
Gao RockShox one day or beef bans the
next I wonder whether I'm being targeted
in some manners Kashmir and the next
problem remain the same more lives are
being lost in terms of civilians as well
as Jevons both in Kashmir and in the
most infested areas the real concern
I feel about the economy is that
manufacturing really hasn't grown they
did suffer depression some amount of
lack of growth during the monetization
picked up a bit but not substantially so
what we're seeing is really a jobless
growth on many sectors they have not
been able to private investment has not
come in in the manner that it should
partly and maybe largely because of the
huge amount of debts that they owe the
banks so this was a special show that
India Today had put out in May 2017 when
the Modi government had turned 3 the
show was called a good bad and the ugly
three years under moody so the original
video is 25 minutes long and is more
than a year and a half old so we
actually reached out to the journalists
depicted in this video for their
comments on this four minute six second
clip going viral this is the most
misleading and mischievous video that I
have seen we had done a program in 2017
and may 2017 reviewing the three years
of the Modi government which we titled
the good the bad and the ugly what they
have selectively done is taken only the
courts that we have talked about in turn
in in the good section and then
pretended that it is a 20-19 video two
years have passed opinions have changed
about mr. Modi we ourselves in that
particular video we're critical of many
of the aspects of the Modi government
look that video has been mischievously
edited to only show the parts where we
are
seeing moody and removing the parts
where we are questioning or criticizing
mr. moody it is a two year old video of
a program that was done called good bad
and ugly of the Modi government you're
only showing the good and not what we
said in the bad and ugly look I have no
problem praising the Modi government but
I also have the right to criticize mr.
Modi's government and if whoever put out
that video was being honest they would
show both the good and the bad it's
absurd it's absolutely absurd
we were appreciated with something
critical in a lot of other things this
obviously is the handiwork this is
election season and this is obviously
the handiwork of the dirty tricks
department they suddenly want to try and
create this impression that we are
cheerleaders or trying to support the
Modi government we've at least I none of
us hold hold a brief for any political
party and are my humble advice request
to all those who are jumping to
conclusions is please take the trouble
of going through the original video

you just heard the defense minister in
fact speaking about the Hindu report and
she said that if the Prime Minister
inquires about any particular deal that
shouldn't be construed as interference
and this is coming at a time when the
Congress party has sharpened this attack
and and Supriya is also with the with me
right now Supriya the Congress obviously
will use this report to their own
political advantage we just have heard
Malika Arjun kar gaye reiterating his
demand for a Joint Parliamentary
Committee probe to investigate the deal
but this this this you know this
stunning twist of the entire controversy
is something that is going to continue
for some time at least well log on to
cars we were just talking a couple of
minutes back this is the new aggressive
raga on raffle with the Congress party
is humming and certainly this is not
sounding musical to the ears of BJP we
have seen as to how at 10:45 a press
conference is addressed by Congress
president Rahul Gandhi and villain one
and a half it is none other than the
defense minister who comes out and says
that this is the government side of the
story they're saying that there was no
interference just an inquiry about the
entire deal was taking place at the time
which was take which happened as I said
this PMO interference which the Congress
allegedly is you know saying so as far
as the Congress party is concerned what
we are hearing from our sources the
strategy is very simple only three days
are left for the last session of this
very you know the government's
functioning will end this is the last
session of the 16th Lok Sabha and then
the country will go into the election
mode what we are hearing is in the next
three days again they're going to
sharpen the attack as far as Polish is
concerned they're going to ask for jpc
probe they have seen as to how other
opposition leaders have also chipped in
it was a TMC also who was saying that
what is happening see there are these
footnotes which are coming out and the
government and the Prime Minister is
specific in particularly has to answer
the you know allegations which are being
level as far as the raffle is concerned
after the jpc demand which we are seeing
is going to be taken you know
it's gonna take the center stage is next
three days as far as the opposition's
attack is concerned we are hearing that
the Congress party will go all out and
say that if the opposition of the
mahathat one then of the Congress is
voted to power there will be a criminal
proceeding which will be initiated as
far as the raffle is concerned with a
proper probe a proper investigation in
Raphael which will take place but it is
such a stunning turn it is so explosive
I mean just last year you had the Prime
Minister and the government putting out
all the information in the Supreme Court
that there was no role in fact and the
prime ministers from the Prime
Minister's office in their file deal all
of this being being put to you know the
Supreme Court of Supriya it's
interesting when the government on one
hand is saying that the entire probe was
carried out by a seven-member team you
have this report saying that the head of
the Indian ago she ating team had also
written to the joint secretary of the
Prime Minister apprising him of the same
speaking about a conversation that had
apparently happened between the French
government and the Prime Minister's
Office well absolutely yes Avantika as
well as this letter is concerned it's
really very very explosive this has
given more Arsenal in the hands of the
principal opposition party and that's
why we have seen as to how the Congress
president when he said that he's going
to play on the front foot is coming all
out there's a pressure in the morning
and then there these copies which are
distributed and what is happening in
looks about notice why it's for us to
see there is complete ruckus there other
MPs are saying you know that they want a
jpc probe the entire opposition is
standing behind you and still conference
president ends up saying that there is
more to come so this is very interesting
there is more evidence in the Congress
OCR saying that there's enough evidence
to nail none other than the Prime
Minister of the country as far as the
raffle is concerned as far as the
government is concerned there have been
long you know speeches we have seen in
the Parliament we have seen as to how
very quickly the government is coming
out and giving the government side of
story just now also it was none other
than the defense minister who came out
and gave out their side of the story she
gave one exactly happened behind that
wave footnote but it's a catch-22
situation as far as government is
concerned is what the opposition is
saying they're saying that they will go
all out they will be attacking the
government
on the raffle they will be asking the
question just a couple of hours in the
afternoon except today we are expected
to hear once again from Congress
president when he's gonna address the
rest of Budokan sister Lee a shot in the
arm it's coming a day after the prime
minister attack the opposition accusing
it of not having good intent from the
Indian force wanting to have a very a a
weak Indian Air Force and here you have
this report that goes on to state how
the PMO's office was carrying about
these parallel negotiations
tell me something Supriya how will the
Congress now how will they put pressure
on the government and on the speaker to
initiate a jpc into this entire deal
where the strategy is very simple as far
as the jpc probe is concerned the rest
of the session of the the days which are
left in the budget session of the
Parliament the Congress will be going
all out along with the other opposition
a leader saying that a jpc probe should
take place we don't want to hear any
more Accord I will do is so this this
big charge in a stunning twist the
entire defile fighter jet deal has been
done by the Congress party on the basis
of newspaper report this is a Hindu
newspaper report that has carried this
story but Nirmala Sitharaman outrightly
dismissed that report in fact she said
that if the Prime Minister is inquiring
about a certain deal which is concerned
to the forces and the country that
shouldn't be construed as interfering
into the deal in fact this is what she
had to say on the floor of the house

issuing a whip shows that things are not
alright but like you mentioned he said
that if those emily's do not attend the
CLP meeting tomorrow morning before the
budget is presented then it will mean
that they are willing to give up their
primary membership but it does not stop
there he also says that there after that
they will actually proceed with the next
step that is disqualifying them because
a whip has been issued they are not
coming over there which means they have
disobeyed the CLP leaders orders and
also the whip so they will be
disqualified so the next process will be
set into motion so now they are being
extremely extremely strict on that count
where what we're told is that the BJP in
the morning had all the senior leaders
had met after mr. Bao europeís home and
dollars colony in order to decide what
exactly is their plan of action because
yesterday a senior BJP leader shri rama
knew had stated that they have two
options before them one submitted a
memorandum before the governor stating
that this government the coalition
government has lost the majority and to
move a no-confidence motion now they're
also alright what they need are about

center's latest move of moving a
petition in the Supreme Court asking the
courts to give back the exes land
BSP has reacted it has slammed the
government over the recent moved by the
BJP it says that it's only a
government's desperate move after the
recent SP BSP Alliance BSP says this is
nothing but a political stunt and a poll
gimmick to try and boo the voters
Siobhan de subasta joins us for more in
this shavonda so obviously you know this
move by the BJP took everyone by
surprise including the BSP which has
come down very heavily saying that this
is nothing but a pool gimmick ahead of
the looks of Elections very clearly I
want to carve ESP especially smiley says
that that it is just only trying to fool
people of India and their past policies
and also this is useful that they are
just showing that they are very
concerned about brahmin lives on temple
and bavi not official but the fact is
that they have do with this issue that's
why they are lingering on the coalition
and just to gain politically they have
filed a petition which has no legal
value as of now and that's why they're
against this entire act on we get the
other political party also targeting it
before playing this kind of image the
parties are also saying that this is
just and and that's what they have
started this practice to petition
government should be indra do you think
that the move by the government of
moving the supreme court seeking its
permission to return the excess land
would have rattling the opposition
parties particularly SP and the BSP but
would that have any impact on the water

decision whether they're accepting the

and all sorts of promises are being made
by our political leaders communist
president Rahul Gandhi said the cat
among pigeons when he jumped BJ peas gun
and went ahead with his poll promise of
basic income for one and all just four
days before the budget the Congress is
promising that if they are voted to
power they will have a formula to rid
India of poverty how much of this is
election optics and how much is feasible
here is a quick look at what all the
human cry is about universal basic
income or ubi is from a school of
economic thought that supports the
government paying out a fixed
subsistence income to each and every
citizen of a country there are
variations to the scheme where certain
criteria is used to qualify recipients
and there have been experiments with ubi
in different parts of the world but not
yet in India come sit down
nuta Anthony Hindustan tea citta del HRA
here in Busan
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
ahead of budget 2019 the rhetoric of
universal basic income has picked up
pace in India and instead of the Modi
government making the announcement it
turned out to be the Congress which has
put its plans out the Congress chief
declared that if voted to power the
party will provide minimum basic income
to every poor Indian the initial idea of
the ubi scheme was mooted in the
economic survey of 2016-17 according to
it the government would provide 650
rupees per month to a probable 70
percent of the country's population
according to the Economic Survey of
2016-17 the estimate was that this would
cost the government four to five percent
of the GDP the difference in RAL
Gandhi's proposal compared to that of
the Modi government's Economic Survey is
in its scope and ambit this is not a
universal basic income scheme that
schemed will give a same amount of money
to everyone in this country including
you and me that's not the idea the idea
is to target the poorest 15 percent or
18 percent or 20 percent whoever are the
poorest will be targeted
critics say that this is similar to the
schemes that have failed in the past
Mondragon was again an idea like that it
worked it can be perfected always the
thing is that you should implement it
then perfect it over a period of time
two states in India Sikkim and Telangana
have already started work on frameworks
similar to universal basic income
Telangana became the first Indian state
to provide unconditional cash transfers
to farmers under its right to Pandu
scheme and Sikkim has proposed to
introduced ubi for all its residents
as the Congress has already opened up on
its plans of implementing universal
basic income the ball is now in the Modi
government's Court through the waters
ahead of the general elections and what
about the ruling party from promising to
Koror jobs per annum to having possibly
failed also on that front at some level
from at all claim to employ youth of
nation through effective job creation to
also selling pakoras if required and
create self-employment that in ramadi
government has changed goal posts often
but also now the question is have enough
jobs not been created as was promised in
2014 that remains the core issue and
perhaps also one of the most debated
ones in the last four years has a report
card of Modi government five years ago
Narendra Modi promised India to crops
per annum
four years later and close to the heels
of the end of his ten yards the reality
remains starkly different
in December 2018 the CMI data revealed
three crore unemployed youths looking
for a job
29.6 like government vacancies remain
unfilled and sixty nine point three nine
lakh Indian youth have registered in
employment exchange India today needs a
stellar cruise rate of nine percent and
above along with serious reforms in land
and labour policies to fulfill the
promises made by Narendra Modi in the
year 2014 the India today mood of the
nation survey reveals unemployment as a
big area of concern amongst voters in
India lack of jobs stands out as the
single biggest failure of the Narendra
Modi government according to our mood of
the nation survey one out of every three
Indian considers this as a big failure
clearly the pace of growth is not
creating jobs that's part of the
distress because you know as you know
some people in agriculture say what we
need is to get out of agriculture and
how do we get people out of agriculture
into the workforce in a in a serious way
that's a matter of creating good jobs
how do we create them one of the things
we have to do is is job creation I don't
think we've been very successful at
creating jobs even number 7.5 percent
growth rate that we have you have many
many brilliant young people coming to
the markets and they need to find jobs
so creation of activity and economic
value that delivers in terms of jobs is
critical
the more the government will have no
choice but to correct the course in the
interim budget Bureau report
India today many young people now have
access to higher education but does
higher education guarantee jobs any more
educated unemployed unemployed youth are
growing in numbers and this time my
colleague Indrajith Kundu from Kolkata
decided to bring you this story of her
youth who struggles to find a job that
fits him and on the other hand another
is disappointed even with proper
enumeration for academics and qualified
future teachers not really reaching out
to the youth take a look at this report
the job situation in the country today
is quite gloomy and in that backdrop the
story of 24 year old Shubham day a
student from West Bengal possibly
replicates the stories of many
youngsters across this country Shubham
has to support a family of six members
at the same time
first you his master's degree you're in
West Bengal didn't mean okay Emily I'm
Evita was a security agency say you have
a high delivery Boyka those who say of
course come sircome
chases artists attack military almost
what could need a salary at Kadena other
which tuitions provided a parado shoe
bombs case clearly shows that contrary
to the popular belief having a master's
degree is no guarantee to getting a
decent job in a globalized job market
specialization is what matters but
despite having such specialization there
are several youngsters were still
looking out for jobs and finding it
difficult to secure one and Ritu Sri
Sengupta and I'm working as a PhD
scholar in the Department of English
visual healthy which is in Shantiniketan
as we all know and I have been a part of
this turmoil joblessness that is
prevailing in Kolkata right now I was
working in Bangalore in Riva University
the jobs which Kolkata had for me right
at that year they actually paid peanuts
where are our jobs why aren't you taking
more
why aren't you increasing our
scholarship amount 8,000 is the not net
fellowship and 32,000 for the JREF as
the Modi government prepares to table
its final budget there is bad news for
the economy according to a latest survey
by the Centre for monitoring Indian
economy more than crore Indians have
lost their job in 2018 even as
unemployment rate stands at an all-time
high
clearly for those entering the job
market now in India these are rough
times coming ahead with camera person
probably response Indrajit find out
today in Kolkata
despite education difficult to find a
job eventually the budget of the economy
boils down to the livelihood of people
so beyond the jargons and politics it is
a job that creates a country and then is
reflected in its robust or failing
economic health so while the government
since the time of swearing-in has
promoted startups and many have even
pulled it off the question is has it
created enough employment here's a
ground report check by my colleague lo
Priya from Chennai
thirty-eight-year-old chunk up which is
high paying job in a leading IT company
to co-found Spinney in 2015 which is a
since referral company that took the
MSME segment by stock we started when I
was in Singapore I saw a big difference
when I moved from Singapore to here to
start operations in India some of the
significant challenges are the time
consumed to work on compliance to work
towards meeting certain requirements to
run business these are little or
slightly more of a hurdle yet in India
we are improving but I think this is
still long way to go due to sluggish
economy shankha had to downsize his team
by 20% d monetization and GST further
forced him to be strict on cash policies
so few people knew it few people had to
learn it by you know going through the
problem so these are the changes which
were required but it could have been
well planned you know people would have
got even more trained if the time was
given
was enough time to deploy this processes
despite the shortcomings Shanker is
hopeful of a positive trajectory he
believes that India's vast marketplace
will revive the trend for start-up
culture in 2019 in Chennai with Twitter
journalist Daniel Nokia India today
taking over from the promise of startup
the current government also has been
encouraging youth to be job creators and
not seekers also asking youth to return
home and help build this country but is
the ground reality as has been promised
take a look at this report by Nolan
Pinto from Bengaluru so I quit my job to
go into business and life has been
pretty much a roller coaster after that
it's been about five years since I left
my job and we've been tax compliant from
day one in the business but contrary to
popular opinion and the whole public
view of business being so glamorous the
learnings have had on the job on my own
business has been vastly different from
the projected reality outside now Priya
Jain as an entrepreneur is finding it
difficult to provide employment because
of the taxes that she needs to pay along
with GST now in another case this is the
story of a man who is actually studied
abroad let's come back to India he's
finding it difficult to get a job
because well it's not easy for everyone
to become an entrepreneur yes I'm a
virgin itself has its own course so I
believe this should remove the science
background and use commerce also as an
option I come from a commerce background
and getting my license converted is one
of the big issues in the first half to
get my science and then get my license
converted and moreover the rules and
regulations about you have to have so
many hours in the night and there's so
many hours of instrument I have had
thousand three hundred hours but I still
don't comply with the Indian
requirements and unfortunately after
paying thirty lakhs and getting my
course done I still have to pay another
ten lakhs to get my requirement up to
mark and as I come back I'm struggling
to get a job because of the science
background and this will change the
rules so according to the people we have
spoken to overall job growth requires
hassle-free policies and skill oriented
job openings for things to change and
hopefully the central and the state
budgets will look into these issues with
video journalist mother
nolan pinto for india today and finally
a concluding ground report what about
the entrepreneurs who have braved to
venture out on their own instead of
creating jobs they are now lamenting the
layoffs to sustain their job he has a
report by oxana in 2013 24-year old
syringe Raj Reddy who was into robotics
so opportunity in 3d printing technology
and very soon he had many a customers
coming in asking for the latest
technology so that's when we bought a 3d
printer for internal usage and then we
started making parts no part of our own
robots with a 3d printer in house and as
we you know went forward so I was really
connected with the electronics and no
hobbyist community in Chennai so all
these people started coming to me asking
for making parts for their own projects
and that's when we realized that there's
a good demand for 3d printing so you
know as a side project I started reading
as a separate business more like a
subsidy the flourishing business saw
customers like Nissan Febby called
Renault and even our directors from the
film fraternity approaching ready studio
there was a steady growth
you know until before this be
monetization happen and probably during
that phase people realized that it was
only hard cash that was affected but you
know since that was affected people
failed to purchase items and then in the
overall industry you know services costs
went up you know this is in sales were
not happening you know we did have to
have to do day offs okay probably at
least 50 60 percent of our stuff had to
be laid off over the next few months
and when we were recovering again there
was the DST implementation that came on
there was another wave of you know a
period of time where they were very
negligible amounts of sales from 7,000
startups in 2008 to over 49,000 startups
in 2018 the startup ecosystem is seeing
an exponential growth States a report I
to the state of Indian startup ecosystem

his projects the growing startup
ecosystem gives him hope for a better
tomorrow and a scope for revival with

of cost remains to be seen because the
last time Browns

all they worked no such details were
given to them by the govt which is
supposed to prepare a listing for the
senior-most
officers and what they were given was a
list of 70 to 80 names not even a

careful it doesn't want to come across

405 names on the committee and saying
select out of these they've given them
the entire list of people who are in

Gt_iDC0u4mA,"Minimum Income Row: Ravi Shankar Prasad Mocks &#39;Hollow Promise&#39;, P Chidambaram Hits Back","A day after Rahul Gandhi announced a universal basic income for the poor, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has called it ...",2019-01-29T09:44:32Z,India Today,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gt_iDC0u4mA/hqdefault.jpg,"massive political activist has erupted
over Rahul Gandhi's minimum income for
poor announcement mocking the Congress's
promise June Minister Ravi Shankar
Prasad said the people of India know the
reality of the congressmen have seen
through the game's terming it a pool
gimmick Prasad further said like
hundreds of other announcement the
scheme is also meant to be never
implemented on Monday Congress president
Rahul Gandhi in his chattisgarh rally
had announced that his party would
ensure minimum income guarantee for poor
in the country water to power in the
upcoming look some others
second Newton Anthony Hindustan forty
days after he introduced farm loan
waivers and three Congress ruling states
and post a few BJP ruling states to do
the same Rahul Gandhi is trying to
dictate terms again just four days ahead
of the 2019 interim budget the Congress
chief has declared that he will
introduce minimum income policy for
every poor person in India if they were
reported to power you transform a tree
moment a hot body but you put a pulley
game but Alcock diggy but what you
trapped me to look past a Pollyanna one
kilowatt solution
the BJP mocked Rahul's counter to Modi
government claiming that the
announcement was outlandish I don't
think you might be taking it very
seriously if people of this country
don't say take such promises or such
statement coming from vowels and be
seriously and in any case they invented
nothing new so this is nothing new and
that only shows this lack of imagination
lack of understanding and of above all
lack of seriousness
the universal basic income is the
brainchild of former chief economic
adviser Arvind Subramanian who spelled
out an outline in one of his economic
surveys but with only months ahead of
the looks of a polls the question
remains is Ronald's declaration
pragmatic is universal basic income an
idea whose time has come
Bureau report India today so is Rahul
Gandhi is promised a counter to Prime
Minister Modi's 10% quota for poor with
the minimum income for poor promise play
a masterstroke for the Congress in the
upcoming general election in a trace
consulting editor Rajdeep Sardesai spoke
to senior Congress leader Pichu domdom
listen was this done without any thought
simply to preempt mr. Modi's
announcement that's an outrageous
allegation we've been thinking about it
for several weeks we have looked at what
many others have said and written about
it we have looked at the chapter on the
economic survey and we have come to the
conclusion that the time has come to
assure the poorest of India a minimum
level of income we are adapting the ubi
idea the key word is adapting this is
not a universal basic income scheme that
scheme will give a same amount of money
to everyone in this country including
you and me that's not the idea the idea
is to target but poorest 15 percent or
18 percent or 20 percent whoever are the
poorest will be targeted and their
income will be raised to a minimum level
it's the same principle which underlines
minimum wages so it's a minimum income
per household or minimum income per
family that's the idea and we are
confident that we can implement it you
say it's eminently doable I read an
article recently which said the basic
challenge was the prohibitive costs
associated with it providing all
individuals with the poverty line
equivalent you be
according to this speaker 1180 rupees
per month for each individual on 2017-18
prices would cost around rupees 19
trillion or eleven point four percent of
the GDP that would be 50% more than this
centres total tax revenues I am trying
to understand how is your scheme going
to meet this major challenge of revenues
have you thought it true that Matt is
wrong that Matt is wrong even dr. Edwin
Subramanyam is ubi he is calculated will
cost 1.5 percent of GDP so I'm not
getting into discussion about numbers
when we are not even face to face and we
don't have paper and pencil in front of
us we will flesh out that numbers in the
manifesto so remember for any new idea
any novel idea there will always be
critics when Kamaraj introduced the
mid-day Meal Scheme in Tamil Nadu in
nineteen fifty four or five he was told
that the state will go bankrupt
today the mid-day Meal Scheme is a
national program every state is
implementing it Congress promised loan
waiver for farmers it was criticized
even on your channel it was criticized
severely but we implemented it fifty
eight thousand to sixty thousand crore
of loan was waived and the immediate
year following credit improved Farm
Credit improved so I think if we have
the will we can find a way we are
absolutely convinced that seventy years
after independence no family
no household should remain so poor that
it cannot put food on the table cannot
effort clothes cannot afford basic

where the crash has taken place I can
from the visuals I can only make out it
seems to be an open field I don't see
many houses around but any more
information they have the people being
evacuated if there are any residents
living in the vicinity so far air force
people are saying that no civil
casualties during this class and as per
training schedule pilot always try to to
to go beyond deep
I know civil area and try to not so
initial information there is a no real
casualty by said om teep yeah near about
the kushina's at the general area and
those people are trying to get more
detail about the especially the safety
of the alert and they are hoping that
pallet may be ejected safely and you
mentioned that this this Jaguar took off
from al-abaad right so and the crash
took place at Kushina got a new page to
be no give us more information on the
time and just when was the IAF
about this crash actually I spot this is
a very initial information that this
took took off around around 10 a.m. and
after within 10-15 minutes he lost the
control from the control area control
station and then after we didn't have 10
15 meter minute the decrease has
happened and routine training sortie and
uni and now deep Air Force people did
their first priority to get about to get
information about the pilot and all they
are hoping that as well training the
pilot may be ejected safely well we
certainly hope so retired Major General
Jerry Buckey is also joining us so we
are still awaiting for more information
but a very tragic bit of news coming in
off the Indian Air Force Jaguar fighter
plane crashing in Kushina got a
notification is still awaiting for more
details on the pilot but your thoughts
on this that has taken place in excuse
me for interrupting you our defense
correspondent shave the root is also
just joining us right now I'll just go
immediately to him to get some more
information ship any any word on the
pilot and more information about this
Indian Air Force Jaguar fighter plane
that has crashed in Kushinagar no
fighter aircraft operating in that
circle
aliases of has been a pretty face in a
craft discipline aircraft that has been
upgraded over the years as well but I am
the Jaguars also flew as the Republic
Day Parade five of them flew at the
Republic Day Parade so we're still
awaiting information about the precise
detail that happened just a very very
short while ago so I'll be back to you
with more information in a bit but we
can confirm that this posit that was
fighter that were went down then the Jag
was just go through a revamp as well if
I'm not mistaken the Indian Air Force
launching the new drive to revamp the
Jaguar ground attack fighters with with
new engines etc interesting question
about the guy actually the you're
absolutely right there has been an
effort to give Jaguar more powerful
engine but that air force is actually
hit a world because of the cost issues
the Jaguars are still flying with their
old engines even though the Air Force is
still hoping to push through that if
they can get through the budgetary
issues but in the meantime the old
engines are not exactly unsafe there and
assess that the Air Force wanted more
powerful engines but they have been
updated over the years in terms of their
electronics and their navigation and
attack system so these are pretty modern
aircraft at the Air Force is still using
even though they are o4 1770s vintage
and as you know the Jaguar is built by
him - yes it's Jets which have been
upgraded in India but as I said details
of this particular crash are still
awaited in fact I'm expecting a call any
moment now with more details and I'll
have them in full of you ok I'll come
back to you then Shiv we will try and
get more details in the interim major
general DD Bakshi excuse me for cutting
you through but if you could just kindly
complete the point that you were making
that Lobby
weight the 67 squadrons of light combat
aircraft would another production
those photons that record have generated
so much controversy before that bending
backwards you see that they stop it
the situation is by 2023 our sporting
strength of the ribbon Air Force will be
down to 26 Pakistan is 25 China can
bring thirty two squadrons Banesto
just do therefore what we need to speed
this up emergency even if there is an
intent to you know just work on the
depleting forces in the Indian Air Force
or in the other two services as well
everything is happening with its one of
the biggest stories and the kind of
seriously concern right right sir
Manji do you have any additional
information about this crash that we are
reporting about the Jaguar stay on with
me Madrid god of servants is also
joining us god of any more updates about
the Indian Air Force Jaguar fighter
plane we're seeing the wreckage of the
crash that took place in Kushinagar in
Uttar Pradesh I will take out very
preliminary information just as yet the
aircraft the deep penetration strike
aircraft for the Indian Air Force it
crashed you know within minutes of
taking off it lost control the pilot
lost control with the air traffic
controller as of now we're being told
that helicopters are being sent out to
locate you know the pilot fortunately
the wreckage has been located by Memphis
I they haven't found the pilot just yet
so fingers crossed all efforts to see
you know that he's been located save me
one of the unfortunate aspects is that
this is you know
very low flying aircraft so margin of
error is very very limited in what
Jaguar pilots tell us and this was one
such training shorty this aircraft flies
lower than the radar into enemy
territory to deliver its cargo and
quickly turn around and fly back right
which is what sources tell us is usually
the shorty but more will be known only
after the board of inquiry training
mission was this a routine training
mission when the crash occurred you're
absolutely right of antica this was a
training sortie a routine regular
morning training sortie with with the
pilots more details are still awaited of
unpicked all right and we'll come back
to you then

lashed out today saying that if the
Congress is not happy with the style of
working he can quit is not here to speak
to the chair is what he has said
definitely there will be repercussions
because the CCP will also target the

when they come to Karnataka to target

what what's the next step Chanda Kochhar
one of India's best-known corporate
leaders finally facing an F IR in a
story that India today had extensively
reported last year
what happens next now an F IR has been
registered what next what could be the
next move of CBI that they could also go
in for arrest of Chanda Kochhar Deepak
culture and Venu Gopal dude while have
been charged with sections and 420 IPC
and several sections of Prevention of
Corruption Act we are very serious and
non bailable sections sources are
telling us that Venugopal dude and
deeper culture have already sought legal
counsel and are planning to move court
so that they could seek anticipatory
bail but it has yet to be confirmed from
Deepak culture and Manu Gopal dude
but what Manish a colleague punished had
been to the CBI headquarters and what
sources and see there have told us that
very soon
the three accused I could be summoned to
CBI headquarters and where they will be
they will be questioned because they
work there is a direct evidence of
kickbacks being received by deeper
culture after few months after 3,250
crore what loan was sanctioned by the
ICA say bank - Venugopal dude so this is
a very clear-cut evidence that the
agency has against the accused trial the
a fire clearly says that Chanda Kochhar
was then the Acting CEO and MD of ICS a
bank had cheated the bank and due to
which the iicense a bank had to suffer
huge losses so this particular case will
also let me bring him Mustafa as well
hold on livvie Asia Mustafa
what about Videocon has there been any
reaction from Videocon from Venugopal
dude from the company itself considering
he is one of the accused uh well since
morning the rates have been going on we
are currently outside Videocon office
and in metal coat and since 9 a.m. 5 to
6 CBI officials are present on the 17th
floor office of the video call and we
are being told that they've asked for
various documents and paper and there is
questioning going on by the promoter
Venugopal good so it's expected that
once the raid is over there may be some
response from Videocon but at this point
of time there hasn't been any and if you
look at the fire which as you know we
have that's very interesting to see that
it's not only Chanda Kochhar
the King senior officers of ICICI Bank
are also named in the a fire dead and it
said that they may be questioned and the
names also include the name of Sandy
buck she was the current CEO what they
are saying what in the a fire is that
when the loans were clear they're clear
there was a committee Chanda Kochhar was
on the committee okay but there was
namely a lot of other senior sales bank
officials who are currently inside the
bank wall so present at the committee
and date may be questioned in this whole
matter back to you okay
we've got to keep a track of that story
it's a big development it could move
fast questioning an arrest could take
place later we will not speculate the

history the Indian captain in another
first has swept the top ICC awards in
which he's been adjudged the cricketer
off the besides being named one day and
test player for the year 2018 here's all
that the Indian captain took away from
the ICC's annual awards list Vinod Kohli
is the undisputed king of world cricket
the Indian skipper edged his name in
record books yet again becoming the
first cricketer to bag all three ICC
awards in a single layer along with
destined one day Player of the Year
virata's bagged the ICC's top honor the
Garfield Sobers cricketer of 2018 award
as well having recognition at the global
level from ICC is something which you
feel proud of as a cricketer because you
understand there's many players who are
playing
to be rewarded in this manner amongst
all of them is obviously a very
crowd moment in something
that gives you more motive
[Music]
and keep bringing consistent points and
so from that point of view I think these
awards just give you that extra
motivation this is the second straight
year that virata's bagged the ICC stop
honor joining Ricky Ponting in the elite
list of winning it consecutively it
capped some memorable 2018 for Virata
who was the top run scorer in tests with
1322 runs at an average of 55 point zero
eight with centuries in each of South
Africa England India and Australia
over 2 1 days where he accumulated 1202
runs at a stunning average 130 3.55 he
also became the fastest to reach the
milestone of 10000 runs in the format
been amazing it I was able to
in a manner that I would have imagined
if the intention is right and you keep
working hard the results are there in
front of your own eyes so I think the
intent always has to be
and these performances you are pushing
yourself to a limit which otherwise
won't be able to so that that is
something I experienced in 2018 a lot it
was an unforgettable 2018 for King
Cooley we're experts and pundits were
left in off his exploits think all round
Eric Carles the best player in the world
in across all the three formats kind of
a complete player I think it will trick
it after such a Tendulkar existed he's
just unbelievable or run machine I would
say and the head coach of winning team
when I see him batting like this and
I've seen him batting across all
conditions in all formats and it's not
just averages it's the way you get runs
when you get it and impact those runs
have on what the team does to add to his
post accolades
Borodin's also named the captain of the
ICC's test in one day team's a clean
sweep of the ICC Awards has put their
art in a different league well one can
only hope that this gives him the
impetus to add another feather to this
gap in 2019 becoming a World Cup winning
captain as well

seen emanating from the lake from a
kilometers distance this is a serious
concern that has emerged right from the
to burner
Holly Nick it's a huge fan
Nolan Pinto joins me from from Bengaluru
on the phone line Nolan what precisely
happened here where is this lake located
well this is a super oily Lake it's
somewhere between the water lake in the
ballon d'or lake now in there today has
reported in the past how in the vicinity
of the tube Rahula lake and the water
Dominic area lake
you have a lot of these migrants staying
over there now the issue is not the
migrant staying over there but the point
or the fact that they recycle waste or
segregate waste so whatever they want
they take the rest is dumped into the
list you can you can actually see a
thermal call floating in the lake you
can actually see you name it and it's in
that particular Lake know the particular
place so the area where this particular
part is on fire it looks like there's a
lot of grass over there weed we are not
to show because we cannot enter right
inside there residents are telling me
that it is waste along with the grass
and the weeds that is actually caught
fire
Oh someone could've done this on purpose
they are called the residents have also
called the fire emergency services still
no one has arrived at the spot but you
can actually see thick smoke billowing
from that particular spot say about 100
metres away from that place so that
means it's not only an environment
concern but also health hazard I'm in
fact now joined by a resident from
Bengaluru mr. Jeong beach-ready is on
the phone line with me mr. Jarvis ready
do you stay nearby with regard to this
lake and can you tell us is it that
visible from from a near distance mr.

lake on day by day kicker
normalizing rifle for no I'm going
around the neck and this morning I
didn't find everything in our army to
accept or starve is something I know VND
waste being dumped into the lake is a
regular ferry to the sake you know from
Latvia was what I could be seized and
all some kind of shame and always put
out of the egg so now we know it's
spreading across the lake because of a
China's no one said you know we were
saved in the past as well raise your
other issue yes but now you know from
the fine varied the garbage openings are
mere case of fire this is a case of one
of our no laughs no missiles from that
point on we go into the middle of the
lake which is there a proper wetland
since last 30 years I don't mean you
know people paid or disturbed at all
negative angles on fire now I could be
almost three extents of makers will
completely child out and whatever was
inside ever birds it'll just like being

today about the probe that is
vindicating the former security officer
there d IG prisons now we know that
Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister G
Parameshwar is clueless over the VVIP
treatment that was being given to Sasha
kala and the report that has now come
out cannot cos deputy chief minister
says he has no idea about the Home
Minister and the report
Nolan Pinto joins me for further details
Nolan what does the deputy cm saying is
he not acknowledging the report and the
RTI report that has come up one factor
though omen is actually the deputy chief
minister who was the Home Minister this
took place as clearly stating that he
has no idea about this particular RTI
request he has no idea about this earth
now that would be well highly in Spain
as one could say the least because he
was the Home Minister and all this
happened the Grammy Award Chief Minister
then it was during the atomic Ruggeri
the grammarians regime so the hope their
deputy chief minister to actually come
out and say that he has no idea about
this is just if one could call it again
preposterous because he knows everything
it's just that now it looks like because
of senior Congress leaders or senior
leaders do not want to acknowledge what
has happened over there because we must
remember when this issue took place it
was the former Chief Minister
Siddaramaiah whoever yeah
to Dhiru power to explain herself in
spite of she coming out with a four-page
report saying that there are
irregularities that are taking place
here to look into it but and then we saw
what really happened how the two main
officers were transferred out of there
but it's interesting again future
because in the report here the
observation they are not talking about
the particular cases case of the
shashikala what sort of what what
changes have been put in place
absolutely clueless as Nolan is telling
us here on India today I'm now joined by
phuket ND he is an aide of sakala he in
fact said that there were harsh
conditions on women inmates mr. Poirot
indeed now it was for all to know that
sakala was indeed getting a VVIP
treatment and the senior officer only
did her job to write it in the report
India today this rating this I don't
know suddenly is going on either coast
no problem in religion airplane but one
thing a business he's a prisoner that we
remember original number two prisoners
in the prison role of religion in
karateka this is Madame Shigella my
bloated leader general faculty of the
parties and number two prisoner even
though income tax also be including the
first class we are not afraid for that
kind information to you you are refuting
the report you're questioning the timing
okay yes sir
okay see that which are all the mobs in
the prison are moving on because
unnecessarily the police are busy
completely against me Taylor and Rao
believe or not but that's precisely the
report that is submitted to the
government it's made public mr. Pogue
rnd but thank you for joining us of
course a sacar laws it says that it was
deliberate against her and that d Rupa
you're of course listening to all these
reactions coming in it's still not
stopping but what next for the d IG
former d IG prisons and IGP now Home
Guard from where do you go okay
I gave this report in July 2017 and I
had joined this post reported to this
post only in June and within 1520 days
of me going and seeing there I had
reported so and to say that somebody
else was prodding me to do this is I
mean I think it's quite insulting to an
officer it says this thing officer
doesn't have her own brain ok brains and
you know her own personality to see what
is right what is wrong what is legal or
not and to report ok so it is reducing
to that so that's quite demeaning I did
it on my own because I and I did it as
per law and this report you definitely
small nation about timing and yes there
will be questionnaire are questions of
timing as well but nevertheless I would
say do you Rupa you have come when

right now two women who reach Nilachal
base camp to go to Subway Milad were
asked to return by cops
police warn them about protesters
gathered in pombe Reshma
Nishant and Chandler had tried to enter
some ramela last week - but they were
stopped at Neal Amana today also they
came with a team of a sixth other men
they've now been shifted to Emily my
colleague Gopi Krishna oniisan in fact
joins me on this story
gopi give us more details it appears
that while the state government is
telling the supreme court that they have
managed to you know have 51 women into
the subliminal shrine since the apex
court orders obviously though doubtful
of that claim women are still finding it
difficult to enter the shrine two
different things that the one that the
state government has for the I quote and
one that is happening at the ground
level because when they whenever there
is a situation that the people know is
that women between the defendant we have
coming and when they try to take a pill
and when they get notice it it will
become really really difficult for them
to start the tricking and the police
cannot really improve and enforces women
entry in the temple because it's a it's
a religious plate and they cannot really
use boots on the ground and that is one
thing that we have seen over the last
two months where the police has been
trying to convince the people or
convince the women if they easily get no
fees then the police might suggest that
you because you may return to your safe
location now and come back at some other
time and now these two women are
actually Richmond is and that Manama and
one of the women who had accompanied her
these are actually two men who try to
enter subliminal laugh because when they
managed to press almost 100 meters from
the base camp but it really Bella they
were stopped by the devotees and there
was a standoff for over three and a half
hour so this is what we have seen lastly
when the pain women try to enter and
with the temple about to close on Sunday
the police is actually looking at the
situation that they did not want to
create any further troubles in Sodom
Allah and them also got this intelligent
input there because the temple is about
the floor
many people who have actually gathered
in supreme Allah as producers have
started coming down towards the base
camp in gamba so to avoid any such
commotion or standoff the police have
informed these women that you must
return from this place they initially
refused and then we have been told that
after our communication for over an hour
they have convinced and they have now
will move to Italy using some fifty
kilometers from the Supreme elevation

was quick to respond to what the Chief
Minister had to say his remark where he
said that it's his misfortune to lead a
coalition government however while
extending his support of the Karnataka
Chief Minister the Congress leader the
nazgûl oorah has said that coalition
government is different and people will
have to make a lot of compromises
the chief minister said yesterday was
it's his misfortune that is the Chief
Minister every time there's a coalition
government here and it's difficult to
implement projects see obviously
coalition is different than being a
single-party rule is different though
you have to manage different people
different political parties also when we
have a destructive opposition like BJP
using its strengths in the central
government to somewhat derailed is
government it does add a lot of stress
you know it does a lot of confusion to
administration also so the BJP is
playing such negative politics in this
country today and that also is a is a
difficult process so correlation is an
arrangement which needs you know give
and take a flexibility and for anyone
who runs it it does take a lot of
compromise and I can understand what the
chief Mossad is trying to say well
Charlie a short while ago spoke to the
chief minister where he did admits to
have been finding the situation quite
challenging as far as the coalition
government is concerned Charlie do you
think that the the crisis that unfolded
in Karnataka was a result of these
differences within the Alliance partners
do you think that the BJP could see
through it and and only went ahead to
exploit the tension between the JDS and
the Congress
indeed Avantika there were a few missed
people people who were promised cabinet
birds people who were promised to make
chairman across boards but none of that
was actually put into play the Congress
and the genius
I had to please each other when they
came together as this coalition
government because this was already
during the elections after the elections
it was very last-minute this coalition
was last-minute and after they were put
in place there were a lot of promises
that were made I'm probably not
fulfilled as my colleague Na Nog urgent
Dwarka nuts was talking to be nagira he
mentioned the same thing on for know
with an allergen as well so different
things like this have missed several
emily's they are been sitting in a bomb
bay in mumbai at a renaissance the hotel
was frequented by BJP leaders they were
saying what are the other options they
can explore however the BJP also kept
their mla's in a hotel in a posh hotel
in gurugram but did not manage to get
the numbers on the ground while you were
expecting say 14 or 15 resignations a
number that they felt would actually
give them the upper hand
they could only get two independent
emily's and for miffed Congress emily's
but by then but by the time they got six
MLAs uncocks inside the Congress said we
are in tight six BJP MLAs as well so
they realized they were on very soft
ground and after that everything has
been out in the open with the JDS in
Congress still on one side and the BJP
on the other the BJP coming back into
Bengaluru all right charlie I'm going to
leave it at that but thanks so much for

time after northern Comanche fell 11
General Grant be seen as said that to
2018 has been a great year for the
security forces now a former Jammu and
Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah
lashed out in a tweet he said and I
quote I beg to differ
a great yog would mean one in which no
young man would join militancy no
terrorists would be killed and no
security fully a nickel security
personnel would lose their lives in
encounters the compulsion of killing
militants
[Music]
okay let me bring in my colleague $2
tacos joining me for more on this story
Shuja now Omar Abdullah once again
stirring a pot because a lot of people
already would be labeling him
anti-national
yes that's that's right uncle in fact
this is a you know all debate that it
does trigger itself every now and then
in Kashmir Valley and it's not the first
time that such a comment has been made
from particularly from you know
political leaders in the valley earlier
as well we've heard such you know
comments from leaders like Omar Abdullah
suggesting that real celebration would
be where you know when there is nobody
you know who loses his life from either
from the militant side or from the
security forces side so basically trying
to pour you know point out towards the
protocell resolution stand so to speak
that they've been making but whether
this will go down well with a lot of
people outside Valley is something that
we'll have to really wait and see like
you were mentioning there definitely
would be voices on social media and
otherwise who would be already labeling
Omar Abdullah as anti-national but the
point that he has made is something that
we haven't heard for the first time it
is something that a lot of people have
been debating in the valley Shuja but
you know what is this compulsion because
we just heard a few days back even
Mehbooba Mufti was saying something to
the effect that terrorists should not be
killed in encounter so and so forth is
there a are these political compulsions
as well yes there is certain merit in
bottomer up the lie saying that killing
on either side killing can't be
celebrated but the fact remains which
are that those who have taken or picked
up the gun against the state there has
to be repercussions for that
well okay you know as far as your only
question is concerned yeah Edie the fact
that Kashmir or J&K as a state is headed
towards you know elections both for the
assembly as well as the Lok Sabha in
couple of months from now that is one of
the factors because of which we can see
that most of these leaders are coming
out and openly speaking about these
issues which are quote-unquote termed as
populist as far as the quality of the
state of Jammu and Kashmir is concerned
but it also remains the fact that there
is a huge constituency you know which
does believe in these factors that
killing should stop both from the
militant side as well as from the
security forces side so one can really
you know understand where these leaders
are also coming from they are basically
addressing their own core constituency
in their areas either you know baby it
may baba Mukhtiar Omar Abdullah they
know that this is what is going to sort
of appeal to their people in terms of
their voters vote base and that's why
perhaps they're making these noises at
this point in time thank you so much for

India has the world's second largest
standing army but paying salaries and
pensions takes away 87% of the defense
budget leaving just about 13 percent for
buying new weapons and equipment the

radical new plan and India today's
Sunday Pune turn gets you details of
that plan

long line of control and 110 kilometers
long actual ground position line at the

forever in operations this apart from
counter-terror operations and disaster
relief effort
but with 87% of the Army's 1.2 lakh
crore budget going to pay salaries and
pensions and a mere 13 percent left for
capital acquisition
general Pepin Robert chief of the Army
Staff has come up with a radical plan to
cut the flap and fight the Battle of the
Bulge India today has exclusive access
to his game plan the aim is to do away
with existing bulky divisions their aim
is to form lean integrated battle groups
reduce the number of officers posted in
Army Headquarters pull out serving
officers from non-critical appointments
there's a high trust on information
warfare the army chief has also proposed
increasing the number of two-star
generals of major generals and making
the post of a brigadier non-selection
grade the major generals will be
commanding the integrated battle groups
deployed closer to borders the army
Chiefs aim is to reduce the number of
soldiers by 50,000 to 100,000 reduce the
size of the army in the next two to five
years the annual estimated savings would
be between 5,000 to 7,000 crore rupees
instead of just talk the BGP should
actually walk the talk
and influencing interim budgets they
should provide all necessary expenditure
to the Armed Forces
the reorganization hopes to reshape the
army to fight under two overhangs
nuclear and budgetary both the potential
adversities Pakistan and China and
nuclear-armed the structural reform in
the Army are to fight a war at a short
notice
the current reorganization aims to
operationalize the Army's Polestar
doctrine that came into effect after the
attack on the Indian Parliament and
operation para chram the ambitious
project also has in the pipeline the
plan to reduce the number of army
commands facing China from the present
for to the proposed - army chief General
Bipin Robert has set into motion a
dramatic plan to restructure and
reorganize the Indian Army it hopes to
transform the world's second largest
army with over 1.2 million soldiers into
a lean mean fighting machine for India
today this is sandy Pune turn in Delhi
ambitious but will it work let's get
down to brass tacks joining me on the
broadcast live in general sanjay
Kulkarni former director general
infantry the man who planted the
tricolour on Sachin glacier on besakih
in 1984 sir welcome on the show also
with me is lesson shell Vinod party a
former director-general of military
operations our Special Forces veteran
sir happy holiday and welcome on the
show my first question is to India today
the executive editor Sandeep Unnithan
Sandeep the current situation looks
rather alarming there is little money
for a big wishlist of attack helicopters
to utility helicopters to assault rifles
tanks and missiles how great is the
situation today something well Gaurav
it's really grim because as somebody in
the army told me that Panisse are super
Chara every budget the the gap between
the revenue and the capital just keeps
on increasing and they are actually
projecting a situation when you will
have
over 90% of the Army's budget being
devoted to revenue and just 10% for
capital and I'll tell you what the
problem here really is it's there is a
fundamental difference in the way the
army looks at the defense budget from
the government's view of the defense
budget the Army says that you're
spending only a little over 2% of the
GDP on defense you need to spend more
than that the government says we are
actually spending over 4% on of the GDP
on defense because they're including the
pensions as well and pensions Gaurav is
a very very big concern for the
government because as you know India
spends double the Pakistan defense
budget only on pensions so there is a
real need to cut down on a manpower okay
will the integrated battlegroup concept
work that when you're facing either
China or Pakistan in different
battlefields you have a small integrated
team it has its own times its artillery
its infantry its armored personnel
carriers and infantry going in together
you know what happens with this
integrated battle groups basically that
terrain specific and since that terrain
specific positively I would look at it
that they would you know otherwise an
infantry division yes it's time-tested
there is no denying the fact and it has
been a success till date but there is no
harm in trying
integrated battle groups which are
terrain specifics because this would
ultimately lead not just to economizing
on the troops on the ground but also
ensure that the two front which is
almost a reality we can be catered for
I'm saying the number of divisions that
we have having integrated battle groups
would shoot up to almost hundred forty
number and that's quite a large number
and all being you know officered by a
major general
yes helps definitely helps oh definitely
more experience and and there is less
affect integrated battle group gen
Bhatia the chief is working on a plan to
reduce manpower fifty thousand to one
lakh reduction perhaps in the next two
to three two to five years this will
save 5 to 7 crore south thousand crore
rupees but don't we need
man part for a strike core in the
Northeast definitely what will you need
know what's happening is that you know
the army has to present relevant future
ready it is not that yes we do up
reading job will future and you also and
in that we have to ensure combat
effectiveness we have to ensure a viable
for prevention strategy of war waging
strategy and of war fighting strategy
okay now we have to understand the the
certain of negligence suboptimal an army
you know these are old organizations and
these these need to be you know
restructured and that is what it exactly
happening and we are we are actually
when you know like the integrated battle
but we go to carry the battle in the war
waging scenario into enemy territory
okay into adversary's territory that is
that is the main thing the proactive
strategy so how does that work so you
have been in agile you know mission
mission oriented teams the battle groups
and they are the ones who'll carry the
battle every show into the adversities
territory echo that is what is exactly
going to happen and let me also just put
a little bit you know it is sound person
is about PN pensions it isn't person is
revenue yes absolutely
the running cost the operational cost
the day-to-day cost the Army's
functioning every day yeah we have
deployed on three four hundred
kilometers in the China border the the
line of control a GPL the Northeast
Agency is the cash means will sing so it
is entertaining so it's all encompassing
it is not just the PN analysis
absolutely Army's also just I take
another second 56% of the defense by it
only on yes 57 defense budget only
paying for 1.2 million people of our
soldiers the rest point 2 million are
being that you know 2 lakh plus our Air
Force and Navy yes and there's six point
one file that civil is also being paid
from it yeah so just to just target the
army will not do so the purpose fara
deuces you know I take a holistic look
under a movie to go down is what we
actually the supposes operations there
also
fair enough Salib is there a larger
national objective is there a national
security strategy given out by the
government because without that this is
just an internal exercise of the army
well exactly Gaurav you hit the nail on
the head
a national security strategy is being
prepared as we understand by the NSA
Ajit Doval that is due sometime this
year and it's that's going to be one of
the last acts of this government which
is to give us a proper national security
doctrine which has never been done in
the last 60 or 70 years and the only
thing that we have is the RMS
operational directives we are given down
to the Armed Forces and the sad part is
that those directives most of it are
actually written by the Armed Forces
themselves so you really don't have the
kind of political oversight that you
have what is our national security
strategy what is the aim are we a
million strong army to protect every
hill along the border with China or
Pakistan or are we to protect euro
strategic points and that if required
going to that territory and then if
there is a negotiation bata see what
happens is the future wars are not
necessarily going to be conventional
Wars it's a hybrid war psychological war
you know cyber war and therefore any
strategy which has credible deterrence
if you are fighting a two-front war
it needs a credible deterrence against
say one adversary and a punitive
deterrence against the other in versa
yes even if he can maintain that and in
the integrity of our borders I think
that should be adequate we mean I don't
think at any point of time get
interested in taking anybody else's
territory
fair as long as we can get a war and as
long as you can deter anyone from having
an evil eye on us I think that should be
fair enough geli Bhatia the aim is to
get maximum bang for the existing buck
in the current scenario so even China is
reducing its manpower I mean they've
already said that they've come down from
three rat troops to do you know they
want to come down reduce it by another
one 100,000 troops it's from 300,000 to
100,000 is that is that doable for us to
reduce by another 100,000 yeah I would
like to put a finger to it but yes there
is there are some opportunity like I
said and we have to understand that it
is not the army alone which is going to
fight the wars water go to fort
it's you know all of our Union approach
it's a nation's go to war
not neither our forces go to war so
there's no effect which can you know if
you go for joint warfare you know joint
training joint intelligence joint
structures you'll be saving a lot of
manpower out there also there is there's
a lot of little man pops gonna save from
other organizations which are there
within the army and within a module also
so aim is to reduce you know to get the
best and how do you get the best don't
you're sixty eight percent of her
equipment is of the same offices so when
you're old equipment you're any cost
multiplied so we know it's the chicken
the sandy isn't this just a drop in the
ocean 5,000 to 7,000 crore rupees aren't
more drastic measures required there was
some talk of a proposal to auction off
some containment lander and use those
funds of for modernization well
Gorem again you know you hit the nail on
the head I must say the fact is that it
is a drop in the ocean because when you
look at the whole defense budget if the
government says the defense budget is
four lakh crore let's have a debate on
the entire defense budget let's not only
confine it to the Armed Forces or only
the Indian Army for instance let's look
at the whole defense budget in its
entirety is the nation getting the bang
for its buck for its defense but are we
getting enough for four lakh crores are
the services fully equipped are the DRDO
labs producing equipment on time there
needs to be a big national security
debate on if we are getting the bang for
our 4 lakh row that we are spending okay
one of the top five spending defense
economies in the world
I mean and yet clearly not in the big
league we are not in the league of the
five super powers you know so we got to
have a serious debate on this coming to
the other point of defense land now I
think there needs to me a relook at the
way defense land is being held we've
seen scandals that have taken place in
the last in the near future in the
recent past of the other scam for
instance a lot of the defense land that
is held by the defense
stays of the defense ministry that needs
a serious looking into and if there is
surplus land then I don't see the harm
in jail everybody holds seventeen lat
acres of land can some of that land
being identified and auctioned off and
that money be used perhaps to buy
helicopters and rifles and be PJs or go
and pay for salaries and pensions you
know this would be seen as a knee-jerk
reaction disposing of even today we
would not be having adequate land the
way we are looking at it you see the
field firing ranges you see these short
ranges there aren't any the weapons have
to be fine you have to have training
areas now you find that defense land
though it might look to be a very big
number seventeen lakh acres of land
being occupied but the kind of army we
are where a 1.2 million army you will
reduce or likely become 1.1 million army
it would require training areas it
required areas to live there a kind of a
combination that we are giving to our
men we aren't giving full accommodation
to everybody it's just that the people
who joined the army are from villages
and therefore they would right now
prefer to keep their families in the
village but with the kind of
urbanization that is taking place they
would much like their families to be
brought in stable no but can't
condolence be relocated for example that
land be auctioned off or if there are
massive golf courses can that land be
auctioned off and that money be used for
you know jelmer TI be utilized for
modernization you have to understand
that this is not you know we can't this
is it the containment with the
mobilization plans you know on the one
hand you have a proactive strategy you
know what happened in Cockrum we took
too long
there was attack on the Parliament we
took just too long to get our act going
okay we can't do it a second time we
have to start right from the beginning
and everything is enmeshed it isn't it
is weeded into your plans and it into
your plans you just can't say okay this
controller not required that don't look
at the land look at the whole thing and
is that the only way that the money has
to come no there are many other ways
like I said you know let the let the let
the three armies the Army Navy and the
Air Force let the authority and the
accountability align today it's not in
light the authorities of the service
chiefs the the
accountability okay I thought is not
with them the thought is the minister
defense so there's a mismatch out there
I cannot spend the money have one two
fifty nine thousand crores plus nearly
16 crores is going to the 41 ordnance
factories and the DPS use though the
posture is ready for the you know we can
get the same thing at a much less
competitive cost okay know for example
you know I I'm coming on this issue of
land for example the army itself wants
to close military firms military firms
will being done so that land can be
auctioned often that money can be used
to buy bulletproof jackets or
helicopters let me let me know this
pertinent correct perspective okay we
have the atom installations today only
33 percent of the men have the cognition
authorized
what are we only 50 percent is there so
it is not that the the lands are there
the land is required today if you look
look at it as per the authorization as
well what is given the army is itself
holding over 20 thrown equals less okay
so this military farmland is being you
know is being utilized for purposes like
administration's never come up or
ammunition Depot's have to come up you
know our demolition to pose wherever
your author is 5,000 let's add tons you
holding 15,000 tons and that is how we
you know our ambition goes off because
not for example I'm just talking about
generating funds spectrum army has a
large spectrum can surplus spectrum be
auctioned off and that money be used for
defense modernization
yeah again depends upon the aspects
whether they should be you know if it's
100 percent safe and if we so feel that
in future at least for the next 20 to 30
years this spectrum is not going to be
used by all means thought could be given
but a knee-jerk that you sell up the
spectrum and then we looking for another
maybe just after five years when they
incorporate the cyber warfare the
spacewalkers all starts playing up then
he said oh who we did a you know did a
mistake by surrendering a part of the
spectrum for commercial purposes
and ended up doing nothing in fact even
now there was some kind of a thing with
the MTNL
and what has happened they said they
would do this and so many things not
many things came up on the ground even
though other trade they was there so I'd
go
I would recommend that anything should
be done with the aim to get money for
tomorrow for something to be done today
and then suffer in the long run of that
yeah I still you know whatever funds you
get Ford said what the spectrum was
given last time we want NFS that is a
network for spectrum yes that's about
ten thousand crores only where the
spectral spectrum many many and lack
roads so it goes to the front of India
doesn't come to the army alone no best
thing if that is feasible
you see those funds of those lakhs of
crores can use the nation and modernize
the nations of competing priorities what
we need to do is whatever the budget is
there which the nation we have for we've
got to use it optimally that is not
happening okay suddenly younger profile
for commanders is a good idea
what about Jevons Jevons who retire with
just 17 years of color service so they
join at the age of 20 may retire at the
age of 37 what does this reorganization
have for them well this is one of the
biggest problems that's faced our
planners for several decades now the
fact that you have 80 percent of the
army retiring every year in the age
group of 30 to 35 and they have to be
paid pensions for the rest of their
lives so that is a huge huge burden I
mean this is no telling on the service
the the absolutely stellar service that
they render for the 15 and 17 years that
they are in service but the army is now
looking at ways that they can be brought
back into the system
and one of the thinking processes are I
am given to understand is to re-employ
soldiers who are retiring at 35 into the
army into jobs that are presently done
by defense civilians for instance okay
so to replace the existing defensive
limbs or retiring with soldiers who have
kind of retired Jenny that's possible
see what happens is keeping the
longevity in mind today better
healthcare I think yes there would be
definitely a large number who would be
wanting to stay on but they will still
be a sizable number who would want to
leave so I I would in my view feel an
option be given
yes it's extendable that means he is not
denied his pension it it is 70 meals
today
you could make it to 19 years no
problems at all but making it compulsory
beyond that there are certain places
where say any 20 man
for example maybe I could be employed
elsewhere like defense security code for
now or elsewhere in the army yeah
definitely we have trained manpower you
know world over you won't retain quality
manpower trained manpower and out here
we are sending him at the peak of his
you know training and is the we spend
your money on him so we need to retain
will longer whether in the in the
frontline jobs or the support job what
we have obtained him you know we have
retained along them there's no doubt
about it
fair enough fair enough so that is all I
have time for in this debate and this is
that India today edition this is Gerald
Bipin Roberts radical plan to reorganize
the army is that leave is there a
timeline by when will this be
implemented and there is a pilot project
that's currently underway yes god of
there is a there are these tool studies
are to IVs IB G's are gonna be set up
under the Western Command and they're
gonna be tested or from the field in
2019 okay and so hopefully before
general robert retires at the end of
this year we will see how this ib g
concept of his plays out in the field
okay this is the cold start doctrine
that had been talked about after
operation ferrochrome after the attack
on the Indian Parliament and now it's
being implemented on ground we will
continue to report on the story very
closely to all my guests many thanks for
joining me that is all I have time for

beats Australia in the 2nd ODI at
Adelaide Oval but verochka Lee's
fantastic done in fact now India has
enabled the series 1-1 my colleague
Radhika is here in the studio the
article finally something for the Indian
cricket fans to it all in fact smile
about on kids
you seem ecstatic and so is the entire
Indian cricket fraternity the fans as
well it was important for India to win
this match like you said they were
trailing ones now and 1 nil in the
series and with this magnificent chase
they were chasing 299 runs which is the
second-highest chase ever at the
Adelaide Oval so it was not an easy task
for India but the way all the batsman
contributed of course Marat Kohli was
simply brilliant
he's brilliant when it comes to chases
this was his 24th Iran when it comes to
chasing he has got an average of 16
one-day internationals now because of
this turn
he's got 64 international tonnes which
is the third highest in the history of
cricket so there were numerous records
that would of course created as India
went down to achieving this total but
what we have to mention is that after we
are cool he got out there were still
runs to be God and it is MS Dhoni got a
50 yet again he's taking 50 of the
series this one fortunately ending in a
win for India with me in the studio is
Nikhil Chopra very happy as well which
India's will Nikhil come we wouldn't say
to the comfortable chase but the way
India paced if you had partnerships
right from the top and then the rascally
with that brilliant hundreds amazonian
Karthik finishing it off so that's what
India needed they needed the middle
order to deliver and that that's true
but once again chasing down say 299 you
had one of the top three get 200 and
once again it was that man who likes a
chase you know we're not call it getting
to another 100 fantastic but to meet the
hero the guy who sealed it off so for
medicine
gets a 50 but 25 or 14 just goes to show
for Dinesh Karthik once again he's
soaked up the entire pressure it's the
pressure of - Indonesian wealth late the
boundaries get the ball in the gaps ran
hard twos and threes I think to meet the
niche Karthik is also the unsung hero of
a game because everybody would be
talking about my missing Dhoni as well
as Barrett Kali hawk only once again
setting up that chest outstandingly when
I thought you know in a middle mind you
see Tony was a little slow when you
needed about eight eight and a half and
over there's too much pressure zone you
know gradually but at least you know
batted right through the end saw the
game hope that is the most important
thing and once again Dinesh Karthik
incredible we're talking about which
you're talking about those twos and
threes that's what was really brilliant
are that's what we did not see when
ambassador who was batting but my inner
Singh Dhoni even though we saw him
clearly in pain the heat getting to him
probably the cramps but there he was
running three runs we're probably one
wouldn't have gotten it so that was
important in this inning as opposed to
watch Joanie did in the last time he
didn't really rotate the strike today
after initially taking time to settle
down he was taking those twos and threes
he was fighting to rotate that's right
except that kind of experience he knows
what he needs to be doing out there in
the middle when you're especially
chasing especially when you've got a set
batsman getting out in 100 then the
responsibilities on you and the man who
walks in and I think the race Karthik
batted and complimented - Singh Dhoni
fantastically well - Ingo need because
he has been playing awfully I think is a
little rusty but the good thing is the
two back-to-back 50s that you talk about
he's getting into the groove because
every single game that you play from
here on in come the summer you're
getting close to the World Cup you know
I think what 11 games a 12 games left
prior to the World Cup starting so you
know hopefully he goes on in place and
in the middle you know before the IPL as
well rather guy he's got to play some
domestic games because at the end of the
day you will perform as you prepare you
need to be out there getting runs and
playing your shots when you start
playing your shots out there in the
middle is where it gives you that
confluence that a player needs he trusts
himself he backs his ability
somebody's got 10,000 done he knows
everything what needs to be done so that
he could be successful he just dissed
Walter and do it we can of course do
knees not somebody who really listens to
all the criticism that comes his way
doesn't take pressure but this not the
fact that he was able to take India home
it was not just the fifty that resulted
in a losing cost will that take some
pressure off my Indra Singh Dhoni as
well and the niche Karthik too because
there were talks of getting K dadada
into the eleven fourteen of the match so
little bit pressure getting off both of
these player

HTezH832ruc,Mallikarjun Kharge Writes To PM Modi Over CBI&#39;s Alok Verma Removal,"Senior Congress leader and member of the Select Committee that voted to remove CBI Director Alok Verma, #MallikarjunKharge, ...",2019-01-15T09:48:09Z,India Today,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HTezH832ruc/hqdefault.jpg,"welcome back breaking news coming in
Congress leader Mallikarjun cartier has
written to the prime minister over CBI
chief a local mass removal as the chief
of the investigating agency in fact
Mallikarjuna carga in his letter has
asked the prime minister to bring the
CVC report retired justice a caper
tonight's report minutes of the
selection commission meeting that took
place on the 10th of January 2018 in
public domain all right so he wants the
minutes of that meeting to be put out in
public domain coming from more and less
committee just why is it that the leader
of the Opposition is now seeking for the
the disclosure of the meeting and what
exactly happened in that meeting in fact
even was the dissenting voice there
amongst the three well remember even the
government is flying to does this entire
controversy of not just a fall but also
a low Karma this is an opportune time
for the Congress party especially as
leader of opposition
Mallikarjun kargh aid writing that sort
of letter to make public betrayers of
conscience the CVC but also about how
justice a keypad Mac had shown that
evasions this also talks about putting
in public domain the minutes of the
meeting of 10 January so very clearly
ahead of 2019 elections this is not just
about a public perception this is also
talking about transparency in a certain
way trying to put the government on a
back foot of song but again remember as
far as whether jpc is concerned whether
it is about a lukewarm is concerned the
government has so far only had so far
diverted back only in terms of politics
but again this is about putting pressure
and especially with reports coming in
about how justice decree was given an
offer to work in London just ahead of
the decision-making on a low forma all
these particular domains just to say
Kasich revos vote did help decide CBI
chief aliquot Maas removal from the top
post and then him turning down the post
retirement offer that was given to him
to the government
is there a connect between the two the
opposition realizing that this perhaps
is an opportunity to reveal more about
what transpired in that meeting
well sources are clearly pointing out
that the two don't have anything to put
together because remember this is adding
up to things you know putting two and
two together
it's saying to say that a decree would
have been a part of this particular
meeting was to actually priam the entire
thing because the ala formal decision
was taken way back in January and again
then he was the one who was nominated by
the Chief Justice took very clearly at
this point of time those are the reasons
which are being put behind but so far as
opposition is concerned and particularly
Congress party is concerned they want to
put the government on the back foot on
the mat they say this is obviously
something which has this been have been
days of concern whether sikri was
offered this particular post in in terms
of seeking favor but remember so many
things have not been said as they have
been implied at this point of time so
very clearly a matter of that battle of
perception also and the Congress wants
to put the government on the map
all right comes if we leave it at that
thanks so much for joining us
and in some more breaking news coming in
India today has accessed a letter that
was written in the year 2009 by the
extradited Oberst a middle man Christian
Michelle to another augusta middle men
good yo hashkee now this letter that has
been accessed by India trade mission
mentions Michelle was allegedly
receiving information about the working
of investigative agencies besides what
else was going on in the then government
that was under the former Prime Minister
Dr Manmohan Singh so this is the letter
that has been accessed for India today
that once again establishes the connect
on the relationship between Christian
Michele and guru hash k.michelle is one
of the three middlemen who's presently
being probed in the case besides good
your hash key and Carlo DeRosa by the
IDI and the CBI Manish Pandey in fact
joins us so Mohnish tell us a little bit
more of about this letter that has been
accessed by you tell us what really does
Christian Michele right to good your
hash ke and what does he talk about the
information that he knows about the
investigating agencies in the UPA regime
don't think I remember earlier we had
accessed one letter of Christian
Michelle which was written by him to the
gusta Western CEO in that letter
Avantika he spoke about the CCS and the
Prime Minister office defense minister
defense ministry so he was aware of all
the details of what is happening in the
ministries and now this letter is very
important because he is talking about
the investigative agencies now
particularly is talking about Gotham
Catan Hill who is one of the co accused
in the entire Agusta Westland case this
letter was written on December 9 to the
other Gustavus Glen middleman that is
hashkee and in this letter he's talking
about one case in which m bar is mr is
being investigated and also he goes on
to say that he is he knows that when the
agency is going to read so this is very
important because this is going and this
is very crucial for the investigative
agencies because till now they were
aware that he was having someone who he
claimed in the letter that party elites
they are the one who are giving him the
information but now he was getting
information of the investigator agencies

investigative agencies also yes being
investigated by the same agency that is
Enforcement Directorate yes absolutely

Court in fact has referred to India
today's special report on mahalia's
rathole mining Supreme Court citing
India today's report say illegal mining
rampant Supreme Court has now directed
the state government to file an
affidavit on whether verification is
going on to stop illegal mining across
the state or not this is the big impact
on the story that we had showcased on
our Channel India today exposing the
dark side of rathole mining in Meghalaya
and the Supreme Court taking cognizance
of that report in that report one can
see how the miners struggles in very
dangerous circumstances and how really
they have to get into mahalia's killer
mines as the Mafia rules outside and the
Supreme Court mentioning the report same
day in fact day after day they watch
that report and has now directed mahalia
to file an affidavit and to also explain
on whether verification is going on as
to whether illegal mining has been
stopped across the state or not this is
a big impact of our story that we
showcased on India today
Anisha in fact joins us for more outside
the Supreme Court
Anisha just yesterday in fact we had
exposed that story we had exposed how
miners in dangerous circumstances put
their own lives to risk while the mine
mafia rules outside so just give us a
sense of what exactly did the supreme
court mention and the directive that has
now sent out to make alia on the basis
of the India Today report well I wonder
it's a second part of yesterday's report
that has carried the court had said that
it was a shocking report that they saw
on television like despite the fact that
there has been a ban on mining coal by
private companies for several years now
yeah coal mining illegal mining is still
going on in the country in in mahalo
states of Supreme Court bench has
severely exact same Akali government
asking just what exactly is going on in
the state wise in the state able to stop
the cyclical mining and whether there is
any
at all going on now McAuliffe in
response to support has said that over
400 fi all have been registered since
2015 but interesting be an argument that
has been they fire them a holler
governmental that's because we still
take the licenses for mining are given
by the center the state has the state
cannot implement the mining ban
effectively because there isn't the
estate they're not entirely aware of how
many licenses have been given and not
and because of this multiplicity of
authority the state government is having
problems are implementing the band over
taking arguments are being raised if I
am is that it is a difficult terrain it
is a hilly area to the tribal area under
it's because of the mountains and the
difficult terrain right monitoring of
Mines
it's difficult should have been raised
but the co2 level the third is matters
on the 19th of that we leave it at that

Ram Janmabhoomi
case in the Supreme Court today this
after constitutional lawyer Rajeev
Dhawan stood up and questioned judge
you--you'll a lit for having represented
former UPA chief minister and BJP leader
Kalyan Singh in a highly tangential
contempt of court matter now the
question is this is there a group or
Lobby that somehow wants to derail and
delay the Ram Janmabhoomi case find some
protects some reason to ensure that we
go from one tonic to another and that
there is no hearing because remember you
had Raji that one stand up and say you
know you've been a lawyer for Kalyan
Singh but it doesn't matter you can
continue a judge like you you love it's
highly respected used to be a very
seasoned lawyer before he's obviously
not going to accept it he was upset he
recused himself and what we have at the
end of the day is just one more date in
the Supreme Court at the end of the
month here's the story the much-awaited
start to the IOT on land title suturing
was delayed yet again the de formant of
the hearing was caused by justice you
ululate opting out of the five-judge
bench this was after the counsel for the
Muslim petitioners raised the issue of
the judge appearing in a related case in
1994 as a lawyer for former U P Chief
Minister Kalyan Singh the court is now
going to take up the matter on the 29th
of January when it may lay down the
timeline for the hearing
the delay in hearing of the case drew
sharp criticism and protests from the
groups fighting for the construction of
the ROM mumble we're standing outside
the Supreme Court right now and you can
see the commotion which you started over
you're because there are several
activists who have come over you're
demanding that their armed temple and
the idea matter be heard as soon as
possible but you can see that the
thoughts are in fact I'll ask my camera
person Pradeep to in fact follow me and
just show you the pictures over here you
can see that all of them are being taken
away by the cops because they've tried
to stop the traffic over here some even
accuse a country's top coat of purposely
delaying the hearing they relate this
matter with the elections they want to
decide the particular number of judges
which will hear the matter they want to
decide which judges should hear the
matter and definitely they don't wat
ready for hearing this matter and
precisely that's what happened in the
code when he pointed out to justice
Lilith that you have appeared in the
matter it was just a mere pointing out
but it has lot of message involved in it
how many say both pasty I am past lunch

[Applause]
our opposition lawyers guilty of
deliberately trying to delay and derail
the Supreme Court hearings in the Ram
Janmabhoomi case and is this being done
to ensure that the Ram Janmabhoomi case
is not heard before the general
elections is the anger of Hindu bodies
like the Vishwa Hindu Parishad justified
joining us on the newsroom showdown I
want to introduce first national
spokesperson of the Bharatiya janta
party dr. Sampath Patra joining us also
on this broadcast member of the All
India Muslim Personal Law Board man with
Parata squaring off against him
representing the Hindu Mahasabha
Vishnu Jain and Goran Kant is an
advocate I want to go across two men
with paratha first because you know
today we had Rajiv divan argue that
judge you you Lillet had to recuse
himself because of which this matter
will now be heard at the end of January
we're already seeing anxiety frustration
heartbreak build amongst the pundits the
seers and all those who want the Ram
temple the fact is that you you Lilith
appeared as an advocate in a contempt
case against Kalyan Singh that's the
basis which was cited to have today's
hearing adjourned to have a new bench
set up this just seems like delaying
tactics that this whole gang whether
it's a Kapil Sibal or Rajiv Dhawan
they've all decided that find some
protects some reason is called electric
guitar equatorial that's the game mr.
Rajeev Dhawan today to be fair to him
otherwise I am NOT a big fan of his he
said and it is his duty as a lawyer to
point out to a judge that there exists a
condition which might if brought to the
notice of the judge he might recuse
himself so that was his duty as a senior
lawyer to point and point this out to
the Honorable Judge and he said that
despite this fact I have and my clients
have full faith in you you can still
continue so if he did not say that you
recuse yourself so it was the decision
of the Honorable Judge that he took this
decision and in his own wisdom now the
second thing is that do take a was not
for a hearing in any case there was to
be a daily fix for the first you can
no question our RSS once again you used
to be one of our most lawyers before you
became judge a judge of the Supreme
Court whose record is sterling now you
cast a doubt in a case as important as
the Ram Janmabhoomi case which is being
looked at across the country the next
five just is the four next chief
justices oh yeah would you raise that
question you've planted the seed of
doubt this is delaying tactics no no no
no no no I am Telling You this was a
practice to save a future delay this was
definitely otherwise so this is the
situation see the how do you have to
understand one thing the basic
contention of the basically what once
again some big paths somebody father I
come back to you Parata the basic topic
of your debate is whether there is a
delay tactics which is going on on the
court of law
let me tell you there two sides one side
it wants delivery delivery of the
verdict and the quickest possible time
and there's other side which wants delay
and derailment of the verdict we have
seen too many coincidences I would say
too many instances to say that they're
just coincidences number one we had seen
Kapil Sibal
going to the court and saying that my
lord it should be heard only after 2019
we had seen OSE demanding the same 2019
we had seen today as to how raju the one
with all due respect to the senior
lawyer the one who had in fact given up
his gown suddenly wearing the ground for
this case and going to the court and
planting a seed of suspicion
well it's when you have five lot so he
do you find Parata the explanation
satisfactory at all that he say he cast
aspersion planted the doubt but said a
poet EK no problem is really Ravel if
you don't have any doubt if you don't
have any suspicions you don't mention it
that you have made a mention of it and
remember one of the most important cases
of this country it means that
I mean do damned if you do damned if you
if you have no doubt why casting
aspersion by mentioning if it's not an
issue let it be you planted a doubt sir
now don't be naive because pick no
tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow some press
press report would have come middle in
the middle of the hearings so let's say
halfway in the in the hearing of press
reports come let let justice you Lilith
was a lawyer then it would have been he
would have recused himself then what is
a better situation today when the
hearing was only for fixing of future
date for actually hearing or in the
middle so so it was a call which was to
be taken by Justice usually it is a
better thing because the Babri Masjid
site want this hearing to be heard to be
finished as soon as possible because we
have a open-and-shut case why would we
want to delay and mr. Kapil Sibal was
not kept as a lawyer after 2017 he's
forgetting this and he was appearing for
Geneva port which is a organisation
which was which is formed by Yogi's
appearing as a lawyer let some big
pastor account to you I come back this
is absurd when mr. Pratt's agos I had to
say that mr. Kapil Sibal was a
representative of mr. yogi Adityanath
and it cannot get more absurd secondly
an extremely importantly only a few days
ago five I mean three days ago when this
judge I'm the bench was formed remember
mr. Jelani Jeff area of Jelani coming
out and saying that it Robin better if a
Muslim would have been appointed to the
bench that a Muslim is not there it's
not fair and then today we have mr.
Rajeev Dhawan coming up and casting
aspersions and then mr. Proctor saying
that when it was just a doubt we had
nothing to worry about it supposedly in
the future remember mr. Rahul that in
the past few months few I would say year
or so we had seen the way these
so-called lobbyists are handling the
issue of Supreme Court we have seen the
judge lower case the case went to the
extent where there was an impeachment
case against the Chief Justice of India
we have seen
says after cases as to how as Persians
have been cast on the Supreme Court and
on this extremely sensitive issue the
aspersion that was cast today in fact is
again delayed and that's why I say what
the Prime Minister Minister Narendra
Modi had said that well he just said
Congress I would say Congress and its
bodies which are constantly trying to
derail this extremely important case is
telling let's hear from Goran con
mammoth Parata argues that it's better
that this matter was raised today that
you you lalita's recused himself later
Press reports would have come after
multiple hearings if you--you'll alittle
recuse himself then it would have
delayed the matter as delay Oh gotcha
well I'm so surprised to hear a
statement like this bye mr. Piazza to
the extent that mr. Lovett was not even
involved in this particular matter
even if he was appearing for any of the
parties he was appearing for Kalyan
Singh in a different not connected to
this particular litigation so it was a
contempt proceeding in which he was
appearing it had nothing to do with this
and he would have actually recused
himself he was well aware to cast her
aspiration like that put a seed of doubt
in the judges mind you actually don't
want the judge to hear this matter and
that's exactly what mr. Darwin had done
so it is not just an innocent thing
which he had pointed to the court he had
actually made the judge uncomfortable
and that's exactly what he had done any
sensitive judge on this judge like mr.
yollop would have recused himself and
that's exactly what mr. Dewan wanted and
this is a delay tactics and nothing else
and they have succeeded in that they
have succeeded in pushing it from today
to 29th no judge from the minority
community no Muslim judge even though I
believe judges have no religion but it's
being pointed out that usually in a bad
bench of this nature when a important
matter pertaining to religion is being
hurt there's a religious dispute there
is generally a judge from a minority
community that's not that you know is it
even fair furniture to raise this
question these are five of the top
judges of the supreme code all of whom I
either sitting chief justices or will be
chief justices in the line of succession
why look at that
I even point this out that's not fair
All India Muslim Personal Law Board also
has condemned this statement of as a
Vista Safari our Jelani that he has cast
it aspersions so don't blame on India
Muslim personal abode for this there are
some individuals who like mr. Salman
Navi who have got dubious characters who
create a situation to weaken Babri
Masjid case as I am saying Bob Remus it
case anybody who's for Barberie massive
case will want this hearing to be heard
on a priority basis day to day basis and
they let this matter be over because we
have an open-shut case Bob Remus is was
there for everyone in the world to see
so we have known world no interest in in
corresponding it is only RSS and BJP who
want this matter to be postponed but
they want to place the blame on on the
Barbary masses side and for that they
use certain people who are are making
certain series you are using the free of
judge the charge gets up Safari of
Jelani Safari Abdullah II will be
horrified many years this some big
Petronas respond this is the usual way
of functioning of I think you have to
say him he wouldn't be thank you see
Rahul as far as who's whose agent I am
not the one to decide that but let me
tell you he said that the All India
Muslim Personal Law Board wants a quick
hearing on it but I run it it was
oversee who is also a member a very
important member of All India Muslim
Personal Law about who went to the
public saying that it should be her
after 2019 he says that Jafar you have
Jelani who who wanted one of the judges
to be a Muslim judge he is also an RSS
agent
let this show be watched by Jafar yup
Jelani he will decide for himself
thirdly an extremely importantly
something is extremely wrong in this mr.
Geelani says that in this five-judge
bench you have to have a Muslim and at
one go they say that this is not a case
of hasta this is not a case of faith
this is just a title case if this is
just a title case as per your own
submission and what the Supreme Court
has said why should the supreme could
have a Muslim judge because in a matter
of land dispute in a matter of title
dispute this is not an issue of faith
according to that is this not viable
Vishnu
Jane from the Hindu Mahasabha for Safari
of Jelani to say
there should be one Muslim judge that
basically means you're looking at a
judge by the religion he practices I
want to the kind of judgments he gives
terribly unfair see the standards which
we have adopted because our case is very
good on merits and we don't go by
whatever the religion of the judges we
go by our case we go by our minutes and
we warned the matter to be heard and
argued as soon as possible but mr. Raju
Dominus Timon again pointed out to the
chief justice's Deepak we should also
that you will not be able to decide this
case within your tenure and he went on
saying that if you go and decide this
case I'll I read the evidence for eight
months so and they also they also
threatened a quote to walk out from the
court
so if these kind of tactics the Muslim
parties are adopting how this case will
be solved if the furry of Jelani is
asking the wrong question Suez Vedanti C
Rahul I firmly believe that no one in
India should cast aspersion on the judge
mr. Pratt sir can you please allow you
condemned by dancing I condemn everyone
who casts aspersions on the judges of
India no one should do that this is a
finest Court of India India you spoke
okay this is the exact tactics that
they're following in the Ram Mandir case
also I object to everyone and anyone who
speaks against the judges of the Supreme
Court but having said that there is a
difference what you do in the street
what you speak outside of the court and
what you do to delay the court case is
something totally different
eminent lawyers and eminent
personalities standing within the
precincts of the court raising voice
against this case being heard early
that's a separate issue secondly an
extremely importantly what I mean to
suggest over here is I mean we have seen
constantly the Congress party
vying a way sighing away from these
debates because a spokespersons also
don't participate this kind of teasing
mentality tarek about our Vandal Qatari
pethau but forming following a totally
different tactics inside the code either
through your own Kapil Sibal or through
people who support you is something
which the country is watching and
thirdly an extremely importantly well
yes patience is important we should all
be patient but then this is a democratic
country people will ask as to why not
acquit here okay see the point is that
you can say the right thing but when
you're in court all you have to do is
like one matchstick that's all it takes
bonk on to delay 29th of January you can
keep sing over Abu rakia this thing and
button just say one thing which will
push it to mid-february from infinity to
which much well enough about you in the
middle of election season and nothing
else you have cast an aspiration on a
very honest judge would be a you know
future Chief Justice of this country and
to say that he's in anyway he can't be
impartial or you know you can't have
somebody like him hearing this matter is
nothing else but delaying it I mean it
is absolutely this kind of practice
should be condemned
we should not encourage this kind of
practice at all and then to go back and
say that you know we were just trying to
point it out and make the judge are
there that he was he's not involved in
this particular matter
this was for Kalyan Singh in some
remotely connected matter not in this
particular suit this particular suit
only deals with the title of this ROM
genom Bhoomi so where's the question of
mr. Lalit appearing in any of these
matters so what mr. Prosser is saying is
absolutely wrong to that extent that
nowhere he has actually pointed out it
is just you're making the judge
uncomfortable and you don't want him to
hear the petition and that is the reason
why he has recused himself because
tomorrow he doesn't want any kind of
mudslinging on him and you have been
successful in getting a delayed no it's
very nice as we say the end and I think
you should have faith in there should be
Sheree and in the Supreme Court it
doesn't matter who is here in this
petition that an attempt is being made
to delay and derail on some pretext to
the other I'm sure there'll be some new
gimmick some stunt that's pulled on the
29th of January so that there is another
hearing and in the fact is you know you
can call the protests outside the
Supreme Court orchestrated in stage but
there is restlessness people want
there's a big argument there's a big
boom happening there's going to be a
Dunham's answer at the end of the month
there is pressure and anxiety that's
building that's a reality people people
aren't saying judge it this way or that
way at least there may be proper hearing
they let it not in a case where there is
so much focus and so much scrutiny
let it not get derailed in this fashion
and
Raaj even if it's not an issue why did
you raise if you can't say oh it's not
an issue but I just wanna tell you that
you appeared for Kalyan Singh back and
no judge is gonna accept that recusing
himself is only most likely once you've
done that some bit petrm a moot Parata

introspection Varma has also said that
he was only serving a CBI director till
the 31st of Jan and now that he's no
longer the CBI boss he has crossed the
age for DG Fire Service civil defense

joins us with a copy of that letter and
what exactly is it today the decision
today will not just be deflection on my

this is a very hard thing Latin America

inquiry committee following which the
quantum of punishment will be decided
the committee will have a time period of
15 days to decide on the punishment
which will be in line with the BCCI
Constitution and players contracts Rahul
Dravid joins us for more on this Rahul
so hardik Pandya and KL Rahul now facing
the heat of the BCCI but what is the
latest that you are hearing will they be
called back and when will this happen
well that's right in fact Dynegy who is
the member of committee of
administrators which was appointed by
the Supreme Court
she has recommended that the players
should be called back immediately from
the tour of Australia and the team
management will soon be informed about
the decision and the both of them will
be put under provisional suspension and
you know the BCCI secretary has also
endorsed dinah idol jeeeze decision the
the the treasurer on a route audrey has
also seconded that decision and in fact
yesterday we know there are the chairman
of the committee of administrators had
recommended a two-match suspension
following which Dynegy had suggested
that there is a larger picture to it in
fact a lot of issues need to be
addressed because the they were openly
going around Europe KL Rahul was
discussing that how he missed out how he
was partying a night before the before
before an important match in Florida
last year where he scored a century and
then the remarks the sexist remarks the
racist remarks that hardik Pandya made
during that during the talk show so
obviously BCCI is very unhappy and both
the players as of now it seems will be
called back they are definitely not
playing the match tomorrow because
virata's also in his pre match
press conference has said that you know
he has also discussed that hardik monday
if he's not there
Jadeja is a very good option as an
all-rounder to replace hardik Pandya so
obviously nobody neither the BCCI nor
the tea management is happy with what
with the comments with the remarks that
these two players have made during that
talk show now tell me something in your
experience is this an unprecedented move
are you seeing of more you know
sensitive and cautious BCCI acting on
the kind of complaints and criticism
that has come for hardik Pandya for
those remarks that he made on the talk
show now remember even the BCCI
or was in the midst of the meto movement
they were serious acquisitions against
the CEO so are you seeing a change in
the BCCI as well as far as this
particular incident is concerned
well event occur you know people who've
been following cricket they would know
in fact you know these type of things
have we keep hearing these kind of
things but never ever has somebody
openly you know come out or admitted you
know and that too in a manner in which
your hardik Pandya did during that talk
show that what they have been doing how
they've been mishandling how they've
been going around and you know but the
way they he has said and made these
sexist remarks in fact you know when he
says that i come from that i like i
belong to that black culture and you
know talking about cheerleaders a lot of
these things have definitely not gone
down well you know but there are a few
issues we recently had the issue of
Mohammed chamois who in fact from a tour
abroad he did not come back to India he
went to Dubai
following which there was an inquiry
made so obviously there are issues as
far as the anti-corruption unit is
concerned because these if you can't
keep a track of the players during a
tour tour the BCCI says that there they
come they become vulnerable to bookies
they become vulnerable to honey traps
and these are the kind of issues that
the BCCI wants to address because
there's a larger picture to it that they
want to address and that is the reason
why these are too much suspension you
know
you may not see a very huge ban on these
players because they've already gone
through a lot of humiliation with with
the kind of you know uproar there is
yang the social media but yes you may
not see a huge band but definitely there
is a larger picture to it which needs to
be addressed by the BCCI through the
legal opinion all right stay on with me
Rahul Nikhil Chopra former cricketer
also joins us
Nikhil so this is the big news coming in
the CEO is recommending immediate
suspension both the players facing the
heat of the BCCI your thoughts on the
entire episode and and you know the
proactiveness that has been shown by the
cricketing body towards the kind of
criticism that has come in for these two
players remember little happy to say
that you know being so proactive looking
at the sport as a gentleman's sport like
you all know it is yes I mean it's a
little surprising for Gill and as well
as hardik Pandya to come up with the
skaters that they did in that chat show
they had I thought that you know that
you'll become a public figure you got to
be very careful what you speak on these
public forums because in your role model
while youngsters following you know it's
all very nice to hear okay you know but
at the end of the day look ambassadors
of the game your ambassadors of the
country one is representing the Indian
cricket team right so that you know this
is the kind of upbringing that Indian I
know that you know with these sort of
characters that is not that you won't
paint the guys at the same sort of brush
but write anything you gotta be a little
more responsible in the statements you
go out in the public forums because you
want to inspire the young kids every
statement that comes out as an
international athlete you know and you
made a name for yourselves you should be
thankful to God that's true every
statement has got to be like an
inspiring statement again I think
looking at that whole Cacho I hadn't
watched that show but after all this
happened I said watch that so I was a
little shocked here the kind of state
driven by both of them know it was I was
indeed very shocking and nostalgia
to hear him and his loose remarks but
tell me something now we we've already
heard from Virat Kohli he's distanced
himself from those controversial
comments he's saying that they do not
reflect the team in any way but if at
all the ban is executed against both of
them what kind of an impact would it
have ahead of India playing those three
one dares against Australia to be honest
nothing on the side because you know the
way we played cricket in the recent past
is been phenomenal
I think you guys winning at a CDS down
under most certainly has been Thunder
Down Under from the Indian side to the
Australian you know this is a team that
has never you know been able to do it in
the past for any Indian side but without
Kohli and the rest of the guys to go out
there and energy beating Australia in
their own backyard has been phenomenal
and looking at kill rouse form to be
honest the one thing you know the first
three games he's played he hasn't done
much he was asked to sit out the last
game and Harvick you know he's been out
of injury so the team's been doing well
without these two guys okay it's not
like they're much better than there are
cool yoga rest of the team is going to
miss them big time I think even god
forbid Ivanka to lose the series but
this is the right sort of example that
Indian cricket board it's true that
certain things it's got to be higher
than just about winning or losing
absolutely Nikhil thanks for joining us
and always a pleasure to speak to you
hardik Pandya facing a minimum to match
banned for making those derogatory
comments on TV show current coffee with
current in fact the all-rounder was
issued a show-cause notice by the
committee of administrators and now the
Cricket Board wants a severe punishment
against him coa in fact has already
recommended a two-match ban however the
board is still of the opinion that both
Harvick and KL Rahul should be suspended
with immediate effect shifting focus now
to some other news the Delhi High Court
will shortly pronounce verdict on pleas
of CBS special director Rakesh Astana
and the others were seeking the quashing
of the fil that was filed against them
on bribery allegations on the 20th of
December the court reserved its order on
petitions filed by Astana and CBI Deputy
Superintendent of Police Devendra Kumar
Astana is accused of receiving kickbacks
and extort
money from Heidelberg based businessman
Satish Babu sana who was being
investigated in the Moines quraishi
corruption case Qureshi is an accused in
multiple graft cases Rakesh Astana has
also filed a petition against the
transfer orders given by former CBI
director a low parma who has been
shunted out by the high powered
committee in view of the recent
developments that mr. Varma himself has
been removed on the grounds of integrity
by the high powered committee it is
obvious that the fire which was lodged
was not for Bona finding reasons but was
with some ulterior motives
I hope mr. Stanner will get his relief
today let's go straight across not to
Manisha for more details and updates and
so much has happened Manisha Alok
Varma's no longer the CBI director in
fact he's been shunted down and
interestingly the CVC in its probe
report has said that they found no merit
in the allegations of corruption leveled
against Astana it is going to be very
crucial for Rocky's asana because now I
know for my is no more CBI director and
technically Rockefeller is the second
most linear official in the Bureau of
Investigation is still this special
director with who is on cold leave by
the government and this meeting is going
to be very important because once the
Empire is paused then there is no
official complaint or probe against Anna
also in the CVC
the allegations the commendation to
initiated criminal investigation is
against a local ma but not in Caracas
Anna so all the eyes are on the High
Court today and the judgments and the
order is expected very shortly that all
right information will come back to you
then for now thanks so much for joining
us
and just today after he was shunted out
as the CBI director by the high-powered
selection committee Alok Varma has hit
back he claims he has been transferred
on false unsubstantiated and frivolous
allegations made by a person who was
hostile to him he's making a reference
there to Rakesh astana Varma also said
that he tried to uphold the integrity of
the CBI while attempts were being made
to destroy the high-powered committee
consisting the Prime Minister Narendra
Modi just as Sikh reported in favour of
a local mass removal while Leader of
Opposition Mallikarjun carga opposed it
submitting a dissenting note what
actually went wrong against Alabama was
the CVC report in which the Cabinet
Secretary had recommended his immediate
removal the report also mentions the
allegation against allah varma of taking
a 2 crore bribe from sati sana in the
Moyne Qureshi case a local ma has now
been posted as director-general fire and
services for the remaining period of his
present term meanwhile M Nageshwar Rao
has assumed the charge of office of CBI
director former attorney general Mukul
Rohan he in fact has reacted and slammed
the SAC CBI chief saying that his
comments are not in good taste listenin
two of them have taken a call after
seeing the papers that is the CBC report
it's not fair for Varma to say that the
decision is you know bad or malavida etc
as far as mr. kargh is concerned I don't
know what decision why he has taken that
decision but the fact of the matter is
this a multi-member body is three people
so the decision is twist to one that's
all the Congress meanwhile is crying
conspiracy Rahul Gandhi even attacked
the Prime Minister with a recent sacking
of CBI chief alo Padma saying fear
gripped the Prime Minister and therefore
he cannot sleep Rahul Gandhi also put
out the tweet that you're seeing on your
screens he says and I quote sacking the
CBI chief Alok were not twice in a row
clearly shows that he is now prisoner of
his own lies the Congress party gave the
file twist to elope Armas austere
questioning the working mechanism of the
CBC and alleging it might be working at
the behest of the prime minister's
office in fact the Congress has said
Herman was shunted out because the Prime
Minister is too afraid of an independent
probe why he's Rahul Gandhi lying
how many times will he lie I think he's
lying and his entire if you if you add
up the number of lies that Rahul Gandhi
has spoken in the last three months I
think that would be the total number of
lies given by any Congress leader in the
last 17 years
Rahul cannot conduct his politics on
lies we will expose him daily on a
continuous basis we have reached a sad
state where our investigating agencies
are being controlled whether it's the
niña or the CBI or the IDI or the income
tax authorities are being controlled and
directed in order to attack particular
people who want to act independently and
also directed it at at our opposition
leaders this is most astonishing and
condemnable within 48 hours of his
reinstatement by the Supreme Court the
primary at prime minister's instance
this committee that is there to appoint
the CBI director overriding a dissent
and not giving a chance to mr. Alok
Obama to come and defend himself over
what the CBC said this action clearly
shows that they this Modi government
wants to control the CBI as a pliant
tool to advance its political and
electoral interests it has placed CPI in
a unprecedented crisis on the
credibility the integrity of CBI was
very much affected and shattered and I
do not know how the country is going to
restore the integrity the credibility of
CBI in some other news ahead of the big
national elections a new South block is
in the making vice our Congress party
chief Jo Mohan Reddy dropped a big
ahead of the looks of up polls he is

the prime minister from somebody who's

worth appreciable to our 25 MPs if 17
