Edition
we got you ground reports from London on
the coronation of King Charles which
took place on the 6th of May
we told you all about the preparations
the sentiment on the ground
the anti-monarchy protests the not my
king movement also the questions that
have been raised over spending Millions
on a ceremony at a time when the UK have
been dealing with a cost of living
crisis
and just as a coronation fever starts to
feed King Charles III faces fresh
challenges
remember he is not just Britain's King
he is also the monarch of 14
Commonwealth realms
but many of them are no longer under the
spell of monarchy
Queen Elizabeth's days were different
you see but now King Charles is on the
throne and some countries are crying not
my king
and which countries are these
to begin with there is Saint Vincent and
the Grenadines prime minister Ralph
Gonzalez wants to see his country dump
the monarchy
but it's not clear if his Republican
views are popular among his people in
2009 in fact a majority of the
population voted in favor of the Royals
they wanted to keep Queen Elizabeth at
the as the head of their state
but then again this is the queen that we
are talking about and it was about 14
years ago
King Charles does not enjoy the same
support
and Gonzalez is seeking an apology from
the Monarch for his family's past
injustices
and the prime minister of Saint Kitts
and Nevis Terence Drew also echoed a
similar opinion his country will also be
debating about becoming a republic
the premier claims Saint Kitts and Nevis
cannot be totally free Until It Breaks
its links with the British Monarchy
you see in 1623 Saint Kitts became the
first successful English colony in the
Caribbean
neighboring Nevis also met the same fate
this was in 1628
sugar cultivation was established on
both islands and they were called the
Mother Colony of the West Indies
the English enslaved people of Saint
Kitts and Nevis to work on sugar
plantations
the country got rid of Buddhist rule in
1983 but it remained part of the
Commonwealth's and retained the British
monarch as the head of state
and on the eve of the coronation
Jamaica and Belize also announced
similar intentions in fact the Belizean
Premier Johnny brazeno said that it was
quite likely that his country would be
the next Commonwealth country to become
a republic
as britons were reveling in the
coronation festivities
there was absolutely no excitement in
the air in Belize
the very same day Jamaica announced that
it was time to say goodbye to the
monarchy and the country plans to hold a
referendum on changes to its
Constitution
the government stressed that time had
come for the country's future to be in
Jamaican hands
and it's not just the Caribbean by the
way other commonwealth countries have
expressed similar views as well
look at this Lord Ashcroft Paul it shows
what the country is actually think of
the monarchy many want to remove the
king as the head of state and become a
republic
and the sentiment is most pronounced in
the Solomon Islands as 59 of the people
want to dump the monarchy
and then there is the Bahamas
with 51 percent
Jamaica 49 Canada and Antigua and
Barbuda at 47 Papua New Guinea and Saint
Kitts and Nevis at 45 percent Belize at
43 percent and Australia and Granada
with 42 percent of the people wanting to
severitize with the monarchy
you see King Charles now has the crown
but he also has the sovereign's orb
skepta and coronation drink but clearly
he does not have the same hold over the
Commonwealth or even the UK
the celebrations have now subsided and
he now faces the harsh realities
will King Charles be able to boost the
popularity of the monarchy or will it
sink to its demise

and it's not an ordinary one
former Pakistan prime minister Imran
Khan has been arrested in islamabads
it's been an eventful day in Pakistan
and like most things to do with this
leader the arrest as well came with a
lot of drama
if party leader is called the arrest an
abduction and demonstrations have
started across Pakistan

we get you a gravitas Special Report
we also get to the story of an 11 year
old who has higher IQ than Albert
Einstein
[Music]
story tonight is from Pakistan at around
3 10 p.m this afternoon in a dramatic
development to say the least Pakistan
police arrested Imran Khan Pakistan's
former prime minister the cricket
Superstar
he was picked up from the Islamabad High
Court where he had gone to file a bail
application in seven cases
and the arrest seemed like a scene
straight out of a movie
have a look at these images these are
Pakistani Rangers taking a stand Imran
Khan into custody it looked more like a
Gangland abduction than a political
arrest
dozens of them dressed in combat gear
from head to toe could be seen
forcefully whisking away the leader to a
police van it was truly for the lack of
a better word a spectacle
so where exactly have they taken Imran
Khan
no one knows and that is the first big
question why keep Imran Khan hidden
if the sahibash Sharif government which
ordered the arrest
Running Scared of public Outreach
what we do know is that he is under the
custody of the NAB that's the national
accountability Bureau of Pakistan
next question what are the charges
against him
at present Imran Khan is facing over 140
cases 140 cases
they range from terrorism to blasphemy
to murder to incitement of violence but
this arrest is in connection with
alleged corruption in a story that
involves his wife it's about the
al-qadir university trust case
now for the unworths the al-Qaeda trust
was started by Imran Khan his wife
Bushra Bibi and his close aide Baba
and this is a distrust was set up to
impart quality education in the jhelam
district of Punjab province distrust is
facing an inquiry for a property
settlement which allegedly caused a loss
of 190 million British pounds that's 68
that's uh the amount that's been
reported in fact Imran Khan and his wife
have been accused of siphoning away this
money
money that was apparently sent by
Britain's National Crime agency and
that's not all Imran Khan has also been
accused of misusing his position as
prime minister to get 458 canals of land
allotted in this trust name
and this inquiry has been on for quite
some time and it has now led to Imran
Khan's arrest
a development that has led to massive
uproar across the country
PTI leaders and supporters have flooded
Twitter with posts condemning the arrest
on your screen now is a statement by
George rifavato said he has in fact
called the arrest quote-unquote
kidnapping he says that scores of
lawyers were tortured in the process
which may be an exaggeration but it
certainly is true that the police will
not disclose the location where Imran
Khan is being kept
the PTI leader Faisal Javed Khan has
called the arrest illegal he asked the
human rights bodies to question the
arrest and the Pakistani Judiciary to
intervene and hold the Sharif government
accountable you have to listen to this
former Prime is from Pakistan national
hero of Pakistan Imran Khan has been
arrested illegally from within the
premises of the Court exactly when he
was appearing before the judge for his
appeared this is unacceptable this
should be unacceptable to the courts as
well with demand from the Judiciary to
intervene and take action against those
who arrested him people of Pakistan have
rejected this illegal arrest it is not
acceptable to them is the rule of jungle
in this country we must raise our voice
we must stand with the fundamental human
rights of the people and Judiciary must
intervene it is also contempt of the
Court when they arrested him there was
no case against him and he was appearing
for his bill before the judge and
exactly before that they arrested him so
we demand from the Judiciary to take
action against those who arrested him
and also we demand from the human rights
organization all across the world to
raise their voice
so essentially the PTI leaders are
issuing statements and the ptis
supporters have taken to the streets
this is what Pakistan has been looking
like through the day look at these
images they are from Lahore and this
evening a sea of protesters gathered at
the city's Liberty chalk
demonstrating against the arrest of
Imran Khan
and in another set of images coming in
from Lahore the protesters can be seen
storming the home of a core Commander
they also apparently gathered outside
the Army and hold Stones before breaking
into the premises
and we wonder how the Army will react to
this direct attack on its officials and
institutions
and there were similar protests in
Karachi
PTI supporter staged a protest March
which was disrupted by the synth police
and the visuals we have been getting in
show the police officials firing tear
gas on the protesters as the media
Personnel around them could be seen
running for cover
[Applause]
and these by the way were just two
cities
last we checked demonstrations erupted
in peshavar as well also karak Multan
also quetta protesters in all these
parts are calling upon the Judiciary to
save their quote-unquote hero
and punish the government
so has the Judiciary responded is the
immediate question well it has
the Chief Justice of the Islamabad high
court in fact who is believed to be
pro-imran Khan has ordered the interior
Ministry secretary and the Islamabad
police chief to appear in court
according to a report in the Pakistan
daily Dawn and the Chief Justice said
that he was showing restraint for now
but he would summoned the Pakistani
prime minister if the Islamabad police
chief did not appear before the court
and again lastly check the Prime
Minister Shahbaz Sharif was not visible
in public
where exactly is he
he is busy though sending Tweets from
islamabads have a look at this one for
example
he posted this one immediately after
Imran Khan's arrest
accusing him of maligning Pakistani
institutions and the country's
intelligence agencies and Leadership
let me just quote
I have no doubt that White Lies
misrepresentations statements and
vicious attacks on institutions are the
introduction of your politics your
attitude is like bending the Judiciary
to your whims
and saying law does not apply to me
it should be clear that as a former
prime minister facing the ongoing
corruption trial you want the legal and
political system to be disrupted
in your knowledge Pakistan has become a
jungle so I would advise you not to stay
here because the facts are often bitter
and destructive
so Imran Khan is behind bars and Imran
Khan's supporters are out on the streets
government leaders are celebrating
online
some of the both senior judges are
warning the government
and the prime minister is busy sending
out tweets this is what Pakistan looks
like as of now but what happens next
where are things headed from here
onwards
well it's tough to say as of now like I
said there are a total of 140 cases
against Imran Khan
and now that he has been arrested
expect the legal process to begin in
many cases
for months Imran Khan has been delaying
the judicial process
through what can only be called
non-cooperation by refusing to accept
the summons all in the hope that he
could drag the process till the time of
the next general election which he of
course expects to win
in Pakistan winners don't face charges
but see since he is in opposition expect
more charges to be framed against him
and I say that because Pakistan has a
long history that proves that age-old
saying uneasy lies the head which wears
the crown
it is a history of cools
of throwing past premieres and
presidents into isolated prisons
or if they are lucky into exile
was hanged to death in what was called a
Judicial murder
and today his grandson bilaval Bhutto is
among those who have ordered Imran
Khan's arrest Ann Abraham Khan has
joined this honors role in a murky
pseudo-democracy
you see politics is never a friendly
match anywhere
and in Pakistan particularly it is a
deadly game
and to discuss this and more joining us
on the broadcast this minute is our
Pakistan bureau chief anas Malik anas
tell us more about the situation on the
ground and is this now becoming Imran
Khan versus the army in addition to what
has been Imran Khan versus Sharif
foreign
if you look at it uh from the time he
was ousted he had always made this fight
about his battle with the establishment
uh and with the powerful country's
establishment so largely speaking to
answer the first part of your question
Molly yes it looks like that this is
Imran Khan versus the powerful
establishment where uh he and his
supporters have gone Rogue uh they there
have been admissions made on the record
by the prime by the former Army Chief uh
and uh
that how they had nurtured project Imran
Khan and now how he has gotten Rogue and
out of control uh so largely speaking
this looks like a continuation uh of
that uh day before yesterday remember
Imran Khan had issued a statement uh
that had targeted senior intelligence
officials naming them and this morning
he alluded that the entire institution
was behind what he says or believe
believes was a conspiracy to have him
killed not once but twice yesterday we
saw a hard-hitting statement coming in
from the Pakistani military's PR wing
sing and clarifying that these
allegations hold no truth and today he
was arrested in a very frivolous case if
one were to put it that ways because he
was already at the Islamabad high court
and Imran Khan saw this coming uh it
won't be wrong to say the situation
right now it remains Grim as I talked to
you just a short while back before we
went on air we heard that uh that uh
mobile networks across the country were
put out uh and uh there are blanket
instructions to put out Facebook Twitter
and YouTube these three social
networking websites are now not
accessible in Pakistan without a virtual
private Network or VPN as we said
additionally uh mobile data is not
working since the day throughout the day
we've seen that mobile data has not been
working and uh there have been protests
widespread some turning Violet as well
most of them around Cantonment areas in
Lahore in Karachi in Peshawar in quetta
in Multan in Festival the festival
protest has turned violent the
government says that it would not be
allowing anyone to take the Law and
Order situation to their hands but the
bigger question Molly is that where is
the government the prime minister up
until this afternoon he was in London
having a breakfast who is in charge that
is the question and that question nobody
has an answer to Molly
well a number of unanswered questions at
this point but we are leaving it there
for the moment on us we're going to let
you go thanks very much for now and for
those quick updates
shifting Focus for now to Russia
this morning it celebrated its 78th
Victory Day
a day that marks the Soviet Union's
victory over Nazi Germany
and for the Russians it was on this day
the 9th of May that Nazi Germany
surrendered in the Second World War
then Soviet leader Joseph Stalin
declared a holiday for the day a Victory
Parade was held on Red Square featuring
German insignia
and since then the 9th of May has been
celebrated as Victory Day by consecutive
Russian leaders
and form Vladimir Putin this day has
become a muscular display of not only
military prowess but also of Russia's
latest Weaponry including warplanes
tanks and nuclear-capable ballistic
missiles
especially now when Russia is at war
with Ukraine
so the Russian president wasted no
effort in turning this day into a
spectacle he made sure that the parade
although a bit scaled down due to
security concerns looked like an
exhibition of patriotism
according to reports more than 10 000
people and won 25 units of various types
of weapons and equipment were displayed
at this Year's parade
and this included armored vehicles but
the main focus was the country's s-400
air defense system and its
intercontinental ballistic system
if we speak of the attendees now despite
the decline in Russia's Global standing
since the war started Putin was
surrounded by at least six four Soviet
leaders during the parade and this
included the president of Kazakhstan
the tajik president
he was big leader
kyrgyzstan's president
also the Armenian prime minister
also the belarussian president of course
and in the presence of these leaders
Vladimir Putin gave a combative
10-minute long speech
what did he say
well he attacked Western countries of
course he claimed that Russia's future
depends on this war he said that Western
globalist Elites quote unquote were
sowing the seeds of russophobia and
aggressive nationalism while the
Ukrainian people who had become hostages
to a state coup quote unquote
and also to the Ambitions of the West
here are a few excerpts from that
address
civilization is once again at a crucial
Turning Point a real war has once again
been Unleashed against our homeland but
we have fought back against
International terrorism we will also
protect the people of the donbass and
ensure our security
absolutely
the Western globalist Elites however
still preach about their exceptionalism
they are pitting people against each
other and dividing Society provoking
bloody conflicts and coups sowing hatred
Russia phobia aggressive nationalism
destroying the traditional family values
that make people people is
unbounded Ambitions arrogance and
permissiveness inevitably lead to
tragedy this is precisely the reason for
the catastrophe that the Ukrainian
people are currently experiencing they
have become hostages of a coup data and
the criminal regime of the western
Masters who took hold in its place a
bargaining chip in the execution of
their cruel self-serving plans
and shortly before that speech Russia
reigned missiles down on Ukraine as if
to send out a message to the country's
leadership once again a total of 60
drones were fired most of them were of
Iranian origin
and they struck cities all over Ukraine
Reports say it was one of the biggest
volleys of missiles and drones yet
the destruction too was unprecedented to
say the least
have a look at these images they are
from Odessa and they show firefighters
tackling a huge blaze in what was said
to be a Food Warehouse
Odessa officials reported three people
wounded and one person missing
[Music]
have a look at these images now they
show the scale of Destruction in the
Eastern Ukrainian city of bakmut
and the video shows damaged buildings
and heavy plumes of smoke rising over
the city immediately after the strikes
unfolded
[Music]
and in Kiev it was the same situation
scores of people were injured when drone
wreckage fell over the city and this
particular video shows a high-rise
residential apartment building with a
gazing hold
overall the strikes hit a total of 127
targets they killed a total of four
people and injured dozens of others and
this was by far one of the biggest
Russian offensives in recent months
an offensive that coincided with
Russia's Victory Day celebrations
and through these strikes Russia has
made one thing absolutely clear
that no matter what the Western press
says about the gains and the losses in
this war Moscow is in it for the Long
Haul
and our next story is about the India
asean drills
India and the asean countries conducted
week-long Maritime drills nine ships six
aircraft more than eighteen hundred
Personnel were involved
and on the very last day the naval ships
were in Vietnamese exclusive economic
zone
that is when a flotilla of Chinese
vessels tried to stalk them
at least five Chinese boats followed by
an additional Chinese research vessel
were originally headed Southeast
but they took an unusual 90 degree turn
and started moving Southwest
and this course LED them directly
towards the India asean Maritime
exercises
let me tell you these were no ordinary
boats
they belong to a Chinese militia Fleet
and such militias usually usually
consist of commercial fishing boats they
may seem harmless on the face but in
truths they work in coordination with
the Chinese authorities
and why is that
for spying and for stalking
and they are known to sabotage Maritime
drills in the South China Sea
the Chinese boats crossed India asean
warships without any Face-Off but they
did interrupt the exercises
the pattern was broken some vessels had
to change their directions
at one point the Chinese research vessel
came as close as 16 kilometers to the
participating Vietnamese warship
and why is that
was Beijing using the militia to
intimidate the asean countries and did
it intend to disrupt the naval exercise
after all China has always been
possessive about the South China Sea it
has claimed majority of the sea as its
own
and it's extremely sensitive to other
military presence
and this of course was not the first
time Chinese vessels did something like
this only two weeks ago a Chinese Coast
Guard ship almost collided with a
Philippine petrol vessel
and this happened in the disputed second
Thomas Scholl the Beijing Coast Guard
sent a number of radio warnings asking
the Filipino ship to leave
and after a rather heated exchange it
came as close as 36 to 46 meters to the
Filipino ship which stirred just in time
to avoid the disaster
and this came at a time when the
Philippines was conducted conducting
military exercises with the United
States
and before this a huge Chinese Navy ship
shadowed two Philippine petrol vessels
the incident happened in the dead of
night the Filipino ships cruised near
subi
for those aren't worst subi is a Barren
Reef that China has transformed into a
missile protected Island base the
Chinese Navy ship radioed the Philippine
vessels to immediately leave and keep
out the ships steamed away
but only after asserting Philippine
Sovereign rights to the area
you see such skirmishes keep happening
in the South China Sea and why not it is
after all one of the world's busiest
shipping routes almost one third of
global Maritime crude oil trade passes
through it
and the Sea remains hotly contested
China being the most aggressive claimant
of course
the country in fact has been trying very
hard to expand its influence it has
deployed military increased Naval
presence established administrative
units in the disputed areas even
conducted after even constructed
artificial Islands constructed
artificial islands and these islands are
equipped with runways and ports among
other facilities
I already told you about soupy
other than that
there are fiery cross Reef Mischief
Island
and quarteranchi reef
in fact China is growing increasingly
intolerant of other countries military
presence in the South China Sea to the
point that it is intimidating the
warships and trying to sabotage Maritime
drills
our next story is on the
israel-palestine tensions
Tel Aviv has confirmed that Israel has
launched a major offensive against the
militants in the Gaza Strip at least 13
people have lost their lives including
three commanders of the Palestinian
Islamic Jihad
and the Islamic Jihad has vowed Revenge
Reports say Gaza will respond with
rocket fire
where are things headed and will this
result in more flare-ups between the two
sides our next report getting you all

Ellie Cohen Israel's foreign affairs

we got you ground reports from London on
the coronation of King Charles which
took place on the 6th of May
we told you all about the preparations
the sentiment on the ground
the anti-monarchy protests the not my

challenges
remember he is not just Britain's King
he is also the monarch of 14.
Commonwealth realms
but many of them are no longer under the

Queen Elizabeth's days were different
you see but now King Charles is on the

way other commonwealth countries have
expressed similar views as well
look at this Lord Ashcroft poll it shows
what the country is actually think of
the monarchy many want to remove the
king as the head of state and become a

and the sentiment is most pronounced in
the Solomon Islands as 59 of the people
want to dump the monarchy
and then there is the Bahamas

Jamaica 49 Canada and Antigua and
Barbuda at 47 Papua New Guinea and Saint

with 42 percent of the people wanting to
severitize with the monarchy
you see King Charles now has the crown
but he also has the sovereigns orb
skepta and coronation ring but clearly
he does not have the same hold over the
Commonwealth or even the UK
the celebrations have now subsided and
he now faces the harsh realities
will King Charles be able to boost the
popularity of the monarchy or will it
sink to its demise
only time will tell
do you remember Captain America
the Marvel hero who defied mortality
woke up after 70 years and survived
being frozen all that while
what if I told you that this could
happen in real life as well
and that Peter Thiel the co-founder of
PayPal has signed up for something
similar
what is this all about and why would he
do that
our next report telling you
is it possible to defy mortality the
fact that we are going to die one day
the fact that our life comes with an
expiry date only makes us human but what
if there was a way to defy death what if
what worked for Captain America could
work for us in real life
this method is called cryogenic
preservation what exactly does it mean
what does it have to do with PayPal
co-founder Peter Thiel cryogenic
freezing is a process which is performed
on dead humans
for this process to be performed an
individual needs to sign up for it in
advance it is a type of low temperature
freezing carried out by a medical team
that stores the organic remains of the
body using ice water
the dead body is then oxygenated using
masks and is put on a machine similar to
a hard lung bypass this is done to
circulate blood and maintain oxygen a
solution is pumped into the dead body
which essentially works like an
antifreeze this is done to stop body
tissues from turning into ice crystals
so that there is minimum structural
damage
the body is then placed in a liquid
nitrogen chamber at a temperature as low
as -320 degrees Fahrenheit once it is
cold enough the body is transferred to a
thermos-like tank
filled with liquid nitrogen where it'll
stay for the foreseeable future what
happens next these bodies wait in these
tanks until medical technology is able
to revive them among those who have
signed up for this process is
billionaire Peter Thiel the co-founder
of PayPal Thiel has agreed to be
cryogenically preserved when he dies
when asked about the same he responded
saying
yes but I think of it more as an
ideological statement I don't
necessarily expect it to work but I
think it's the sort of thing we're
supposed to try to do this technology
costs roughly around twenty eight
thousand dollars per person but after
spending such a hefty amount why is
Peter Thiel skeptical about its success
the thing about this technology is that
it is still a work in progress there are
three major challenges that it faces one
it needs to repair the Damage Done by
freezing two there is an additional
burden to cure whatever ailment
originally killed the subject and three
it will have to reverse the aging
process so that the subject has a young
healthy body difficult isn't it Thiel is
not the only one to be betting big on
life extending Technologies
Sam Altman the CEO of open AI recently
invested 180 million dollars in a
project that aims to extend the human
lifespan by 10 years with rapid
advancements in AI the threat of AI
taking over the human race is also
advancing with more and more people
signing up for technologies that aim to
expand our lifespan will the human dream
to be immortal become a reality view
report we on world is one
our next story is about the perseverance
of an 11 year old girl
a girl who was diagnosed with autism at
the age of three
she had a difficult childhood
she got bullied felt excluded
but she never gave up
and today this very girl has an IQ more
than that of Albert Einstein and Stephen
Hawking
you heard that right
meet Adara Perez Sanchez
who is Making Waves globally with her
exceptional intelligence
adara's IQ that is intelligence quotient
was measured at an astonishing 162.
and why do I call it astonishing
that is because Albert Einstein and
Stephen Hawking had an IQ score of 160.
which made both these scientists near
Genesis
but what makes a Dara story unique is
not her IQ only Perhaps it is her
perseverance her ability to Fight
Against All Odds in life and come out
stronger
adhara has not had an easy childhood
she grew up in a low-income neighborhood
when she was three she was diagnosed
with autism
a developmental disability caused by
differences in the brain
and with this of course came numerous
challenges particularly at school
she was also bullied by her classmates
she had difficulty in socializing
and as a result of this
she started to isolate herself
but when people around her were doubting
her adara's mother noticed something
very different
it was her love for mathematics
mathematics was special she self-taught
herself algebra memorized the periodic
table and this made her mother enroll
her in a special school a school for
gifted children
and what happened next is creating a lot
of Buzz around the world atara's IQ was
tested at this school and the score
measured 162.
from a very young age Atara developed a
passion for space exploration it all
started when she saw Stephen Hawking's
artwork
and any guesses where she saw it
it was at her doctor's office
and since then there was no turning back
for her
Atara decided to explore the red planet
it became her Inseparable dream and at
the age of five just five years old she
finished Elementary School and at six
she was done with high school
imagine
when most kids are still clearing their
grade 1 exams athara was already a high
school pass out
in fact it doesn't stop here this young
girl is set to receive a master's degree
in engineering
she already holds a bachelor's degree in
systems engineering and is currently
pursuing a master's program in
mathematics
this very girl who was once bullied
because she was differently abled
she has not only confined herself to her
education she actively is involved in
promoting maps and science among girls
her age and to serve this purpose she is
working with the Mexican space agency
not just that she wants to colonize Mars
as well
in a recent interview she said I want to
go to space and colonize Mars if you
don't like where you are Imagine where
you want to be I see myself at NASA
so it's worth a try
and as I speak Adara is working on
finishing her g-tips and if she passes
these tests will open up the doors of
NASA for her
will then join NASA as a young scientist
and become the first autistic person to
fly
can you guess her age by then
she will be only 17 years old just 17.
from specially challenged to specially
gifted
Atara story is perhaps a reminder on how
setbacks can be turned into comebacks

is that Jiu Jitsu demands can melt away
all your other worries it allows a

many people particularly those living

this is arguably Europe's largest

I am convinced that 3D printing has a

not believe that in the future
everything will be built with 3D

Joe Biden and the Republican lawmakers
be able to break the deadlock they're
scheduled to meet on Tuesday led by
Speaker Kevin McCarthy but an immediate
solution looks extremely unlikely at the
moment the Democrats want to deal
without any conditions on the other hand
the Republicans passed a bill with deep
spending cuts and if a deal is not
reached the U.S May default on its debt
a default is likely to push the U.S
economy into a deep recession
its congress's job to do this if they
fail to do it we will have an economic
and financial catastrophe that will be
of our own making and there is no action
that President Biden and the U.S
treasury can take to prevent that
catastrophe
the previous standoff on the debt limit
came in late 2021 am at the covid-19
pandemic the debt ceiling was raised by
2.5 trillion dollars that was a one-time
fast try process to increase the debt
ceiling with a simple majority vote of
51. generally 60 votes are needed to
move most legislation through the Senate
Biden's predecessor Donald Trump did not
raise the debt limit a month before the
deadline in 2019 he suspended them for
two years Trump also suspended the debt
limit in 2017 and 2018. as per some
estimates the U.S national debt spiked

continuous stream of text while they are
listening to a story or imagining
telling a story we're not talking about

comparing it to an atom bomb Buffett is
wary of something that has multiple
capabilities and he believes that it
cannot be uncreated once invented
drawing parallels to the creation of the
atom bomb during World War II
and it is not the first time Buffett has
rejected technology he's also bearish on
cryptocurrencies and called it a
non-productive asset class
his defensive stance on technology has
been called out by his peers Elon Musk

was filed by writer Eugene Carroll who
accused former president Donald Trump of
raping her between 1995 and 96.
now Donald Trump did not show up do the
trial on Monday a lawyer from
carrollside said that Trump's absence
shows that and I'm quoting her he did it
Trump's lawyer said that the case was
outrageous on Monday Trump's lawyer Joe
de coupena accused Carol of wanting to
derail Trump's 2024 White House run amid
the trial Trump accused Carol of making
up the story to drive sales of her
memoir
father Trump denied raping Carol in a
video deposition played for the jury on
the 3rd of May in the video Trump said
that it was the most ridiculous
disgusting story and added that it was
just made up
with the closing arguments out of the
way the jury is scheduled to start
deliberating beginning Tuesday the
narrative given by Trump and his lawyers
it's simple that Asian Carroll is a liar
now it is up to the jury whether they
believe Carol or Trump
and for more on this we were also
earlier joined by a correspondent Susan
thehrani from New York who explains what
happens now after closing arguments or
what's next in this trial listen in
the judge is expected to read the
instructions of the law for the jury on
Tuesday morning and deliberations are
expected to start immediately afterwards
at the start of the trial the judge told
the nine jurors that the central claim
in this case pertained to battery he
said in a civil case battery can result
from even the slightest unlawful
touching of another person the juror
will then be asked whether or not Carol
was successful in bringing her case
against Donald Trump in the battery case
and if the jury does decide that Donald
Trump committed battery then they will
be asked to what extent but the trial
also involves a claim by Carol regarding
defamation on the part of trump once
again they will be asked whether or not
Carol was successful in bringing her
claims forward and whether or not
Trump's intentions were malacious
and Susan also reported on what is at
stake at this trial
if the jury decides that Carol was able
to prove her case against Donald Trump
for battery and defamation then they can
award compensation and punitive damage
the amount will be up to the jury to
decide but there is no possibility that
because of this trial the former
president will go to jail and because it
was a civil case and not a criminal case
he also didn't have to appear in court
in person

and while in the process it will also

everything keeps moving in a rhythmic

the sun will begin to die as a star
nears its end it either expands and goes
out with a bang or it collapses into its
core

this is the first such Celestial
catastrophe observed in real life

one can call it a snapshot from the
future though astronomers have theorized
that stars do gobble up planets

the event was observed 12 000 light
years away near the Aquila constellation
in our Milky Way galaxy the star which
is quite similar to the sun engulfed the
planet over a period of around 100 days
starting off by nibbling at its edges
which ejected dust
the bright explosion occurred in the
final 10 days as the planet was totally
destroyed when it plunged inside the
star
and this is exactly how in 5 billion
years from now our home planet will be
destroyed too
but don't lose heart if Humanity does
survive till then we would have made
unimaginable progress hopping around
galaxies and making Interstellar travel
would be akin to taking a cab home

Syria could be readmitted into the Arab
League
and tonight we can safely tell you we
told you so
Arab states have taken a decision to
resume the participation of the Syrian
Arab Republic's delegation in the
meetings of the Arab League and all
Associated organizations and bodies
starting today
foreign Ministers of the Arab League
countries met at Cairo on Sunday they
decided to restore Syria's membership
in other words re-admit Damascus into
the Arab League
the country was suspended 12 years ago
and why was Syria thrown out in the
first place
you see Syria was suspended from the
Arab League in November 2011.
this was following the outbreak of the
Civil War and soon many Arab states also
pulled out their own voice from Tobuscus
many in fact sided with the rebels who
were trying to oust the Syrian president
Bashar al-assad
the war has killed hundreds of thousands
since and displaced Millions from their
homes U.S president Donald Trump had
branded Assad an animal for using
chemical weapons in Syria
so just what led to this Thor in the
relations is the immediate question
you see in the recent weeks Saudi Arabia
and Syria have tried to take steps
towards normalization in the tides
in fact the two have even signed an
agreement to reopen embassies
and now that Syria has been readmitted
into the Arab Arab League will other
countries follow suit
there is one thing the league has made
very clear and that is Syria's
readmission into the block will not mean
that all member states will
automatically resume diplomatic
relations with Syria and this decision
by the way will be left onto individual
countries
and what about the war
what happens to it
many Regional players have been pulled
into the war in the last decade or so
Iran for example is backing the Assad
regime
Iran's gain in Syria is Israel's loss
the UK the U.S France are also fighting
in Syria
and America mind you is not the happiest
about Syria's readmission into the Arab
League
in fact Washington believes Syria does
not Merit a readmission
the U.S state department has made it
clear that Washington will not normalize
ties with the Assad regime also it does
not support other normal others
normalizing ties with Syria
and guess who is expressing support loud
and clear
the new self-proclaimed Peacemaker in
the block
and if you are thinking China
you are right
China welcomes and congratulates Syria's
return to the Arab League we believe
that Syria's return to the Arab League
is conducive to Greater unity and
self-empowering of the Arab Nations
accelerating the development and
Rejuvenation of the Arab world and
promoting peace and stability in the
Middle East this is in line with the
long-term interests of the Arab
countries China always supports the Arab
Nations for Unity and self-strengthening
and actively supports Syria's return to
the Arab League
which brings us back to the question
what happens to the war in Syria
during the meeting on Sunday the foreign
Ministers of the Arab League countries
decided that Jordan Saudi Arabia Iraq
Lebanon Egypt and the Secretary General
of the league will form a ministerial
contact group
and this group will yes with the Syrian
government and seek step-by-step
solutions to the crisis
also Arab countries will continue to
deliver Aid to Syria is
the return of Syria is the beginning of
a movement
the direction of the resolution to the
crisis in Syria will take time for
procedures to be implemented and it will
be gradual the task of this committee is
to follow up on those procedures

how exactly
well by bringing West Asia closer to
India literally
a grant project is in the works and at
its heart is a massive Railway project
that will create Communications capacity
for Commerce and passengers
this is what happened over the weekend
when India's national security adviser

forward an Innovative project
the others at this critical meeting were
Jake Sullivan America's NSE

shaytanoon bin Zayed al-nayan

and they discussed this grand plan it
entails interconnecting the Arab world
via a railway Network and then carrying
forward the connect to India through
shipping lanes
let's just tell you more where does this
Railway Network start
and which cities will it connect
the concept was greeted warmly but now
the details have to be discussed and the
specific map is being drawn but we can
tell you that India will be the lead
builder of this Mega project
and this plan by the way was presented
to the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman in the presence of the nfcs the
Saudi State News Agency leader saying
I'm quoting during the meeting they
discussed means to strengthen relations
and ties between the three countries in
a way that enhances growth and stability
in the region
this is a foreign policy win for India
at a time when one is much needed New
Delhi was caught napping when China
pulled off a diplomatic coup in West
Asia
remember earlier in December China's
president Xi Jinping made a sudden visit
to Saudi Arabia for a conference with
Arab Nations and this was unprecedented
and then in March China brokered a deal
between Iran and Saudi Arabia that ended
the hostility
now the trilateral China Saudi Iran
agreement signed in Beijing heralded
China's assertive presence in the region
and this was not good news either for
India or for New Delhi strategic partner
that's the United States
but you see delhi's course correction
started sooner than expected led by the
Edison
doval in fact visited Iran last week
before he went to Saudi Arabia
where exactly will the railway project
kick off
pace is in India's and the Region's
interest after all and it seems to have
received the implicit nod from the
prince who is the effective ruler of
Saudi Arabia
and apart from correction what exactly
does this infrastructure mean for
interconnectivity between West Asia and
India
number one
faster movement of energy and trade
and this is crucial
remember traditionally India buys most
of its oil from West Asia countries like
Iraq and Saudi Arabia remain major crude
oil suppliers to India and India also
Imports LNG or liquefied natural gas
from Qatar
the country's top gas importer petronet
has a contract to buy 7.5 million tons
of LNG from Qatar
India is also negotiating a free trade
agreement with the GCC currently India
is the largest importer of emirati goods
and the UAE is India's third largest
trade partner
India in fact aims to become the Bread
Basket of West Asia
and then there is connectivity here's
something else India's credibility in
the railway sector is beyond doubt and
has been internationally recognized
India has the world's fourth largest
railway Network after the U.S China and
Russia
and India also built Railway projects
for Sri Lanka Railway projects for Sri
Lanka and entering West Asia will be an
added feather to that cap
in fact we are being told that the plan
was first laid out during the I2 U2
meeting some 18 months ago and what is
that platform
it comprises of India Israel the United
States and the UAE
in fact the first I2 U2 Summit was held
on the 14th of July 2022.
and coming back to the infra project
here's a question
what exactly is in it for the United
States
and why did the U.S NSA Rick Sullivan
fly to Saudi Arabia to push for a
project to bring West Asia closer to
India
well the answer is simple let me just
read out for you what Jake Sullivan
exactly said
the plan is to connect South South Asia
to West Asia and the United States in
quote unquote ways that Advance the
economic technology and diplomacy
adding I'm quoting a more integrated
interconnected Middle East empowers our
allies and partners advances Regional
peace and prosperity and reduces the
resource demands
on the U.S in this region over the long
term without sacrificing our fundamental
interests or our involvement in the
region
and what about West Asia
coming closer to India helps the regions
trade an economy West Asia is looking to
diverse diversify its economy after all
invest in countries that guarantee a
good return
India for example
the UAE is investing two billion dollars
to develop integrated food parks in
India also looking to develop a hybrid
renewable project in Gujarat of 300
megawatts of wind and solar energy
during Crown Prince Salman's Last Visit
to India
he spoke of investing billions
the Saudi Sovereign fund has already
invested in India The Rail Project

TOS tells you stories which others want
and tonight we will tell you about this
new strategic map
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
thank you
foreign
[Music]
here's a look at what's lined up for you
on the show tonight
[Music]
thank you
a cover story tonight is about a massive
Railway project
and I cannot stress enough on the many
ways in which it is going to be a game
changer
especially when it comes to trade and
connectivity
let me tell you one of the reasons why
this is a project that will have
far-reaching implications
it is a grand plan to bring West Asia
closer to India
and tonight on gravitas
we tell you all about this Railway
project we decode the implications what
are the details who all are involved and
what is the bigger picture
we tell you how India is countering
China's influence in West Asia
India is starting to counter China's
influence in the Arab world with a major
communication project in West Asia
how exactly
well by bringing West Asia closer to
India literally
a grant project is in the works and at
its heart is a massive Railway project
that will create Communications capacity
for Commerce and passengers
this is what happened over the weekend
when India's national security adviser
Ajit doval went to Riyadh to carry
forward an Innovative project
the others at this critical meeting were
Jake Sullivan America's NSE
they're equivalent from the UAE Sheikh
tanon bin Zaid al-nayan
and of course the host Saudi Arabia's
prime minister Muhammad bin Salman
alsoth
and they discussed this grand plan it
entails interconnecting the Arab world
via a railway Network and then carrying
forward the connect to India through
shipping lanes
let us tell you more where is this
Railway Network start
and which cities will it connect
the concept was greeted warmly but now
the details have to be discussed and the
specific map is being drawn but we can
tell you that India will be the lead
builder of this Mega project
and this plan by the way was presented
to the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin
Salman in the presence of the nsas the
Saudi State News Agency leader saying
I'm quoting during the meeting they
discussed means to strengthen relations
and ties between the three countries in
a way that enhances growth and stability
in the region
this is a foreign policy win for India
at a time when one is much needed New
Delhi was caught napping when China
pulled off a diplomatic coup in West
Asia
remember earlier in December China's
president Xi Jinping made a sudden visit
to Saudi Arabia for a conference with
Arab Nations and this was unprecedented
and then in March China brokered a deal
between Iran and Saudi Arabia that ended
their hostility
now the trilateral China Saudi Iran
agreement signed in Beijing heralded
China's assertive presence in the region
and this was not good news either for
India or for new delhi's strategic
partner that's the United States
but you see delhi's course correction
started sooner than expected led by the
NSA
doval in fact visited Iran last week
before he went to Saudi Arabia
when exactly will the railway project
kick off
pace is in India's and the Region's
interest after all and it seems to have
received the implicit nod from the
prince who is the effective ruler of
Saudi Arabia
and apart from course correction what
exactly does this infrastructure mean
for interconnectivity between West Asia
and India
number one
faster movement of energy and trade
and this is crucial
remember traditionally India buys most
of its oil from West Asia countries like
Iraq and Saudi Arabia remain major crude
oil suppliers to India and India also
Imports LNG or liquefied natural gas
from Qatar
the country's top gas importer petronet
has a contract to buy 7.5 million tons
of LNG from Qatar
and India by the way is also negotiating
a free trade agreement with the GCC and
currently India is the largest importer
of emirati goods the UAE is India's
third largest trade partner
and you see India aims to become the
Bread Basket of West Asia the Bread
Basket of West Asia
and then there is connectivity of course
here's something else India's
credibility in the railway sector is
beyond doubt and has been
internationally recognized India has the
world's fourth largest railway Network
after the U.S China and Russia
and India also built Railway projects
for Sri Lanka Railway projects for Sri
Lanka and entering West Asia will be an
added feather to that cap
in fact we are being told that the plan
was first laid out during the I2 U2
meeting some 18 months ago and what is
that platform
it comprises of India Israel the United
States and the UAE
in fact the first I to you to Summit was
held on the 14th of July 2022.
and coming back to the infra project
here's a question
what exactly is in it for the United
States
and why did the U.S NSA Rick Sullivan
fly to Saudi Arabia to push for a

[Music]
the Tibetan youth congress has launched
a month-long Tibet matters March
on the 29th of April 80 volunteers from
India and Nepal started walking from
sikkim's capital gangtok and they will
continue to March till May 23rd and
reach a Psalms the sport City
and what is this about who is leading it
and what does the Tibetan youth congress
want really
let me just break it down for you
as I said the March ends on the 23rd of
May
does that date ring any bells for you
on this day in 1951 Tibetan delegates
were forced to sign the 17-point
agreement with China
the Tibet matters March marking 72 years
of this agreement
and what was this agreement about and
how did it affect the people of Tibet
to begin with it was rather an
imposition instead of an agreement
and it legitimized China's occupation of
Tibet
it was signed after China had invaded
Tibet in 1949 defeated its Army took
control of the bits Eastern and Northern
parts and threatened to advance further
the agreement terms claimed that Tibet
sought Chinese protection from
imperialist powers
even though there were only a handful of
Europeans in Tibet
in truth the agreement was a tool to
cement China's hold on Tibet
on the face of it it promised a bit
control over its Internal Affairs
respect for tibet's religion and culture
it even ensured protecting the power and
status of The Dalai Lama and Pancham
Lama the Tibetan delegation had two
options
first to sign the agreement and second
to take a full-fledged war with China
Tibet chose the safer option and signed
the agreement
but China being China did not play by
the rules it did not keep its part of
the promise
it introduced communist Chinese policies
stationed more troops in Tibet brought
in communist land reforms
leaving the region in turmoil
and all this fueled discontent among the
Tibetans
in fact the anger grew so much that it
led to an uprising in 1959. Tibetans
feared a Chinese plot to kidnap the
delilama
on the 10th of March 300 000 of them
surrounded novelinka Palace in an
attempt to save it and within a week
Chinese artillery was aimed at the
palace the 14th Dalai Lama had to flee
to India
fighting broke out in lhasa two days
later
Tibetan Rebels were hopelessly
outnumbered and outgunned
early on the 21st of March the Chinese
started shelling the palace they
slaughtered tens of thousands of men
women and children still camping outside
the Tibetan Uprising field China
forcibly occupied Tibet
and 64 years on the fight for
independence continues
the Tibet matters March calls for strong
action against China
and added spearhead is
the president of the Tibetan youth
congress
he is seeking international support for
Tibet amid Chinese repression and human
rights violations
in fact he has called on the G20 leaders
to raise this issue during the September
Summit
have a look at this tweet badundup
you can see his foot injury due to all
that walking
he captioned it for Tibet I must
continue walking
the people of Tibet are suffering China
is attacking their human rights and the
matter is only getting worse
first there is Chinese Colonial
education system it has separated over 1
million Tibetan children from their
families
the children
are into Chinese state-run boarding
schools to brainwash them to separate
Tibetan children from their cultural
roots
and then there is Chinese massive
surveillance system of course Chinese
authorities collectibit in DNA samples
even children as young as five have not
been spared
the privacy and identity under threat
and China is also exploiting tibits
landscape and ecosystem in fact almost
almost 2 billion people depend on Fresh
Water Resources in the Tibetan plateau
and what happens to these people if
China continues to abuse tibet's natural
resources
the Tibet matters March promoting peace
and security aims to raise awareness for
Tibetans
will there please be heard
will Tibet be freed from China's
clutches
a couple of weeks back we told you that
Syria could be readmitted into the Arab
League
and tonight we can safely tell you
we told you so
Arab states have taken a decision to
resume the participation of the Syrian
Arab Republic's delegation in the
meetings of the Arab League and all
Associated organizations and bodies
starting today
foreign Ministers of the Arab League
countries met at Cairo on Sunday they
decided to restore Syria's membership
in other words we admit Damascus into
the Arab League
the country was suspended 12 years ago
and why was Syria thrown out in the
first place
you see Syria was suspended from the
Arab League in November 2011.
this was following the outbreak of the
Civil War and soon many Arab states also
pulled out their own voice from Tobuscus
many in fact sided with the rebels who
were trying to oust the Syrian president
Bashar al-assad
the war has killed hundreds of thousands
since and displaced Millions from their
homes U.S president Donald Trump had
branded Assad an animal for using
chemical weapons in Syria
so just what led to this thought in the
relations is the immediate question
you see in the recent weeks Saudi Arabia
and Syria have tried to take steps
towards normalization in the tides
in fact the two have even signed an
agreement to reopen embassies
and now that Syria have been readmitted
into the Arab Arab League will other
countries follow suit
there is one thing the league has made
very clear and that is Syria's
readmission into the block will not mean
that all member states will
automatically resume diplomatic
relations with Syria and this decision
by the way will be left onto individual
countries
and what about the war
what happens to it
many Regional players have been pulled
into the war in the last decade or so
Iran for example is backing the Assad
regime
Iran's gain in Syria is Israel's loss
the UK the U.S France are also fighting
in Syria
and America mind you is not the happiest
about Syria's readmission into the Arab
League
in fact Washington believes Syria does
not Merit a readmission
the U.S state department has made it
clear that Washington will not normalize
ties with the Assad regime also it does
not support other normal others
normalizing ties with Syria
and guess who is expressing support loud
and clear
the new self-proclaimed Peacemaker in
the block
and if you are thinking China
you are right
China welcomes and congratulates Syria's
return to the Arab League we believe
that Syria's return to the Arab League
is conducive to Greater unity and
self-empowering of the Arab Nations
accelerating the development and
Rejuvenation of the Arab world and
promoting peace and stability in the
Middle East this is in line with the
long-term interests of the Arab
countries China always supports the Arab
Nations for Unity and self-strengthening
and actively supports Syria's return to
the Arab League
and which brings us back to
the during the meeting on Sunday the
foreign Ministers of the Arab League
countries had decided that Jordan saw
the Arabia Iraq Lebanon Egypt and the
Secretary General of the league will
form a ministerial contact group and
this group
with lazy with the will with the Syrian
government and seek step-by-step
solutions to the crisis
also Arab countries will continue to
deliver Aid to Syria
foreign
the direction of the resolution to the
crisis in Syria will take time for
procedures to be implemented and it will
be gradual the task of this committee is
to follow up on those procedures
the Arab League Summit is on the 19th of
May in Riyadh and Damascus has not yet
said if Assad will attend it
China's much debated belt and Road
initiative is once again in the news and
this time for its extension to
Afghanistan
you heard that right Afghanistan
in fact the Chinese foreign minister met
with his Pakistani and afghanistani
counterparts
they pledge to work together on
Afghanistan's reconstruction process and
this includes taking China Pakistan
economic Corridor to the Taliban ruled
state
the same nation which does not have
enough money to feed its own people
so what trade is China expecting from
Afghanistan really and what is in it for
Beijing
this has once again raised questions
about China's ambitious project and for
those unversed Xi Jinping launched the
belt and Road initiative in the year
2013.
a decade has passed by and the project
is still in the making
China boasts of it as 21st Century's
Silk Road originally it was devised to
link East Asia and Europe through
physical infrastructure
but over the years the project has
expanded to more than 140 countries and
these nations account for two-thirds of
the world's population and 40 percent of
the global GDP
and now cash-strapped Afghanistan is
also a part of the project
the project comprises a belt of Overland
corridors and a maritime Road of
shipping lanes hence the name
I told you the project is ambitious and
one can only guess how much money has
been spent
analysts put the figure at one trillion
dollars and experts predict Bri's
lifetime cost to reach 8 trillion
dollars
but take that with a pinch of salt
Chinese firms are carrying out
construction across the world in fact on
an unparalleled scale the largest of all
projects is the china-pakistan railway
with an estimated spending of around 58
billion dollars it connects kashkar in
China's xinjiang uyghur autonomous
region to Pakistan's Port of guadal
in fact it is the most expensive Bri
project so far
but China is vouching for it in hopes of
reshaping trade and geopolitics
that the whole Bell that is what the
belt and Road Project really is all
about are Chinese Marshall Plan a
state-backed campaign for Global
dominance and a massive marketing
campaign for something that was already
in motion
as in China's growing investment around
the world
it is partnering with rich and poor
countries alike countries like Pakistan
Sri Lanka Malaysia and now Afghanistan
and these countries are at serious risk
of failing to repay their loans
the Maldives Mongolia Pakistan
Tajikistan are among the poorest in
their respective regions
in fact they mo they owe more than half
of all their foreign debt to China
Afghanistan may also meet a similar fate
and it makes it difficult to not
speculate is China using debt trap
diplomacy to extract strategic
concessions
consider this in 2011 China wrote off an
undisclosed debt owed by Tajikistan and
what exactly did it demand in return
over 1100 square kilometers of disputed
territory that's right
land in exchange of debt relief
the project is a sort of economic
imperialism it is giving China too much
leverage over other countries and who
knows if this expanded commercial
presence one day turns into military
presence
it has already established an overseas
military base in Djibouti almost all the
ports and other transport infrastructure
can serve dual purposes if it can carry
Goods it can also carry troops
and what does Afghanistan have to offer
in terms of trade anyway
and another interesting statement came
out of the trilateral meeting in
Islamabad the foreign ministers agreed
to combat terrorism
do remember this is Pakistan Afghanistan
and China we are talking about these
countries are most notorious for
supporting terrorism themselves
and what are they up to now
where is the belt and Road initiative
headed
in the last 10 years it has not quite
served any purpose but will this
ambitious plan ever yield its promised
results
or will it simply give China political
and Military leverage over the others
our next story is from India
where a boat capsized in the southern
state of Kerala at least 22 people lost
their lives
Reports say most of the deceased are
women and children
what led to that vessel capsizing what
is the latest
our next report getting you the complete
story
yeah
a capsized boat
Rescuers bringing survivors to the shore
and the deceased being carried on
stretchers
22 people lost their lives in the
southern Indian state of Kerala after a
boat with the capacity to carry 20
passengers loaded up nearly 40 people
for a ride
this was the first indication of
something going wrong
but operators did not pay heed and
encouraged passengers to board
Reports say some onlookers also warned
of the vessel tilting to one side a
vessel can capsize due to several
reasons a sharp turn could flip a boat
maybe a strong wave could overturn a
vessel or maybe heavy winds can cause a
boat to capsize but this incident is
also about a clear violation of rules
an incident where a boat was packed with
too many people rescue operations are
still underway
Prime Minister Modi has announced an
ex-gracia of over two thousand four
hundred dollars for the next of kin of
each deceased
the state government will also provide
an over 12 thousand dollar fund to the
families of each deceased what made
things worse was the condition of the
boat
Reports say the vessel had no emergency
Machinery or infrastructure there were
no safety ropes or lights the situation
reached a point where local fishermen
had to step in the fishermen had to
rescue people with ropes
The Vessel did not have an emergency
exit door and a significant part of the
boat was made with glass
Reports say that people could not Escape
due to Broken Glass
many had to squeeze through the only two
doors of the vessel
careless chief minister has declared
Monday as a day of mourning all
government events have been postponed as
a mark of respect to the victims
leaders from across the political
Spectrum have expressed their
condolences
will The Vessel owners be more careful
from now on will officials carry
mandatory checks for Emergency Equipment
in vessels
will lessons be learned
Bureau report we on worldless one
Focus to Iran for now a country
struggling with the cost of living
crisis amid a major challenge of
handling waves of protests Iran is
planning to put up
its historical Treasures for auction you
heard that right the country's ancient
historical Treasures will be a part of
an online auction
this is to reduce the state debt in the
face of crippling sanctions
first things first what exactly are
these ancient Treasures that I'm talking
about and why did the country even
consider such a move
well you see Iran's currency the Real's
value has dropped to a historic low
and this is mainly due to the several
sanctions imposed on the country the
Nationwide protests
following a 22 year old mesa amini's
death also did not help much the majorly
affected the country's economy what
seems like the worst period in history
for Iran has pushed the country to sell
its historical Treasures like ancient
castles and Heritage buildings
can you believe that
a total of 19 locations in fact will be
on sale by the 22nd of May and this is a
move by Iran's Ministry of cultural
heritage tourism and handicraft
so which cultural sites will be a part
of the auction is the immediate question
one of them will be the Ryan castle
castle
reports see the castle is nearly a
thousand years old this is a fort with
one of the oldest foundations which can
date back to pre-islamic clients
another gem on sale would be the
residence of nasiruddin Mirza a prince
of the kajar dynasty the building was
confiscated from The Princess heirs
following the Islamic revolution and
many more buildings owned by the pelavi
dynasty met the same fate
in fact the site is currently owned by
the government
some Heritage sites have been converted
into hotels even restaurants
and while this can be seen as a move to
Breathe new life into these structures
experts say the conversions can damage
the buildings if not managed under
expert supervision
so what are the historians really saying
about this auction plan
well the experts are not all that
pleased historians have condemned the
auction plan and said that it is
extremely worrisome
Iran's leading architectural historian
Muhammad garipur saying that the lack of
research behind the plan is alarming
this is the latest move which has
triggered question marks over the
reasons behind this measure the ministry
of labor in fact had to recently sack a
senior official because of what he said
as a part of an interview
now the former director general of
social insurance had said that Iran
might have to sell some of its Persian
Gulf Islands
he might have had a good argument he
gave the example of how Greece sold
hundreds of its Islands to relieve
pensioners
and Iran May soon find itself in a
similar situation Iran had sacrificed
300 000 Martyrs to preserve its land
during the iran-iraq war
and this latest move has triggered a
series of question marks how badly are
the sanctions hitting Iran really the
nation earns a significant path through
its oil exports and officials say that
even if the country sold 3 million
barrels per day and received the full
proceeds from the sales it would still
not resolve the economic crisis Iran
currently sells only 1 million barrels
per day due to stringent sanctions and
declining living conditions wage areas
and a lack of welfare support has now
sparked on rest on the streets citizens
are enriched as inflation continues to
rise
nearly half the country in fact has been
forced below the poverty line
will selling cultural Treasures really
solve Iran's problems it remains to be
seen
meanwhile the state of Bangladesh's
economy
the depleting Forex Reserves
its growth story hitting a roadblock
there is mounting economic trouble
in fact for months we've been telling
you how Pakistan's economic crisis
have led to misery for the people of the
country we have been telling you about
the levels of Despair and Desperation on
the ground how people have been getting
crushed in stampedes while trying to get
basic food Aid
we've also been decoding Sri Lanka's
economic crisis for you telling you just
how bad things have got in the country
and how things reach that point
are we now going to see a repeat of
what's been happening in these two
countries is another country heading in
the same direction or are things under
control
take a look at what's happening in
Bangladesh
the international monetary fund has
flagged risks to the country's economy
this is what it has said
persistent inflationary pressures
elevated volatility of Global Financial
conditions and slow down in major
Advanced trading partners continue to
weigh on growth foreign currency
Reserves and the currency
now this comes after an international
monetary fund staff team conducted a
staff visit to Dhaka in order to discuss
the recent macroeconomic developments
also the implementation of the fund
supported program
reserves by the way are expected to drop
to
29.86 billion dollars that is the lowest
in seven years after import bill
payments for two months next week
let's just give you some background here
in January this year the South Asian
countries secured a 4.7 billion dollar
loan from the IMF amid mounting economic
trouble Bangladesh has received 476
million dollars as the first installment
with the second batch expected in
November
and while Bangladesh recorded a decline
in Forex reserves neighboring India saw
its import cover blowed to a 10-month
high
now this clearly shows that India's
Stand Tall even have neighboring
countries seem to be faltering Sri Lanka
and Pakistan being Prime examples of
that
and now concerns are growing over
Bangladesh state of economy as well it
seems to be in trouble once touted as a
strong emerging economy Bangladesh has
been struggling since the pandemic hit
the global economy and whether or not
things will go further south remains to
be seen
but the fact is the depleting Forex
reserves falling repetances have been a
cause of growing concern the lack of
diversification as far as the
manufacturing sector is concerned is
also an issue
while short-term measures have been
undertaken to improve the economic
growth there is a need to reassess also
assess to rethink the strategy and a
need for multi-pronged reform programs
what comes to your mind when I mention
atomic bomb
is it Hiroshima Nagasaki
but would you ever think of artificial
intelligence
that too as a potential atomic bomb
well Warren Buffett just did in fact he
said that AI is like the creation of the
atom bomb
what did he mean
why did he say that our next report
telling you more
what is the biggest threat to the human
race over time the answer to this
question has changed
and the latest addition to the list of
threats is artificial intelligence
how dangerous is it recently Warren
Buffett the American business magnet
compared artificial intelligence to an
atom bomb he said
when something can do all kinds of
things I get a little bit worried
because I know we won't be able to
uninvent it and you know we did invent
for very very good reason the atom bomb
in World War II
statement comes as a question to ai's
capacity to replace humans and in
cognizance of how much AI can already do
in fact Buffett is not the first person
to have made such statements The
Godfather of AI Joffrey Hinton claimed
that he left the field of technology to
be able to openly talk about the dangers
of AI
regretting his entire life's work Hinton
said that ai's threat to the world could
be more urgent than climate change and
needs immediate attention commenting on
similar lines Stuart Russell the author
of artificial intelligence a modern
approach compared AI to Chernobyl
disaster the very disaster that is
called the world's worst ever civil
nuclear incident
among these Tech CEOs is Elon Musk who
has warned that the out-of-control
development of AI has profound risks to
humanity and has urged companies to Halt
work on advancing AI musk along with
other academics and tech industry
figures have signed an open letter that
demands an immediate pause on
development of AI this letter also urges
government to temporarily ban research
on advancement of AI why are these Tech
Giants opposing AI what calls for such a
strong reaction this is because of ASI
artificial super intelligence it is a
software-based system with intellectual
Powers Beyond those of humans meaning
its capabilities would apply across
disciplines and would include cognition
general intelligence problem-solving
abilities social skills and even
creativity
imagine if this happens where would
humans end up wouldn't the human
civilization be completely replaced
while ASI does not exist yet and is a
hypothetical state of AI it could be not
too far away especially with auto GPT

having the ability to teach itself view

today is a Monday and unlike most
Mondays that bring along Monday blues
this one is about Monday Bliss
it's about motivation progress also hope
the defense Ministry of India has
approved the posting of women officers
of territorial Army along the line of
control or the Loc
which means by the way that women
officers who are a part of the engineer
Regiment of the territorial Army can now
be stationed at the military line of
command of India
the territorial Army commonly known as
the TA Army is an army based on Citizen
Soldier Army concept which means the
officers in this Army undergo annual
military training while staying employed
in civilian life
they carry out a periodic attachment
with the tutorial with the territorial
Army where they assist the Indian army
by providing support services
and this approval brings with itself a
fresh perspective
and also a progressive one
you see with this approval New Delhi
aims to enhance the scope of employment
of women officers in the Indian army
the territorial Army started
commissioning women officers in the year
2019
and as a result of which women officers
were able to serve in ecological task
force units
ta oil sectors and ta Railway engineer
regiment
but they were away from the Loc
unlike their meal counterparts
and with this crucial move women
officers will now be posted at the loc
they will serve and train under the same
circumstances as their meal counterparts
they will have a wider range of units to
opt for also more positions to fill and
serve
and this forward-thinking policy measure
will not only fulfill the professional
aspirations of the women officers to be
able to be in the war field but it also
expands the range of employment
opportunities for them
after an amendment to the existing
Carter management Provisions the
ministry of Defense not only declared
that women officers will now serve at
the loc but they also added that women
officers from now onwards can serve as
staff officers at the territorial Army
group headquarters and the directorate
general of territorial Army at New Delhi
earlier both these Provisions were
exclusively for male officers and women
officers had a limited service scope
and this is not the first time that
India has undertaken steps to promote
gender equality in the armed forces of
course the Indian army has granted
permanent commission to women and this
has put women officers at par with their
meal counterparts and women are now
being assigned command roles and they
are joining artillery regimens none of
which
was a norm in the past
in fact the Indian army plans to
implement a joint selection board for
male and female officers in 2024-25
and this is crucial for two reasons
primarily number one this committee will
be gender neutral number two both male
and female officers will be given equal
consideration for promotion
and with multiple actions at multiple
levels India is taking huge steps
towards an inclusive Army an army where
women
have been getting these roles

uhL_BPbqKgA,Arab League readmits Syria as relations with Assad normalise | Latest World News | World DNA | WION,"West Asia has been showing signals of change recently, and the change is now profound. Syria has been re-admitted to the Arab ...",2023-05-08T03:45:30Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uhL_BPbqKgA/hqdefault.jpg,"all right let's now begin with our top
story that's coming from West Asia right
Rohit Sans have been shifting in West
Asia in recent weeks and months now the
shift it's a huge one of course Syria
has been readmitted to the Arab League
of Nations ending 12 years of political
isolation yes it's a big development in
West Asia the move comes after Arab
League foreign ministers voted to
reinstate Syria back into the Arab fold
at a closed-door meeting in Cairo a
unanimous decision by the group's
foreign minister said and I quote
government delegations from the Syrian
Arab Republic will resume their
participation in Arab League meetings
the decision also calls for resolution
of Syria's Civil War
foreign now all 13 of the 22 member
states that were present in the meeting
endorse the decision however not all
parties on the table have been in for
the decision while United Arab League
has been pushing for serious readmission
others have been wary of this move Rohit
yes
Some Like Jordan have been
urging for a return with conditions
attached while Qatar has been opposing
full normalization without a political
solution to the Syrian conflict
according to the decision secretary
generals of Jordan Saudi Arabia Iraq
Lebanon Egypt and Arab League
would form a ministerial contact group
to work along with the Syrian government
and seek a step-by-step solutions to the
crisis the decision comes ahead of Arab
League Summit on the 19th of May in
Jeddah the last Arab League Summit Assad
attended was in 2010.
here be there yet
no massage
[Music]
but let's try and understand why was
Syria ousted in the first place
damascus's membership was suspended in
the year 2011 due to the brutal
Crackdown on people protesting against
President Bashar al-assar the violence
eventually escalated and sparked a Civil
War which brought the country to its
knees statistics tell you the Crave
picture on the ground in Syria more than
half a million people have been killed
and millions displaced since the war
started this is also added to the
problem of refugee influx for the
neighboring countries
while the front lines have mostly
quietened large parts of the country's
North remain outside government control
Syria's Assad has been able to emerge as
a winner militarily due to Russia and
Iran's support
[Music]
um
now Russia has hailed this decision to
reinstate its allies Syria's membership
into the Arab League calling it an
action that showed Arab countries intent
on conducting their own independent
policy on the global stage the United
States has also reacted a U.S state
Department spokesperson said that
Washington shared the goals of Arab
Partners in Syria including building
security and stability but also
cautioned that it remains skeptical of
Assad's willingness to take steps
required to resolve the Syrian crisis
foreign
so what are the implications of this
move and how did it come about let's go
across to him thank you so much Rohit I
will take off from here lots to unpack
in fact let's just tell you about the
implications of Syria returning to the
Arab League it's a huge symbolic win for
our Southern supporters with this Assad
has gained the legitimacy status thus
ending the Pariah status of Syria the
move will also undo of course the
crippling sanctions on Syria mostly and
may also bring International Community
on board and Syria's return to the Arab
League it also acts as a setback for the
accountability Seekers here let's just
give you a brief timeline of how the
Arab leagues reinstated Assad Syria
Refugee crisis drugs and extremism here
prompted an Outreach to Damascus then
with UA and Jordan pushing for Syria
turquoia talks on the 11th of April the
Arab Nations met on Syria's return to
the Arab League and on the 18th of April
Saudi foreign minister visited Damascus
and on the 1st of May the envoys from
Saudi Iraq Egypt and Syria met with the
focus being on the political situation
here
followed by on the 7th of May the Arab
League decided to re-admit Syria let's
also now tell you what's next for Syria
Assad will be attending the Arab League
Summit in Saudi Arabia on the 19th of
May the debate will revolve around
reconstruction of Syrian Arab incentives
for Assad and lastly the return of
Syrian refugees will also be on the
agenda here
but of course there are some other
questions as well and for more on this
we're joined by Edward p Joseph from
Washington DC Edward is a senior fellow
at Johns Hopkins University School of
advanced international studies and a
foreign policy analyst thank you so much
for joining us on this broadcast this
morning
you're welcome now my first question to
you how do you assess serious
readmission to the Arab League
exactly as you put it you put it very
well this is a legitimacy for uh Bashar
Assad this is this represents uh
acknowledgment by Syria's neighbors that
effectively Syria has prevailed or will
prevail because the conflict is by no
means over but it's uh tacitly uh
conceding by most of Syria's neighbors
principally among them Saudi Arabia that
uh basically
uh Damascus has prevailed with the
backing of Iran the backing of Russia of
the brutality the sheer brutality that
all three have inflicted upon the Syrian
people and we really shouldn't gloss
over that here while we're talking about
these uh diplomatic moves here to admit
uh Syria back into the Arab League we
should remember as your package noted
the absolutely astounding human cost as
you noted almost a half a million people
dead a basically half of serious
population displaced that's about 12
million people displaced and of course
that's one of the drivers here because
many of those displaced people have
crossed the border into neighboring
states like Jordan that would like to
see these refugees return to their homes
so that's that's part of this that
there's an understandable interest in
some of uh serious neighbors
particularly Jordan to have these
refugees go back to their homes and just
basically restore some kind of open
relationship and hope that perhaps uh
Assad can be in pushed somehow to make
some concessions please
Mrs Joseph there are there is this
Regional realignment going on in West
Asia but there is a global impact of
that now how do you see that Global
impact because we've seen the reactions
that have come in the last few hours
Russia is hailing this inclusion of
Syria and the Arab League but U.S
remains skeptical of Assad's willingness
to end or resolve the Syrian crisis of
what are the global ramifications of
this
it's an interesting question I I
wouldn't I wouldn't overstate them I
would not overstate this and read this
as some kind of grand geopolitical
Victory unless uh someone watching is is
a big fan of uh brutality and uh using
maximum Force against civilians I I know
these statistics are hard for people to
process when we talk about a half a
million people it's hard to for the
human brain to process that but remember
some of the photographs the images that
Unforgettable image of the child uh
shattered in in the uh they're in the
hospital with the the white dust
covering his face of the child on the
beach in uh in Turkey trying to get uh
to to Greece to escape from Syria lying
dead there on the beach these are some
of the individual human stories this is
how this change was achieved it was uh
brutality Russia coming in and bombing
not just helping Syria bomb not just
civilians but even U.N Humanity Ontarian
convoys remember that this is this is a
war with uh where Assad was targeting
hospitals schools so whatever we can say
about the the different parties or their
aims uh here the the means that were
used to to achieve this are those that
that are uh deeply troubling for anyone
who cares about uh lasting stability or
uh international law or human rights so
uh yes it's true uh Assad with the
backing of Iran and Russia has prevailed
but again uh I don't believe this is
some kind of uh geopolitical shift
please
all right Mr Edward Joseph we'll leave
you there thanks very much for joining
us with your perspective

PiybAJjqh88,QR codes here to stay at restaurants? WION,"Up until COVID-19, the QR code, that square offspring of the Universal Product Code, was a mostly marginal technology as far as ...",2023-05-07T05:43:57Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PiybAJjqh88/hqdefault.jpg,"over the last few years many restaurants
have started replacing physical menu
cards with digital menus that are
operated through a QR code well some
customers are comfortable operating them
many others feel the classic physical
menu card is integral to the dining out
experience
[Music]
the menu card has been an integral part
of the restaurant experience since the
yester years the prices on it may have
gone up tenfold but depending on where
one goes out for a meal the experience
can range from a detailed menu with a
wine list and well-informed server to
some misspelled items on the side of a
food van
however there is a second alternative
that has become increasingly popular in
the last few years and that is the
absence of the physical menu altogether
now ever since the pandemic began a lot
of restaurants shifted to QR codes which
you scan with your mobile phone and they
take you to a digital menu on the
restaurant's website and if you're
ordering at home of course all the
delivery apps have online menus which
you scan through an order now all that
was fine at the peak of kovit because
you know you had to avoid contact with
shareable physical material but the fact
that a lot of restaurants are still
sticking with it that goes Way Beyond
just hygiene
changing prices and items at the click
of a button as opposed to reprinting and
cutting out the cost of printing all
together are at the top of a list that
can go into all sorts of diplomatic
justifications like following a covet
protocol that isn't at all mandatory
but no matter how tech savvy the food
and beverage sector gets browsing
through a printed menu card and reading
well-written introductions to each dish
is an Irreplaceable operative
would know she has been observing the
good bad and improvable aspects of
restaurants for close to four decades
[Music]
they used to be individual people used
to steal menu cards I used to steal them
myself when I was in college in the
1970s I must admit there are a flood of
um
people getting allergic to various
things so you actually have to ask a
server you have to ask somebody in the
restaurant space whether soon so thing
has any allergens and then carry on with
them like when you are just looking at
it online it won't show anything at all
even though delivery apps with online
versions of menus are the popular choice
for home delivery a lot of local
restaurants still continue to print
pamphlets that also accompany the
morning newspaper for the few that still
prefer to call and order in there are
also those who do not feel comfortable
using a QR code at restaurants possibly
because they do not choose to own a
smartphone or are simply against the
idea of replacing a physical menu
finding the middle ground is key here I
believe a hybrid model is is what it
should be
the choice should be given if you feel
as a restaurant it cuts your cost sure
but keep a few copies of your physical
menu as well
give the choice I mean if you're giving
so many choices in terms of what you can
eat give them the choice of how they can
order as well if you want to say no
we're going to have QR codes
um physical menus you are telling a
certain kind of customer look we don't
want you to get out and sooner or later
they're going to get out and that's when
you begin realizing that it's not their
funeral it's yours as restaurants seem
to be paying heat to that the workforce
at prints and Designs Menus can be at
ease at least for the foreseeable future

on the 8th of September 2022 thousands
gathered outside Buckingham Palace in
central London
[Music]
there was an absolute silence when the
flag was lowered to half-mast Buckingham
Palace has announced the death of her
majesty Queen Elizabeth II in a
statement the palace said the queen died
peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon
the crowds surged to the gates as the
notice announcing the death of the only
monarch most britishers have ever known
became public
[Music]
they lamented the passing of Britain's
longest-serving Monarch she died
peacefully at her home at Balmoral
Castle in Scotland at the age of 96.
Queen Elizabeth II reigned for 70 years
7 months and two days
though her Reign was frequently
overshadowed by scandals involving her
family The Sovereign was praised for her
Devotion to duty
[Music]
Queen Elizabeth II's death marked the
end of an era
it also snapped the link between
Britain's Imperial past and the modern
world a world where the royal family is
now struggling to stay relevant how long
will the UK monarchy last
[Music]
relevance is absolutely crucial to the
monarchy the big threat to the future of
the House of Windsor is not mobs
storming the gate it's it's it's not
Revolution it's it's becoming irrelevant
and they understand that you've got to
the queen always used to say we have to
be seen to be believed they have to play
a part in National Life
[Music]
even before the queen died Buckingham
Palace had a plan in place for the
Queen's funeral
[Music]
it was codenamed Operation London Bridge
the operation provided plans for
services and succession
[Music]
of happy men
have our only lawful and rightful
Regional
[Music]
upon the passing away of Queen Elizabeth
II The Throne was passed to her eldest
son Charles the former Prince of Wales
it was done without any formal ceremony
as per the laws of British succession
[Music]
British law specifies that the heir to
the throne becomes king or queen
immediately after the death of the
previous monarch so that there is no
period without a reigning king or queen
the official process of ascending the
throne began on the 10th of September
2022 two days after the death of Queen
Elizabeth II
however the coronation of King Charles
was planned for the 6th of May 2023 at
Westminster Abbey eight months after the
queen passed away
why is it that Charles's coronation
ceremony took place months after he
ascended the throne is there a reason
[Music]
and what exactly is a coronation
ceremony let's find out
[Music]
[Applause]
amen
a coronation is both the symbolic
religious ceremony during which a
sovereign is crowned and the physical
act of placing a crown on a Monarch's
head
foreign
God Saves The King
it is a one thousand year old tradition
with Archbishop of Canterbury oversees
the ceremony
a coronation is several months after a
monarch dies
this is to ensure appropriate time is
provided for Mourning
[Music]
the crowning of a new monarch is meant
to be a celebratory occasion and so it
would be inappropriate to hold the
ceremony while mourning continues this
interval gives the planners enough time
to complete the elaborate Arrangements
required
[Music]
that is why Queen Elizabeth II also sat
on the throne 16 months later on the 2nd
of June 1953 even though her father King
George VI died on the 6th of February
1952.

[Music]
thank you
King Charles's coronation formalizes the
Monarch's role as the head of the Church
of England and marks the transfer of
titles and Powers
[Music]
it is the first coronation the United
Kingdom has seen in 70 long years
Joyce Lewis she is part of a small
section of people that attended the last
coronation in Britain in 1953 Back in
the Day Lewis and Friends camped out on
the mall the Avenue leading to
Buckingham Palace to watch the
coronation procession of Queen Elizabeth
II Lewis has some vivid memories of the
event
the thing I do remember was the queen
had a bouquet I think of probably
orchids there were white flowers on her
lap and as she went past these flowers
were just shaking very gently showing
what they were feeling really in a way
but the flowers stuck in my memory
because then of course when she came
back she had the orb and the scepter
Louis just turned 90. as someone who has
witnessed the British Monarchy from
early on she has pinned her hopes on
King Charles I feel he's had a long wait
for it but I feel he's somebody who will
do his best
and I think that's all a person can do I
think I think he's matured a lot
from when he was younger and he's I
think grown into a very fine person and
one that can be trusted to fulfill all
that's required of a king in these very
challenging days far more than his
mother faced I would think
Joyce Lewis may seem optimistic about
the new monarch
but the anti-monarchist movement in
Britain is also gaining momentum
[Applause]
[Music]
these protesters have publicly
challenged King Charles as a session to
the throne and the institution that he
heads holding the signboards not my king
the supporters of Republic a group
founded in 1983 their campaigns for an
elected head of state believe their best
chance of ending the monarchy is right
now
I think the monarchy is in a lot of
trouble because uh you know they've lost
their star player support is clearly
going down
interest is going down and that's a big
problem for them so enthusiasm for the
coronation is about nine percent
just hours before King Charles's
coronation six demonstrators including
the leader of the anti-monarchy group
Republic Graham Smith were arrested by
the police while unloading placards near
the coronation procession route in
central London
Our intention is to show that there is a
republican movement in the UK and it is
growing every single day the trends show
more and more people dislike the
monarchy and want an elected head of
state or no head of state or a
Democratic alternative to what we have
now and we're here just to show that we
exist and this is a very common belief
in the UK obviously most people here are
here to demonstrate peacefully
and that's what I hope happens and
hopefully we get the chance to put our
point of view that we should that we
should not have an unelected head of
state
according to a survey conducted by the
andhi monarchy campaign group 35 of
people were against the monarchy in 2022
as opposed to 45 percent of people in
2023 it clearly indicates the declining
support for the Royal Family
in fact King Charles's coronation was
scaled down with the shortest ceremony
and attended by 2 000 plus guests while
the late Queen's lavish event had more
than 8 000 people
[Music]
does it imply that the British Monarchy
is slowly becoming Irrelevant in today's
world
who is the new monarch what is his past
and how popular is the monarchy under
King Charles let's break it down
thank you
Charles was born on the 14th of November
1948 at Buckingham Palace the firstborn
son of Elizabeth and Philip he received
a 41-gun salute in Hyde Park
he was just four years old when his
mother Queen Elizabeth II was crowned as
Queen
[Music]
and it was in 1969 that he was first
exposed to the Royal roles he would
eventually discharge as Britain's King
[Music]
that year at the age of 20 he was
invested by the queen as Prince of Wales
A Canaveral Castle he served in the
British royal Air Force and Royal Navy
while also enjoying a comfortable life
marked with playing Polo and doing
charity work
[Music]
[Music]
with his marriage to Lady Diana Spencer
more popularly known as Lady Diana
started a very controversial chapter of
his life
so long as you both shall live I will in
1981 at the age of 32 he tied the knot
with the 20 year old Diana Spencer a
schoolteacher in London they had first
met in 1977 when Charles was reportedly
courting Diana's Sister Sarah Spencer
Charles eventually parted ways with
Sarah and went on to marry Diana
they're Larger than Life wedding took
place at Saint Paul's Cathedral in
London an event that was seen by a
global television audience of about 750
million across 74 countries
in Britain even a public holiday was
declared to Mark the cheerful occasion
[Music]
a year later they welcomed a newborn son
William
three years later in 1984 they were
blessed with another son Harry
he said a president by being the first
Royal father to be present at his
children's births
but familial Bliss soon faded away and
their marriage began faltering
Prince Charles was allegedly involved in
an affair with Camilla Parker Bowles
he had met Camilla about a decade before
getting married to Diana but the two had
to part ways and their romance ended
Princess Diana was aware of this affair
even famously hinting at it in a 1995
interview saying there were three of us
in this marriage so it was a bit crowded
do you think Mrs Parker Bowles was a
factor in the breakdown of your marriage
well there were three of us in this
marriage so it was a bit crowded
the cracks in their marriage started
becoming more evident in their glum
public appearances a month later the
shocking news of their separation was
announced to the British Parliament but
matters only got worse from there
93 camilligate
the transcript
to hilophonic conversation between
Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles
was published by the UK paper the people
the six-minute intimate conversation
sent shock waves throughout the royal
family it exposed the relationship
between the two while Prince Charles was
still married to Lady Diana
Prince Charles faced even more turbulent
Waters the following year in 1994 his
Infamous interview with John dimbleby
came out in which he publicly confessed
to having cheated on Diana did you try
to be faithful and honorable to your
wife when you took on the vow of
marriage yes absolutely
and you were yes
until it became
irretrievably broken down
the pair ultimately divorced in 1996 but
Diana's popularity continued to remain
unaffected
I think it was inevitable that when
Charles became king that a lot of the
person's self would come back to haunt
him but we know a huge amount about him
of a very personal nature stuff that he
in no way would want us to know and uh
you know I'm talking specifically about
TV interviews in the 1990s in a series
of recorded Sullivan conversations that
were leaked to newspapers of a most
personal nature
but what happened next took the entire
world
a year after their divorce on the 31st
of August 1997 Lady Diana was killed in
a car crash in Paris
her death had a moving impact on the
people world over who struggled to come
to terms with what felt like a personal
loss to them
[Music]
the Diana had indeed left the world as
the queen of people's hearts
[Music]
oops
[Music]
in 2005 eight years after the death of
Diana Prince Charles finally tied the
knot with Camilla Parker Bowles who had
been long blamed for his bailed marriage
with Diana
interestingly Camilla decided not to use
the Princess of Wales title which had
been used by Diana
instead she chose the Duchess of
Cornwall styling herself on her
husband's other title the Duke of
Cornwall
[Music]
and in 2022 this happened in a message
marking the 70th anniversary of her
Reign the queen said she wants Camilla
to be known as Queen consort when Prince
Charles becomes king
at the age of 74 King Charles succeeded
Queen Elizabeth II following a lifetime
of scrutiny as Britain's longest serving
Heir Apparent in the Years leading to
his accession Charles has hit headlines
for all the wrong reasons many times
over
here are a few of the controversies that
King Charles quartered over the years
in 2005 King Charles committed a
diplomatic blunder and shook hands with
the Zimbabwean president and dictator
Robert Mugabe the incident took place
during the funeral of Pope John Paul II
and a day before his marriage to Camilla
at the time was an outcast the European
Union had banned him for rigging
parliamentary poles
in 2017 the paradise papers were
released by The International Consortium
of investigative journalists
it made public its investigation into
how the world's rich and famous stashed
their wealth offshore
the name of King Charles III cropped up
among those who stashed their wealth in
safe tax Havens
in June last year the Sunday Times
reported that King Charles accepted 3
million euros from Qatari prime minister
sheikhandan bin jasim bin Jabar
al-tahani as donations to his charitable
fund between 2011 and 2015.
[Music]
critics said it raised serious concerns
about the future King's personal
judgment
also last year King Charles vented his
frustration over a leaking pin during a
signing ceremony in Northern Ireland
the new monarch initially wrote down the
wrong date as he signed a visitor's book
in front of cameras at belfast's
Hillsborough Castle before his pen
started leaking ink
earlier this year King Charles's son
Prince Harry released his Memoir spare
the book revealed several private
confrontations between him and other
senior Royals and the details of his
split from the family many reports also
claimed that the book ruined the
reputation of the royal domain such
unending Royal Rifts only raised
questions about Prince Charles and the
monarchy
foreign
and then there's the larger question
what does the British Monarchy actually
do
although the king or queen is the head
of state their powers are only
ceremonial the Monarch remains
politically neutral he receives daily
dispatchers from the government the
prime minister normally meets the King
on a Wednesday at Buckingham Palace
the last few years have been difficult
for the Windsors in 2021 Prince Harry
and Meghan markle's interview with
American chat show host Oprah Winfrey
created ripples
the royals-based allegations of racism
the explosive interview showed Harry's
father King Charles his brother Prince
William and his grandmother the late
Queen in a less than flattering light
their claims plunged the monarchy into a
crisis critics of the monarchy also say
it is outdated and a waste of money
the bulk of the Royal Family's expenses
are covered by an annual taxpayer-funded
payment known as The Sovereign Grant is
the cost to the public Justified
especially at a time when the United
Kingdom is grappling with one of
Europe's worst cost of living crises
ultimately the future of the monarchy
depends on the support of the public
the new monarch has been preparing for
the crown his entire life
does he have it in him to become the
king of people's hearts

the war in Sudan as strange as it may
sound has got nothing to do with the
people of Sudan
the common people of Sudan are the
victims of this war the two military
generals who are fighting for Supremacy
in Sudan have flouted every single
ceasefire
critical infrastructure has been
targeted and life has been brought to a
standstill but the question is this who
is arming these two military Generals in
Sudan
and why is it that surrounder has just
emerged out of one of Africa's longest
and bloodiest civil wars that ended with
the creation of South Sudan in 2011 has
again plunged into another civil war in
2023.
a ceasefire should result in a temporary
suspension of fighting but in Sudan each
ceasefire is being manipulated by the
head-butting generals to gain some
advantage
resulting in Greater violence on the
streets the Sudanese Army is using heavy
air power to bomb rsf positions in
densely populated heart 2.
thick plumes of smoke are visible from
miles around almost every shop is
shocked
and with widespread shortage of
essential supplies there are reports of
shops supermarkets and even Banks being
lutoned
fuel stations are running dry most
neighborhoods have been without power
for days Sudanese people caught up in
this fighting are being forced to make a
difficult choice either to stay on and
hope that the fighting ends soon or flee
from their homes to a safer place
we were forced to come here because of
the fighting in cartoons we had to run
as quickly as possible because of the
war it was difficult Journey we wanted
to stay with our relatives here because
we have suffered alone
more than a hundred thousand people have
fled from Sudan in the last 20 days over
350
000 are internally displaced regular
checkpoints have been set up by both the
Sudanese Army and the rsf in areas where
they control
people coming from Khartoum who are
escaping the world and trying to find
Safety and Security arrive here under
very difficult circumstances some people
who have passed through here don't have
food some are sick and some are very old
Sudan hundreds of families are camping
at a makeshift Center hoping for a
chance to board a plane or even a ship
nobody could ever wish this upon anyone
not their enemies not themselves I hope
everyone can eventually come back and
all these problems are solved nobody
really wants to leave their country and
that is why I hope things get better
soon and everyone comes home
but when with the fighting end in Sudan
not anytime soon because both generals
are being bucked and armed by powerful
Western faucets
the rebel paramilitary group called The
rsf is being provided with
surface-to-air missiles and other
Ammunition by the Wagner mercenary group
Libya's General Khalifa has thrown his
way to behind the rsf leader Muhammad
hamdan de gallo
according to open source intelligence
Russia is pumping in weapons from its
Syrian Latakia Air Base into the crib
al-tom camp in Sudan all this with
stopovers at the Libyan air bases of
al-qadim and al-jufra which are
currently under the control of halifah
General Abdel fatah al-burhan is
friendly with Egypt
with an eye river flowing from Sudan
into Egypt and with Ethiopia's ambitious
Renaissance done being a major
Flashpoint in the region Cairo has major
stakes in shaping the developments that
happen in heart too
South Sudan seceded from Sudan after a
protracted Civil War that raged on for
over two decades in which an estimated 2
million people are said to have been
killed South Sudan took with it its Rich
oil fields leaving Sudan poorer and
dependent on agriculture and gold
exports
the rsf General hamdan de gallo also
known as hemeti has got into several
Marquee deals for the export of gold
with mercenary groups such as Wagner it
is a combination of these factors that
has pushed Sudan deep into another
protracted Civil War

s don't kill people
kill people
this is the slogan of the National Rifle
Association of America and a line that
is parroted by those who wish to
purchase and keep guns with them
but three incidents on two separate
continents must drill some common sense
into the program lobbies around the
world
that without access to guns it is not
easy for people to kill other people
the Serbia this week has been
unprecedented mass shootings
a 13 year old boy who decided to pull
the trigger on his classmates inside of
his classroom
where a 21 year old in Serbia again who
drove around in his car shooting people
at random
and in the United States of America the
nation that is notorious as the
epicenter of Civilian Marsh shootings
a man pulled the trigger on his
neighbors just because he was told to
stop shooting in his yard as that was
disturbing the sleep of an one-month-old
infant
what will it take for those who are
addicted to buying and owning guns to
realize
that without easy access to guns the
bloodletting due to mass shootings will
not happen
eight students and a security guard were
killed in a school shooting in Belgrade
on the 3rd of May the rare shooting
occurred at 8 40 a.m at an elementary
school in belgrade's downtown for crowd
District
the 13 year old assailant identified as
Costa catchmanovic himself called the
police and was arrested in the
schoolyard
in the meticulously planned attack in
the works for a month the teenager had
drawn detailed maps of the classrooms
and prepared a kill list of students he
intended to shoot dead
shocked by the Carnage the Serbian
president labeled it as one of the most
difficult days in recent Serbian history
this day is one of the most difficult in
the modern history of our country
Serbia is unfortunately United in grief
this grief is so great that we do not
remember a greater one
mass shootings are extremely rare and an
unheard of phenomenon in the Balkan
Nation with no mass shootings reported
at Serbian schools in recent years
but Serbia like the United States is a
wash with guns left over from the wars
of the 1990s although purchasing a
firearm requires a special permit in
Serbia the 13 year old assailant was
armed with two pistols one in his
backpack and the one that he used both
the guns used in the shooting spree were
owned by the assailant's father who was
also arrested later
some media reports attributed bullying
as a possible motive but no conclusions
have been made
I feel disappointed and I have a lot of
questions where are we as human beings
where is our empathy where did we all
fail to see the problem both with the
person who did this and with all the
other people that have led this to
happen
what for the last few decades had been
rare in Serbia was repeated immediately
the next day
a 21 year old gunman identified by his
initials UB armed with an automatic
weapon opened fire from a moving vehicle
before fleeing
the shooting spree in which at least
eight people were killed and 14 wounded
spread across three separate Villages
near ladenovac
the drive by shooting suspect was
arrested early on Friday after a
night-long Manhunt by hundreds of police
a nation's scarred by Wars but
unaccustomed to mass shootings has now
been thrust uncomfortably into the
spotlight
in the United States where mass
shootings are rather alarmingly frequent
a seemingly banal interaction turned
into yet another tragedy
on the 28th of April in Houston Texas
Francisco oropeza a 39 year old Mexican
national was requested by his neighbors
to stop shooting his semi-automatic
rifle in his yard because the noise was
keeping their baby awake
infuriated at this innocuous request he
stormed the Crowded House of his
Honduran neighbors and shot five of them
dead execution style including an
eight-year-old child
he was later arrested after a massive
four-day Manhunt in a neighboring town
separated by geography and modus
operandi these two incidents are similar
in the way the assailants could easily
access guns
here's some food for thought in a world
where assault weapons are not so readily
available would we still witness such
horrific attacks so frequently
[Music]
147 villagers including 28 women and 45
children were massacred in Burkina Faso
on the 20th of April
the figure is more than twice the
official figure of 60 deaths
survivors interestingly blamed the
Burkina Bay Security Forces for the
Carnage
the burkinaabe military government
though has condemned the barbaric act
and is urged for a full inquiry the sum
out of the opinion that the terrorist
attack in the burkinaabe Army fatigues
could have carried out the attack
one of the world's most volatile
countries Burkina Faso has been battling
islamist Insurgency for close to a
decade
another full and impartial inquiry has
been called the question is this
will the perpetrators behind this
gruesome Massacre be brought to Justice
in one of the worst attacks on civilians
in the West African nation of Burkina
Faso 136 people were massacred in the
northern Village of karma on the 20th of
April armed men dressed in fatigues of
the burkina's Armed Forces reportedly
slaughtered the unsuspecting villagers
in a Carnage that lasted for more than
six hours survivors of the massacre had
a press conference about a week later
blamed the burkinabe's security forces
for The Killing
20th around 7am I was at the well
washing my clothes
we saw many motorcycles coming followed
by big trucks some people said we had to
run away I said that it was not
necessary because they are our military
and not jihadists their job is to
investigate to find the jihadists and
liberate our country
indeed the villagers welcomed them with
respect and shouts of Joy
The Joy was short-lived as more than a
hundred died in the ensuing Carnage
including babies in the back of their
fleeting mothers
babies died on the back of their
executed mothers the Carnage lasted more
than six hours before the soldiers left
the village of dinguiri the survivors
were able to leave after their departure
while some of the Wounded were
transported to the regional hospital of
waigoya by the survivors others could
not be evacuated and succumbed to their
injuries
11 more were killed the same day by
assailants six Integrity Village two in
many and three on the road between
oyhuga and barga the toll is likely to
climb higher considering information is
still awaited from some villages in the
area
especially noteworthy is the timing of
the bloodbath that followed a jihadist
attack on the 15th of April that attack
claimed the lives of 40 burkinaba troops
and volunteer auxiliaries in the same
region
according to Survivor accounts the
assailants suspected the karma villagers
of Sheltering terrorists and hence the
blowback were kinabi Armed Forces for
close to a decade have been battling an
islamist Insurgency by groups affiliated
with Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State who
are believed to have infiltrated from
neighboring Mali since 2015. more than
ten thousand civilians and members of
the security forces have been killed in
the conflict since then at least 2
million people have been internally
displaced the mounting toll precipitated
two military coups last year the most
recent of which was on 30th of September
when 34 year old Ibrahim traure seized
power in one of the world's most
impoverished countries at least 40
percent of the country lies outside the
government control
but is this heavy-handed and rash
approach the rightful course of action
to reign in members of Terror groups and
to recapture lost territory

there is no such thing in life as easy

we've been told this many a time but
some people don't seem to remember it
at least that's what the latest scam
suggests
and
fraud is doing the rounds online cyber
criminals are approaching users on
various social media platforms
they offer a part-time job the task is
simple like videos on YouTube and make
money it could be one dollar per like or
two dollars
some users immediately become suspicious
of such messages and don't entertain
these offers others fall for them
as you agree to take further
instructions from the person on the
other side of the chat window the scam
begins like other frauds the ultimate
goal here is to rob you of your
hard-earned money
do you know what's different here the
scam has been designed in such a
sophisticated way that you don't lose
your money immediately instead you are
paid for liking the YouTube videos
initially
you earn money and scammers earn your
trust
then comes the Second Step miscreants
try to convince people to invest their
money in crypto schemes what they
promise in return is high interest rates
some people agree to do so and what
happens next they lose their money
A woman from the Indian city of Puna has
been a victim in the process she lost 24
lakh rupees which is approximately
thirty thousand dollars
the same online fraud has been reported
in other Indian cities as well such as
Lucknow and gurugram
this leads us to an important question
what can be done to prevent such
fraudulent activities
firstly if you're watching this report
you are aware of this scam by now so if
someone approaches you with such an
offer block the number secondly if
someone offers you other types of
part-time jobs check the authenticity of
the caller by researching about the
company he is representing thirdly never
share your bank details with an unknown
person
last but not least if any offer appears
too good to be true it's probably a scam
so watch out for such messages and deals

are on the rise they're everywhere
we've seen them deliver Parcels cook
food and serve drinks
but the new age robots can now do a lot
more than we can perhaps imagine here
are some of them
[Music]
the first one on our list is an
autonomous two-wheeled robot developed
by acento robotics
what does it do it acts as a security
guard a central robot guards are now
patrolling several sites in Switzerland
they provide an added layout of security
and enhance operational efficiency the
robot can navigate rough terrain bumps
steps and even snow with its off-road
tires
according to the company's robot guards
allow a single human security guard to
efficiently cover large outdoor areas
that would require significant manpower
to patrol in person the robot features a
thermal camera that detects people and
vehicles its 360 degree camera can
capture images of its surroundings
the robot can communicate via a live
feed with a backup operator in a control
center it can maintain records as well
which means the robot is able to produce
automatic daily security reports we
chose to go for the security Market
because this is a place where it's
really difficult to find people nowadays
they have to work long hours and they
have to work in every weather conditions
we did this job ourselves and it's
really brutal
and we wanted to help there and our
robots are able to make the life of
these cards a lot easier
over the last few years Boston Dynamics
has deployed over a thousand robots to
various sites and now its robot is
coming in handy in the Paris underground
Metro the company's dog-like robot is
helping the workers repair the 100 year
old Regional Railway Network the
Administration has bought the robot for
around 110 000 it even has a French name
Percival
the bot can inspect hard to reach and
hazardous areas it has a 360 degree
camera with an infrared sensor
the camera allows it to capture accurate
thermal and visual data
before Percival either we don't go in
there or we were going but putting the
Workers Health at risk so thanks to
Percival we can go and the workers
remain safe and we can monitor the sites
that we couldn't necessarily monitor
before

what you see on your screen is a lung
transplant being carried out in a
hospital in Spain what's interesting is
that the surgeon is a forearmed robot
his name is DaVinci
the robot is using a pioneering
technique with him Da Vinci cuts a small
section of the patient's skin and muscle
to remove the damaged lung
it then inserts a new one through an
eight centimeter incision in the lower
part of the sternum surgeons at the
hospital say that this new procedure is
less painful for the patient it's also
safer than the traditional method which
requires a 30 centimeter incision

New York City recently had a parking
garage collapse in lower Manhattan the
garage was too unstable for New York
City Fire Department Personnel to enter
so they sent in a dog that goes where
humans can't meet Berg the four-legged
robot dog
he initiated the search and rescue
operation of the collapsed building how
by using its thermal camera while
looking for people who may be trapped a
task too risky for First Responders at
the time
for the first time in history FDNY NYPD
responded with multiple air
and ground robots working together to
prevent the loss of life it was the
first time the FDNY put his robot dog
Burke into action the building was too
dangerous for personnel to enter soberg
went into the building instead
using his thermal camera
our robot teams were able to determine
that no other person or no other
individual was trapped and also inspect
the building structural components
[Music]
the next one on our list is a shark
don't worry it's a robotic one it's
being used to eat plastic waste in
London's Thames River an effort to clean
up plastic pollution in the area
the waste shark gobbles up to 22 700
plastic bottles per day
The Aquatic Droid is London's first
Marine robot designed to remove Water
waste it can also collect data on the
water quality during its surveying time
the world as we know it is changing and
robots are playing a key role by
allowing machines to take over redundant
and dangerous tasks humans may be able
to focus on more creative and fulfilling
work while some see the rise of robots
as a cause for concern others see it as
an opportunity

been denied by Washington and which has
said that Ukraine a Ukrainian sabotage
has reached unprecedented momentum
that's the allegation that's coming from
Moscow Russia has said that it reserves
the right to retaliate and hardliners
including former president
have said that it should now physically
eliminate Vladimir zelinsky so that is
the shrilling of rhetoric that's coming
from Moscow now dubbing U.S as The
Mastermind the Kremlin spokesperson has
said that and I quote that decisions on
such attacks are not made in Kiev but in
Washington so that's what's happening at
the moment uh Kiev only does what it is
told to do that is what Kremlin is
saying that such decisions are taken in
Washington and not keep so a big charge
coming there from Kremlin now White
House has denied this allegation of
masterminding the Kremlin drone attack
they have said that this is just a
blatant bold lie White House saying that
U.S is not involved in the incident in
any way so U.S denying that attack so
what is Moscow saying Moscow is saying
that West is leading a war against
Russia by proxy that's an allegation
that Moscow has maintained for a long
time now that West is leading this war
against Russia by proxy now there's a
reaction coming in from the European
Union as well European Union foreign
policy Chief's message for Russia do not
use this as an excuse to escalate the
conflict that's the danger at the moment
escalation of possible escalation of the
conflict will Moscow use this as an
excuse to escalate the conflict we'll be
analyzing that in a bit more detail but
let's move on on now Putin has spent a
working day at the Kremlin just after
that alleged drone attack in Kremlin
Moscow has flagged what is what it is
calling an unprecedented wave of
sabotage now what is this apparent
sabotage attacks there have been trains
derailed by explosions there have been
two train derailments in this week
itself in two days on Monday and Tuesday
on Monday in fact an explosion uh caused
a train to derail and Catch Fire near
your neck and then on Tuesday there was
another train derailment an explosive
device derailed a Russian freight train
in a region bordering Ukraine so there
has been trained derailment and they've
been let's go back to the previous page
they've been massive fires in annexed
Crimea as well that's also what Moscow
is flagging as part of an unprecedented
wave of sabotage massive fires in NX
Crimea let's give you a little bit a
little bit more detail on that a
suspected drone hit an oil Depot in
Crimea and caused a huge Blaze and power
lines were blown up near Saint
Petersburg so that is also what Moscow
is claiming as part of an unprecedented
wave of sabotage now all this is coming
remember before the big holiday in
Moscow in Russia
Russia prepare is preparing to mark one
of its main holidays on the 9th of May
what is why is that significant this is
a victory day that marks the Soviet win
over the Nazis in the second world war
so there's been a wave of so-called on a
sabotage attacks that Moscow is claiming
ahead of this main Victory Day
Celebrations now lastly now after this
drone attack the alleged drone attack at
the Kremlin which Moscow says was an
attempt on radimir Putin's life they
have now opened a terrorism probe that
has now opened into that attack so this
is what is happening the shrilling of
rhetoric will this lead to something
bigger let's go across to Our Guest uh
uh who is who is joining us we are being
joined by Charles a caption senior
fellow Council on Foreign Relations and
professor of international Affairs at
Georgetown University thanks very much
sir for speaking with vion
happy to join you so uh I want to talk
to you about this ramping of rhetoric
from Moscow blaming Washington for the
Kremlin drone attack now with the facts
that are in public domain at the moment
and the strategies that you've analyzed
of both Russia Kiev NATO Washington
is this just aggressive posturing you
know to win a battle of perception by
Moscow or can it lead to a possible
escalation something much more bigger as
EU foreign policy Chief is worried about
well there isn't a lot of hard
information in the public domain one
would have thought that if the Russians
have hard evidence that these drones
flew from Ukraine were under the
direction of the Ukrainian government
that they would disclose that
information for example intercepts of
communications flight path of the Drone
there has been no such disclosure of
information and as a consequence I think
one has to view with skepticism the
Russian claimed that this was Ukraine
and that this is part of a campaign of
sabotage for two different reasons I
would be very surprised if Ukraine was
behind the attack number one they're
focused on the offensive which is soon
to begin they want to use their military
capability to get back territory doesn't
make sense for them to provoke Russia by
hitting the Kremlin and secondly the
Kremlin has said that the U.S is behind
this attack the U.S has been won't
telling the ukrainians not to take shots
against Russian territory it would not
be in the interests of the United States
to see an escalation so right now I
think the kremlin's claims simply lack
credibility
right right so also given these
developments what options do you think
both sides are left with what would it
take for the two sides to come to the
negotiating table
I think the negotiating table is rather
far off the ukrainians are about to
launch their offensive the Russians have
been fighting for the last few months
further north around Bak moot neither
side seems ready to call it quits and
try to negotiate an end game my best
guess is we're going to see the the
offensive begin quite soon as the
weather gets warmer the mud dries up
it's easier for Ukrainian tanks and
armored vehicles to head toward the
Russian front lines I think we can
expect a bloody summer then maybe toward
the end of this fighting season when
both sides are exhausted both sides have
taken a lot more casualties it may be
possible for the US and others to try to
broker a ceasefire and a diplomatic
conversation but we are certainly not
there now

the Ukrainian president zelinski has
denied that his country carried out an
alleged drone attack on the Kremlin
which Russia says was an attempt on its
President Vladimir Putin's life
you know I I can repeat repeat this
message and I think it will at least
will be understandable for for everybody
we don't attack
Putin or Moscow
now we fight on on our territory we are
defending our religious and cities we
don't have you know enough weapon for
this that's why we don't use it any
anywhere for us that is the deficit we
can't spend it and we didn't attack
Putin
we'll leave it to Tribunal
has opened a terrorism probe after
Moscow said it had shot down two drones
at Putin's Kremlin residence in what it
called a Ukrainian Terror assassination
attempt the Kremlin has further asserted
on how it has the right to retaliate and
in the latest Moscow has launched an
attack on Ukraine's Southern Garrison
region according to Kiev at least 21
people have been killed and 48 others
wounded but at this point the bigger
question remains that is could Ukraine
have actually been responsible for this
let's decode well Ukraine has the
capability to carry out long-range
strikes inside Russia experts say that
Ukraine could use its own uj-22 drones
all the chinese-made mucine five drones
for this attack reports also suggests
that Ukraine has developed a long-range
drone capability that could reach Moscow
now here's a look at the previous drone
attacks carried out against Russia in
2023. on the night on the 29th of April
drone strike at a fuel storage facility
in the Crimean Port of sevak sport to
Paul resulted in a massive column of
fire and smoke as per the Ukrainian
officer it had 10 tanks of oil products
with a capacity of about 40 000 tons
on the 27th of March a drone struck the
town of kiriviks about 400 kilometers
from the Ukrainian border injuring three
people
on the 2nd of March two civilians were
killed and a boy was injured in the city
of Bryant in February a drone crashed in
the village of gubba stovo 100
kilometers away from Moscow the local
Governor said it was an attempt to
Target civilian infrastructure now
Russia's ex-president Dmitry Medvedev
also called for the physical elimination
of Ukraine's president called me
zelinski after Moscow off the Drone
attack on Kremlin meanwhile the leader
of Russia's Wagner group has said that
he believed a promised counter-offensive
by the Ukrainian troops had already
begun in an audio message published by
his press service he has said that the
active phase of the counter-offensive
would begin in the coming days
meanwhile the White House has said that
it cannot confirm the authenticity of
reports by Russia that it foiled an
overnight attack by the Ukrainian drones
on the Kremlin speaking at the White
House the press secretary said that the
administration is aware of the reports
but is unable to confirm the
authenticity of them at this time
so we are aware of the reports but are
unable to confirm the offensive
authenticity of them at this time and so
I don't want to get uh into speculation
from here about what happened but we are
we are indeed aware of the reports
the White House announced it will send a
new shipment of heavy artillery and
Rocket ammunition to your crane ahead of
its planned counter offensive
we'll have an announcement today uh that
from the Biden Harris Administration a
new package of security assistance to
help Ukraine continue to defend itself
on the battlefield and protect its
people against Russian aggression
and well with the tensions Rising there
is a fear of fresh escalation and we
spoke to experts from around the world
on what could be expected in the next
coming days
there is in Wartime a distinction to be
made between attacks on command and
control targets and assassination so the
difference being that command and
control targets and the pictures I've
seen showed drones exploding over the
Kremlin not in an industrial part so it
could be that this was an attack to try
to damage command and control facilities
and if Putin happens to be there then
he's uh sort of a secondary Target but
assassination is different that's to the
person not trying to damage the command
and control capabilities or facilities
but try to specifically kill that
individual
Putin is now a open enemy of many
governments so
attempt to kill him
could have been prepared but by any of
Secret Service of big countries and the
same of Ukraine Ukraine will never
accept that it prepared this in the same
way as ukrainians never admitted that
somebody tried to blow up the Crimean
Bridge
the Americans I think repeatedly say
that they and deny uh long-range
missiles and such to Ukraine to prevent
them from doing that
so I think it's it's mainly they're
they're facing west and saying we didn't
do it or we we don't know who did it so
some something Coy they don't say that
they don't deny they did it
um and I think we can pretty much assume
that they they definitely did
Ukrainian drone attacks against Rush has
increased and even recently there was a
down drone downed drone found in the
outskirts of Moscow so uh well I would
say that if this is an attack by key
it's an incredible escalation to
entirely new levels because again trying
to kill the Russian leadership is very
extreme and as moscowas stated it
reserves the right to retaliate how it
sees fit so it's quite possible that
Russia would respond in kind by
targeting the Ukrainian political
leadership
I mean Russia is using this this is this
is trying all all part of the same
package of trying to actually to get
Ukraine to come to the negotiating table
by threatening threatening things
um this is this is for the internal
audience and the American audience
um it's not going to work they're not
going to to do that what Russia is doing
are like things like the attacks on

joining us from a Washington DC thanks
very much ma'am for speaking with Beyond
thank you
there has been an accusation from
Kremlin a denial from cave but looking
at the strategies so far you know do you
think Ukraine carried this out the
alleged attempt to assassinate Putin or
do you think this is a
false flag operation by Russia
the only information we have uh about
this alleged attempt so far is that
Russia said Ukraine did it and Ukraine's
uh the Ukrainian government says it
didn't do it and unfortunately Russia
does not have a good track record of of
uh of uh accurate information I think we
all remember vividly just before Russia
invaded Ukraine uh the Russian
leadership instead Russia had no plans
of invading Ukraine so now with Russia
alleging that that this uh was a
Ukrainian attempt on uh on the life of
President Putin I'm pretty sure nobody
will believe Russia because they so of
the Russian leadership so often lies and
so while we have no information at the
moment the U.S government other
governments have no inference at the
moment virtually
everybody will draw the conclusion that
Russia has uh circulated falsehoods yet
again
right absolutely in fact I was just
going to come to this how do you see
this impacting the ongoing war in
Ukraine one of course and also Russia
said that it has the right to retaliate
what can we expect on that front do you
reckon this is just another free tax for
another offensive in Ukraine
you raise two very important points
there uh this uh incident uh gives
Russia the opportunity to
expand further expand its war against
Ukraine now it's already full-blown War
but it could for example uh increase its
uh focus on on trying to to uh kill
President zielinski now he's already
under massive threats and and obviously
uh has traveled with bodyguards at any
time of the day and night but I think
this could give Russia an opportunity
this alleged incident which mostly like
most likely wasn't conducted by Ukraine
but it would give Russia the opportunity
in the public eye in Russia to further
expand its aggression towards uh
particular
leading Personalities in Ukraine now we
could also see it we can also see it as
an attempt to to uh create uh separation
between Ukraine and its Western allies

this we have with us our principal
diplomatic correspondent siddhan sibal
joining us from Goa now Sudan thank you
so much for joining us what can you tell
us of the key bilaterals that have been
scheduled for the day what can we expect
well today we will see arrivals of the
various foreign ministers in including
of course the Russian foreign minister
who has just landed in Goa we know that
there are four bilateral slated for the
Indian external Affairs ministers
including with the Russian and the
Chinese counterpart when we talk about
the Chinese uh bilateral uh which the
Indian external affairs minister will be
having we know uh that relationship
between the two countries have seen a
steep fall since the galwan incident of
2020 and since then we have seen while
the Chinese side has been claiming the
situation is stable at the border the
Indian side has been reminding publicly
and of course privately as well that
relationship remains abnormal and as
long as China continues to violate the
parks and the Border continues to amass
troops at the border situation will
remain like that and we do not expect a
breakthrough during this bilateral here
in Goa in fact last week we saw the
Indian then the Chinese defense
ministers meeting in Delhi and the
Divergence in the position were known
given the fact that how the statements
were issued and statement basically uh
gave a picture which was different to
what the other side was saying now when
it comes to Russia uh relationship has
been doing well but there are few issues
as well which is the trade deficit which
has been arising because of India's
increased import from Russia increase
import of Russian energy and this is
something that the Indian external
affairs minister had raised during his
meeting with the Russian Deputy Prime
Minister recently intelligence almost
two weeks ago and I do expect during
today's bilateral as well this will be
something that will be talked about
good morning those Serene Waters behind
you is a perfect backdrop for hectic
diplomatic negotiations that are
expected today uh when those bilaterals
happen you know I want to ask you about
uh
Dari who is visiting India after many
years Pakistani foreign minister is uh
visiting India now take us through the
Optics of that and the significance of
that visit both for India and Pakistan
yeah
well uh it's after the decade that uh
Pakistani foreign minister is visiting
India almost like 2011 we saw uh Hina
Rabbani card then foreign minister of
Pakistan visiting uh Delhi uh this time
of course the focus is the Shanghai
cooperation organization's meeting which
begins tomorrow but essentially uh the
Indian side has made it clear that there
will be no structured bilateral with the
Pakistani side last week we saw the
Indian external affairs minister Dr
Shankar saying that crossbar terrorism
remains a big issue and this is a clear
message to Islamabad ahead of the
Pakistani foreign Minister's visit to
government essentially the Optics and of
course the fact that the Pakistani
foreign minister will be present here in
Goa is something that will be making
news in fact there's a large contingent
of Pakistani journalists and of course
diplomats as well who will be present
along with him the big question is will
he do a press conference and how does he

The prosecutors will soon decide if hunter ...",2023-05-04T03:29:32Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L4uob8efFec/hqdefault.jpg,"all right the other big Story coming out
of United States the four-year probe
into Hunter Biden Second Son of Joe
Biden is nearing an end the prosecutors
will soon decide if Hunter Biden will be
charged for tax and gun related
violations right and according to Media
reports Biden's lawyers also met at the
Justice Department headquarters in
Washington last week Hunter Biden's
lawyers discussed the matter with U.S
attorney David Weiss of Delaware this
kind of meeting it typically comes
towards the end of an investigation
yes usually at these meetings defense
lawyers urge prosecutors not to seek an
indictment of their client or they seek
reduced charges last year federal agents
decided that they had enough evidence to
charge Hunter Biden with tax crimes and
making a false statement related to a
gun purchase
however the prosecutors are yet to file
charges against Hunter Biden the probe
into Hunter Biden it began back in 2018
Ruiz it was mainly on his finances
related to overseas business ties and
Consulting work
yes soon the probes the focus shifted to
whether he failed to report all of his
income it also extended to whether he
lied on a form to purchase a gun by
denying that he was a drug abuser onto
Biden's battle with addiction became a
focal point of Republican attacks during
the 2020 presidential elections
right and as per sources U.S attorney is
nearing the end of his decision-making
process here they said that the
four-year probe could slow down again
before reaching a decision and any
decision here could have an effect on
Joe Biden's campaign Reports say
Republicans will try to tie Hunter
Biden's legal votes directly to his
father so more trouble there for Joe
Biden looming there meanwhile on
Wednesday Congress received an
unclassified whistleblower disclosure it
allegedly States the FBI possesses a
recording of Joe Biden linking him to a
criminal bribery scheme with a foreign
National from when he was vice president
the FBI has also been subpoenaed to
submit documents in connection with this
however the White House has downplayed
the issue stating Biden's record here is
clean
this week my Administration
now for more on this we were earlier
joined by correspondent Susan therani
from New York who actually takes us
through how this particular case against
Joe Biden's son has developed so let's
just listen into that yes
the culmination of four years of
Investigation May finally be coming to
an end as the Washington Post is
reporting that a prosecutors May soon
decide whether or not to charge
President Joe Biden's son Hunter
regarding attacks and gun related
violations however the paper notes that
it's not clear when this will happen
it's also important to note that back in
October of 2022 Federal investigators
said that they had enough evidence to
charge Hunter Biden regarding these two
cases however the case fell into the
hands of U.S attorney for Delaware David
Wise an appointee of a former president
Donald Trump and he will be the one
making the decision Merrick Garland when
asked about this case said that he has
full faith in the decision that David
Wise will ultimately make
so Hunter Biden case haunting Joe Biden
yet again right and there was another
development on Wednesday where an
unclassified whistleblower disclosure
received by the Congress has allegedly
revealed that the FBI possesses a record
linking former Vice President Joe Biden
to a criminal bribery scheme with the
foreign National here's Susan reporting
on that
house oversight chair James Comer has
dramatically escalated his investigation
into President Joe Biden with this
subpoena on Wednesday to the FBI a
citing quote-unquote broad outlines of a
highly credible whistleblower complaint
the summon for documents is Comer's most
direct attempt in bringing the current
president in after
largely focusing his investigation on
the president's son Hunter Biden and
other Biden family members the oversight
chair and a Senator Chuck Grassley who
has been also investigating Hunter Biden
and the Biden of family in a separate
letter to the FBI said that the FBI does
have material quote outlining an alleged
criminal scheme involving then Vice
President Biden and a foreign National
relating to the exchange of money for
policy decisions the GOP has always made
clear that the investigation into the
Biden family ultimately its aim is to
see whether or not President Joe Biden
was compromised or not the FBI has
confirmed that they have received this
letter and the White House has responded
by playing doubt this incident saying
that the current president's record is
clear for everyone to see

on the 8th of September 2022 thousands
gathered outside Buckingham Palace in
central London
[Music]
there was an absolute silence when the
flag was lowered to half-mast Buckingham
Palace has announced the death of of her
majesty Queen Elizabeth II in a
statement the palace said the queen died
peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon
they lamented the passing of Britain's
longest-serving Monarch she died
peacefully at her home at Balmoral
Castle in Scotland at the age of 96.
[Music]
Queen Elizabeth II reigned for 70 years
7 months and two days
though her Reign was frequently
overshadowed by scandals involving her
family The Sovereign was praised for her
Devotion to duty
[Music]
Queen Elizabeth II's death marked the
end of an era
it also snapped the link between
Britain's Imperial past and the modern
world a world where the royal family is
now struggling to stay relevant how long
will the UK monarchy last
[Music]
relevance is absolutely crucial to the
monarchy the big threat to the future of
the House of Windsor is not mobs
storming the gate it's it's it's not
Revolution it's it's becoming irrelevant
and they understand that you've got to
the queen always used to say we have to
be seen to be believed they have to play
a part in National Life
foreign
[Music]
died Buckingham Palace had a plan in
place for the Queen's funeral
[Music]
it was codenamed Operation London Bridge
the operation provided plans for
services and succession
[Music]
of happy men
to come our only lawful and rightful
angel
[Music]
upon the passing away of Queen Elizabeth
II The Throne was passed to her eldest
son Charles the former Prince of Wales
it was done without any formal ceremony
as per the laws of British succession
[Music]
British law specifies that the heir to
the throne becomes king or queen
immediately after the death of the
previous monarch so that there is no
period without a reigning king or queen
the official process of ascending the
throne began on the 10th of September
2022 two days after the death of Queen
Elizabeth II
however the coronation of King Charles
was planned for the 6th of May 2023 at
Westminster Abbey eight months after the
queen passed away
why is it that Charles's coronation
ceremony is taking place months after he
ascended the throne is there a reason
and what exactly is a coronation
ceremony let's find out
[Music]
a coronation is both the symbolic
religious ceremony during which a
sovereign is crowned and the physical
act of placing a crown on a Monarch's
head
it is a one thousand year old tradition
with Archbishop of Canterbury oversees
the ceremony
the date for coronation is set several
months after a monarch dies this is to
ensure appropriate time is provided for
Mourning
[Music]
the crowning of a new monarch is meant
to be a celebratory occasion and so it
would be inappropriate to hold the
ceremony while morning continues this
interval gives the planners enough time
to complete the elaborate Arrangements
required
[Music]
that is why Queen Elizabeth II also sat
on the throne 16 months later on the 2nd
of June 1953 even though her father King
George VI died on the 6th of February
1952.
[Music]
King Charles's coronation will formalize
the Monarch's role as the head of the
Church of England and mark the transfer
of titles and Powers it will be the
first coronation the United Kingdom will
be seeing in 17 long years
meet Joyce Lewis she is part of a small
section of people that attended the last
coronation in Britain in 1953 Back in
the Day Lewis and Friends camped out on
the mall the Avenue leading to
Buckingham Palace to watch the
coronation procession of Queen Elizabeth
II Lewis has some vivid memories of the
event
the thing I do remember was the queen
had a bouquet I think of probably
orchids there were white flowers on her
lap and as she went past these flowers
were just shaking very gently showing
what they were feeling really in a way
but the flowers stuck in my memory
because then of course when she came
back she had the orb and the scepter
Lewis just turned 90 exactly eight days
before the coronation of King Charles
as someone who has witnessed the British
Monarchy from early on she has pinned
her hopes on King Charles I feel he's
had a long wait for it but I feel he's
somebody who will do his best
and I think that's all a person can do I
think I think he's matured a lot
and from when he was younger and he's I
think grown into a very fine person and
one that can be trusted to fulfill all
that's required of a king in these very
challenging days far more than his
mother faced I would think
Joyce Lewis may seem optimistic about
the new monarch
but the anti-monarchist movement in
Britain is also gaining momentum
these protesters have publicly
challenged King Charles's accession to
the throne and the institution that he
heads holding the signboards not my king
the supporters of Republic a group
founded in 1983 that campaigns for an
elected head of state are planning their
biggest ever protest they believe their
best chance of ending the monarchy is
right now yeah I think the monarchy is
in a lot of trouble because uh you know
they've lost their star player support
is clearly going down
interest is going down and that's a big
problem for them so enthusiasm for the
coronation is about nine percent the big
difference isn't so much Charles himself
but the fact that he's not the queen and
the queen was the monarchy for so many
people and they were willing to suspend
this belief and to suspend judgment and
they now that she's not there she's no
longer there to protect the monarchy and
we're seeing an immediate drop in
support and a distinct lack of interest
in the big ceremonial which is all
they've got
according to a survey conducted by the
anti-monarchy campaign group 35 percent
of people were against the monarchy in
2022 as opposed to 45 percent of people
in 2023 clearly indicates the declining
support for the Royal Family
in fact King Charles's coronation has
already scaled down with a shorter
ceremony and 2 000 guests while the late
Queen's lavish event had more than 8 000
people
does it imply that the British Monarchy
is slowly becoming Irrelevant in today's
world
who is the new monarch what is his past
and how popular is the monarchy under
King Charles let's break it down
[Music]
Charles was born on the 14th of November
1948 at Buckingham Palace the firstborn
son of Elizabeth and Philip he received
a 41-gun salute in Hyde Park
he was just four years old when his
mother Queen Elizabeth II was crowned as
Queen
[Music]
and it was in 1969 that he was first
exposed to the Royal roles he would
eventually discharge as Britain's King
[Music]
that year at the age of 20 he was
invested by the queen as Prince of Wales
at Canaveral Castle he served in the
British royal Air Force and Royal Navy
while also enjoying a comfortable life
marked with playing Polo and doing
charity work
[Music]
[Music]
to Lady Diana Spencer more popularly
known as Lady Diana started a very
controversial chapter of his life
so long as you both shall live I will in
1981 at the age of 32 he tied the knot
with the 20 year old Diana Spencer a
school teacher in London they had first
met in 1977 when Charles was reportedly
courting Diana's Sister Sarah Spencer
Charles eventually parted ways with
Sarah and went on to marry Diana
they're Larger than Life wedding took
place at Saint Paul's Cathedral in
London an event that was seen by a
global television audience of about 750
million across 74 countries
in Britain even a public holiday was
declared to Mark the cheerful occasion
[Music]
a year later they welcomed a newborn son
William
three years later in 1984 they were
blessed with another son Harry
he said a president by being the first
Royal father to be present at his
children's births
but familial Bliss soon faded away and
their marriage began faltering
[Music]
Prince Charles was allegedly involved in
an affair with Camilla Parker Bowles
he had met Camilla about a decade before
getting married to Diana but the two had
to part ways and their romance ended
Princess Diana was aware of this affair
even famously hinting at it in a 1995
interview saying there were three of us
in this marriage so it was a bit crowded
do you think Mrs Parker Bowles was a
factor in the breakdown of your marriage
well there were three of us in this
marriage so it was a bit crowded
the cracks in their marriage started
becoming more evident in their glum
public appearances a month later the
shocking news of their separation was
announced to the British Parliament but
matters only got worse from there
93 come
for transcript of
telephonic conversation between Prince
Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles was
published by the UK paper the people
the six-minute intimate conversation
sent shock waves throughout the royal
family it exposed the relationship
between the two while Prince Charles was
still married to Lady Diana
Prince Charles faced even more turbulent
Waters the following year in 1994 his
Infamous interview with John dimbleby
came out in which he publicly confessed
to having cheated on Diana did you try
to be faithful and honorable to your
wife when you took on the vow of
marriage yes absolutely
and you were yes
until it became
irretrievably broken down
the pair ultimately divorced in 1996 but
Diana's popularity continued to remain
unaffected
I think it was inevitable that when
chance became king there a lot of the
person's self would come back to haunt
him
we know a huge amount about him of a
very personal nature stuff that he in no
way would want us to know and uh you
know I'm talking specifically about TV
interviews in the 1990s and a series of
recorded telephone conversations that
were leaked to newspapers of a most
personal nature
but what happened next took the entire
world
a year after their divorce on the 31st
of August 1997 Lady Diana was killed in
a car crash in Paris
her death had a moving impact on the
people world over who struggled to come
to terms with what felt like a personal
loss to them
[Music]
the Diana had indeed left the world as
the queen of people's hearts
[Music]
please
[Music]
in 2005 eight years after the death of
Diana Prince Charles finally tied the
knot with Camilla Parker Bowles who had
been long blamed for his bailed marriage
with Diana
interestingly Camilla decided not to use
the Princess of Wales title which had
been used by Diana
instead she chose the Duchess of
Cornwall styling herself on her
husband's other title the Duke of
Cornwall
[Music]
and in 2022 this happened in a message
marking the 70th anniversary of her
Reign the queen said she wants Camilla
to be known as Queen consort when Prince
Charles becomes king
at the age of 74 King Charles succeeded
Queen Elizabeth II following a lifetime
of scrutiny as Britain's longest serving
Heir Apparent in the Years leading to
his accession Charles has hit headlines
for all the wrong reasons many times
over
here are a few of the controversies that
King Charles quartered over the years
in 2005 King Charles committed a
diplomatic blunder and shook hands with
the Zimbabwean president and dictator
Robert Mugabe the incident took place
during the funeral of Pope John Paul II
and a day before his marriage to Camilla
at the time was an outcast the European
Union had banned him for rigging
parliamentary poles
in 2017 the paradise papers were
released by The International Consortium
of investigative journalists
it made public its investigation into
how the world's rich and famous stashed
their wealth offshore
the name of King Charles III cropped up
among those who stashed their wealth in
safe tax Havens
in June last year the Sunday Times
reported that King Charles accepted 3
million euros from Qatari prime minister
sheikhandan bin jasim bin Jabar
al-tahani as donations to his charitable
fund between 2011 and 2015.
[Music]
the critics said it raised serious
concerns about the future King's
personal judgment
also last year King Charles vented his
frustration over a leaking pin during a
signing ceremony in Northern Ireland
the new monarch initially wrote down the
wrong date as he signed a visitor's book
in front of cameras at belfast's
Hillsborough Castle before his pen
started leaking ink
earlier this year King Charles's son
Prince Harry released his Memoir spare
the book revealed several private
confrontations between him and other
senior Royals and the details of his
split from the family many reports also
claim that the book ruined the
reputation of the royal domain such
unending Royal Rifts only raised
questions about Prince Charles and the
monarchy
[Music]
and then there's the larger question
what does the British Monarchy actually
do
although the king or queen is the head
of state their powers are only
ceremonial
the Monarch remains politically neutral
he receives daily dispatches from the
government the prime minister normally
meets the King on a Wednesday at
Buckingham Palace
the last few years have been difficult
for the Windsors in 2021 Prince Harry
and Meghan markle's interview with
American chat show host Oprah Winfrey
created ripples
the royals-based allegations of racism
the explosive interview showed Harry's
father King Charles his brother Prince
William and his grandmother the late
Queen in a less than flattering light
their claims plunged the monarchy into a
crisis critics of the monarchy also say
it is outdated and a waste of money
the bulk of the Royal Family's expenses
are covered by an annual taxpayer-funded
payment known as The Sovereign Grant is
the cost to the public Justified
especially at a time when the United
Kingdom is grappling with one of
Europe's worst cost of living crises
ultimately the future of the monarchy
depends on the support of the public
the new monarch has been preparing for
the crown his entire life
does he have it in him to become the
king of people's hearts

the 1962 war with India the pla reached
out to Nepal to recruit korka soldiers
Kathmandu refused but will it agreed
this time
you should not be surprised if Kathmandu
says yes and I'll tell you why I say
that
number one because of the existing
tensions with the Indian army
number two the unhappiness with the pay
being offered by the British army
and number three the current political
situation in Nepal
let's just go through these points one
by one
we're starting with what's happening in
the Indian army wizaved the gorkha
soldiers
in June 2022 India approved the
agneepath scheme
it changed the recruitment process for
the Indian Armed Forces by Paving the
way for recruiting Talent at a young age
and retiring three-fourth of the batch
every four years
but the new scheme have no provision for
a pension and this did not sit well with
the youth in Nepal why is that
because so far the Indian army was a
lucrative career option for The Nepalese
youths the Indian army paid them 2.5
times of what the Nepalese Army pays
there was pension on top of that also
job security
and the option to settle in India
there are some 126 000 goldcar
pensioners of the Indian army in Nepal
and they bring to Nepal around 620
million dollars in remuneration which is
three percent of Nepal's GDP and more
than Nepal's defense budget
but the Nepalese youths who will be
joining the Indian army now
will not have these books like their
Indian counterpart
counterparts the two will not be offered
a pension
and Nepal is unhappy
months after the agneepath scheme was
announced Nepal's then defense minister
and Deputy Prime Minister bhim rawal
told The Nepalese Parliament that the
scheme violated the tripartite treaty
which one you ask
the memorandum of agreement on
recruitment of gorkha troops
it was signed on the 1st of May 1947
between India and Nepal
raval called for the cancellation of the
treaty
and the results by the way are for
everyone to see
this year not a single Nepalese youth is
joining the Army
the question is whether China is
exploiting this very situation
and before we answer that let's just go
back to point number two
another reason why golcar soldiers may
end up in the pla is because that they
are unhappy is because they are unhappy
with the British army unlike the Indian
army the British army does not treat the
gorkha soldiers as equals they are
discriminated against paid lesser than
their British counterparts
in fact they also don't receive the same
pension as their peers
the gorkha soldiers in the British army
have been fighting for equality for
decades now
from going on hunger strikes outside 10
Downing Street to pleading to the
government for better pay the gold cars
have done it all
but to what end
you see the historic problem continues
meanwhile the situation back home in
Nepal is changing which brings us to
point number three
today Nepal is led by a communist
government a communist prime minister
pushpa Kamal
in fact he has opened key trade routes
between Nepal and China
's funds are flowing into Nepal
just a few days ago The Nepalese
government said that China was releasing
80 billion rupees meant for various
infra projects in Nepal
so The Nepalese youths are not happy
with the agneepath scheme there is
frustration about what's happening there
and what's happening here in the UK and
there is a pro-china government at home
will China exploit the situation and try
to recruit as many gold card soldiers as
possible
some of you may be thinking but why does
China want gorkha soldiers are there
enough pla troops
sure there are the ple in fact has the
world's largest number of active
military personnel
but how many of these Personnel are
combat ready
how many of them have Battlefield
experience
I don't know if you remember the videos
that we showed you some time ago
of the pla troops crying on their way to
the Lac or the line of actual control
my point is there are serious questions
about the pla's capability
the gorkha soldiers on the other hand
had proven their metal
and they have fought Wars for India be
it the 1947-48 war 1965 or 1971 and like
we told you they've also fought for
India against China in 1962. in 2020
news broke that China had funded a study
to understand what drives the Nepalese
youth into joining the Indian army and
we've already answered that for you
China could have asked and saved itself
some dollars could have asked the US and
see if some dollars
Jokes Aside recruiting gorkhas also
gives China the chance to intrude into
the Nepali Society become integral to
its bread and butter you see it also
enables China to open a new front with
India decrease Nepal's dependence on
India and one cannot rule out that this
could be Beijing flying very hard to
burn Bridges between India and Nepal at
a time when ties between New Delhi and
Kathmandu are not at their historic best
it's not as if there is the death of
tension between India and China
ladakhra means a stalemate the Border
remains tense and now you have this
issue
the talk of China trying to recruit
gurkhas and this is likely to add to the
sense of uneasiness as the Chinese
foreign minister visits India to attend
the SEO foreign Minister's meeting
Russia is accusing Ukraine of attempting
to assassinate the Russian President
Vladimir Putin let me just say that
again Russia is accusing Ukraine of
trying to assassinate Vladimir Putin in
fact Russia is saying that the Kremlin
was attacked by drones last night
the Kremlin remember is the Fortress
that houses the official residence of
the Russian leader Vladimir Putin and
Russia saying that two drones tried to
strike the Kremlin last night
but law school managed to shoot down
these very drones
this unverified footage is doing the
rounds on social media
you can see an object flying over the
Kremlin
and then there is an explosion
those living nearby saying that they saw
Sparks in the sky
and people with flashlights near the
Kremlin wall the Russian statement
saying fragments of the drones had
fallen on the Kremlin and that there
were no casualties or damage
Putin spokesperson saying that the
Russian president was not inside the
Kremlin at the time of the attack
but the story you see does not end there
the Kremlin released a statement saying
that Russia reserves the right to
retaliate
let me just read out read out that
statement for you
last night the Kiev regime attempted to
carry out a strike on the Kremlin
residents of the president of the
Russian Federation with unmanned aerial
Vehicles we regard these actions as a
planned terrorist attack and an attempt
on the president's life carried out on
the eve of Victory Day the May 9 parade
at which the presence of foreign guests
is also planned and the Russian side
reserved the right to take retaliatory
measures where and when it sees fit
Ukraine is saying it has nothing to do
with the Drone attack meanwhile
drones over Kremlin indicate that Russia
is preparing certain informational
background to justify its own
large-scale terrorist acts so let's see
what Russia is going to do I underline
it one more time attacking Kremlin with
drones is not Ukraine's goal
the Western media is already pointing at
a theory of a false flag operation by
Russia and some even going to the extent
of saying that it is astonishing to
think that a drone could have come
anywhere near the Kremlin
given how highly protected that area is
and the Russian president is
either way one thing is clear that this
incident has escalated the already
raging conflict
and we will be keeping you updated with
the latest that's coming in
all not well between Ukraine and the US
I'm asking that because of the latest
statement by Walter mizolenski he is
quite disappointed with America's
intelligence leaks in fact he's come out
and openly criticized its Ally he said
and I'm quoting from his statement I did
not receive information from the White
House or the Pentagon beforehand it is
unprofitable for us it's not beneficial
to the reputation of the White House and
that not even all
according to a Washington Post report
when zelenski was asked if the league
had trained his trust as far as the U.S
is concerned he said and I'm quoting I
cannot risk a state where I can speak
frankly I do it but there are high risks
if it were my ward against Putin and
there were two of us on the battlefield
I would tell everyone what I think of
them but here the story is a little
different we are all responsible
now this doesn't happen often does it
while zelenski indicated that airing his
true feelings was not worth the risk at
the same time he openly expressed his
disappointment
and what forced zelenski to criticize
America out loud are the ties between
the two countries freeing
the last time we checked the U.S and
Ukraine were brothers in arms in fact
Ukraine have been fighting a proxy
battle
and the U.S has been arming it
but things have been different off late
clearly there is some friction now and
Ukraine is late for its spring offensive
why is that
you see because America has not
delivered the promised gifts
for weeks now top Ukrainian officials
from the president and down onwards have
been cripping about this zelenski has
made it clear that he will not send his
troops to Russian front lines until he
receives more weapons from the West in
fact the U.S is well aware of Ukraine's
over dependence on its weapons
and yet it continues to stall and
downgrade its weapons delivery
and why is America doing that
has it run out of weapons
you see the U.S had already refused to
send long-range missiles and again why
is that because it only had a few to
spare and to date America has snubbed
Ukrainian requests for F-16 fighter jets
in fact zielinski wants tanks artillery
rocket launchers
but what did he get instead
an embarrassing case of mishandled
intelligence
a leak that will go down in history as a
huge joke we have been telling you about
this throughout the classified papers
detailed Ukraine's secret spring
offensive according to reports there
were Pages after pages in fact detailing
how Ukraine had planned to win back the
Lost Cities
how NATO would assisted details of
weapon deliveries Troops Battalion
strengths the documents also gave away
kiev's shortfalls and so much for being
tight allies
how did zelenski learn about the leak
you see like everybody else in the news
and what was America's response
it claims it had informed its allies
about the inter league
the Pentagon says the U.S defense
secretary Lloyd Austin made a lot of
phone calls apparently he also held
several conversations with his Ukrainian
counterpart resnikov
then why is zalesky telling a completely
different story
what really is happening between the two
countries what's going on
the classified documents highlighted
America's low confidence in Ukraine
Ukraine is burning American weapons at
an Irreplaceable base and we cannot help
but speculate was the leak genuinely an
accident or was it an act of sabotage
is Ukraine's biggest supporter turning
its back on it
zelenski remains desperate for more
support he has made a surprise visit to
Finland to attend the Nordic PM Summit
and he will be holding bilateral talks
with the prime ministers of Finland
Sweden Norway Denmark Iceland
what will this spell for the war in
Ukraine
let's now shift Focus to Pakistan
the crisis written country is witnessing
overwhelming inflation
an inflation rate which has overtaken
that of Sri lankas
the country which has been seeing one of
the worst economic crises
as the Pakistani rupee falls to the
lowest levels and the levels of Despair
and Desperation among the people on the
ground continue to rise
will Islamabad managed to save itself
with a bailout package
our next report getting you the complete
story
political instability economic crises
and a growing food crisis the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan is suffering
citizens are considering moving out of
the country as the prices for food and
basic necessities reach the ceiling as
Pakistan's game plan failing did it even
construct a reasonable plan of action we
will come to that let's first see the
new cause of panic in the nation
Pakistan has stopped the list of
countries in Asia the list for countries
with the fastest rising inflation
islamabad's inflation rate has hit an
all-time high of 36.4 percent it has
outpaced the price rise in Sri Lanka
which is at 35.3 percent Sri Lanka is
actually doing better than Pakistan
we are talking about a nation which saw
the worst economic crisis we have been
telling you the story of Pakistan for
months the situation seems to be getting
worse the Pakistani rupee is plummeting
down the whole it is now one of the
worst performing currencies in the world
the Ruby has declined by 20 against the
dollar
while politicians look to stabilize a
major political crisis
the public is left wondering how to fill
their stomachs let's show you the
numbers which has left people or struck
the inflation has made basic Commodities
into luxury the cost of Transport has
climbed by 56.8 percent the cost of food
items have increased by over 48 percent
price of clothing and Footwear has risen
by 21.6 percent water and electricity
saw a rise of nearly 17 percent
the next chapter does not get any better
in Pakistan essential Commodities are
mostly imported but the government is
running out of cash this is fueling the
inflation to rise so what is the
solution Pakistan is looking to the IMF
to come to the rescue it is seeking to
secure a 1.1 billion dollar package as
part of the total 6.5 billion dollar
bailout deal
both are locked in a debate over an
unfinished Loan program which has to be
solved before a new package can be
secured
at this moment only water in Afghanistan
has a weaker economy than Pakistan this
is a new law for the world's fifth most
populous country the question is where
does Pakistan go from here
Bureau report Beyond world is one
our next story is on the cash trapped
Indian airline go first
earlier known as go air
a dispute between the airline and
flattened Whitney and engine
manufacturer has led to go first filing
for bankruptcy
in fact the airline has blamed Pratt and
Whitney for its insolvency how did go
first land up in this mess is Gophers
paying the price for no fault of its own
what's really going on our next story
telling you more
go first Airline known for its Ultra
low-cost flight has delivered a shock to
its investors and flyers
the pocket-friendly airline has filed
for insolvency
this announcement is not the only thing
worrying the public go first has also
canceled all of its flights until May
5th although passengers have been
promised to refund employees have been
left stranded in several parts of the
world
pilots and cabin crews are stuck in
Kuwait Bangkok musket Abu Dhabi and
Phuket this is just a name of you
so what led to go first landing in
crisis
the airline blames Pratt and Whitney and
says that it's geared turbofan engines
are the heart of the crisis
in 2016 Gophers received its first 320
Neo aircraft powered by the gtf engines
this is after the airline had ordered 72
narrow body Jets
but the gtf engines turned out to be
defective
the engines had problems regarding the
fan blades the oil seal and the
combustion chamber lining
by 2017 go first had to ground or cancel
several flights due to Indian issues
Pratt and Whitney promised to compensate
the airline for the engine failures and
replace the engines but that never
happened
in 2022 50 of the aircraft had faulty
engines the planes had to be grounded
the airline faced massive losses upwards
of 1.3 billion dollars
now the entire fleet has been grounded
because the airline does not have the
money to operate all the bandwidths to
fly to the committed sectors on top of
that there's Mountain deck
the big question is will go first be
able to fly again
this Airline is not the first to
temporarily suspend operations the ones
that previously walked down this path
never made it back to the runway take
for instance the case of Paramount
Kingfisher more recently Jet Airways or
true jet or air Carnival
all the companies tried to infuse funds
and sell Stakes but could never
successfully roll back into business so
we'll go first also meet the same fate
the company has already received notices
from aircraft letters
Gophers might even face termination of
its aircraft lease agreements which
means that soon you could have an
airline without aircraft the timing
could not be worse for go first just
earlier this weekend India recorded its
highest single day air passenger count
today India's Aviation sector is booming
people are traveling more than ever
stamping their passports more than ever
and go first will not be able to ride
this blame and whom will it play itself
or Pratt and Whitney

imagine this you get off an Uber cab you
take a few steps you check your pockets
just to be sure and panic Creeps in
you see it's that Dreadful moment of
realization that you have left your
phone your purse or your wallet behind
well you are not alone especially if you
live in Delhi
Uber's lost and found data shows that
passengers in Delhi are the most
forgetful and they lose not only phones
or wallets but entire televisions and
commodes as well toilet commodes as well
our next report telling you more
this is New Delhi
the capital of India
he has many star attractions it's known
for its street food Mughal architecture
Thrift markets
it's also a happening place for late
night parties but now it has another
title under its belt New Delhi is
India's most forgetful City
but who decided that Uber one of India's
biggest cab service providers the same
company that drops home forgetful
commuters and party goers of Delhi
it turns out residents of Delhi forget
their belongings in Uber more than those
of other Metro cities
Delhi has beaten Mumbai to the title
Hyderabad and Bangalore are next on the
list
Uber keeps track of things lost by
passengers and its lost and found index
has made some bizarre Revelations
let's see to begin with more items were
forgotten in cabs on Saturday Sunday and
Friday yes the same days when delhiite's
party the hardest
they forget their belongings in Uber
mostly during the evening only to wake
up with a sense of panic and maybe a
hangover too so what are the things that
people forget the most phones laptop
bags and wallets top the list then
there's clothing headphones water
bottles spectacles or sunglasses key
jewelry and watches
Samsung apple and OnePlus are the top
three phone brands left behind in Uber
cabs
you took a wild guess you would have got
most of these things right but let me
tell you these aren't the only
belongings people of Delhi have
forgotten in Uber cabs
some forget televisions curtains
groceries others Left Behind induction
stoves brooms walking sticks family
collages and as bizarre as it may sound
even toilet commodes
but what makes the commuters of Delhi so
forgetful why do they leave their
belongings behind are they in a rush to
escape the Heat and pollution or are
they just doing roast in talking to
fellow passengers perhaps they're
running late too often and forget stuff
in a rush or is it the chatty Uber
drivers they try to evade
[Music]
the coronation of King Charles is also a
great gift for London sailors
especially those based as civil row it
is a street in central London's Mayfair
it's famous for its bespoke tailoring
for men
and four centuries
the tailors there have been designing
suits for over 150 years
in fact these tailors have been
designing suits for kings queens
politicians and celebrities and this
year they have a special task
to design clothes for the coronation
ceremony and tailors at this iconic
Street are racing against time to design
military uniforms for members of the
royal guard
here's a detailed report
this is travel rule
a road best known for turning out sharp
sewers in fact for decades it has
dressed The Who's Who of the United
Kingdom
at this time the tailors here have a
special task
designing clothes for the coronation
procession of King Charles
Sava Street in London is famous for
turning out sharp suits and at this
point it's a Race Against Time for the
tailors on the street to prepare the red
and gold uniforms that will feature in
the king's coronation on the 6th of May
adorned with the new Insignia of King
Charles
in the sales rooms work is brisk as
customers arrive to collect uniforms or
suits for those who will be attending as
guests
stepping off preparation for one of the
most elaborate ceremonial occasions in
Britain
so at the moment we're changing the tail
badges on the uniforms of his Majesty's
Bodyguard the gentleman at Arms and
we're changing them to the new Crown the
Tudor crown
and we have to do this on 29 uniforms
and they will also have the ciphers on
their pouches change
the big names on the street Henry Poole
Anderson and Shepherd
they all boast of Royal warrants
confirming that they've dressed the
Royal Family
a mark of Authority for many businesses
and their clients
in return they have had to steadily
improve their environmental record
supplying energy bills and invoices to
show how they have reduced their use of
packaging or lighting
the last time we applied we had to prove
that in the period since since we first
applied and then the next time we had
reduced our use of packaging and we had
to prove that through invoices we also
had to submit our energy bills and also
that we have you know certified that we
use LED lighting and that all our
tungsten bulbs have been replaced so
those are just a few things
the changing of a monarch requires
Insignia to be replaced with Charles's
two-door Crown button and Royal Cipher
or monogram stitched onto the ceremonial
uniforms that will be on display among
the 6 000 strong military processions
travel Road tailors have dressed kings
queens and their children for 150 long
years
at King Charles by the way happens to be
a long time customer
the sight of soldiers in the elaborate
gold braid and red wool of a military
uniform are an essential part of British
basically seen on the streets of the
capital last year for both the
celebration of the reign of Queen
Elizabeth
and then her vast funeral procession in
September as for King Charles he has
been photographed wearing the same
double-breasted suits that he has owned
for decades he has been an advocate for
the slowest fashion approach that has
gained greater Traction in recent years
this has provided a sort of hollow
effect for British menswear with
International television Crews asking
about his approach towards sustainable
fashion this is lollygampir reporting
from London for we on world is one
and since we are discussing wardrobes
how could we not talk about the king
what is he wearing for the Grand
Occasion
well the details are out
the king will be wearing golden robes
with layers of Coronation Investments
same robe Investments that were worn by
his mother and grandfather
the Priceless garments are usually kept
with the crown jewels inside the Tower
of London
but they are said to be removed from the
walled Castle
what do they look like what's their
story our next report telling you
[Music]
we know the date we know the time
and we know the guest list and now we
know about the outfit as well this is
what King Charles III will be wearing
for his coronation ceremony
heavy priests like golden robes that
were worn by his ancestors the king will
put on layer upon Lair of glittering
coronation vestments inspired by
Priestly attire
for the crowning King Charles will be
given a long gold sleeved coat now this
robe was created in the year 1911 for
George V and has been worn as successive
coronations including by late Queen
Elizabeth II
these gold restaurants were also worn by
the King's mother Queen Elizabeth II
[Music]
his grandfather King George VI
and his great-grandfather George V
[Music]
the Priceless garments are usually kept
with the crown jewels inside the Tower
of London but they will be removed from
the walled Castle as part of a 150
million euro security exercise
which has been dubbed operation Tower of
London
and besides this the king will also be
reusing the coronation girdle or the
sword belt and the coronation Gauntlet
or glove
both made for his grandfather George VI
in 1937.
this glove was made in a Worcester
Factory which was the which was the
gloving area of the UK and as you can
see the beautiful gold embroidery
and it's made out of a kid
and um you can see the lovely Crown here
and it was made in 1937 for King George
VI
the glove and its duplicates were made
by dents with embroidery by Edward
stillville and Company
the original glove the one Charles will
wear have been kept in the Royal
collection while the identical duplicate
is in dance Museum on loan from the
worshipful company of Glovers
so it would probably be in a couple two
three days work at that time but the big
thing would have been choosing the skins
and also keeping it all secret you know
it would have been a
Specialist Team working on it and I know
one of the royal gloves the manager of
the factory actually slept in the
factory for a week with the Royal glove
Buckingham Palace is yet to reveal what
the Monarch will be wearing beneath the
westmonts but he will apparently follow
in the footsteps of 20th century
sovereigns
by putting on the super Tunica created
for George the Fifth in 1911 and later
the Imperial mantle first worn by George
IV in 1821 and then worn at all
consecutive coronations since 1911.
it is a part of tradition for recent
monarchs to reuse garments just like
King Charles is but in a move aimed at
making the event more sustainable the
King has decided to reuse way more than
his predecessors

alleged mission to take out the Russian
leader it crashed mere kilometers away
from the site this according to a tweet
by Ukrainian activist Yuri Roma nenko
who claimed to have close ties to keep's
intelligence Services which was picked
up by the media as well he alleges that
Ukrainian Secret Service agents received
information about Putin's apparent trip
to the industrial site after that they
decided to launch the deadly drone in an
attempt to assassinate the Russian
president
okay well to
let's head on to Russia for more on this
we are joined by Fred Ware from the
Russian Capital Moscow threat is a
journalist and political commentator
Fred welcome to we on wow what a story
this alleged assassination attempt on
the life of Russia President Vladimir
Putin Russia says that Ukraine was
responsible can you tell us what the
latest is from Moscow and
in your opinion how could it respond
after these accusations uh towards
Ukraine
well you summarized it pretty well two
drones apparently uh flew all the way to
Moscow and
uh arrived right near the Kremlin which
is the heart the political heart of
Moscow and
we've seen the video of one of them
hitting the the Dome of the presidential
Palace which is underneath which is
Putin's office
it didn't seem to be a big explosion it
seemed to be just the thing hit and so
the Kremlin does claim that air defenses
and perhaps electronic countermeasures
worked to to disable the thing but still
it's pretty pretty breathtaking attack
and as I say it it hit
Putin's one of Putin's offices so
um and it is I think mainly a
psychological
operation on the part of the ukrainians
it's clearly the ukrainians who did it
and the Russians would not like
voluntarily give themselves a black eye
like that I think you can rely on that
so uh
and it it's probably intended to strike
fear to disrupt the May 9th holiday
which is coming up it's it's Victory Day
there's meant to be a big military
parade on Red Square which is just
adjacent to where that drone hit
um so I I think that that's it it's the
ukrainians trying to bring the war home
to Russians and perhaps to Putin
personally
oh what what Russians can do in response
you know you talk about this yeah
yeah no uh okay that that I I don't know
because the war is going at full
full crank right now uh the only thing I
can think of that they might do in
retaliation is try to attack zelenski
personally
that would be extremely unwise
uh because like like this I I don't
think it will have this attack on the
Kremlin I don't think we'll have the
effect of frightening Russians or or
Putin and an attack on zielinski would
likewise just draw people closer around
him and and heighten the amount of
sympathy that he gets around the world
do you think that this was a major
security breach considering the fact
that the two drones flew undetected deep
inside Russian territory
I mean how did they get that far
yeah well it's happened before
um and it it just is the case that the
sky it's a big very big you know you're
you're located in the United States and
then you have all these balloons flying
over your heads recently and
nobody saw them until so uh it it the
sky is just full of objects and I think
that that's why the Moscow authorities
banned the use of Civilian drones to
clear the airspace around Moscow for air
defense Radars to work better
uh but yes it's a security breach the
Russians can't be happy with it and
they'll probably be tightening the
screws uh in the next few days
especially in the days leading up to the
Victory Day Parade
yeah that's that's such a interesting
point about that parade and instilling
fear but
but Russia respond to Ukraine saying
that it wasn't us uh we had nothing to
do with this drone attack and uh you
know look somewhere else oh we had
nothing to do with it how how do you
think Russia could respond to something
like this
I don't think that's credible or that
anybody believes it the ukrainians
routinely say that don't they uh when
they strike inside of Russia they throw
up their hands and say we don't know
who did this I think that's mainly for
Western consumption because it's people
in the west who are nervous
about Ukraine striking on Russian
territory
um and uh the Americans I think
repeatedly say that and deny long-range
missiles and such to Ukraine to prevent
them from doing that
so I think it's it's mainly they're
they're facing west and saying we didn't
do it or we we don't know who did it so
some something koi they don't say they
don't deny they did it
um and I think we can pretty much assume
that they they definitely did
absolutely and
and you said what I was thinking the
United States is now going to definitely
think twice and NATO allies as well uh
when Ukraine is asking for those fighter
jets although you know none have been
provided but this was one of
America and its allies main concern that
Ukraine would ultimately Target inside
of Russia but then you have all this new
technology with the drones and
everything uh Fred Weir thank you so
much for joining us and helping us make
some sense of this extraordinary story
is the best way I can describe it I look
forward to speaking to you again very
soon
thank you
so the United States is a superpower
it's the world's biggest economy it also
has the most powerful military its power
permeates beyond its borders but is
Washington losing the trust of its
allies well three of its allies namely
Ukraine turkey and Israel are taking an
aim at the Biden Administration here's
why
America is one of the most powerful
relations in the world it has one of the
biggest militaries it dominates Global
military spending it spends more on its
defense than the next 10 countries
combined and with the military so strong
Washington exercise is a say in
geopolitics
but as Dynamics change and the world
order Witnesses changes
it seems that many of America's allies
are losing their confidence in the
superpower
U.S investigators are probing one of the
most damaging leaks of classified
information since the 2013 dump of
National Security Agency documents by
Edward Snowden
Ukrainian President Vladimir zielinski
says the U.S did not warn Ukraine about
the top secret documents leaked to the
internet chat rooms before the news
broke in the media last month
all the Washington Post we did not
receive any information from the White
House or Pentagon beforehand
the embarrassing breach which includes
top secret documents reportedly reveals
the U.S unease over the viability of a
counter-offensive vacu's forces against
the Russian troops
it had details of losses and casualties
it even tears down the Ukrainian Air
Force in its analysis
zelenski did not confirm the leaks but
expressed his disappointment that if the
enemy comes to know of their flaws
before then then it definitely stands a
minus for Ukraine
with zelenski's desperate trust in the
U.S going weak what the report did was
that it confirmed a decades-long belief
that the U.S snoops on its allies
foreign
which will soon head to polls amid water
issues or weak economy a devastating
earthquake and claims of autocracy a new
angle has made it to the news and it
involves the U.S
a close urduhan Ally and interior
Minister Suleiman soilu has claimed the
AK party faces an external threat not a
domestic one
he has blamed the U.S for staging a
political coup in Turkey based on
Biden's old statement where he called
for strengthening the opposition
foreign
lastly we have the biggest Ally and
partner who has lately been witnessing a
rather rocky relationship with the US
Israel is at the center of public Fury
for months now millions of Israelis have
been protesting against the Nathaniel
coalition's judicial reform plans
and in the middle of that Israel's
Justice Minister yaref lemon accused the
Biden administration of cooperating with
the protest movement against Netanyahu
both say that while speaking at a
meeting with political analysts Levin
said that the protest movement has total
control of the press and a hold on the
court the AG and the entire Financial
system and the U.S Administration which
cooperates with them
however he clarified that he believes
the Americans are doing this out of a
true belief and not that someone is
operating them
the list of allies is long U.S is slowly
losing the confidence of its AIDS Saudi
Arabia a key American Ally in West Asia
has already started following its
independent foreign policy straying away
from the U.S favoring terms question is
how many more will follow and how soon
Bureau report we on world is one
foreign
Administration has decided to
temporarily send additional troops to
help secure the U.S Mexico border
authorities are preparing for a possible
rise in illegal migration when title 42
covid-19 border restrictions are lifted
later this month the forces will be in
addition to an ongoing deployment of
about 2500 National Guard troops but
what's noteworthy and unusual is that
these new troops are being deployed from
the Pentagon sending U.S soldiers to the
Border has been controversial just one
of the many questions being asked is
whether the administration is
militarizing the Mexico Frontier instead
of just securing the U.S border
government officials however deny that
case here's a report
experts anticipating a huge surge in
migrants this month coming to the U.S
President Joe Biden's Administration
said Tuesday it will temporarily send
1500 troops to help secure the U.S
Mexico border Pentagon spokesman Pat
Ryder for 90 days these 1500 military
personnel who will be sourced from the
active duty component will fill critical
capability gaps such as ground-based
detection and monitoring data entry
and Warehouse support until cpv can
address these needs through contracted
support military personnel will not
directly participate in law enforcement
activities the increase in Border
resources adding to the 2500 National
Guard groups already there comes As
Trump era covid-19 restrictions known as
title 42 are set to end on May 11th the
policy had allowed U.S authorities to
rapidly expel non-mexican migrants to
Mexico without the chance to seek Asylum
Biden who is running for re-election
already has grappled with record numbers
of migrants caught illegally crossing
the border during his tenure and has
taken criticism from all sides
Republicans have blasted Biden for
rolling back Trump's Hardline policies
while Democrats and immigration
activists have lashed out over what they
see as Biden's toughening approach to
border security U.S military troops have
been used to help secure the Border
during previous administrations
including under President Bush and Obama
White House Press Secretary Kareem
Jean-Pierre on Tuesday went so far as to
call such deployments a common practice
but some in the president's own party
were not on board Senator Bob Menendez a
Democrat and chair of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee said Biden's
decision to send troops to the Border
was unacceptable
and accused the president of trying to
score political points

The all-new MG Comet is an ...",2023-05-03T10:50:26Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dt_vFcjFdu0/hqdefault.jpg,"foreign
[Applause]
people in India are not used to seeing
such kind of Automotive designs on the
road and we've had a lot of folks come
up to us and ask what on Earth is this
thing so really what is this car all
about well it is the mg Comet a micro
car all electric of course and it aims
to solve the problem of mobility in the
urban jungle
[Music]
because we think it's a very subjective
matter and also that you have eyes and
you can judge for yourself whether a
product looks good or not but these kind
of things well they definitely need a
little bit of a mention when it comes to
the exterior design because just look at
it it's a very quirky very eccentric
sort of design execution completely flat
front end of course it's flanked by a
lot of elements with a charging flap in
the middle and the headlamp cluster is
very uniquely shaped with this curve and
that tables towards the top end so
definitely a design that has a very
unique identity on the road and then as
you go along the sides you will fly into
the doors are absolutely massive almost
feels like you are opening the door of a
truck which is necessary because it
allows you the access into the rear row
of seats
foreign
and then when you look at the back
section of this car this is flatter than
the front end and there are design
similarities like this red bar that runs
all across the width of the car and
again the tail lamp design is pretty
much similar to the headlamp design and
you find this curve which tapers at the
top again but one thing that you will
notice is the inconsistency in the panel
gaps like for example the Gap over here
between the shut line of the boot lid
and the glass panel that's not really
all that great and yeah it just goes to
show that there have been some Corners
cut
before starting with the vehicle
attributes and assessing how this car
feels let's address a very big point
this thing attracts a lot of attention
from everyone other Road users on two
wheels four wheels multiple Wheels
bystanders and we even had people from
roadside shops making the effort to peep
out in the direction of the Comet this
thing is an attention magnet and that
makes it dangerous as well for itself
and others people get far too close for
comfort just to get a better look at
this car a lot of them even kept turning
their heads back while driving and it
just kind of got us a little perturbed
and we just kept praying that things
would not get messy anyway according to
research 80 percent of people drive less
than 30 kilometers a day and over 70
percent of us drive solo and these are
the main data points that have motivated
mg to bring out a car of this kind onto
our roads
[Music]
foreign
it measures less than three meters in
length and its height is considerably
more than the width which makes it
dynamically as good as a drunk ostrich
we'll come to the Dynamics in just a bit
because it's absolutely comical and fun
in some great ways but right now let's
address the overall packaging and
practicality of this car the comet will
most certainly be used as a tiny City
Runabout for the most basic commutes
going from work to office if your
workplace is not too far out carrying
kids from into school or then taking
them to their extracurriculars it may
even actually find acceptance from the
elderly it'll be a bit eccentric enough
for them to give a complete image
makeover to themselves
foreign
with a completely blank slate we did not
want any preconceived notions to spoil
the party
but at the same time we were a bit
concerned because the past examples of
any product of such a nature have not
been great but the thing is surprisingly
refreshing the seeds well they are not
great especially if you're anything more
than thin which I am well they're narrow
they're flat and they just don't give
you the support that you need but
otherwise the cabin quality is
reasonably okay some plastic bits here
and there are of course are not of such
high grade quality but overall you can't
really complain too much and the space
on offer is absolutely lovely and
seeding for adults in the cabin not a
problem at all
but when you start scratching beneath
the surface you will find that some bits
of materials used is actually not bad at
all and they're in fact better than some
of the mainstream hatchbacks in the
market and the overall design of the
dashboard or the general cabin design
overall is also extremely nice as I said
this thing is just a very nice and
refreshing change from the sea of bland
everything that we see in the market
going on right now
foreign
[Music]
there's a 26 centimeter touch screen
infotainment there's the MGI smart
connected Car Technology and then it has
steering mounted controls which if
you're old enough will remind you of the
iPod Touch very very nice and uh yeah it
just feels like they've nicked the
design idea from Apple and then when you
get on towards safety you have the
mandatory ABS EBD combination dual
airbags of course and there are isofix
anchors as well and you also get a
reversing camera and there is a TPMS
notification through a voice alert
but don't do the mechanical bits now or
in fact electrical bits now this thing
has a 17.3 kilowatt hour battery which
has been sourced from Tata now the Tiago
that has a 19 and some kilowatt hour
battery and the higher range one is
about 24 kilowatt hours this one is
specific to mg they specified the
battery that they want which is now
rated at 17.3 kilowatt hours and this I
think is going to allow mg to price this
product a bit more aggressively than
what was thought previously because of
course battery being the most expensive
component of an electric vehicle that
has been sourced locally and it is
mounted right below the front seats
[Music]
and when it comes to the charging well
most of it is likely going to be at home
again data or the research points are
the fact that 90 of the people charge
their electric vehicles at home it also
gets a region breaking which means it
captures a little bit of energy and
stores it back into the battery there
are three different levels and in the
fiercest level or the strongest level
you will definitely notice that the
moment you take your foot off the
throttle this thing reduces speed in a
big way and that's all down to the
region function
[Music]
the motor well that's an imported unit
and it sends power to the rear axle
makes about 42 PS and 110 Newton meter I
did not think that the comet would be
offered with different Drive modes but
it does come with Drive modes there are
three of them one is Eco the other one
is normal and the last one is sports as
you would expect normal means just a
regular throttle map you're going about
in the city managing beer driving very
nicely Eco just kind of does everything
down
gives more preference to the range and
Sport really changes the map and you can
definitely feel that added zest in the
way this car moves
[Music]
the figures of the motor makes but
that's ample I think for you to pierce
and 110 newton meters is not bad for a
car of this kind the performance is good
enough for again the kind of car that it
is dynamically it's a bit of a comedy
won't you say the steering it feels like
it will serve the purpose of going about
in town but just don't go mooning about
in the comment this is not a car that
you will enjoy doing that in it will
give you that lump in the throat kind of
entertainment no doubt about it but of
course you are also going to be very
very nervous so I would just advise that
you don't wear shoes made of lead and
don't wear driving gloves on
[Music]
suspension that's a bit firm especially
on the rear end it feels like it ran out
of spring travel and just kind of hopped
a bit but for the most part again and
especially considering the kind of
application that this car is going to
have it's not bad and you will really
not have any problems living with it on
a daily basis
foreign
[Music]
it's a crazy fun sight on the road and
it's a comic experience to be honest it
does not have a pretentious personality
it knows what it is it's a small City
Runabout for very basic needs it's a
funky little thing that offers
reasonable practicality it's a
transportation tool in essence but it
just happens to bring a smile to your
face and for that it's fantastic
[Music]
thank you

FedEx itself predicts a mild recession
this year but the markets believe that
there is a greater upside risk to the
jobless rate and the depth of the
economic downturn foreign
hike there's some more bad news for the
Americans job openings fell to a
two-year low in the month of March that
is a clear indication that the U.S job
market is schooling sharply the labor
department said that the employers
posted 9.6 million vacancies in March
which is down from nearly 10 million in
the month of February
now this was the lowest numbers since
April 2021 when a new wave of the
covid-19 case surge took hold on the
other hand the layoffs Rose to 1.8
million marking the highest level since
December 2020. the right layoffs has
also had an impact on the American
employees the number of Americans
quitting their jobs declined to 3.9
million the lowest since May 2021.
meanwhile a private survey shows
employers added fewer than 180 2000 jobs
in April this is the third straight
monthly drop since new jobs Rose in
January 2023. the media reports further
ad that the unemployment rate is
expected to rise to 3.6 percent in the
month of April a couple of notches above
January is a low of 3.4 percent
the latest U.S job market numbers come
at a time when the U.S fed has been
fighting a battle against stubbornly
elevated inflation in the country the
FED has raised its Benchmark interest
rate nine times in just over a year
higher borrowing costs are however
taking a toll on the companies which
have announced massive layoffs and have
also slowed down their hirings
under still tracking top stories from
the United States of America now the
United States will breach the debt
ceiling as early as on June 1st which
may result in a dead default this could
happen if the U.S Congress fails to
raise the debt ceiling the U.S treasury
has warned it could run short of cash to
pay its bills by the month of June this
is as per a letter by the treasury
secretary Janet listening
as you know I've asked Congress to raise
or suspend the debt limit since 1789 the
United States has always paid its bills
on time and it must continue to do so in
my assessment in those of economists
across the board default on our debt
would trigger an economic and financial
catastrophe
yeah and further said that the Congress
must act quickly to raise the debt
ceiling to avoid a default on the
federal government's debt U.S President
Joe Biden has called for a meeting on
May 9 with four top Congressional
leaders at the White House for the same
Republican house Speaker Kevin McCarthy
housed Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and
Republican leader Mitch McConnell will
meet Joe Biden next Tuesday at the White
House as per the reports the president
will discuss initiating a separate
budget process during this meeting
here's how Senate Majority Leader Chuck
Schumer reacted to the situation
the House Republicans have taken the
American people hostage as you know
yesterday secretary Yellen warned that
the U.S government will likely default
on its debt obligations as soon as June
1st that's only 30 days from now
rather than listen to reason speaker
McCarthy has caved to extremists by
passing the default on America Act he's
handed the keys over to the house
Freedom caucus who are more than happy
to let the U.S default if they don't get
every last cut
and every last unrelated hard-right
policy that they want
however the Republican lawmakers want
spending cuts in return for raising the
debt limit they say that the budget
stunt path is unsustainable Biden and
the Congressional Democrats want to
raise the debt limit without any
conditions
we've done our job I've sat down with
the president on February 1st he ignored
the rest of the time
he treats it just like the Border he
wants to ignore it and thinks it goes
away that doesn't work in America
he's putting the American economy in
Jeopardy by his lack of action
Colorado
centers this report from New York take a
look
foreign
the back and forth in Washington
continues it's important to note that a
deficit spending and the national debt
go as far back as the founding of the
Republic in fact during the past half
century or so there's only been a
handful of years where government
spending did not surpass the collected
tax however in recent years whether it
was to combat covid-19 or the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan or covering the
enormous costs of an aging population
these numbers have grown exponentially
and no one in Washington wants to be
blamed for causing a default but on the
other hand it's something that everyone
knows the status quo is anything but
sustainable it's during these times that
the American people however find
themselves in a peculiar situation
they're constantly being told notably by
democrats that no matter how much tax
they pay they're just not able to cover
the costs in Washington
Susan tehrani reporting from New York
for we on Federal Reserve hike on

exactly the last piece of the jigsaw and
more crucial are indicators of what will
happen next for June the FED will not
provide any guidance at this time so
it's up to the markets to make sense of

the U.S investigators are probing one of
the most damaging leaks of the
classified information since the 2013
dump of National Security Agency
documents by Snowden zelenski says that
the U.S did not want Ukraine about the
top secret documents leaked to the

Washington Post and I'm quoting here we
did not receive any information from the

the embarrassing breach which includes

the U.S unease over viability of a

contained information on troop
casualties and Equipment losses not only
this it also contained details about
NATO observation flights over the Black
Sea the reports further suggest that the
leaked papers revealed concerns about
the Ukrainian air defenses and also
points to the U.S spying on its allies
which also includes Israel and South
Korea
speaking on CNN Pentagon press secretary
Pat Ryder did not confirm or deny
zelenski's claims he said that
Washington remains committed to working
with Ukraine and its allies to ensure
that Kiev has the security assistance
that it needs
refused to confirm or deny the veracity
of any of the exposed material he said
and I'm quoting again anything that
informs our enemy in advance in one way

hike there's some more bad news for the
Americans job openings fell to a
two-year low in the month of March that
is a clear indication that the U.S job
market is schooling sharply the labor
department said that the employers
posted 9.6 million vacancies in March
which is down from nearly 10 million in
the month of February
now this was the lowest numbers since
April 2021 when a new wave of the
covid-19 case surge took hold on the
other hand the layoffs Rose to 1.8
million marking the highest level since
December 2020. the rise layoffs has also
had an impact on the American employees
the number of Americans quitting their
jobs declined to 3.9 million the lowest
since May 2021. meanwhile a private
survey shows employers added fewer than
180 2 000 jobs in April this is the
third straight monthly drop since new
jobs Rose in January 2023. the media
reports further ad that the unemployment
rate is expected to rise to 3.6 in the
month of April a couple of notches above
January is a low of 3.4 percent
the latest U.S job market numbers come
at a time when the U.S fed has been
fighting a battle against stubbornly
elevated inflation in the country the
FED has raised its Benchmark interest
rate nine times in just over a year
higher borrowing costs are however
taking a toll on the companies which
have announced massive layoffs and have
also slowed down their hirings
understood tracking top stories from the
United States of America now the United
States will breach the debt ceiling as
early as on June 1st which may result in
a dead default this could happen if the
U.S Congress fails to raise the debt
ceiling the U.S treasury has warned it
could run short off cash to pay its
bills by the month of June this is as
per a letter by the treasury secretary
Janet here listening
as you know I've asked Congress to raise
or suspend the debt limit since 1789 the
United States has always paid its bills
on time and it must continue to do so in
my assessment in those of economists
across the board default on our debt
would trigger an economic and financial
catastrophe
yeah and further said that the Congress
must act quickly to raise the debt
ceiling to avoid a default on the
federal government's debt U.S President
Joe Biden has called for a meeting on

leaders at the White House for the same

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and
Republican leader Mitch McConnell will
meet Joe Biden next Tuesday at the White
House as per the reports the president
will discuss initiating a separate
budget process during this meeting
here's how Senate Majority Leader Chuck
Schumer reacted to the situation
the House Republicans have taken the
American people hostage as you know
yesterday secretary yellin warned that
the U.S government will likely default
on its debt obligations as soon as June
1st that's only 30 days from now
rather than listen to reason speaker
McCarthy has caved to extremists by
passing the default on America Act he's
handed the keys over to the house
Freedom caucus who are more than happy
to let the U.S default if they don't get
every last cut
and every last unrelated hard right
policy that they want
however the Republican lawmakers want
spending cuts in return for raising the
debt limit they say that the budget
stunt part is unsustainable Biden and
the Congressional Democrats want to
raise the debt limit without any
conditions
we've done our job I've sat down with
the president on February 1st he ignored
the rest of the time
he treats it just like the Border he
wants to ignore it and thinks it goes
away that doesn't work in America
he's putting the American economy in
Jeopardy by his lack of action
Susan terania centers this report from

it's important to note that a deficit
spending and the national debt go as far
back as the founding of the Republic in
fact during the past half century or so
there's only been a handful of years
where government spending did not
surpass the collected tax however in
recent years whether it was to combat
covid-19 or the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan or covering the enormous
costs of an aging population these
numbers have grown exponentially and no
one in Washington wants to be blamed for
causing a default but on the other hand
it's something that everyone knows the
status quo is anything but sustainable
it's during these times that the
American people however find themselves
in a peculiar situation they're
constantly being told notably by
democrats that no matter how much tax
they pay they're just not able to cover

optimism is lower than it was at the
depths of the pandemic according to the

Federal itself predicts a mild recession
this year but the markets believe that
there is a greater upside risk to the
jobless rate and the depth of the
economic downturn
and ahead of a possible U.S Fair hike
there's some more bad news for the
Americans job openings fell to a
two-year low in the month of March that
is a clear indication that the U.S job
market is schooling sharply the labor
department said that the employers
posted a 9.6 million vacancies in March
which is down from nearly 10 million in
the month of February
now this was the lowest numbers since
April 2021 when a new wave of the
covid-19 case surge took hold on the
other hand the layoffs Rose to 1.8
million marking the highest level since
December 2020. the right layoffs has
also had an impact on the American
employees the number of Americans
quitting their jobs declined to 3.9
million the lowest since May 2021.
meanwhile a private survey shows
employers added fewer than 180 2000 jobs
in April this is a third straight
monthly drop since new jobs Rose in
January 2023. the media reports further
ad that the unemployment rate is
expected to rise to 3.6 in the month of
April a couple of notches above January
is a low of 3.4 percent
the latest U.S job market numbers come
at a time when the U.S fed has been
fighting a battle against stubbornly
elevated inflation in the country the
FED has raised its Benchmark interest
rate nine times in just over a year
higher borrowing costs are however
taking a toll on the companies which
have announced massive layoffs and have
also slowed down their hirings
and you're still tracking top stories
from the United States of America now
the United States will breach the debt
ceiling as early as on June 1st which
may result in a dead default this could
happen if the U.S Congress fails to
raise the debt ceiling the U.S treasury
has warned it could run short of cash to
pay its bills by the month of June this
is as per a letter by the treasury
secretary Janet listening
as you know I've asked Congress to raise
or suspend the debt limit since 1789 the
United States has always paid its bills
on time and it must continue to do so in
my assessment in those of economists
across the board default on our debt
would trigger an economic and financial
catastrophe
yeah and further said that the Congress
must act quickly to raise the debt
ceiling to avoid a default on the
federal government's debt U.S President
Joe Biden has called for a meeting on
May 9 with four top Congressional
leaders at the White House for the same
Republican house Speaker Kevin McCarthy
housed Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and
Republican leader Mitch McConnell will
meet Joe Biden next Tuesday at the White
House as per the reports the president
will discuss initiating a separate
budget process during this meeting
here's how Senate Majority Leader Chuck
Schumer reacted to the situation
the House Republicans have taken the
American people hostage as you know
yesterday secretary Yellen warned that
the U.S government will likely default
on its debt obligations as soon as June
1st that's only 30 days from now
rather than listen to reason speaker
McCarthy has caved to extremists by
passing the default on America Act he's
handed the keys over to the house
Freedom caucus who are more than happy
to let the U.S default if they don't get
every last cut
and every last unrelated hard right
policy that they want
however the Republican lawmakers want
spending cuts in return for raising the
debt limit they said that the budget
stunt path is unsustainable Biden and
the Congressional Democrats want to
raise the debt limit without any
conditions
we've done our job I've sat down with
the president on February 1st he ignored
the rest of the time
he treats it just like the Border he
wants to ignore it and thinks it goes
away that doesn't work in America
he's putting the American economy in
Jeopardy by his lack of action
Colorado
centers this report from New York take a
look
foreign
the back and forth in Washington
continues it's important to note that a
deficit spending and the national debt
go as far back as the founding of the
Republic in fact during the past half
century or so there's only been a
handful of years where government
spending did not surpass the collected
tax however in recent years whether it
was to combat covid-19 or the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan or covering the
enormous costs of an aging population
these numbers have grown exponentially
and no one in Washington wants to be
blamed for causing a default but on the
other hand it's something that everyone
knows the status quo is anything but
sustainable it's during these times that
the American people however find
themselves in a peculiar situation
they're constantly being told notably by
democrats that no matter how much tax
they pay they're just not able to cover
the costs in Washington

the U.S investigators are proving one of

interview the Ukrainian president told
Washington Post and I'm quoting here we
did not receive any information from the

contained information on troop
casualties and Equipment losses not only
this it also contained details about
NATO observation flights over the Black

that it needs
refused to confirm or deny the veracity
of any of the exposed material he said
and I'm quoting again anything that
informs our enemy in advance in one way

suspended by his Clubhouse for two weeks
Messi's two-year stint in the French
capital is all but over with the
proposed contract Extinction dead in the
water because you have taken this
extreme step after Messi flew off to
Saudi Arabia to fulfill commercial
obligations without prior permission
reports coming out of the club indicate
that French Champions have decided to
end the relationship with Messi and not
take up the option of a one-year
contract extension the World Cup winning
Captain was part of the PSG team that
suffered a shock 1-3 defeat at the hands
of mid-table Club Orion on Sunday the
first team was called in for training on
Monday post that defeat but Messi did
not show up PSG denied Messi's request
for two days off but he flew out with
his family to Riyadh where he has a role
as a tourism Ambassador for the kingdom
PSG have hit Messi with a two-week
suspension which rules him out of games
against a Troy and ajaxu he won't be
paid for those two weeks and will also
not be allowed to train with the first
team with just five games remaining in
the season Messi may even not wear the
PSG shirt again Messi was never able to
win over PSG fans and was even booed
injured last month talks to extend his
contract had begun in Ernst after his
teller role in taking Argentina to the
World Cup title buttocks have broken
down and Messi's family has reportedly

changed in the last two years
message trip to Saudi Arabia could also
be telling a move to Saudi pro league is
certainly the best offer on the table
financially and it would pit him once
again against his great rival Cristiano
Ronaldo
a move to mls in America has been
circulating in football circles for a
while now as well Messi was linked to
David Beckham's inter Miami last year
and he owns a house there English
Champions Manchester City remain an
option because of Messi's relationship
with his mentor Pep Guardiola and they
can afford his astronomical wages

as you know I've asked Congress to raise

will discuss initiating a separate

here's how Senate Majority Leader Chuck
Schumer reacted to the situation
the House Republicans have taken the
American people hostage as you know
yesterday secretary Yellen warned that
the U.S government will likely default
on its debt obligations as soon as June
1st that's only 30 days from now
rather than listen to reason speaker

passing the default on America Act he's
handed the keys over to the house

to let the U.S default if they don't get
every last cut
and every last unrelated hard right
policy that they want
however the Republican lawmakers want
spending cuts in return for raising the

stunt path is unsustainable Biden and
the Congressional Democrats want to
raise the debt limit without any
conditions

well the back and forth in Washington
continues it's important to note that a
deficit spending and the national debt
go as far back as the founding of the
Republic in fact during the past half
century or so there's only been a
handful of years where government
spending did not surpass the collected
tax however in recent years whether it
was to combat covid-19 or the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan or covering the
enormous costs of an aging population
these numbers have grown exponentially
and no one in Washington wants to be
blamed for causing a default but on the
other hand it's something that everyone
knows the status quo is anything but
sustainable it's during these times that
the American people however find
themselves in a peculiar situation
they're constantly being told notably by
democrats that no matter how much tax
they pay they're just not able to cover

Biden's Administration has decided to
temporarily send additional troops to
help secure the U.S Mexico border now
authorities they are preparing for a
possible rise in illegal migration when
covid-19 border restrictions lift later
this month yes that's the big Story
coming out of United States the force
will be in addition to an ongoing
deployment of about 2500 National Guard
troops but uh him this sending U.S
troops to Mexico border to the borders
has been controversial the question that
is being asked is whether the United
States is militarizing the Mexico
Frontier the administration though is
denying that that's the case here's a
report
with experts anticipating a huge surge
in migrants this month coming to the U.S
President Joe Biden's Administration
said Tuesday it will temporarily send
1500 troops to help secure the U.S
Mexico border Pentagon spokesman Pat
Ryder for 90 days these 1500 military
personnel who will be sourced from the
active duty component will fill critical
capability gaps such as ground-based
detection and monitoring data entry
and Warehouse support until cpv can
address these needs through contracted
support military personnel will not
directly participate in law enforcement
activities the increase in Border
resources adding to the 2500 National
Guard groups already there comes As
Trump era covid-19 restrictions known as
title 42 are set to end on May 11th the
policy had allowed U.S authorities to
rapidly expel non-mexican migrants to
Mexico without the chance to seek Asylum
Biden who is running for re-election
already has grappled with record numbers
of migrants caught illegally crossing
the border during his tenure and has
taken criticism from all sides
Republicans have blasted Biden for
rolling back Trump's Hardline policies
while Democrats and immigration
activists have lashed out over what they
see as Biden's toughening approach to
border security U.S military troops have
been used to help secure the Border
during previous administrations
including under President Bush and Obama
White House Press Secretary Kareem
Jean-Pierre on Tuesday went so far as to
call such deployments a common practice
but some in the president's own party
were not on board Senator Bob Menendez a
Democrat and chair of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee said Biden's
decision to send troops to the Border
was unacceptable
and accused the president of trying to
score political points
so what's happening at the U.S Mexico
border and what is the administration
expecting what will happen going forward
which is why these troops are being sent
to the U.S Mexico border let's go across
to him joining us for more on this hymn
thank you so much I will take all from
here ahead of an expected surge of
migrants the United States will deploy
1500 additional troops to the Mexico
border the deployment it will add 2500
troops already assisting the U.S border
Patrol and other agencies poised for the
long forecast jump in a border crosses
let's just take a look at the Biden
administration's immigration policies
and what the troop deployment implies
here let's just take a look at that U.S
border curbs they are ending next week
on the 11th of May introduced under
Donald Trump the title 42 program used
pandemic measures to expel people
crossing without migration documents
with the easing of curbs including
decision to lift vaccination
requirements for in were Travelers
Biden's Administration it can no longer
apply title 42 for Border controls of
Homeland Security is stressed that the
military personnel will not be involved
in law enforcement they will help in
backup activities like border monitoring
I.T services and Warehouse support as
mentioned earlier the deployment will
add 2500 troops already assisting U.S
agencies here also in February the Biden
Administration announced a new set of
restrictions aiming to penalize people
who cross into the country illegally
they will have to first go through the
process of applying online through a
Customs and Border Patrol app as well
alternatively people can apply for
asylum in one of the countries they pass
through to get to the United States
border
last week the state department announced
plans to set up processing centers for
hopeful migrants in other countries
starting with Colombia and Guatemala
all right Tim thanks very much for that
great explainer we are also joined by
our correspondent Susan Theron in fact I
spoke to her earlier she's she sent us
this report from New York on why the
partner Administration has decided to
take this measure listen it
the Department of Homeland Security
requested Pentagon assistance in hopes
of getting ahead of a possible migrant
search as title 42 is expected to expire
on May 11th however these troops are not
going to be responsible for enforcement
only for logistical duties enforcement
will be left on the shoulders of border
patrol to deal with the tens of
thousands of illegal border crossings
expected as a title of 42 will expire
the Pentagon said quote unquote that the
military personnel will not directly
participate in law enforcement they will
be armed but they're only permitted to
use their weapons for self-defense
now also always for better understanding
what is the White House saying here
Susan Theron is reporting on a White
House's reaction on the same
so the White House Press Secretary on
Tuesday tried to downplay this
development saying that troops have been
sent to the Border quote unquote for
almost two decades but she failed to
mention that usually when troops are
sent to the Border they're being drawn
from the National Guards unit and it's a
very rare for the Pentagon to send
active duty troops to the U.S border the
Biden Administration nonetheless is
facing criticism from all sides from the
Republicans first and foremost they say
that the Border should be secure and if
not title 42 should stay in place and
then the Democrats on the other side are
concerned that this move by deploying
troops and taking a more serious stance
against immigration will ultimately harm
their long-term immigration agenda

the two nations are discussing a

it will allow three things first the U.S

personnel to Finland second it can store
its weapons and third Washington can
invest in the necessary infrastructure
nuclear weapons are off the table at
least for now
in May last year Finland had first
decided to give up on its long-held
neutrality the country applied to join
the NATO alliance after almost a year of
getting a nod from everyone it became a
member on 4th of April of NATO this
immediately meant that the land border
between Russia and NATO would be double
as before this new agreement works could
be
a boost in helsinki's defense
capabilities but United States might be
eyeing a bigger game here
with Finland just being a layover this
brings us to the Arctic a region long
untouched and hardly talked about but
the melting ice sheets are revealing
what Nature has long kept a secret below
the ice lies a Fortune of unexploited
oil and natural gas resources and it's
not just that climate change
is opening new routes for shipping some
are appearing to be shortcuts as well
so now everyone wants a piece of the
melting Arctic as well
this ring of our planet is called the
Arctic Circle the council governing this
region has eight countries in total the
rule is that only countries in the
circle can be part of the council there
are Finland Canada Greenland Iceland
Norway Sweden the United States and
Russia while Moscow is a member the
Arctic seven suspended cooperation with
the country after the invasion so
Vladimir Putin had has done the next
best thing
he's brought in a proxy member enter
China Beijing calls itself a near-arctic
country collaboration with Russia is
both an opportunity and a challenge
Arctic definitely interests China but Xi
Jinping should carefully avoid being
ostracized by other countries in the
region now a big question is for how
long will the china-russian cooperation
last because more than Mutual interests
it seems to be external conflicts that
have brought the two countries together
and investing in the Arctic cannot be a
short-sighted strategy either so China
needs to be in it for the long haul if
at all
in a sense the impact of Russia's war in
Ukraine has spread to the Arctic region
as well the interest is not new but the

Russia respects including Finland being

defeated the Soviet Army in the winter
War before World War II so I think it at

strengths that NATO has and the effect

foreign
[Music]
will Finland become a new front in the
Ukraine Russia War I'm asking this
keeping in mind the recent developments
being talked about quite a bit here in
London
I'm talking about a bilateral agreement
one that Finland and the U.S are
negotiating
and this bilateral agreement allows
America to use Finnish military bases
and this is according to a report by
helsingin sanamat it says that the
agreement that is being chalked out
allows American troops to station
equipment in Finland also allowing
America to build infrastructure in
Finland and establish military bases in
Finland
why is this important
let me show you
let's just have a look at this map look
at where Finland is located
it shares a 1 340 kilometer long border
with Russia the country that is
currently fighting a war with Ukraine
now that is just for the context while
the finer details of this agreement are
not out as of now neither is the
timeline for when the American Equipment
will be arriving in Finland one cannot
help but ask whether Finland will become
a new front in this war
you'll see this is not the first time
that America will be stationing its
military or military equipment in
another country
in fact far from it the U.S has similar
agreements with other NATO countries as
well with Norway for example where it
has invested 170 million dollars into an
airport near Oslo Finland became a NATO
member less than a month ago and I don't
know how many of you remember this
but it was Russia's invasion of Ukraine
that prompted Finland to join the NATO
80 of the country's people voted in its
favor by the way and now this agreement
with America is being chalked out at the
war in Ukraine continues
how does Russia see this is the
immediate question before it invaded
Ukraine Russia repeatedly complained
about NATO's expansion in fact it was
one of the many pretexts of this
invasion
when Finland was roped into the NATO
U.S President Joe Biden told the entire
world that Europe is more united than
ever
why don't I read out that quote for you
right now
when Putin launched his brutal war of
aggression against the people of Ukraine
he thought he could divide Europe and
the NATO he was wrong today we are more
united than ever
you see access to Finnish territory has
helped the NATO in more ways than one
first it helps the NATO dominate the
Baltic Sea second it provides a new
route for reinforcement via Estonia
basically Finland helps the NATO
strengthen its forward defense
and what's more The Finnish military is
considered to be extremely capable
in fact analysts say unlike most
European countries Finland never really
stopped preparing for a potential War
basically Finland takes all the right
boxes for the NATO and the news of the
bilateral agreement between Finland and
the U.S coming at a time when Russia has
Unleashed a fresh missile attack on
Ukraine
killing two people and injuring several
others in bakmut the battle appears to
be turning it's a crucial Point Ukraine
claiming Russian forces are being pushed
back in bakmut
in fact the Commando of Ukraine's Ground
Forces
Colonel General Alexander cyrusky Singh
and I'm quoting the situation in
bhagmuth is quite difficult in certain
parts of the city the enemy was
counter-attacked by our units and left
some positions
in short the back and forth in bhagmud
continues and whether or not Finland
becomes the next front in the war here
is the question neither of the sides can
choose to ignore can either Ukraine or
Russia afford to drag the war
U.S estimate saying that Russia has lost
20 000 troops in the last five months
let me just repeat that for you 20 000
troops in five months and half of these
were Wagner Mercenaries
now you may take these numbers with a
pinch of salt given that these are
Western estimates but even then the high
casualty in this war remains a fact
and here's what else does Ukraine also
cannot afford another offensive I know
we've been saying this on gravitas and
now even Ukraine's Western friends are
saying the same thing
the West is concerned that Ukraine's
Army is not prepared for a
counter-offensive
and this despite the Western Aid
Russia Sputnik is reporting this citing
a British news Outlet it says and I'm
quoting
the news Outlet also cited one of
pentagon's leaked defense documents as
arguing that Ukraine might fail to amass
sufficient troops and weaponry and fall
well short of its goals for regaining
territory unquote
so you have massive casualties and lack
of insufficient resources
which brings us back to the question
can either of the sides afford to drag
on this war
the answer may be no and there are clear
signs of War weariness
and it leaves the warning sides with
only one solution and that is peace
interestingly enough Pope Francis has
said that the Vatican is part of the
peace process to end the war in Ukraine
and what is this peace process what are
its terms and conditions what exactly is
on the table and what's not
this is what Pope Francis has to say
the mission is in the course now but it
is not yet public and when it is public
I will reveal it
here in the UK prime minister Rishi
sonak has some questions to answer
yet again over his wife's finances
in fact labor leader Kiest statement has
sent alarm bells ringing what is this
all about what exactly did akshita murti
do this time
let me just break it down for you over
the next few minutes but before that
let's just have a look at what the
statement really is all about
labor leader kiesta messing and I'm
quoting I think there are questions to
answer in relation to this there seems
to be an emerging pattern of behavior
here so I think the sooner those
questions are answered the better
now where exactly is this coming from
what's going on
as it turns out a company partially
owned by Rishi sonak's wife has received
taxpayer cash and it was no ordinary
amount by the way
Morty runs an investment company named
katamaran Ventures Limited catamaran in
turn holds around 2500 shares in a
startup called study hall the startup
was founded by Sofia fenichel it is
developing an Adaptive learning platform
for students
interestingly in 2022 study hall
received around 437 thousand dollars in
government grant it covers the period
between August 2022 and August 2023.
this by the way means the bid was made
before sanak became the premier but
likely when he was the chancellor
you see the startup had akshita murti's
interest and suddenly it was blessed
with government funds
I hope you realize it is the taxpayers
money we are talking about here Downing
Street Insider saying that the decision
was external to the government
a funding panel made the final ruling
and not the ministers
but can we really rule out Foul Play
here
who knows if a few strings were pulled a
few backs were scratched those are the
questions that are being raised because
there is a pattern here
first it was murthy's non-domicile
status she saved millions of dollars
remember on her tax bill as per reports
all the while when cost of living was
soaring in the UK and people were
struggling here to make ends meet
and then her States in child care agency
Kuru kids came under the microscope
we have reported on this before as well
's wife owns shares in a Child Care
Agency Coro kids and she became a
shareholder this was on the 6th of March
and only nine days later on the 15th of
March the spring budget was unveiled
new child care policies were introduced
new child minders were given an
incentive of 746 dollars but this
incentive doubled under one condition
child care workers who joined through an
agency would receive nearly fifteen
hundred dollars
and as of now six agencies are involved
in this scheme
and guess what
is one of them
Jeremy Hunt has given taxpayers money to
murthy's company
former Health secretary Matt Hancock
also has a stake in koru kids
using her husband's position for
personal profits is the immediate
question because simply put it's highly
likely that sonak family will benefit
from the new policy
but ditsunak admit to this when he was
grilled by the empties he did not
in fact he firmly said he had no other
interests
and now embroiled in a parliamentary
probe and as if that wasn't enough
here's another company with links to
murti
receiving public cash this pattern have
not evaded the MPS or even the public
eye
saying sunak has some questions to
answer
and what exactly are these questions
well to begin with asunox public duties
coinciding with his private interests
and what explains murthy's company
getting government grants
and why was the knock reluctant to
declare his wife's States in koru kids
is it all just a coincidence
or is there something more to this
and how exactly to the britons feel
about it
as you know it is the coronation week
Rishi sanak and wife akshita Murthy will
be leading the procession of flag
bearers at King Charles's coronation
in fact sonak will also read out Bible
verse
how will it bought with britons amid all
the controversies
on Monday Joe Biden held an Eid
celebration at the White House and in
his speech he thanked the Muslim
Americans for their contribution to the
country
this event was meant to celebrate
diversity you know to make everyone feel
welcomed to make the minority feel
included
that was the entire point of it
but did that really happen
a Muslim mayor was barred from entering
the White House you heard that right
on what grounds
well it's not known because the Secret
Service refused to explain
our next report getting you the complete
story
the White House held a reception on
Monday what was the occasion to Mark the
end of the holy month of Ramadan
the White House was belatedly
celebrating Eid al-fitr several
dignitaries were invited several Muslim
Americans attended the celebrations
U.S President Joe Biden lauded Muslims
for their indispensable contributions to
America at one point he even quoted the
Holy Quran even condemned targeted
violence and islamophobia but what
happened behind the scenes tells a
different story
New Jersey mayor Muhammad kairula was
set to arrive at the White House for the
celebrations but all of a sudden he was
disinvited
why apparently he hadn't been cleared
for an entry into the White House
by whom the Secret Service when asked
why the Secret Service officials
declined to detail can you see the irony
here on one hand America is celebrating
diversity but it is also on the other
hand denying a Muslim mayor entry into
the very same celebrations
why did this happen because of false
profiling when mayor kairula relayed the
incident to American Islamic relations
Council he was informed that there has
been a misunderstanding
a person with his name and birth date
was in a terrorist screening data set
the data is handled by the FBI how did
kairullah feel about this he was
obviously disappointed here's what the
mayor said
it left me baffled shocked and
disappointed it's not a matter of I
didn't get to go to a party it's why I
did not go and it's a list that has
targeted me because of my identity and I
don't think the highest office in the
United States should be down with such
profiling
unfortunately this wasn't the first time
the mayor had faced such discrimination
in 2019 kairula was returning to the U.S
after visiting his family in Turkey
he was interrogated at New York's John F
Kennedy International Airport for three
hours he was questioned whether he knew
any terrorists in another incident he
was briefly held at the U.S Canada
border again for no fault of his kairula
was elected to his first term as the
mayor of New Jersey in 2001. he has been
New Jersey's longest serving mayor and
he has been an American citizen since
the year 2000.
kairula is a high profile and
well-respected American Muslim figure
and if someone like him is being treated
like this one can only imagine how
America treats those without the same
privilege as a man Bureau report we on
world is one from being overweight
since the Russia Ukraine War started
any country with trade ties with Moscow
any trade ties was accused of standing
on the wrong side of History by Europe
and now as the war continues Europe
struggles to meet with its domestic oil
demands
so what does it do to fix its domestic
crisis
well it decides to re-route Russian oil
the very same Russian oil it preached
the world about
our next report telling you more
remember the times when you wrote banned
Imports of certain Russian Goods
remember when Europe expected the world
to follow suit
when it decided to lecture India for
importing Russian oil it hasn't been
that long has it
as the war in Ukraine rages on
the global order is changing Supply
chains are in a distorted shape trade is
becoming expensive and Global Dynamics
are suffering Europe is facing an
internal crisis it is struggling to meet
its domestic oil requirements this is
because nearly 5.6 million BPD or
barrels per day of crude oil is produced
in Russia it accounts for 13 of Global
Production but Europe has banned Diesel
and oil products from Russia and as a
result of this a major chunk of its oil
imports are stalled
so what does it do next how does it fix
the crisis it Imports Russian oil from
India it basically reroutes its oil
trade you see most of the oil that comes
into India is from Russia India refines
that oil India has 23 refineries
together they can refine up to
249.36 million tons of oil per annum now
Europe is tapping into this very oil
soon Europe is expected to import nearly
360
000 barrels of oil a day from India so
much so that India has become Europe's
largest supplier of refined oil
this spot was held by Saudi Arabia but
the country's oil exports have decreased
by 11.7 percent why just Europe the
United States too has increased certain
imports from India vacuum gas oil for
example in 2022 2023 India sent about 11
000 to 12 000 barrels per day of vacuum
gas oil shipment to the United States in
2021 to 2022 the number was around 500
barrels per day
Western hypocrisy much what else will
you call it Bureau report we on world is
one
our next story
still at between two of Indian crickets
tall worths have made news
in a match between Bangalore and Lucknow
Virat Kohli and Gotham gambhir got
caught in an argument
both the stars have been penalized for
what transpired
what exactly happened between the two
you are wondering
and where does one draw the line between
passion and sportsmanship
Indian Premier League
this is the most popular franchise
Cricket tournament in the world
it fell witness to the most brutal spat
between two high-profile figures
although this could be a source of
entertainment for some
fights can degrade the reputation of the
sport and the players as well
so what took place on the cricket ground
temples initially flared up between
Kohli and Ebola Naveen olhak
both had a verbal argument after the
16th over and this was more than just
friendly banter by the way the empires
had to step in and separate the two
players
the argument continued even after
Bangalore won the match
Koli and ulhak clashed again during the
fourth match handshakes and eventually
Lucknow team Mentor Gotham gambhi
decided to have a talk with Virat Kohli
but that shot between the two did not
end well
the fight between Kohli and gambhir was
then broken up by other players
in fact the Indian cricket board has
taken strict action against the duel
both have been fined with hundred
percent of their match fees
Naveen al-haq has also attracted a fine
of 50 percent of the match fees the
altercation has also spilled into social
media onto social media platforms
pictures are doing the rounds where
Kohli is seen silencing the crowd and
critics are calling this a sign of
arrogance after Bangalore won the match
pictures of Kohli showing the soul of
his shoe are also trending and this
seems to be a move to insult Naveen
ulhaq
and let us remind you here these
pictures are of a sportsman the world
looks up to
so does the penalty really matter to
these sportsmen
will it stop them from fighting in the
future
because history tells us otherwise
in 2013 the duo had a water worlds on
the field a verbal Clash after the match
had ended
Boats were again separated by other
players
in 2016 gambier's aggressive side was on
full display
when he threw a ball at Kohli in a fit
of rage
Virat Kohli is Infamous for his
aggression on the field and the top
layer has been involved in misconduct
like flicking the middle finger at the
crowd exchanging deadly stairs curse
words
and almost crashing into physical
altercations
we are talking about the most famous and
influential players here some of the
most famous ones players who are
aspiring who aspiring cricketers look up
to
is this where the sport is heading
a ground where Sportsmen argue spit out
curses while hundreds and thousands of
people watch
they disrespect the fellow players while
many children watch
the same children who say that they want
to be cricketers when they grow up
watch cricket witnessed more such fights
will Sportsmen fail to practice
sportsmanship
these are the questions that are being
asked
India is home to the world's longest
station platform
also the world's highest motorable pass
and very soon India will also be home to
the world's highest Railway Bridge
as I speak in fact this bridge is under
construction in Kashmir
our next report telling you more
this is Kashmir home to the world's
highest Railway Bridge located on the
chinab River of Kashmir this bridge is
1315 meters long
it is part of a broader project by the
Indian railways called The
udhamposhinagar baramul Rail Link which
aims to make the Kashmir Valley more
accessible this bridge is an engineering
Marvel to say the least
this structure uses 28 000 metric tons
of steel fabrication it is taller than
the Eiffel Tower and it is built on an
area that can accommodate half a
football ground
Also let's not forget Kashmir is
1850 meters above sea level which is
around about 6070 feet
these numbers explain the challenging
location of this bridge and stunning
craftsmanship that must have gone into
making it
in the past Kashmir has struggled with
connectivity issues given its high
altitude location and the China Bridge
comes as a big respite both in
connecting the state to the rest of
India and in opening the door to tourism
Revenue
the most distinguishing feature of this
bridge is that it is stable enough to
withstand an earthquake to the extent of
eight on the Richter scale and it's
expected to have a lifespan of 1 20
years authorities say the natural flu of
the chinab river was not Disturbed
during the construction of the bridge
not just the world's highest Railway
Bridge Kashmir will soon also be home to
four new Railway terminals which will be
constructed between baramulla and
banihal this in turn will make sure that
locals in the area have easy access to
the market
the China Bridge isn't the first Indian
Marvel that has caught Global headlines
India is home to the world's longest
station platform it's called Hubbly
Junction and it's located at a height of
1507 meters
it doesn't stop here India is also home
to the world's highest motorable pass
it's in ladakh and it is located at a
height of urban 19 300 feet

do you remember the NHS Club
in the year 2020 when the Wuhan virus
pandemic hit us
Britain clapped for its health workers
in fact it lauded the nurses working
with the NHS
the country's then prime minister called
them extraordinary
his government celebrated them as Heroes
but when it came to paying them
Britain chose to give them a negligible
hike
eventually leading to NHS workers
walking out
it's been two years the government has
changed there is a new prime minister
but the NHS staff is still staging
walkouts the last one being on the 1st
of May just the day after we landed here
nurses across the country in almost half
of England's hospitals were on strike
and we decided to witness the protest
firsthand just to try to understand what
their demands are all about we visited
Trafalgar Square where one such protest
was underway
we also spoke to a doctor working with
the NHS
here's a detailed report
it is one of the largest employers in
the world with over 1.2 million workers
across the UK it leads the world in
terms of equity of access and ensuring
no financial hardship for the ill but
can the nhf say the same for its staff
look at these images they are from the
1st of May these are nhf nurses and
workers protesting against poor wages
seeking a big hike from the government
we decided to visit Trafalgar Square to
witness one such demonstration and here
we met Dr Veer pushpak Gupta a doctor
and researcher with the NHS also a
member of the Royal Society of Medicine
we asked him about the sentiment within
the nhf and here's what he told us
doctors that are striking your Junior
doctors so basically Consulting level
and Below which form a majority of the
workforce when it comes to hospitals and
Hospital staff the nurses are striking
as well who form a majority of the
workforce not only in the hospitals but
also in the community so it is the
backbone of the NHS that it's striking
at this point
um the sentiment is rather
desperate in terms of how they want to
be looked at so if during Corona there
was a lot of respect for doctors and
nurses people came out and clapped
people came out and showed their respect
and it was really
well received by the NHS but as soon as
that finished a lot of the staff feels
like they were ignored at that point
obviously the Striking is about
increasing salaries which remains
shockingly low for uh Western world
nation
so what exactly are the NHS workers
demanding
inflation and two better working
conditions for the staff so why is the
government refusing to accept these
demands yes what we were told
I think budgeting concerns have been a
an issue in not only the NHS but a lot
of departments in the civil services in
England and in in Scotland and in Wales
in all the home Nations I think that the
government the budget of the NHS is
actually shockingly high it's a 280
billion pounds which is more than a lot
of countries GDP so they do have a
substantial budget if the government
were to pay uh and and pay the money
that the doctors and the nurses are
demanding it'll only cost them one
billion a year out of that 280 billion
the government's refusal to accept their
demands is proving to be catastrophic in
April 196
000 Hospital appointments had to be
canceled because of the strike
in March the strike disrupted over 175
000 appointments and procedures
and what does that tell you that the NHS
is nothing without its staff
it truly is the lifeline of the UK's
Health System it has developed the
status of National Treasure by treating
thousands of britons free of cost that
too over 106 years and never in its
history has the NHS witnessed industrial
action on such Escape
the number of protesters could increase
if their demands are not met so what is
the British government planning to do
well last we checked it had refused to
discuss raising salaries further raising
the prospects of more Strife Bureau
report we on world is one
people are celebrating the British
Royals but the coronation ceremony is
also attracting tension
anti-monarchy groups are raising their
voice against the Royals
the famous Trafalgar Square has been
bustling with protesters demonstrating
against different issues
in fact we witnessed some of these
protests what arguments are they putting
up and would these Mass scale protests
concern the Royals what are they all
about
our next report telling you all that you
need to know
a much needed tradition or an outdated
Royal ritual
the coronation ceremony excites many in
the UK
but this time it has ignited mixed
emotions why because Britain is reeling
under a cost of living crisis people are
starving due to skyrocketing prices
citizens are unable to pay high cost
energy bills
and a large chunk of workers surviving
without a pay
so ever since King Charles III have
taken the help of the British Monarchy
protests have often broken out on the
streets of London
a host of famous sites across the city
witnessing small uprisings
this is Trafalgar Square
Mass groups are gathering here every
week
voices are being raised various flats
are being weaved
and demonstrations are taking place
against the monarchy
we decided to talk to people and
understand what they think about it
feels crazy there is also the teachers
have also been striking the train
strikes even like the cleaners which
most of them are Latin Americans and I
am from a Latin American Community it
feels again like so it rages to feel
that the country has money to spend in
something that is so
I don't know so outdated like what what
is that given to the people and I
understand that there's one of the
arguments is that it involves it brings
tourism tourism is not going to solve
anything
while talking to demonstrators and
protesters we understood one major cause
of anger among the people
the funding of the royal ceremony
the coronation ceremony is being
financed from the public purse
this means taxpayers are paying for the
ceremony
the same taxpayers who are struggling
are made an economic crisis
I'm not from here and I I feel like the
hate that I might be getting after
saying that I don't really understand
why monarchy still exists and the amount
of money that goes into that when
there's so many people that don't have
what to eat or there are people that
have no shelter so it feels like a slap
in the face of so many people and the
entire population of this country so
it's actually shameful
Trafalgar Square has become a hub for
critics of the royal event why do people
choose the bustling Square for protests
well it is named after Britain's victory
in a battle
the victories shattered Napoleon a
dictator planned to invade England
if we see it this way the protests also
seem to be a battle between Royals and
the common people
I'm standing right now at London's
iconic Trafalgar Square One of the major
hubs of Central London named after the
battle of the falga between the British
royal Navy and the combined fleets of
the French and Spanish movies it is a
very prominent site which Witnesses
celebrations events even protests and
today is no different
the tradition is outdated we are not
interested in the event
these were the answers we got when we
asked people about the coronation
ceremony
what could be the reason
on the whole I think like like a lot of
young people I'm not super like into the
monarchy like I've lived here my whole
life but I'm not
I don't think it's as big a deal for
young people as it is for kind of older
people so I would never go and watch it
just because of the crowds and stuff so
yeah I mean honestly I didn't even
realize that it was going to be next
weekend until today
studies show that support for the Royals
has fallen to the lowest since 1983
the national Center for social research
saying a total of 45 people said they
did not support the monarchy in 2022 35
people said that they were not
interested in the Royals
this is a significant drop in the
support for the Royal Family
I think it's just a kind of like
outdated I guess with this whole thing
with like
Meghan Markle and Harry I feel like they
had a bit of an opportunity like a
window where they could modernize and
the face of the monarchy could change
but I feel like it just went the wrong
way and things like became very weird
and everyone was like kind of looking at
you know Charles he's not super popular
especially with the crown and stuff and
then a lot of people liked like younger
people liked Megan and Harry and thought
they were modern
there are more protests being planned
for coronation day the 6th of May
an anti monarchy group The Republic is
organizing rallies all over England and
Scotland
the demonstrations are aimed at the main
agenda and aim to replace the king as
the head of state by an elected official
Republic has upheld its agenda
and says that an elected head of state
will represent the people's hopes and
this will help keep politicians in check
we will be tracking the coronation
celebrations and the protests as we move
closer to the ceremony day
no matter what unfolds on the coronation
day
Britain is surely in for a grand show
so you've seen the protests and you've
seen the strikes but if not all gloom

overall in Japan in the latest a first
law has been introduced against filming
sexual acts without someone's consent
the law has laid out the most probable
cases expected and the thoroughness is
deliberate lawmakers don't want to leave
any room for compromise the bill
explicitly prohibits taking distribution
and possession of photos or videos of
someone's genitals without their consent
it doesn't end here
in case someone is manipulated into
sexual positions even then the
perpetrators will not be allowed to walk
Freer the bill also bans the filming of
children in a sexual manner in Japan
child models mostly girls are routinely
portrayed in sexually provocative ways
until now such criminal cases had to be
prosecuted under local laws so there was
no one kind of ruling it often varied on
case-to-case basis but the reforms are
expected to be passed in June this year
and offenders would face either
imprisonment of up to three years or a
fine of up to 22 000 US Dollars there
has been a visible outcry by the
Japanese people in the past few years
there is no data available for last year
but a year before that in 2021 Japanese
police saw a record number of cases with
non-consensual sexual content
which was made more than 5000 arrests
which were also made this is about three
times the cases in 2010. Japan has been
looking at several penal code changes to
strengthen legislation against sex
crimes in February this year the
government proposed raising the age of
consent from 13 to 16. the statute of
limitations for reporting rape will also
be increased to 15 from 10 years

But the ...,2023-05-02T15:43:38Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eSarJluGfZY/hqdefault.jpg,"exactly a month since finland's long
fight to join NATO United States has
made its first strategic move the two
nations are discussing a military
agreement as we speak
it will allow three things number one
the U.S will be allowed to station its
military personnel to Finland number two
it can store its weapons and the number
third is Washington can invest in the
necessary infrastructure nuclear weapons
are off the table at least for now
now in may last year Finland had first
decided to give up on its long-held
neutrality the country applied to join
the NATO alliance after almost a year of
getting a nod from everyone it became a
member on 4th of April this year this
immediately meant that the land border
between Russia and NATO has doubled this
new agreement works could
could be a boost in helsinki's defense
capabilities but United States might be
eyeing a bigger game here with Finland
just being a layover
this brings us to the Arctic a region
long untouched and hardly talked about
but the melting ice sheets are revealing
what Nature has long kept a secret below
the ice lies a Fortune of unexploited
oil and natural gas resources and it's
not just that climate change is opening
new routes for shipping some are
appearing to be shortcuts as well
so now everyone wants a piece of the
melting Arctic region
the Ring of our planet is called the
Arctic Circle the council governing this
region has eight countries in total the
rule is that only countries in the
circle can be part of the council
that of Finland Canada Greenland Iceland
Norway Sweden the United States and
Russia while
while Moscow is a member after its
invasion of Ukraine the Arctic seven
suspended cooperation with the country
so Vladimir Putin has done the next best
thing bring in a proxy member enter
China Beijing calls itself a near-arctic
country collaboration with Russia is
both an opportunity and a challenge
Arctic definitely interests China but Xi
Jinping should carefully avoid being
ostracized by other countries in the
region now a big question is for how
long will the China Russian cooperation
last because more than Mutual interests
external conflicts have brought the two
countries together and investing in the
Arctic cannot be a short-sighted
strategy China needs to be in it for the
Long Haul
in
in a sense the impact of Russia's war in
Ukraine has spread to the Arctic region
the interest is not new but the heat in
geopolitics is changing how the ice
melts so the race to the Arctic is just
getting started and U.S China and Russia
are all eyeing the region

news on the British prime minister Rishi
sunak and his troubles because he's
under investigation by the Parliamentary
Watchdog over alleged failure to declare
shares in his wife's holds in an agency
benefiting from a recent budget well now
it's been emerged at the UK's prime
minister his wife is a shareholder in a
company that received public money and
the labor party is seeking answers well
let's go through the details now so the
Sunday Times reported that an education
startup that an investment company
controlled by akshata Mercy has a
financial interest in was given UK grant
money now in 2022 the education startup
study hall received a government grant
through a body called innovate UK which
helps companies develop new products or
Services well decisions on what
Innovative UK will invest in are made up
by of funders or hitting out labor
leader kirstarmer said there seems to be
an emerging pattern of behavior when it
comes to financial interests of the
sunac family the labor leader said that
the UK prime minister has questions to
answer
will soon act reflects allegations of
wrongdoing however this will likely
increase calls for more transparency
about the sunac family's money and of
course business interests as well all
the funds provided by the UK government
comes Under The edtech Innovation fund
started by National Endowment for
science technology and the Arts the main
aim of the organization is to support
Innovation there are many other edtech
firms who are listed as grantees under
this scheme well to understand more
about this story we have a guest joining
us now Renault vocal joining us a
political analyst and Senior lecture at
Lancaster University good to see you
Reno
hi Renault can you hear me there so we
are talking about this latest storm with
Richardson in particular his wife's
interest what's your initial thoughts do
you think Kirsten's right to want more
answers
it's the right moment to think about the
transparency in the system in particular
because Russia sunak and his wife are
extremely wealthy so it's very unlikely
that they desperately need money or did
something illegal to try to avoid
scrutiny but the fact of the matter is
that yes indeed she did did not declare
all the interests of his wife simply
because I don't think he felt it was
relevant but there is a big problem in
the last 20 years of British politics
whenever we talk about the possibility
of conflict of interest there is a big
struggle between the privacy of
politicians I think which is and his
wife went to keep some privacy about
their interest and a big big big public
demand for some kind of transparency in
the debate so there is an Ethics advisor
for the Prime Minister I don't think the
system has been thought for a situation
in which prime minister's partner or
wife is someone who is extremely worthy
has a lot of investment interest I think
she must have invested in many many
different sectors of the British economy
and she doesn't have to declare
everything all the time but at some
point I think it does make sense to
think Whenever there is a decision on
public investment Whenever there is a
new policy to think about how could it
benefit the Prime Minister and maybe to
be a little bit more transparent about
that I don't think there is any call to
discuss about corruption or active
personal enrichment but there is
definitely the appearance of conflict of
interest and in a country that is really
trying so hard to rebuild trust in
politics I think it is extremely
important to think very carefully about
that
yeah I think what you just said there is
key the transparency factor in all of
this just kind of the the system aside
just the fact that they are
multi-billionaires do you think that
there is a problem with someone being
the head of a country who is that rich
because
maybe they can't relate to the average
person is that an issue do you think
I think um it is clearly priced in in
the politics of rishisuna that he's
perceived as someone a bit out of touch
but people trust him as this character
of a serious businessman so he will not
relate to ordinary people like perhaps
Boris Johnson did what is seen as this
more competent successful businessman
even though in practice it's largely his
wife with who he narrated a lot of money
he looks like this business-like person
also because of his education also it's
a peculiar moment in British politics
history that just before
um Rishi sonak I mean there was a
parenthesis but just before it was the
years of Boris Johnson and Maurice
Johnson at the exact opposite problem he
needed a lot of cash all the time to
sustain his lifestyle and this cash he
received it through a suspect or
non-transparent loans from people
um the the chairman of the BBC just
resigned because he helped facilitating
a loan just to sustain the lifestyle of
Boris Johnson it also emerged that he he
lives at the moment ran free somebody's
giving him a house somewhere he receive
hundreds of thousands of pounds so after
the time of Johnson where there was a
disparate need of the Prime Minister to
get cash it might see be seen as a
relief to if someone who does not need
that cash however in practice it's true
that in terms of the very electoral
concern of the conservative party they
will try to convince the people in the
north of England who voted
overwhelmingly for Boris Johnson in 2019
that rishisanek is someone to represent
them he will struggle to look like this
working-class person that is definitely
not
yeah I think that's really interesting
what you say about it being kind of a
relief in a way and I suppose there's an
argument to say that he doesn't need the
job as the Prime Minister he wants it
which is always a encouraging uh Renault
thank you so much indeed for your time
today at political adolescence senior
lecture there from at Lancaster
University live from Lancaster here are
we on today
right so now the UK labor party has come
under Fire over the appointment of
former senior civil servant Sue gray who
also happens to be the person allegedly
responsible for orchestrating the party
Gate scandal well that became the key
reason as well for the fall of the
former UK prime minister Boris Johnson
well Sue gray uh well her allies they
believe she is facing a political Witch
Hunt as the UK government is set to
conclude the pro that's looking into
whether or not gray broke the civil
service code well later today the UK
ministers are expected to announce the
findings of this internal inquiry She's
accused of holding talks with the labor
party about her new role in the
opposition party without informing Civil
Service officials now according to Grace
supporters the investigation is designed
to delay her joining the labor party or
reports claim in the chief of UK Civil
Service Simon case wants to block Gray
from working for labor well after the
probe is concluded the committee will
share its recommendation with the UK
prime minister Rishi sunak and he is
expected to make a final ruling on the
matter however a prime minister does not
have the power to block an appointment
as such well government sources have
denied the claims of the pro being
personal also refusing that at Gray's
progress in the civil service was
blocked by the case while the case
continues

London is bustling with excitement and
frenzy as well as the country prepares a
fully coronation of King Charles III or
the Royal ceremony is scheduled to take
place at Westminster Abbey on May the
6th followed by a concert on May the 7th
at the Windsor Castle grounds well the
stage is set for a weekend of noble Pomp
and pageantry in the British Capital the
event is touted to be an automation of
thousand-year-old traditions and
contemporary editions as well to the
affair
well the UK has pulled out all the stops
to celebrate the sacred occasion the
Royal Parade has nearly 8
000 people participating with over 700
Guardsmen officers and band members
rehearsing for the king's procession
from Buckingham Palace to Westminster
Abbey well historic Investments not one
since the coronation of Queen Elizabeth
II are also being prepared for the
crowning ceremony these Royal robes
which have not been worn in 70 years are
usually up for public display at the
Tower of London well on May the sake
King Charles III will wear the same
Royal vestments that his mother Queen
Elizabeth II more during her coronation
well during the event Charles will wear
an embroidered gown made of gold silk
and over that he will wear the Imperial
mantle made with King George IV in 1821.
well the massive Arrangements also
include the return of the oldest of the
UK's Royal golden coach to London
however the coach is not just for public
display the king and queen consort will
be carried in another golden cage with a
coronation function well the ceremonial
also Mark many firsts for this momentous
event for the first time in British
history is people have been invited to
take a pledge for True allegiance to the
King and his heirs and successors the
Declaration which will be known as the
chorus of the people will replace the
traditional homage of peers or reports
also suggest UK's non-Christian
communities including the Muslim seek
Buddhist and Judas leaders will deliver
a greeting at the coronation as
Neighbors in Fe
and Reporting from London we have our
Molly there who has been sending us
updates
London is getting a royal makeover As It
prepares for the coronation ceremony
which is slated for the 60th of May and
to the other levels of soaring after all
it is a ceremony which is taking place
after 70 years and a lot has changed
since then but the coronation ceremony
itself has not changed much over the
past 1 000 years the ceremony this year
will be attended by around a 2000 gift
including foreign Kings in Queens
dignitaries world leaders British
politicians even religious figures and
some experts have compared a
coordination to a wedding saying that
except for getting married to a spouse
the Monarch is getting married to the
state and a lot of questions of course
also that have been raised over spending
all that money on a ceremony like this
at a time when the UK is grappling with
a cost of living crisis that the common
people are bearing the brontos
it is important to
give attention to the royal family and
show them
that the people love them and
yeah I just think the royal family is
very important to the people of the of
UK as an American we're we really like
the royal family
it's a good story I
it's exciting I think it's fun to see
how the city is energized and decorating
and all the color it's like really
interesting to see like how London is
being prepared for all of this and like
you can see see it everywhere like this
beam and
we are I'm first time in London so it's
like even more interesting and
fascinating
is really finally setting insight for
the UK nurses strike issue well the UK
government and National Health Service
officials are to meet members of 14 NHS
unions or the unions are expected to
declare whether a majority of members
are in favor of the deal well the NHS
unions who have rejected the deal are
still continuing their industrial action
well this includes the Royal College of
Nursing however the RCN needs to hold
another strike ballot hel secretary
Steve Barkley says the five percent pay
offer is the government's best and final
offer meanwhile the RCN Chief Pat
Collins said that Sue Barclay has lost
the public support while adding that the
Striking nurses are not going to go away
well this comes after Barclay described
the industrial action by nurses as
premature and disrespectful
the UK Health secretary will also be
meeting the British Medical Association
to find a common ground with the
Striking Junior doctors as well or the
BMA wants 35 of an increase to make up
for 15 years they say
well for more details we do have Alex
with us just now Alex ISAT she sent us
this report from London
the government is meeting with 14
representatives of NHS staff workers
later today as it tries to push ahead of
five percent pay rise increase and now a
few of the unions did accept the
government's deal and that is a unite
and the GMB Union but Unison and the
Royal College of nurses overwhelmingly
voted no against the pay rise that the
government had offered saying it wasn't
just about the money it was also about
the workload however if this five
percent does get pushed through it would
mean that all of those and the NHS
whether or not they are throughout Union
that was for or against we'll be getting
an extra five percent pay rise and a
potential extra bonus on top of that as
well and it could move towards
potentially having no further strikes
although the RCN are also voting to buy
their members to decide if they want to
go forward and hold another six month
mandate which means that they could
strike until Christmas but until then it
looks like the strikes May well be on
hold this is Alex Isaac reporting for
weon world is one
and also reporting from London Molly
Gambier spoke to Dr Veer pushback Gupta
an NHS doctor and researcher and a
member of the Royal Society of Medicine
with me is Dr V pushpa Gupta NHS doctor
and researcher and a member of Royal
Society of medicine thanks very much for
being here with us welcome to Beyond
world is one thank you we are speaking
at a time when the coronation ceremony
is just days away we've also seen weeks
of controversies a lot of criticism as
far as the coronation ceremony is
concerned the fact that it's taking
place at a time when the UK is
witnessing a cost of living crisis to
the extent that it is we're also talking
at a time when nurses in England are
taking a strike action in half of
England's hospitals Health
Community and Mental Health Services as
well so how exactly do you see this
contrast really playing out what does it
mean to you
um we're looking at a changing point in
in Britain and that changing Point has
been coming for many years now if you
look at the NHS on its own one of the
largest employers in the world employs
up to 1.8 to 3 million people
um it is at a point of breaking as we
speak uh something needs to be done
Health needs to be coming from the
government much faster than it is uh the
nurses have been striking continuously
now uh for the last month or so there's
been multiple strikes by nurses there's
been a strike by doctors there's another
strike by doctors that happened just
last week a couple of weeks ago so uh
things need to to change and change for
the positive and as you said yourself
there's a cost of living crisis
inflation levels have gone up brexit has
sort of uh perpetrated that as well so a
lot of of many crises that are forming
in Britain that need to be resolved and
I think with the coronation coming this
may be a chance for a new beginning for
Britain and its people and I think most
people are looking forward to that
change uh King Charles along with the
current government of Rishi sunak will
need to work together to to solve these
crisis so that we can move forward than
Britain can have its place in the world

threatened to shutter records and more
intense heat waves sizzle the globe each
year researchers have found that heat
stress burden is not only dependent on
local climate but also on humidity that
can erase cooling benefits which come
from trees and vegetation alike a study
led by Yale School of environment
investigated the combined effect of
temperature and humidity on Urban heat
stress using observational data and an
urban climate model calculation as
temperatures globally reach record level
highs and urban areas face increased
heat stress the global South contends
with an additional complicating Factor
Urban humid Heat
the analysis reveals that heat stress is
another Urban microclimate phenomenon
called the urban dry Island that tends
to be less humid than the surrounding
rural land to conduct the study
researchers developed a framework on how
Urban Land modified both air temperature
and air humidity and showed that these
two effects have equal weight and heat
stress as measured by the wet bulb
temperature and contrast to other heat
indexes which weigh temperature more
heavily than humidity
now as green vegetation can lower air
temperature through water evaporation
but it can also increase heat burden
because of air humidity the question
then is to what extent this humidifying
effect erases the cooling benefit
arising from temperature reduction
now with hazards of humid heat projected
to increase soon these effects May
amplify heat risk in cities of the
global South at the same time
researchers hope that the findings of
this study lead to further research on
how lush green and built up Urban spaces

lengthened 2300 meter Runway and radar
station and visible as of late March on
the southern tip of great cocoa just
beyond the causeway connecting the
islands is evidence of land clearing
efforts indicating construction work to
come
now these signs of construction have
provoked concern that China which
Myanmar has grown increasingly dependent
on after the February 2021 cool could
stand to gain from intelligence gathered
there either through Espionage or
intelligence sharing more so because
prior to the coup in 2020 about 40
percent of myanmar's foreign debt of 10
billion dollars was owed to China and by
all means this has increased after the
coup given how China is also supplying
arms to the military Hunter
now here's what experts are saying about
the development
Jason Tower Myanmar country director at
the United States Institute of Peace
saying
with Myanmar reliant on China for
international support and economic
development it's extremely likely that
the Army would share intelligence with
Beijing and support China's strategic
initiatives and this presents a
significant challenge to Regional
security and will likely generate
significant tensions between China and
India in the Bay of Bengal now how will
it generate tensions with India is the
question let me explain this to you
first and foremost great cocoa is small
at 11 kilometers in length but its
location is strategically important if
not only close to the street of Malacca
one of the world's busiest shipping
lanes but it also lies 55 kilometers
from India's Andaman and nicobar Islands
which host Indian Navy and Air Force
bases
so the militarization of the cocoa
Islands by the tathmodo combined with
the wider Chinese developments occurring
Inland code force a significant security
challenge to India and its Navy
especially near the Andaman and nicobar
Islands which provide India's eastern
Fleet strategic depths in the Bay of
Bengal and command approaches to the
street of Malacca
but after China gets access to Great
cocoa Chinese commercial shipping could
soon bypass the streets and offload
their Cargo in Myanmar nullifying
India's advantage and that's not all
great cocoa could also be used as
leverage in negotiations with Delhi it
can be used to extract economic support
and maintain India's engagement with the
Junta and just to put it simply for
India great Cocoa Island was in the past
a place for outlandish theories it may
now become a real point of concern soon
our next story is from Sudan even though
the Warwick size agreed to extend a
truth fighting still continues to
intensify and Reports say over 500
people have been killed while Millions
remain trapped in Khartoum thousands of
victims are starving without food or
shelter and a war between the military

chaos could this lead to a refugee
crisis as well with the warring factions
continue to disrespect the ceasefire our
next report telling you more
Sudan's capital Khartoum was supposed to
feel the relief of a ceasefire
a momentary truce meant to let people
flee the capital
the true skull came about due to
intensive diplomatic efforts by several
Nations
but it remained a virtual non-starter
the rapid support forces couldn't wait a
few hours airstrikes continue to pound
Khartoum the death toll continues to
rise as the two sides fight for power
Sudan's former prime minister Abdullah
has raised concerns of long-term
troubles
he said that the conflict could become
worse than those in Syria and Libya
the United Nations said a ripple effect
could be felt across Africa this could
be true as hamdog has stated this is not
the Army looking to crush a small
Rebellion it is practically like two
armies fighting with both sides
well-trained and well armed
hamdul sees the fight between the two
generals as a nightmare for the world
the ex-prime minister has called for an
international effort to persuade both
sides to hold peace talks
meanwhile chaos ranges on in for Sudan
where people are desperate to board
ships people are sleeping on the streets
and Food Supplies are running short
there are no homes or apartments here
people come and they come here to sleep
on the street women have nowhere to
shower there are children diabetic
people others with hearing impairments
and pregnant women thank God for
everything
foreign 's attempt at providing

Chief Martin Griffiths has been sent to
Sudan Griffith said the humanitarian
situation has reached Breaking Point
countries continue emergency efforts to
pull out their Nationals Britain pulled
out nearly 1900 people and has ended its
evacuation process
this is after it faced heavy criticism
on its evacuation operations
UK had decided to only rescue diplomats
and some of its citizens
the government made a u-turn and started
focusing on rescuing workers and more
citizens the U.S is also pushing to
rescue its people
several U.S citizens are being evacuated
to Saudi Arabia's Jeddah
India has shipped over 3000 citizens to
the Jeddah Port over 2 000 Indians
rescued from Sudan are back in India
under an intensive rescue operation
named kaveri
Sudan's Army has now urged people to
stay indoors as it plans to deploy more

Army is only widening the conflict and
planning to deploy the central Reserve
police a unit known for being brutal
against civilians is the world
witnessing another battle turning into a
war
can be stocks take place between the
warring factions how much longer must
tensions continue during a report Beyond
world is one
our next story is about a tweet that was
put out by Ukraine's defense Ministry
which has triggered a raging controversy
now that tweet that mean has now been
taken down but Indians are demanding an
apology what's the story all about our
next report telling you
foreign
[Music]
defense Ministry has parted controversy
on the internet it tweeted a meme that
has outraged Indians what was it about
let me tell you
it was a mockery of religious Sentiments
of Indians the picture short plumes of
smoke rising from a building
but it was morphed into the likeness of
a Hindu goddess reportedly by Ukrainian
artist Maxim palenko the meme showed a
woman who had blue skin she wore a
Garland of severed heads her tongue was
out Simply put it had striking
similarities to goddess Kali here comes
the controversial part the figure was
seen in a classic Marilyn Monroe pose
Yes you heard that right the meme was
posted from Ukraine defense Ministries
official Twitter handle and to top that
off it was captioned as a work of art
what kind of art is this Ukraine has
some explaining to do because Indian
netizens have taken offense the Tweet
was taken down after the backlash but it
had been viewed at least 585
000 times its screen grabs made rounds
on the internet users call the meme an
attack on religious sentiments many
labeled it Hindu phobic others call for
India's Ministry of external Affairs to
look into the matter
while the Ukraine defense ministry's
tweet has been deleted following the
backlash the controversy has not died
down
it's a tradition as old as the British
Empire
ceremony that we haven't seen in the
last 70 years
our day that promises to be one of the
grandest in British history witness the
coronation of King Charles III with me
Molly come here all the way from London
[Music]
take you behind the scenes to help you
understand what it takes to Crown the
British king we'll also show you what to
expect from the event the spectacular
Arrangement the spiritual dress
rehearsals the figures to watch out for
and of course the controversy
surrounding the event
watch the most comprehensive coverage in
the run-up to the coronation ceremony
all through this week with me Molly
gambir only on Leon world is what
[Music]
what goes down during a coronation what
happens behind the scenes why does King
Charles need it isn't he already the
king also how much money is being sent
on the coronation ceremony these are
some basic questions that come to one's
mind when they think of an event like
this and if you are one of them and are
confused about what the coronation
really is we've got you covered in our
next report
September 2022 upon the death of Queen
Elizabeth Charles succeeded his mother
to become UK's new monarch
all of 73 years of age he also became
the oldest person ever to accede to the
British throne
fellows ladies and gentlemen
it is my most sorrowful duty to announce
to you the death of my beloved mother
the queen
eight months on he is said to be
officially crowned as the king
extravagant coronation ceremony which
will be held on the 6th of May but what
exactly is this ceremony
why does Charles need it if he's already
King
how much money is being spent on the
event
and how is London preparing for it
we decided to find out
we traveled across the length and width
of London to gather every piece of
information about the event
[Music]
we started with the obvious question
what is a coronation
well the word itself is derived from the
Latin word Corona meaning Quran but it's
much more than literally placing the
crown on the sovereign's head it's a
symbolic coming together of the monarchy
the church and the state
a ritual during which the Monarch makes
bars to protect both the God and the
country
some experts say a coronation is similar
to a wedding but instead of a spouse the
Monarch is getting married to the fleet
how exactly well the 2000 people who
will witness the coronation in person
will be asked if they recognize him as
the Monarch after which he will be given
the coronation ring and asked to swear
Reynolds
next question why does Charles need a
carnation
isn't he already the UK's Monarch well
he is but this ceremony is needed to
formalize the transfer of title and
powers to him through an oath
a promise to our whole law Justice and
mercy as fundamental things matter
[Music]
coronation ceremonies in the UK have
changed little over the past 1000 Years
by law there is no need for such a
ceremony as the Monarch in a way takes
over the role after the deaths of the
predecessor automatically but they are a
symbolic gesture
symbolizing the commitment of the
Monarch to the Lord
so how long will the ceremony be well
Charles's coronation is expected to be
shorter than his mother's seven decades
ago back then the ceremony which was the
first live Royal event to be televised
ran for more than three hours
this time many experts are suggesting
it's likely to be closer to two hours
[Music]
and what about the crown
which Crown will the king wear
well there are two of them
the first is the Saint Edwards Crown
which will be used at the exact moment
of crowning the second is the Imperial
State Crown which will be worn after the
spiritual events of the ceremony next
question will there be a procession
this is a royal celebration of course
there's a procession in fact there will
be two through the streets of the
British capital on Coronation Day
one will take the king to be crowned and
after the service there will be a larger
parade back to Buckingham Palace where
the Monarch and members of the royal
family will make a balcony appearance
and watch a fly past
and last but not the least how much
money will this event cost
well it'll be a party Fit For A King
with an envious price tag to match
[Applause]
[Music]
the king's coronation is set to cost
millions and it falls on the taxpayer to
foot the bill while no budget has been
revealed for the occasion some
predictions suggest that it could cost
Britain somewhere between 50 to 100
million euros and while that does sound
like a lot it's way less than what the
previous monarchs have spent on their
crowning
so the countdown has begun all eyes are
on May 6th as Charles gets ground and
the sound of God Save the King Echo
across the United Kingdom Hills hoping
the sound doesn't get overshadowed by
the thunderous Rancor of not my king
protests
we'll report we on world is one
all right
going a party the question is who is
attending it and who all are on the
guest list well there are world leaders
there are foreign Royals as well
diplomats dignitaries celebrities
even relative leaders there are a total
of two thousand of them coming for the
coronation ceremony the question is is
there someone who is not we set out in
London in quest for some answers and
this is what we found
[Music]
in 1953 over 8 000 people crowded the
Westminster Abbey to witness the
coronation of Queen Elizabeth
[Music]
70 years old the coronation of her son
King Charles III will be a dramatically
slimmed down ceremony with roughly 2000
people attending the event
[Music]
the guest list has been prepared the
invitations have been sent out and the
confirmations of attendance have come in
foreign kings and queens British
politicians world leaders even religious
figures
they will all be joining the royal
family to witness the coronation
ceremony in fact the invitees are
expected to reflect a modern and
Multicultural Britain that will evolve
further under the new king
so who all are coming we'll start with
the political figures first French
president Emmanuel macro will be there
so will the Australian prime minister
Anthony albinizi Germany and Italy will
send their ceremonial precedence Frank
water steinmeyer and Sergio matarella
from Pakistan prime minister Sheba
Sharif will be attending the event
president Ferdinand bongbong Marcus Jr
and first lady Lisa arunetta Marcus will
represent the Philippines and lastly
Chinese vice president Han Zhang who
presided over a civil liberties
Crackdown in Hong Kong he's also on the
king's guest list a move that has been
branded quote-unquote outrageous by
conservative MPS if we speak of Royals
now besides the British royal family
there will be a glittering number of
foreign Royals this includes Prince
Albert II of Monaco and his wife
Princess Charlene King Philip VI and
queen Letizia of Spain King Carl's 16th
Gustav of Sweden King William Alexander
and queen Maxima of the Netherlands
Crown Prince Frederick and Crown
Princess Mary of Denmark the king and
queen of Norway will be represented by
Crown Prince hawkon and Crown Prince
mete Merit and lastly bhutan's king
jigmi kesar namgal wangchuk and queen
jet Superman wangchuk have also
confirmed their presence
if we speak of government
representatives and officials from
International organizations there is
Narayan prakash South Nepal's Minister
of Foreign Affairs Jill Biden the first
lady of the United States Roberta
metzola president of the European
Parliament Charles Mitchell president of
the European Council Ursula Wonderland
president of the European commission
Amina Jain Muhammad Deputy Secretary
General of the United Nations
on to the celebrities now there will be
Robin Atkinson David and Victor Beckham
Bear Grylls in his capacity as Chief
Scout of the Scout Association Amanda
Holden and Sir Bryn tearful Jones
and lastly what about the Royals while
it hasn't yet been publicly confirmed it
is guaranteed that nearly the entire
British royal family will be in
attendance except a few names the
biggest one being Meghan Markle The
Duchess of Sussex
Prince Harry will attend the coronation
of his father while his wife Meghan
Markle will stay at home in California
with their two children now it is
believed that her decision to stay back
is in part to do with the fact that the
coronation date of the 6th of May falls
on their son Archie's 4th birthday but
is that really the case
whatever be the case it seems the rest
of the royal family will be relieved
that Megan won't be there
after all they wouldn't want the
internal family drama to overshadow This
Global spectacle we report fion world is
one
and as promised we are getting you a
horse to
we're speaking to experts
range of voices just to piece together
the preparations and get you behind the
scenes as far as the big day the
coronation ceremony is concerned
a member of the labor party now he gave
his insights on the much awaited event
the king's coronation we also spoke to
him about the UK India relationship and
what it means at this point and where
things lie also about the Indian
diaspora in the UK take a look
with me right now ish Desai a British
Indian he is a member of the labor party
and he has represented City and East in
the London assembly since 2016.
uh very good to have you with us welcome
to Beyond world as one thank you thank
you for having me uh what about the
cream surrounding the ceremony you know
uh spending all that money on it at a
time when the UK is going through the
cost of living crisis that the people
the common people are wearing the
brontos well yes there have been some
criticism but look even it's like this
you know don't come around every year
it's a Once in a Lifetime you know uh
sort of event but you see look at the
value that events like this add to the
image of Britain uh we've been through
brexit through kovid we are trying to
re-establish a relationship with
countries like India post-brexit a very
very important trading partner for post
practice with Britain and events like
this of a value that you can't measure
in monetary terms you can just see
things uh like the coronation uh in
terms of money it's about the symbolic
value but how it strengthens our country
and our relationships and links with the
Commonwealth in particular uh India is
the important part of the Commonwealth
uh let's just talk about the role of the
Indian diaspora in the UK now you of
course are a British Indian the
contribution of Indians they also are
said to be among the wealthiest in this
out of the world so how do you see this
in terms of the relationship between the
UK and India this is where I think that
the British Indian Community is uh is
part of a very multi-racial
Multicultural Britain and this is where
why the British Indian diaspora uh and I
would say Indian diaspora all over the
world is actually taking part in the
celebrations marking the coronation
because the relationship between our two
countries is so important so whether we
are Indians living in India or British
Indians in this country
it is a relationship that has grown over
the years there have been tensions of
course no one's denying that we had very
little incident outside the Indian High
commission a few days ago about which I
formally protested to the Metropolitan
Police Commissioner whose office is just
behind us as to why those Securities
that day so but incidents like that will
not damage the strong relationship that
we have and that is why the coronation
ceremony is a very important certain
Milestone is strengthening the
relationship and talking about those
incidents and the activities of the
pro-kalistani elements in the UK why why
do you think uh they are on their eyes
and we are witnessing a frequency like
this uh at this point well firstly uh
there are people who by making some
noise have an influence that actually is
have a media impact that is far far
greater than their numbers uh is is a
few people even if you look at the
protests outside uh the high Commission
in terms of numbers it was it was small
the overwhelming majority of British
Indians uh no matter which part of India
they come from reject such actions uh
and as the Prime Minister the government
everyone's the foreign secretary is
strongly condemned it was a lapse of
security it should not have happened uh
it puts a section of the community in a
bad light but I would say that the
majority of foreign majority the people
I work with British Indians British
Punjabi British sex reject such uh such
actions let's just talk about your party
uh in a greater detail uh you know it's
been accused of
anti-india policies and also The
Unwanted remarks on aggregation of
article 370 the activism on Kashmir uh
do you think that that's drawn away the
British Indian water from your party our
challenge is to regain their trust there
was some remarks by Under the previous
labor party leader we did not represent
the real position Liberal Party
and what has said very clearly is that
he wants to restore those links with
India regain the trust of the British
Indian Community again
which is there has been lost to some
extent because of some some
irresponsible remarks right how how do
you see this entire controversy around
the BBC at this point the resignation of
Richard Sharp as well well I think it
shows the importance that we put on
transparency uh in in this country and
in a political structures
um Richard
shops the governor of the chairman of
the BBC uh was a prime minister's
appointment he should come out very
clearly about whatever leads he had
direct or indirect with the Prime
Minister uh it was a big slip on his
part and he's had to in my opinion he's
done the right thing by resigning you've
got to have absolute honesty and
integrity and transparency and openness
in politics uh and we demand the higher
standards of elected representatives
I just want to go back to what you
mentioned earlier about these Pro
kalistani elements what more do you
think the British government needs to do
to try and uh you know act against them
and clearly not enough is being done at
this point and how does the labor party
plan to change that uh what are you
planning to do about it we simply cannot
condone violence of any type hate speech
of any in any form around any issue you
know whether the Middle East Kashmir or
whatever there are ways it means to
conduct the debate uh and uh uh in
particular elected politicians no matter
which party they come from a good
responsibility upon them use the right
language they have a mature debate about
issues that are very complex and
and how we behave ourselves how we
conduct ourselves the language we use we
always got to be looking at ways of
peaceful resolutions
the news again at this time it's not for
the
foreign it is a new demographic crisis
all together China is among the
costliest countries in the world when it
comes to raising a child that's right in
fact off late China is making headlines
for all the wrong reasons
this being one of them what's this about
after South Korea China is the most
expensive country in the world to raise
a child and this perhaps is the latest
crisis faced by China Child Care is
expensive everywhere not only is it
financially consuming but it also
consumes an individual both mentally and
physically let's just see if I asked to
guess how fast it is to raise a child to
college graduation in China how could
you think of a number any predictions on
that front let me tell you the exact
number it is 90 711 dollars
the cost of raising the same child from
born to 17 years of age is 485 000 Yuan
or 69 430 US dollars a study by Juan
population Research Institute has said
that the costs of raising a child until
the age of 18 in China was 6.9 times its
draft domestic product per capita women
in China have time and again cited heavy
economic burdens as a reason behind not
wanting a child in 2017 a survey was
conducted by the National Health and
Family Planning Commission this survey
found that 77.4 percent women of
childbearing agency that high child
bearing costs were the top reason for
not wanting a child and this is not the
first time that China is facing a
demographic crisis this is just one of
the many crises that China is dealing
with and apart from Child Care being so
expensive China is struggling with low
birth rates and well it is also becoming
an aging society which means that it has
higher mortality rates than the birth
rate further the size of its labor force
is shrinking so does this mean that
China is facing a demographic challenge
the graphic challenges on multiple
fronts the answer is a definite yes and
how does one fix this perhaps at a
national level policies that reduce
childbearing costs for families need to
be introduced and with this specific
measures that aim at cash and tax
subsidies should be looked into there is
also an urgent need to address issues of
maternity leaves and the rights of
single women in China
while much of these issues a lot of
these issues are in the pipeline to be
addressed the question is how effective
has the government been in tackling them
as China attempts to be a global power
and races towards Global dominance is it
giving it domestic issues a miss and if
it continues to do so for how long will
it be able to run in the race of global
dominance
maybe now is the time for China to stop
poking its nose elsewhere and focus on
its expensive domestic affairs
marijuana businesses are booming in
Thailand less than a year ago you could
be jailed for five years for possessing
marijuana up to 15 years for producing
it and now restaurants are selling
marijuana leaf dishes there is cannabis
tea ice cream
convenience stores are also selling
marijuana flavored water you can take
your pick but the weed industry remains
largely unregulated ahead of the
elections rival political parties are
threatening to re-criminalize marijuana
if they come to power where is the
seaweeding industry really headed our
next report getting you the complete
story
take a little walk in Bangkok and you
will find multiple dispensaries lining
the streets
these dispensaries self-ported marijuana
flower buds along with all the bits and
pieces needed to smoke them
if you happen to take the khausan road
you would see an entire marijuana themed
shopping mall it's named plantopia
its shops stay glazed with the smoke
created by customers testing out the
products this is the new Thailand
the one where cannabis consumption is
legal
until last June you could be jailed for
five years for this
now you can get marijuana delivered by a
motorbike Courier
you can find marijuana Delicacies in
restaurants in convenience stores it's
now a flavor for tea for ice creams even
for water
look at this website it's called weed it
lists over 4 000 businesses across
Thailand selling cannabis and its
derivatives
this should be enough to give you an
idea
the marijuana industry has grown at a
breathtaking speed in less than a year
you see this new regime was a bit of a
political accident
head of one of Thailand's larger
political parties actually centered his
2019 campaign around decriminalizing
marijuana
it proved to be Award winner for him as
health minister in the new government
Charan virakul prioritized fulfilling
his election pledge in June 2022
cannabis was decriminalized in Thailand
but it was before anyone could write
regulations to control the new business
the planned new laws got bogged down by
interparty bickering the police admit
that they are unsure of what's legal and
what isn't when it comes to marijuana
there are some rules but they are being
enforced haphazardly if at all all
dispensaries selling cannabis are
required to have a license but not all
of them have it they are supposed to
keep track of all their cannabis flowers
and the personal details of every
customer but this rule is rarely
followed no products are supposed to
have more than 0.2 percent THC it is the
psychotropic chemical in cannabis yet
you can find suppliers offering potent
wheat brownies and gummies with high THC
content online
cannabis cannot be sold to anyone below
the age of 20. but who has to know if
they order it online for the longest
time all narcotics were viewed as a
dangerous social evil in Thailand
for many thighs the dramatic boom of the
weed business is bewildering
why was this decision taken in the first
place one of the reasons was Financial
marijuana was viewed as a profitable
alternative cash crop for poor farmers
it was intended to boost national income
but in truth marijuana isn't fetching
the money it was expected to
there are holds of buyers but then there
is no shortage of sellers either
marijuana prices are falling as there is
a lot of products with so much
competition sales are plummeting for
many farmers profits remain a Far Side
many regret switching to marijuana
farming and now the narcotic faces
threat in the parliament too
already rival parties are warning off
the dangers of unregulated weed many are
threatening to re-criminalize it if they
take power
the future of this freewheeling new
industry remains uncertain

thousands of people are preparing for
King Charles coronation but what how
often has one come under criticism is
the amount of wealth Royals have
according to a report by the times the
late Queen Elizabeth left her son
Charles an estimated wealth of 448
million dollars this increased child's
wealth to more than 750 million dollars
when Elizabeth became Queen in 1952
Charles received an income from the
duchy of Cornwall which is an estate
established to give the heir to the
throne Financial Independence the duchy
consists of more than 52 000 hectares of
land 260 farms and leases worth 345
million pounds of commercial property
under Charles Authority the duchy
collected assets worth more than a
billion pounds it generated an income of
around 23 million pounds per year which
is an increase of more than 40 percent
over 15 years a 1993 Clause gives
monarchs a chance to dodge taxes on
assets left by the predecessor so
so that they can protect the Royal
Estate from being broken up and that's
why the monarchs will is also not made
public this means that the content of
Queen Elizabeth's will will remain
private however some things are still
available for public information like
the Balmoral Castle in Northeast
Scotland where the queen died last
September and the Sandringham estate in
eastern England are now Charles private
property
however Buckingham Palace and Windsor
Castle belong to the state and will
continue to do so another historical
symbol of the British Monarchy the crown
jewels are also the property of the

Jr has arrived in the United States he
said to meet his counterpan Joe Biden
the meeting is widely anticipated to
further strengthen U.S Philippines ties
the meeting comes after both Nations
last we completed their largest War
drills ever a four-day visit to
Washington is a first by a Philippines
president in over 10 years Marcos JR
says that his meeting with the U.S
president is significant for advancement
of Philippines national interests before
leaving for Washington he said that he
is determined to seek a strong
relationship with the United States
Biden and Marcos Jr are expected to
reach agreements on greater business
engagement as well as military
enhancements the visit is part of a
larger move to boost economic ties
between the two countries the U.S
Administration has said that a
presidential business delegation from
Washington will also make a visit to
Manila but the larger focus is likely to
be on the issues of security amid
tensions with China Manila and
Washington have recently agreed to
expand their cooperation in strategic
areas of the Philippines Philippines has
also allowed U.S to increase the
presence of his troops in its territory
U.S officials believe that strategic
importance of Philippines cannot be
undermined
experts say that Washington sees
Philippines as a potential location for
Rockets missiles in case of an invasion
of Taiwan by China
Manila has sought to balance ties with
both Washington and Beijing but its
disputed China on territorial Waters of
South China Sea has made it unable to do
so on Friday Philippines had accused
China's Coast Guard of dangerous
Maneuvers and aggressive tactics in the
region this happened after a
confrontation between a Philippine
Vessel and two Chinese ships in the
South China Sea u.s2 had slumped China
for the incident calling it unsafe and
provocative
the Philippines and China have a long
history of disputes in the region as
China claims almost the entire South
China Sea as part of its territory
let's talk more about this the great
competition between the United States of
America and China is only intensifying
especially after Chinese Coast Guard
ship blocked a Philippine Patrol vessel
in the South China Sea the United States
of America has now warned that any
attack on the Philippine vessels would
trigger a U.S response the warning comes
on the heels of the Philippines
president's Washington visit Ferdinand
Marcos Junior will be meeting his U.S
counterpart today as concerns grow
regarding China's assertiveness in the
South China Sea
okay so let's take a look at where the
Skirmish is
are or what is happening in the South
China Sea and what this drills involve
between the Philippines and also the
United States of America this area here
the second Thomas Shaw is what I'm going
to talk about the skirmishes in the
South China Sea happened on April 28th
that is when the Philippine Coast Guard
say that two of its vessels were
involved in the confrontation with the
Chinese Navy in the disputed South China
Sea this is a South China Sea you can
see China here and the Philippines all
the way here so this is the disputed
area and this area is what I'm talking
about the second Thomas Shaw the
incident occurred during a Philippine
Coast Guard Patrol close to the
Philippine held second Thomas Shaw
Marco's visit to Washington also comes
after the U.S and the Philippines
completed their largest War drills ever
the two weeks exercise called the Bali
cotton drills involved more than 17 600
military personnel and also included
live fire exercises
let's tell you more about growing
Philippines and the U.S relations apart
from the Philippines president
Washington trip and the Bali Cotton
military drills between both the
countries the United States of America
also hosted two diplomats from the
Philippines
during the talks both the sides agreed
to complete a road map for the U.S to
provide security assistance to its
Regional Ally for the next five to ten
years
last year Washington also granted Manila
a hundred million U.S dollars to boost
the South East Asian Nations defense
capabilities and Military modernization
also in February the Philippines granted
new rights to the United States to
expand access to its military bases
fardin and Marcos Junior's father also
visited the United States of America in
1982. it was marcos's first visit to the
United States in 16 years since the
first year of his presidency in 1966
now according to a data from the Pew
research Center's Global attitudes
project 85 percent of Filipinos
have a more favorable view of the
American people the survey father
suggested that the Philippines liked the
United States of America a lot
meanwhile in recent weeks the United
States of America is also making
diplomatic inroads holding drills and
meeting their leaders just a few days
ago the United States of America signed
the Washington declaration act with
South Korea
it also opened its Embassy in Vanuatu
here
and Solomon Islands these are two
islands which are in contention now this
was in a bid to counter China in the
Pacific apart from this Washington has
also reopened its Embassy in the Solomon
Islands like I mentioned the two islands
are in contention
meanwhile China is also trying to
rekindle its relations with various
countries especially after it broke at a
peace deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia
Chinese foreign minister also visited
Manila for three days to see cooperation
amid worsening relations between the
Philippines and China
let's also now tell you why the issue of
South China Sea is so contentious China
claims almost the entire South China Sea
including the
portless the sport lease
the Spotless is around this region
which is also claimed by the Philippines
this is done the South China Sea into
one of the world's biggest flash points

Association Don McLean Gale
thank you very much for making time for
we on wild is one and welcome to the
program
thank you so much for having me sir true
pleasure to converse to you on this
let me ask you we've seen the U.S and
the Philippines conduct military drills
in the South China Sea we've also seen a
Marcos Junior heading to Washington DC
to meet President Joe Biden what do you
read from these two events what is the
message that Marcos Junior and President
Biden are trying to send to Beijing
right and this is in fact a continuation
of the promises uh president Marcus Jr
has made upon his uh his victory as the
election victory that he would
prioritize uh two particular aspects and
that is to enhance and secure Philippine
territorial Integrity sovereignty and
Sovereign rights and of course to be
able to modernize and fast-track the
modernization of the Philippine military
with a special emphasis on Maritime
security now of course as we can see uh
the alliance is multi-dimensional and it
involves a lot of uh qualifications to
address the series of threats and of
course one of these threats uh include
China's expanding assertiveness and
while Manila has of course sought to
manage relations with Beijing
um as I've always mentioned there's
always the discrepancy between what
Beijing says at the political level and
what it does on the ground so this is of
course a reaction uh to this particular
discrepancy Don what why is the South
China Sea so contentious and why is it
taking too long for that matter to be
resolved
right we have to understand in the
context of the greater region if you
look into southeast Asia or the greater
Western Pacific this is the traditional
sphere of influence of the United States
whereas it is now becoming uh the locus
of Chinese power it's right it's
assertive rights and of course what we
can see here that China has uh
emphatically enhanced uh its anti-access
aerodynal capabilities and in fact in
2018 as early as 2018 uh Philip Davidson
uh emphasized that China has
significantly controlled uh the South
China Sea uh vis-a-vis the United States
in all aspects short of War
um so this is the situation that we're
in now China continues to militarize uh
the disputed Maritime territory because
it acts as a particular Shield a
geographic Shield against U.S expansion
in the Western Pacific or rather the
enhancement of military operations of
the United States in the Western Pacific
so because of this particular complex
situation
China's rise U.S desire to maximize its
influence in the region this will be a
very sticky issue for a very long time
and you know as we can see it has been
going on for decades
don't look there's the issue of China
expanding still claiming Taiwan at its
as its own and some concerns that U.S
and the West might be isolating uh you
know China with that in mind what is at
stake here
well you know we have to understand that
I do not think that China can be
isolated uh you know the same way that
they sought to do so in the Cold War uh
what we can say is that there's an
effort by the West uh and of course
like-minded countries in the
indo-pacific to constrain China's
ability uh to emphatically uh expand its
assertive claims uh its territorial
interests and it's narrowly defined
Regional Ambitions uh and this of course
will generate uh some sort of
countermeasure from China as you can see
uh China has sought to leverage on what
it has uh significantly that is its
economic capabilities using this uh as a
form of salami slicing to get into the
regional architecture of the
indo-pacific and in fact we can see that
China has utilized its influence Slowly
by creating fault lines within asean for
example and the Global Security
initiative which is seen as a
countermeasure as an exclusionary form
towards the U.S alliance system in the
indo-pacific so we can see that there is
a balancing and counter balancing not
only military Affairs but also in
narratives and economic capabilities as
well Don as we wrap up this conversation
and I want your brief response to this
what do you predict will be the outcome
of Marco's Junior and President Biden's
meeting
right very quickly uh the the outcome
would be that both sides will agree that
they have mutual concerns and threat
perceptions towards what is taking place
in the region they will try to deepen
their Alliance and hopefully broaden it
as well but of course we can expect
countermeasures from China as it also
maintains its strength in the region

he fell near Camp 2 from an altitude of
about 5 600 meters
several rescue attempts were made three
days later on the 20th of April five

him out
luckily two of The Rescuers were finally

standing 8091 meters tall Mount
Annapurna is the world's 10th highest

comparing Annapurna with Everest it's a
much shorter climb at a lower altitude
so what makes this climb one of the most
dangerous in the world
an incredibly difficult route perhaps
and the frequent and unpredictable
nature of avalanches here other reasons
the unpredictable weather and the lack
of physical Mountain support

thank you
hello welcome my name is Vikram Chandra
and you're watching this world a show
that brings you a Roundup of the week's
biggest developments and I'm going to
start by talking a little bit about
China and its relations with Europe they
see your meeting has been on in India
and a lot of attention has been fixed on
how China is dealing with India now
India is dealing with China and their
Dynamics but China has also found itself
this week in the middle of a spat with
some European countries and that's
partly because of the way China
approaches international relations China
of course country with the reputation of
fixating on history as well as
interfering with historic realities but
this Story begins with a Chinese
Diplomat telling the world that Ukraine
is not a legitimate country I mean not
in as many words but his message seemed
Crystal Clear Louise the Chinese
ambassador to France said that
post-soviet Nations quote do not have an
effective state status in international
law unquote
we're going to be telling you on the
show what happened next and it wasn't
always pretty also in this program it's
Donald Trump versus Joe Biden once again
as the former and the sitting president
of the United States start preparing for
the 2024 presidential elections that's
going to be an interesting battle if it
comes up also I am going to be telling
you once again that AI is here to change
the world and potentially the music
industry could have changed forever just
this week what if I was to tell you that
artificial intelligence is now
potentially allowing anyone to sing like
Rihanna like Beyonce or the weekend all
you need to do is to tell AI which
singer you want to sound like and the
rest could be
fascinating and scary depending on your
point of view we're going to be talking
about this in great detail in just a
little while
but let's begin with China Europe and
let's begin with that controversial
comment post-soviet countries do not
have an effective status in
international law
these are the words of Lucia he's
China's ambassador to France what made
him say what he did while Lou was giving
a television interview he was asked if
he considers Crimea to be a part of
Ukraine the Penance that I remember was
annexed by Russia in 2014 but Lou did
not talk about this annexation instead
he said that the ex-soviet states are
not sovereign or at least that's what he
implied Lou was talking about these
countries Armenia Azerbaijan Belarus
Estonia Georgia Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan
Latvia Lithuania Moldova Tajikistan
Turkmenistan Ukraine Uzbekistan there
are a total of 15 countries including
Ukraine's whose status has essentially
been called into by that statement in
essence the Chinese ambassador to France
questioned their sovereignty their
integrity and their borders
how did Europe react to this well
several countries issued summons to
Chinese envoys Liu himself was summoned
by France 80 European parliamentarians
wrote an open letter
urging France to expel the Ambassador
but that's about it nothing more
happened
could the response have been stronger
could the Ambassador been actually
expelled could China have been
officially forced to make a
clarification or a statement perhaps all
of that would have happened if it wasn't
for Europe's over Reliance on China be
it for trade paid for solving the crisis
in Ukraine according to one estimate
China accounts for 20 percent of eu's
good Imports and nine percent of its
goods exports many feel that those trade
relations give China leverage many feel
that it is because of those trade
relations that Europe cannot or does not
take the stance against China or the
stance in response to China as many
people feel that perhaps it should now
let's turn to the war the war between
Russia and Ukraine not too long ago the
French President Emmanuel macron
traveled to China he was accompanied by
the European commission president Ursula
Vander Lane also accompanied by the
German foreign minister now these
leaders met the Chinese president XI
Japan in Beijing what did they discuss
they did discuss the Ukraine war you see
Europe is leaning on China to establish
a framework for negotiation between
Russia and Ukraine it's banking on G's
friendship with the Russian President
Vladimir Putin from bringing an end to
the war a war which was already
stretched on for a year in two months so
in a situation like this you could argue
that Europe needs China even more so can
Europe afford to react strongly to some
erratic worlds of someone who's going to
be just described as a wolf Warrior
Diplomat of course there was some strong
statements that did emerge here's what
Burrell said the Foreign Affairs Council
will start discussing about China in
order to prepare the European Council in
June bottle told reporters before the
start of the summit maybe that will
reassess and recalibrate our strategy
towards China
now it has to be noted that China has
been quick to jump into damage control
mode let me read out what China's
foreign Ministry spokesperson mounting
told the media China respects the
Sovereign status of former Soviet
republics after the Soviet Union's
dissolution unquote so in essence
reversing what had been stated just a
short while earlier Mao also went on to
add that this is China's official
position the Chinese Embassy in Paris
issued a separate statement it said the
ambassador's remarks were quote not a
statement of politics but an expression
of personal views during a televised
debate so again some sort of an efforts
to step back from that and also earlier
this week when she got on a phone call
with Ukraine's president zielinski China
offered to mediate Rito zelenski the
talks are the only way out of the war
China is now sending diplomats to
Ukraine their tasks to broker a peace
deal between Ukraine and Russia
what is all of this boiled down to China
is wasting no time to show that it is
serious about playing The Peacemaker in
Ukraine but there are some experts who
believed that the statement made by the
Ambassador was too dangerous to undo so
where does the story go from here will
it impact China's relations with the
European Union or is this going to be a
storm in a teacup
so to understand what exactly is
happening between China and Europe who
better to talk to the nadrian gigas
who's the author of XI jinping's
biography it's called XI jinpin the most
powerful man in the world and Adrian now
joins us on this program Indian thanks
so much for joining us now great to have
you you're sitting there in Germany
looking at the relationship between
Europe and China how is it looking it's
B it's been looking like a bit of a
love-hate relationship for a time for a
while is that still the way you think
it's going to go forward a love-hate
relationship
uh yes it is you'll describe it very
well because I mean what
uh China under the leadership of Xi
Jinping is trying now to make a split
between Europe and the United States
because of the relation between U.S and
China is uh worsening every day and
Europe became a strong Ally of the
United States in the Ukraine war but now
with some things like Xi Jinping talking
to zelenski the president of the Ukraine
and so on this such things
China tries to make a split between U.S
and Europe okay there are a lot of
attention being paid to the remarks made
by the Chinese envelope recently but
he's talking about the USSR and the
nature of the former republics and
whether they really have sovereignty now
China's tried to walk that back but
Chinese diplomats don't usually say
things that are completely off the cuff
so what do you think are the
implications of those that statement
we have seen the the true Faith the real
opinion of the Chinese leadership of
course they had to step back now
officially because it's also a problem
for their relations to many countries
for example to Kazakhstan which is a
important neighbor of China which is
also a former Soviet Republic but I mean
as you said she's the Ambassador it's
not his private opinion it's obviously
the opinion which is shared by by many
in the Chinese leadership and this is a
very bad sign because if we start to
question the borders in Europe or the
borders all over the world that can be
very dangerous
okay Adrian thanks so much for joining
us we're all going to be keeping a very
close eye on China and I'm sure Europe
will as well thank you thank you for
being with us
all right let's move from Europe now to
the United States the country's just a
year away well a little more than a year
from presidential elections who's
running well we know for a fact that the
U.S President Joe Biden is he's seeking
a second term Biden has officially
announced his candidacy for 2024 the 80
year old filed documents on Tuesday and
soon his new campaign team released this
video I ran for president four years ago
I said we're in a battle for the soul of
America and we still are
the question we're facing is whether in
the years ahead we have more freedom or
less freedom more rights are fewer
I know what I want the answer to be and
I think you do too
this is not a time to be complacent
that's why I'm running for re-election
and this was followed by a public
appearance
job finish the job
well awesome
[Applause]
and no prizes for guessing which leader
was among the first to react yes Donald
Trump former president and Biden's
predecessor
you could take the five worst Presidents
in American history and put them
together and they would not have done
the damage Joe Biden has done to our
nation in just a few short years not
even close
so are you surprised it's Biden versus
Trump once again or at least that's what
it looks like as of now the Republicans
have not yet officially named the
presidential candidate and we don't know
who's going to get the party ticket we
do know that former U.S ambassador to
the U.N Nikki Haley is in the running
for the Republican nomination so is
Indian origin Vivek ramaswamy 72 year
old ASA Hutchinson Florida Governor Ron
DeSantis too is expected to announce his
run but like I was saying as things
stand right now as things stand right
now Trump appears to be the strongest
Republican phase making it potentially
yet another Trump versus Biden Face-Off
now we know who won last time so will
this time be any different what Biden
has gained in the last two plus years is
a sin to the White House and a track
record that you could debate about a
little bit now his campaign talks about
finishing the job but so far has bidened
and great job as president or not well
that depends on whom you ask some may
point to the Hasty pullout of
Afghanistan seems to have been a bit of
a disaster or the failure to prevent a
war in Europe or the inflation at home
but the others who would celebrate Biden
for record job growth the kind which has
not been seen since 1960s or returning
the United States to the Paris climate
Accord what about Trump what is he
campaigning on make America great again
that slogan has been Trump's favorite
since his 2016 presidential campaign but
the capital riots are Trump in so many
ways instigated following his loss in
the last elections
urged many to ask whether Trump really
had America's best interest in mind
whether he really is in the race to make
America great again as for Biden the age
Factor looms large he would be 86 by the
end of his second term that is of course
if he manages to secure it also Biden's
approval rating is just 39 percent Trump
by the way is not going to be a spring
chicken either by the time he finishes
he's younger than Biden but not by all
that much so as you can see Americans
aren't exactly spoiled for choice at
this point it all comes down to the
question who is likely to win a Trump
versus Biden battle
and figured out what exactly is going to
happen next it's a great pleasure to be
joined by Kimberly Leonard she's a
policy and politics correspondent with
Insider Kimberly thanks so much out
there in Florida did you join us so I'm
sure Ron DeSantis is keeping a very
close eye on all of this what's it
looking like to you is it going to be
Trump versus Biden or is someone else
going to step in
I think what we've seen in recent weeks
is that Trump has really benefited from
the indictments and benefit from the
fact that
he seems to get more support when other
Republicans attack him so we saw Florida
Governor Ron DeSantis go after him sort
of dig against him because he you know
lost the 2020 election and dig against
him because of the allegations that are
uh in the in the indictment
um but Trump then saw soaring in the
polls and then he uh we saw DeSantis
losing in the polls so there's sort of
this contrast that happens that every
Republican seems to struggle with which
is how do you take down Trump because it
seems like the more he's under attack
the more support he gets but let us look
at both the camps on the Republican side
it's still on a done deal for Trump by
any stretch of the imagination John
DeSantis has been faring reasonably well
jury is still out as to who's going to
get the candidacy
definitely and I think one thing that
probably is heartening to the DeSantis
Camp is that he has taken a lot of
punches from Trump in recent weeks and
he is still in the game and if you look
at Rhonda Sanchez against let's say
Nikki Haley or Mike Pence who will
probably announce or you know the
vacarama Swami you still see that
DeSantis is the one who comes anywhere
close to potentially
you know being second place to Trump all
right turning to the Democratic side
when it comes to Biden do you think is
it a done deal out there I know there
are some people who feel that but it's
possible that Biden will get the
candidacy but maybe if there was another
candidate they would have a better shot
a more short chance of beating Trump
remember it was actually quite close
between Biden and Trump even in 2020.
one of the benefits Biden has that Trump
doesn't have is that even though you see
a majority of Voters do not want Biden
to run again that's a polling show you
don't have prominent Democrats jumping
in to challenge him that's in contrast
to Trump I mean Trump is still also you
know someone that a lot of Voters don't
want to run but you have all these
Republicans who are jumping in to
challenge him even potentially his
former vice president I have to say I'm
really curious about the age Factor
whether if it's Biden versus Trump it's
going to be What 80s versus late 70s a
couple of years here and there now if
you compare that for example to the age
that Clinton was when he became the
President Obama was when he became the
president or even George Bush these are
relatively really really old candidates
so what's happening is it is the era of
ancient Americans running the the
country back or are we going to see
young candidates out there at some point
oh well it's definitely a factor that
voters are thinking about we see that in
polling it's one of the biggest factors
that people say Biden shouldn't run
again and I hear a lot of questions from
voters even Democratic ones about you
know whether Biden is up to the job and
when he ran in 2020 he benefited from
the covid pandemic because he was able
to run a virtual campaign and what was
interesting was that if you were there
during the primary which I was I was
kind of following him around a lot of
reporters were questioning whether he
could you know become the nominee they
really thought it was a done deal that
he could not because you know he would
be extremely late to campaign events he
would stumble through questions he there
would be small groups of people he was
so it you know his age was showing
we're going to keep coming back to you
for this really fascinating story that's
going to build an America all the way
through till the 2024 elections thanks

but as things turned out the Drone
crashed 19 kilometers outside of Moscow
and the Russian President Vladimir Putin
was unharmed on export gets you the
details
did Ukraine try to assassinate Vladimir
Putin
this is a question that'll have
far-reaching consequences in the Ukraine
war in the days to come according to
reports in the German Media One of
Ukraine's top Kamikaze drones was
launched on the 23rd of April its Target
was the newly constructed rudnivore
industrial park near Moscow because the
Ukrainian secret service had got wind
the plasma Putin would visit the
industrial park on Sunday afternoon
what should worry the Russian
strategists is that the Ukrainian drone
managed to sneak into the Russian
airspace it flew for over 500 kilometers
and the assassination bit failed
only because the Drone that was fitted
with 17 kilograms of special explosives
the type that is mostly used by the US
and Canadian Armed Forces crashed about
19 kilometers east of Moscow
but the question is this did Vladimir
Putin visit the root nivo industrial
park on Sunday
no one can be sure security analyst
Glenn Grant believes that Ukraine was
not behind this assassination attempt
according to him this drone strike is
most likely the handiwork of elements
within the Donetsk region who may have
had some outside help this comes into
the same basket as the um as the attacks
in in and around the netsk which are
clearly done by by the Russians not
actually done by the ukrainians
um my view is that if the Ukraine is
intent on killing Vladimir Putin they
will do so
um because because it's too serious for
them to to play around with let's just
say that they wouldn't use one drone
they'd use five or six
Vladimir Putin's movements are closely
guarded his visit to Mario Paul in the
19th of March was described as
spontaneous and was announced post facto
another aspect of Vladimir Putin's
security is the use of body doubles
Western media is Awash with reports that
Vladimir Putin is regularly using body
doubles either due to security reasons
or because he's physically incapacitated
due to health concerns but Putin himself
has repeatedly rubbished reports of him
using a body double yeah
foreign
on the battlefield the stakes continue
to get higher with each passing day
on the 29th of April a drone strike on
severester Poland Crimea sparked a
massive fire at an oil Depot
although like in the past Ukraine has
not officially claimed responsibility
for the strike
after a haters of over a month Russia
resorted to the use of missile strikes
across Ukraine
cities that is Kiev Oman and dunphro
were peppered with over 23 missiles in
which more than 25 people lost their
lives I felt that it was a very strong
wave and everything just fell down on me
and my granddaughter the windows and the
glass and the crown everything in the
house just fell what did we feel I don't
know I didn't have the time to get
scared I just took the child and threw
her out into the corridor and only then
I thought I had glass at my legs on the
19th of April Ukraine received its first
batch of patriot missile defense systems
and the Ukrainian people feel that this
will make their airspace much more
secure
we have faith and we believe in our air
defense in our Ukrainian Armed Forces
and we hope that this will not happen
again and while we are sitting here we
will not be sad but will support the
spirit of our country we know that we
are invincible glory to you crazy
the mud started Ukrainian spring
counter-offensive against the Russians
hasn't yet materialized the reports of
assassination attempts have now planned
the war into a whole new territory where
it is difficult to predict what turn the
Ukraine war will take in the coming days

finland's accession into the NATO
military lines has altered the security
framework of the Arctic on a very
fundamental level
although initially reluctant Russia is
now Inked a historic Maritime Security
deal with China
and what this means is that Moscow and
Beijing enough joining hands to take on
the NATO presence or the Arctic eyes
the Arctic Council has eight Nations and
when Sweden too joins the NATO military
lines then seven of the eight nations of
the Arctic Council will be part of the
NATO military Alliance
so how is Russia planning to take on the
NATO military lines in one of the
coldest regions of planet Earth our next
Port gets you retails
the Scramble for the Arctic is well and
truly underway
the Arctic is one of the coldest and one
of the most hostile environments in the
world
just about four million people live here
but according to the United States
Geological Survey the Arctic is home to
an estimated 25 of the world's oil gas
and mineral deposits
and the arctic's melting eyes has
changed the geopolitical realities of
the region
there are eight Nations that fall or
border the Arctic Zone Russia United
States Canada Denmark Norway Iceland
Sweden and Finland and amongst these it
is Russia that has an all-arching
Presence at the Arctic
but with Finland joining the NATO
military Alliance and Sweden too on the
verge of jumping onto the American
Military bandwagon the Arctic ice shelf
is increasingly beginning to look like
the NATO ice cap
so how does Russia counter this but
bringing in an ally with formidable
economic and military mind to blunt
NATO's Edge
China is 1400 kilometers away from the
Arctic Circle but Beijing likes to
describe itself as a near-arctic nation
with the stated ambition of wanting to
become a polar great power by 2030. on
the 25th of April in the Russian city of
mulmans close to the Finnish Border in
the Arctic Circle Russia and China
signed a deal for maritime law
enforcement for the Arctic at this
moment China has invested a staggering
90 billion dollars in infrastructure
assets at the Arctic
to count to Nato Russia is also end
creating other non-arctic nations like
India Iran and Saudi Arabia to expand
their commercial presence
in the course of the last decade Russia
has been aggressively expanding its
Arctic defense capabilities Russia's
Coastline account for almost about 53
percent of the Arctic Ocean and it is
here that Russia has stationed its
Hypersonic missile systems
in the last few years the Russia has
reopened 50 previously closed soviet-era
military posts
it has refurbished 13 air bases 10 radar
stations and 24 outposts
the Russian special forces are also a
part of the Arctic Brigade have been
deployed for military drills and
exercises in 2017 Russia unveiled an
Ultraman military base on the France
Joseph land island called the Arctic
trefoil
this is Russia's northernmost military
Outpost there is a second of its kind
facility after kutelny
it is now home to the upgraded Squad air
base and provides Russia with air sea
and land capabilities
the cola Peninsula is the epicenter of
Russia's Arctic power projection
it is here that Russia is estimated to
have stationed its highest number of
nuclear weapons
the Godzilla submarine base at the
cooler Peninsula has been expanded and
the nearby placette's cosmodrome is
widely used for testing Russia's latest
military hardware
island in the Russian Arctic is home to
the rogo chivo Air Base
additional radar and electronic warfare
equipment has also been set up
in 2019 s 400 air defense missile
systems were also deployed at Roger
chivo
the Dixie Air Base in central eastern
Russia has been significantly expanded
by 11 new structures in total
s 400 air defense missile systems will
be stationed here supplemented by radio
technical regimens
Island which is one of the largest
Siberian islands is equipped with a
state-of-the-art reform military
compound along with swapka 2 radar
facilities and missile launch vehicles
Russia views the Arctic as its future
it has deployed more military resources
than all other NATO Nations combined at
the Arctic and now by joining hands with
China Russia is planning to push NATO
after the Arctic Circle

the Civil War in Sudan has brought life
to a standstill
while the focus of the global media has
been on diplomats and foreign Nationals
who got caught in the violence that
suddenly exploded in this head-butting
contest between the two military
generals
few have focused their attention on the
common people of Sudan
remember civil War's ethnic conflicts
and social Strife is not new to the
people of Sudan
but even then this is a conflict like no
other that is gripped Sudan in the last
few decades
be the ethnic violence of Darfur or the
Blue Nile and the southern carnivan
crisis
it was the Sudanese government that was
fighting against an armed militia or a
rebel group
but the rsf is not a rebel group but
rather a paramilitary force that was
created by the government
so how has this impacted the lives of
the Common People of Sudan unexport
gives you the details
[Music]
fighting between the Sudanese Army and
the powerful paramilitary group called
the rapid support forces or the rsf
continued for a second week
multiple truce efforts since the
fighting broke out on the 15th of April
have failed
over 500 people have been killed so far
and more than four thousand wounded in
the fighting
with it all likely to rise even farther
given the sketchy details available
hospitals have been shelled with more
than two-thirds out of service
in the final hours of the three-day
ceasefire that was repeatedly broken the
Army and the rsf agreed to a 72-hour
extension following pressure from the
Saudi Arabian government and the United
States
first we are very actively working to
extend the uh the ceasefire we've had a
72-hour ceasefire which like most
ceasefires is imperfect but nonetheless
has reduced violence uh and that's
um obviously created somewhat better
conditions for people in Sudan uh it's
also enabled some humanitarian
assistance to continue uh to move around
but we want to make sure that um uh if
possible this is extended we're very
actively engaged on that more
importantly the foreign representatives
are hoping for the ceasefire to be
followed by a de-escalation plan that
was mapped out in an April 20th
blueprint for peace
violence though has now spread beyond
the capital city of khartoul
the war ravaged western region of Darfur
is particularly vulnerable
Food Supplies to an estimated 50 000
acutely managed children in Western
Darfur has been disrupted civilians in
Khartoum and elsewhere are trapped in
their homes and during severe shortages
of food running water and electricity
those who can afford to and are willing
to risk their lives are taking the long
and risky journey to flee the country
desperate homeless and fleeing to save
their lives they do have a question for
the warring generals responsible for the
chaos
that today they end the war because the
Sudanese people are suffering and they
don't deserve this and I ask you to sit
on a negotiation table and to resolve
your issues because this is your own
conflict not that of the Sudanese people
God will judge you in this life and the
next
the United Nations has cautioned that if
the fighting continues as many as 270
000 people could flee Sudan
since fighting erupted 14 000 Sudanese
refugees have crossed the border into
Egypt besides 2 000 people from 50 other
countries
at least twenty thousand people have
escaped into charred four thousand into
South Sudan
3500 into Ethiopia and three thousand
into the Central African Republic
in a war where both the warring factions
have utterly disregarded the laws and
Norms of war the future looks rather
bleak

at least 16 people mostly policemen were
killed and over 50 others were wounded
in two powerful explosions a trip
through a Pakistani police station on
the 24th of April
start with the impact of the explosions
that it leveled the counterterrorism
department in cabal town of the
savatwali
the Pakistani prime minister Sheba
Sharif initially described the blasts as
a suicide attack but later he retracted
that statement and tweeted that the
nature of the blast is presently being
investigated
what's also interesting is that no one
has claimed responsibility for the
attack although in recent months the
Pakistani Taliban have been responsible
for a wave of attacks that have
specifically targeted the police
Personnel in Pakistan on next born gets
you the details
the Northwest SWAT Valley of Khyber
paktunkhwa Province was rocked by twin
explosions this past Monday which
happened inside the counter-terrorism
department police station
Not only was the police station
completely blown apart but even the
nearby buildings including houses a
mosque and a school were also damaged
due to the impact of the explosions
security forces and rescue teams rushed
to the site to rescue people trapped
under the debris and to move the injured
to nearby hospitals a state of emergency
has been imposed in all the hospitals of
the district
it is confirmed that 16 policemen were
martyred and more than 50 were injured
the blast took place in the old ctd
police station the explosives were on
the first floor all the explosives RPGs
mines Etc were under trial for different
legal cases
uh
uh mines between RPGs between Europe
Pakistan has witnessed a dramatic
upsurge in attacks since the Taliban
ceased control of kadul in August 2021.
Islamabad claims that these attacks
focused on its border regions with
Afghanistan are being launched from
Afghan soil the usual suspect in these
attacks is the Tariq at Taliban Pakistan
which was founded in 2007 when Pakistani
militants fighting alongside the Taliban
in Afghanistan splintered off and began
to Target Islamabad as payback for
supporting the U.S Invasion after 9 11.
the picture asks what valley once had
been a stronghold of Islamic militants
who had imposed strict Sharia law there
until the Pakistani army flushed them
out in 2009 and restored normalcy but of
late the semblance of normalcy has been
frequently Shattered by militant attacks
when I came to know about the blast last
night I was extremely grieved and rushed
to the hospital along with some other
people we donated blood talked to the
medical officials and went around to see
the injured everyone is in a State of
Shock the residence of the mingora and
Saudi towns in soar District have given
great sacrifices in the war against
terrorism and the hospital was
overflowing with people clamoring to
donate blood
Insurgency has returned since November
last year when a ceasefire between the
TTP and the Pakistani establishment
ended since the beginning of this year
two major attacks on large police bases
have been linked to the TTP in January
more than 80 officers were killed in a
suicide attack targeting a mosque inside
a police compound in Peshawar the
following month five were killed when a
ttp's Suicide Squad stormed a police
compound and the southern Port City of
Karachi prompting an hour's long
shootout
is Pakistan losing its fight against a
resurgent TTP well given the frequent
TTP attacks targeting its Security
Forces it certainly isn't helping the
image or morale of the Pakistani
Security Forces

gang members were reportedly beaten to
death and set on fire by mob in Haiti on
the 24th of April
it was the most horrific instance of
vigilante violence witnessed in recent
history in Haiti
later on the same day six more gang
members were allegedly killed by the
police and later were burned by the
residents
the Law and Order situation has
increasingly deteriorated in Portal
prints since the assassination of former
president Jordan Ruiz in July 2021
the United Nations Secretary General
Antonio guterres has termed the security
situation in Haiti to be comparable to a
nation that is at War
criminal gangs now control about 80
percent of the port or Prince
metropolitan area in Haiti
with close to 200 gangs operating with
impunity gun fights between police and
gang members are fairly routine
trapped in the crossfire it is the local
residents who bear the brunt bloody turf
wars between rival gangs have left
hundreds dead and thousands displaced
this past Monday encroaching gangs
targeted the hilly suburbs of Haiti's
Capital but were met with stiff
resistance
the gang invaded us here in canopy word
from the top of the Hills at 2 am
bullets were raining down everywhere and
they surrounded the area women and
children did not know where to go so we
took out our machetes through stones and
they dispersed the police met them on

said that its officer stopped and
searched a minibus for Contraband and
confiscated weapons from suspects aboard

glqsBzf3skA,"Gravitas Plus: Gen Z prone to heart attacks, diabetes?","Chronic & life-threatening diseases like Diabetes, Cardiovascular disorders & Vitamin D deficiencies are becoming more common ...",2023-04-29T15:30:08Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/glqsBzf3skA/hqdefault.jpg,"hello and welcome you're watching
gravitas plus I am Molly camphir
I have some questions for you
when did you wake up today
when did you go to sleep last night
what was the last meal that you had when
was the last time you worked out and if
not that at least went for a walk
outside
now are you happy with your answers
you might not want to face them but they
do tell you a lot about your lifestyle
you see our daily habits Define our
health how much we sleep what we eat how
much we move and exercise everything
matters
but gen Z has a lifestyle problem
you see youngsters are hooked to their
screens
they consume carbs and fried food like
anything most of the time
their diet might not be including
healthy greens work takes up most of
their time
working from home essentially eliminates
any scope of going out and stepping out
in the sun
exercising takes a back seat
and what do we even say about the sleep
cycle
more stay up late and then they stay in
their bed still midday
and what happens next health issues that
stay with them for a long time
and in worst cases even for a lifetime I
am talking about diabetes heart attack
risks vitamin D deficiency crippling
mental health disorders gone are the
days when heart diseases only plagued
the older population
heart attacks in youngsters have become
increasingly common
as you know your heart is constantly
pumping blood but sometimes the vessels
carrying this Blood get blocked and the
blockages narrow down the artery
blood flow to the heart is reduced and
this leads to a heart attack
in many cases heart attacks can be fatal
now the question is why does this happen
What leads to these blockages in the
arteries
the answer life in your lifestyle eating
food loaded with trans fat added sugars
extra salt can lead to high cholesterol
levels
such food items have been proven to
accelerate the collection of bad
cholesterol in the blood vessels
on top of that other factors like
excessive alcohol consumption regular
smoking obesity diabetes hypertension
can lead to a heart attack
in fact more and more youngsters are
suffering from hypertension partly due
to excessive work stress
and partly due to poor diet and lack of
physical activity
high blood pressure thickens the heart
muscles it makes them work harder harms
the arteries and increases the risk of a
heart attack
another Menace is obesity
even if you feel overall healthy if you
are overweight then you are at high risk
of cardiovascular diseases
now it is a proven fact that exercising
daily can boost one's heart health but
these days even gym goers are suffering
from heart attacks and why is that
because a lot of people over exert
themselves in gyms and they ignored
their health history
so what is the way out what are the
solutions
and can you Safeguard yourself against a
heart attack
while it also depends on your genes and
your family history you can still reduce
heart attack risks
here's what you can do maintain a
healthy diet avoid fatty and fried food
instead switch to a fiber-rich diet with
seasonal vegetables and fruits
exercise daily but don't over exert
if your trainer pushes you beyond your
limit you can always say no
take your health conditions and your
family history into account
if you have a family history of heart
diseases then maybe it's time for you to
get a screening test done
and stress is another major contributor
to heart diseases
High cortisol levels have been linked to
heart attacks
so find healthy ways to regulate stress
and take a break before reaching the
point of mental breakdown or burnout
lastly moderate your alcohol intake and
smoking
this was all about heart attacks but
that's not the only risk to youngsters
in their 20s and 30s
another one is diabetes
that happens either when there isn't
enough production of insulin or the body
stops taking up the produced insulin
and what happens when you have diabetes
the sugar level in our body shoots up
this in turn damages the organs nerves
and the blood vessels
and who is at risk
someone who is overweight has a history
of blood pressure issues a history of
PCOS or polycystic ovary syndrome
someone who has a sedentary lifestyle or
poor dietary choices or does not engage
in physical activity
because the moment there are fatty
tissues around your muscles they stop
responding to insulin sending your blood
sugar levels through the roof youngsters
and even little children are developing
diabetes these days
and what are some symptoms you can look
out for
let me break them down for you
feeling thirsty more frequently
urinating frequently feeling extremely
hungry too often unexplained weight loss
feeling a sense of fatigue having
blurred vision
source that refuse to heal or heal
slowly
another symptom Is frequent infection
If you experience these symptoms then do
get tested for diabetes
and how can diabetes be prevented
eat more nutritious food include whole
grains in your diet eat fresh fruits
green vegetables nuts avoid processed
food
sodas fried foods
high calorie desserts don't drink too
much alcohol try to exercise for 30
minutes five times a week and you should
be fine
there are other deficiencies and
disorders common in gen Z and
Millennials that can go undetected and a
prominent example is vitamin D
deficiency
a research by Health test provider York
test has highlighted how youngsters are
becoming vitamin D deficient
42 percent of britons in their twenties
now have a vitamin D deficiency compared
to just 21 percent of those in their 60s
and 12 percent of those aged 70 and
above now who is to blame
youngsters either work in closed offices
or work from their homes
during the weekend they could have a
cozy day in instead of stepping out
often they can go days without getting
some vitamin D which leads to a sharp
increase in cases of vitamin D
deficiency adults and children over the
age of one need 10 micrograms of the
vitamin every day while babies need 8.5
to 10 micrograms
so how can you boost your vitamin D
levels
have more milk be it almond soy or oat
include vitamin D Staples like cod liver
oil salmon mushrooms eggs beef liver
tint tuna and cheese in your diet and go
out in the sun more often you see your
lifestyle choices your Fitness levels
your sleeping schedule have a big role
to play
they go a long way in determining how
healthy you are
so Choose Wisely stay happy and healthy

collapse of the executive Judiciary and
practically all else here's our report
yet another political crisis in Pakistan

a massive external debt concerns over

of a possible military takeover
always remains the possibility and
Pakistan has had long periods of Martial

would say that there's never been
economic situation or a political
situation as severe as the one today
the latest crisis driven after
Pakistan's parliament in April ruled
against providing funds for provincial
snap polls called by the Supreme Court
on a plea filed by former prime minister
Imran Khan the Sharif government's
contention it cannot spare 21 billion
Pakistani Rupees needed to fund these
polls
while the political reasons for Sharif
not agreeing to the judiciary's order
may be one part of the story it's
obvious that Pakistan's economy is in
severe crisis
according to the United States Institute
of Peace as of December 2022 Pakistan
holds external debt and liabilities of
126.3 billion dollars of which around 27
billion dollars is Chinese debt another
8.5 billion is owed to the Paris Club a
group of 22 major creditor countries a
major share of Pakistan's debt is also
owed to multilateral institutions
amounting to roughly 45 billion
islamabad's main multilateral Predators
include the World Bank the Asian
development bank and the IMF that's not
all lending from Pakistani Banks to the
federal government surged 182 percent in
the last nine months
foreign exchange reserves held by the
State Bank of Pakistan have dipped to
2.9 billion dollars such low levels of
Foreign Exchange reserves raise alarm
bells and can have major implications
for Pakistan's currency exchange rate it
external debt to be repaid by June 2026
is 77.5 billion dollars for a 350
billion economy that's a hefty burden
the Sharif government needs IMF
financing to avoid a default but to meet
the terms of the debt it needs to raise
taxes further and slash subsidies an
unpopular move that could create further
political instability for Shabbat Sharif
it was triggered the latest crisis it
all started in removal of former prime
minister Imran Khan from power through
parliamentary vote of conference in
April last year
[Applause]
Khan launched a Countrywide campaign to
demand immediate national elections
as the government rejected his demand
Khan decided to resolve the provincial
Assemblies of Punjab in khyberbaktunpur
in January and asked the top Court to
intervene

points in the Pakistan Muslim League
Nawaz LED government pushed for the

if the military is to take over this
wouldn't be a first remember no civilian
leader in Pakistan has ever completed a
full term
in 1958 Pakistan saw its first military
coup in general Khan sees power from
president iskandar Mirza in 1977
was deposed by General Zia UL haq in
1997 prime minister Nawaz Sharif
returned for a second non-consecutive
term but remained in power only for
under three years as the Army Chief
Purvis from Sheriff toppled him in a
military coup in 1999. it's no secret
that the Pakistan Army has had a hand in
every government formation in Pakistan
Imran Khan came to power in 2018 with
the tacit support of the Pakistani
military and unlike brother Nawaz Shiva
Sharif has traditionally had good
relations with the military
as of now the military in Pakistan seems
to be standing an equidistance from both

both the sides continue to use high-tech
ways to track and Target the enemy
this is the latest from Russia
according to Media reports the Russian
Federation is all set to deploy more
lethal drones in Ukraine
these drones would be able to carry a
variety of weapons such as 82 and 120
millimeter mortar mines and Fab 100
bombs
Fab is a term used by Russia for an
air-dropped bomb with a high explosive
Warhead in this case these heavy attack
drones could be capable of carrying 100
kilograms of Fab 100 bombs
[Music]
it's believed that the country is
considering the possible deployment of
the Russian serious drone which is
developed by a saint petersburg-based
group
the Sirius is a heavy drone that weighs
around 2500 kilograms it can reportedly
carry 450 kilograms of weapons
the unmanned aerial vehicle can fly for
20 hours at an altitude of 23 000 feet
while it is primarily an attack drone
the series can also be used to patrol
designated areas equipped with a
synthetic aperture radar the Sirius can
be used to map the terrain for cruise
missile routing and mortar engagements
tested airspace the serious drone may
not be an easy target why because the
Drone is built like a conventional
aircraft it features a thin elongated
fuselage also it has straight wings and
a v-tail according to various Russian
sources the Drone is likely to be
operationally deployed in the near
future

facto leader and his second in command
is tearing apart the African nation
but is this just an internal unrest or
is it becoming another proxy conflict
being fought on behalf of larger
interests
you have
a deep concern about the engagement of
the um progression group the Wagner
group in in Sudani company
will Sudan become the next Ukraine I'm
Shivan Jana welcome to game plan let's
get to the point
the current battle in Sudan is between
the Sudanese Army and the paramilitary
General Abdul Fateh al-burhan heads
Sudan's Army and is also Sudan's de
facto leader since taking over the
country in 2021
on the other side we have Muhammad who
was al-burhan's deputy and who helped
him carry out the coup in Sudan in 2021
becoming Sudan's second in command
degalo heads Sudan's paramilitary known
as the rapid support forces or the rsf
now the two military forces have clashed
over a disagreement of merging the rsf
with the Sudan Army but is it just that
simple or are there other interests
involved
the United States remains a steadfast
partner of the Sudanese people in their
pursuit of a civilian-led government U.S
has long been batting for a civilian
government in Sudan to bring peace in
the nation but it's never that simple
when it comes to America in 2019
Abdullah became Sudan's prime minister
he had full U.S support thereby giving
U.S an upper hand in Sudan
Russia decided to increase its Footsteps
in Sudan and signed a 25-year agreement
to establish a naval base in the African
nation
allowing Russia to simultaneously keep
up to four Navy ships including
nuclear-powered ones in Port Sudan
in exchange Russia offered to provide
Sudan with weapons and military
equipment the agreement of course
angered U.S and did not materialize
in October 2021 Sudan's military with
al-burhan and tagalo at the Forefront
came together and carried out a coup and
overthrew us-backed handok and took over
Sudan
in September 2022 John Godfrey U.S
ambassador to Sudan warned Sudan of
consequences if it went ahead with the
Russian military base at Port Sudan
in December the same year a political
framework agreement was signed in Sudan
for restoring a civilian-led government
in Sudan exactly what U.S had been
batting for all this while
which would have perhaps brought back
U.S backed Abdullah to the four giving
U.S and upper head once again in Sudan
and then in March of 2023 the deal was
nearly finalized for a civilian
government in Sudan when the violence
broke out between the two military
leaders in April 2023.
the contention was over the agreement
terms which would have dissolved the rsf
into the Sudan Army
you see Sudan has lucrative mineral
resource exports especially gold
Sudan also provides access to the Red
Sea which is linked to the Mediterranean
Sea through the Suez Canal on one side
and connects to the Arabian Sea and the
Indian Ocean on the other side
this is a busy route for international
Maritime trade which world powers are
key known
as for the international trade
Administration 80 of Sudan's gold is
smuggled abroad and reports suggest that
amid heavy sanctions Russia is using
Sudan's gold to fund its war in Ukraine
then throw in China into the mix as well
which has already established a military
base in nearby Djibouti
which China and Russia gaining closeness
U.S will definitely not back off either
so all in all it is another case of U.S
and Russia scrambling for a larger
footprint and Sudan is just another
Battleground doesn't it all smell like
Ukraine what is your view let me know in

[Music]
2013-14 we came across a project where a
client wanted to create a space a new
shipping container
[Music]
making a shipping container into living
space is not a new idea not that we have
invented that idea it has been happening
in other countries or a lot of spaces
long back
[Music]
it was that we got an opportunity to
work with shipping container old
shipping container and create a living
space in India
so our first project was in 2014. and
after that we decided to kind of make
this as a one of our major area of work
at Studio Alternatives
[Music]
first time we went into the into the
Container projects it was like even
locating a right container for us we
knew nothing at that point in time but
since then now we have a very set system
where we know we have standard vendors
we get inspection done we get very
detailed reports of what kind of
containers we are buying so that we are
sure what we the raw material that goes
into our products
unique part of our work is we work with
you shipping containers only secondly
our spaces are ready to install so uh
the complete space is created and made
it ready at our Workshop here in
upskirts of Pune and then it is taken to
wherever the sites are
most of our projects are in our areas
which are slightly far from the main
cities are remote areas in terms of kind
of projects that we have done we've done
like classrooms for school or a lot of
ngos who are working in the remote area
for their activity centers or Learning
Centers so those are the area which we
have done then uh we have also worked on
some technical spaces which are like
machine displays washrooms we have done
a kitchen for Domino's certain spaces we
have done for drd as well for the they
are you know kind of equipments and
other things
and majority part is farm houses
the life of a container space it's I
mean we have literature abroad where
people have been staying more than 30
plus years but we are very confident
with the kind of Maintenance where which
is very you just have to take care that
the space doesn't rust so it's just
about painting and keeping the space
intact from outside and a regular
maintenance that happens in any other
home from inside
we have started an education arm in our
foundation where we have Hands-On
workshops you know we have visits we
have awareness sessions so we have a
whole set of things that is going on

[Music]
did Ukraine try to assassinate Vladimir
Putin with a drone this week
and did Moscow respond with a flurry of
missile attacks that reheated a war that
seemed to have started to cool down
as retaliation
you see these questions are buzzing
across Europe and the concerned capitals
of the world and not without Reason by
the way
let's just take a closer look at the
developments over the last 48 hours
Let's just piece them together for you
on the 27th of April
this report emerged
it said that Kiev recently hatched a
plot to kill Putin outside the Russian
capital
and this plot was apparently the
brainchild of Ukraine's Secret Service
this report was based on a claim that
was made by a prominent Ukrainian
journalist
his name is Yuri romanenko
he is the chief editor of cavilia a
Ukrainian website
and in an extensive post on Twitter
he claimed that last week Ukrainian
intelligence officials received
information about Putin's visit to the
industrial park in Rhode Neville
and accordingly they came up with a plan
to kill him
they apparently sent
a Kamikaze drone which has a range of up
to 800 kilometers
this drone was Laden with 17 kgs of
explosives
it managed to fly over the border and
pass by Russia's air defense systems
it was supposed to explode and kill the
Russian leader right when he arrives in
rodneyville
but before it could do that the Drone
crashed
and how did it crash
was it shot down or did it malfunction
what really happened
maybe if someone knows but no one is
talking about this all we know is that
the wreckage of a drone was found just a
few miles from Moscow
it had crashed in a village called war
of scogo
the local police saying that it was
stuffed with 17 kgs of explosives
now was this the Assassin drone
well the Russians will not see but
here's what they are doing instead
this morning they launched a wave of air
strikes across Ukraine the worst hit
were the cities of women Kiev kremenchuk
the nipro micolev and poltava
and these strikes were the biggest in
two months
they left a total of 19 people dead
besides damaging critical infrastructure
and now have a look at these images
they are from Oman
they show firefighters battling a deadly
Blaze
after the missile strikes Reports say
one of them even hit a residential
building
and add another site in Oman officials
were seen digging through the rubble and
removing bodies after the deadly strikes
and last we checked the rescue
operations were still underway
or today at 4 30 am the enemy launched a
missile attack on the town of Hooman one
of the missiles hit a nine-story
residential building the first entrance
to the building was almost completely
destroyed according to the preliminary
data 109 people lived in the building 46
Flats were damaged and 27 were
completely destroyed emergency rescue
operations are currently underway
I was sitting at my computer and there
was a powerful explosion it struck me in
the back I tried to turn on the light
and it didn't work I went immediately to
look for my children my wife was in the
living room with my younger son I
couldn't open the door when I opened it
I saw nothing
soon
and have a look at these images now they
are from the nepro
they show rust rescue workers at the
sides of the missile stripes
and Reports say a woman and her
three-year-old daughter were apparently
killed in the stripes
foreign
[Applause]
[Music]
so what exactly was Russia targeting
military infrastructure is it
was it a government Hideout or an energy
facility
well there is no Clarity and Ukrainian
officials are saying that the attacks
were not aimed at anything in particular
that they had no military purpose
in fact they say Russia's intention was
to just inflict as much damage as it can
and intimidate the civilians
but how do we view this
you see one interpretation says that
these airstrikes indicate that Russia's
spring offensive has started
so is Moscow about to launch a new round
of attacks as far as Ukraine is
concerned will these strikes be followed
by more such assaults
or were they just a retaliation to
kiev's attempt of assassinating the
Russian president
is Moscow trying to send out a message
to the Ukrainian leadership
I mean just join the dots and sketch the
scenario
on Monday Ukraine hatches a plot to kill
Putin by mid-week the plot makes Global
headlines on Thursday and by Friday
morning Russia Rains Down missiles on
Ukrainian cities
if the Drone was an assassin drone
Kiev was playing a dangerous and full
heartly game
because this is not the kind of
brinkmanship that Ukraine's closest
allies would approve
Russia and China have once again made
headlines the two countries have signed
a new deal what's it about
it's a deal essentially to challenge the
NATO in the Arctic region
the countries want to reap the arctic's
natural resources and block its access
from the West
and Moscow is following this up with
building defense in the region
will the next War be over the Arctic and
what more is Moscow planning to do
you see Russia has been quite active as
far as the Arctic is concerned
Moscow recently in fact held an Arctic
rescue exercise
nine African Latin American and Eurasian
countries joined these drills and Russia
a strong Ally China stood as an observer
to these drills
the two countries describe their ties as
a no limits partnership
they have now signed a maritime law
enforcement agreement
although the details of the deal have
not been disclosed we know that this
will protect their strategic interests
in the Arctic
things are heating up
Russia's main aim is to challenge the
NATO and the West
and how exactly is Moscow planning to
establish an offensive in the Arctic
the Kremlin you see is a building more
military outposts and this includes deep
water ports and airfields
does Russia want to make the Arctic a
Battleground
when Moscow has opened over 50 Arctic
military facilities in the past decade
not just that it's also moving its
nuclear deterrent to the region
experts say the region could become a
war zone if Western countries don't take
urgent measures
so why is Russia trying to block the
Arctic for itself
Moscow regards the Arctic as its
backyard it wants access to the
hydrocarbon resources in the region
hydrocarbons make up the majority of
petroleum and natural gas
and dominance over the resource would
highly benefit Russia
in fact the country has also launched a
claim with the United Nations
to get a legal right to the riches
and just how resource-rich is the Arctic
region really
well the region has vast untapped
nuclear untapped resources and this
includes important Rare Earth elements
Russia and China value the arctic's
mineral deposits these are deposits
worth more than 30 trillion dollars
studies show that a third of the world's
undiscovered natural gas lies in the
Arctic
so it's no surprise that the country has
won the region for themselves
and how are other countries reacting to
this new deal
the Arctic states are not convinced
about the maritime agreement members of
the Arctic Council in fact have refused
to deal with Moscow especially after its
invasion of Ukraine
let's just tell you about the Arctic
Council the council currently has seven
members the U.S Russia Canada Denmark
Finland Iceland Sweden and Norway
the Arctic council is an organization
that handles matters regarding the
Arctic area and its native population
and Russia was pulled out as a permanent
member and precise over the Council on a
rotating basis
the council in fact had to stop 130
collaborative operations
and the members stopped all
communication with Russia
this led to Russia concentrating on its
own Arctic agenda which by the way
resulted in the new Maritime deal with
China
experts say Moscow feels threatened by
the NATO and the Arctic Council
and so as a result it is increasing
cooperation with China and other
non-western partners like India
it's not only Russia which has a strong
agenda as far as the Arctic is concerned
China has sought a bigger role in the
Arctic Affairs this comes as political
and economic ties deepened with Moscow
and experts say that Russia could be
China's best route
to gain greater influence over the
region
China which I've declared itself as a
near-arctic state aims to grab access to
the Arctic shipping lanes and resources
and that's that's not even all Beijing
has proposed a Silk Road on ice
and this would be a massive network of
Arctic routes
China has claimed itself as a
stakeholder in Arctic affairs
it says that climate change in the
region would directly impact its
environment and the economy
Beijing says it upholds an important
mission
what's the mission
to promote beef and Security in the
region
well the new Maritime deal seems to
represent quite the contrary
the heated contest over the Arctic seems
to not be slowing down in fact Russia
and China's attempt to dominate the
region could escalate tensions further
between the west and Russia
where are things headed will the desire
for natural resources turn into a heated
conflict would the Arctic become the
next Battleground
and our next story is about kamarja with
bajwa
Pakistan's former Chief of Army staff
he is making international headlines
and not for the best reasons
courtesy Hamid Mir and Nasim zahera
who are they
two prominent Pakistani journalists and
they have made a stunning claim
they say that in a 2021 interaction with
over a dozen Pakistani journalists
bajwa apparently revealed that Pakistan
cannot beat India if the two fought a
war
and that's not even all he even told
them that the Pakistan Army is no match
for the Indian army
let me quote his exact statement
bajwa had told us that tanks are not in
a working condition
there is no diesel for the movement of
troops
he said that the Pakistan Army was not
capable of fighting a war
before 20 to 25 people
after the incident he asked fares to at
least inform the foreign office about it
however bajwa came and lectured them
the same lecture was given to us
and immediately after this statement was
made
the Pakistan Army dismissed the claims
saying that bajwa's statement which was
made off the Record was taken out of
context
let me just quote now from their exact
response
views of the former Army chief on the
future threats to Pakistan
which he shared with media persons in an
off the Record interactive session
have been ported out of context
the Army assured the people of Pakistan
that we always took and will continue to
take pride in our operational
preparedness and utmost combat
worthiness
and you'll see the story should have
ended there only that it has not
courtesy Imran Khan
the former prime minister of Pakistan
someone who has been at loggerheads with
bajwa and has also blamed him in fact
for toppling his government
now he has claimed that he knows more
than what has been shared by Hamid Mir
but since this is a national security
issue he did not want to make
international news and let Pakistan
suffer
now remember just a few days back Imran
Khan leveled a serious allegation
allegation against bajwa he said that he
had dissolved two provincial assemblies
because General bajwa had asked him to
do so
he said that during a meeting with bajwa
back in January which was also attended
by the president Arif Alvi
he was asked to dissolve the governments
in the two provinces if he wanted the
country to go to the polls
and now you have two senior Pakistani
journalists publicly embarrassing the
former Army chief
how should one view this
until now it was Imran Khan that was
taking on bajwa and now you have
Pakistani journalists also revealing
what he told them
from where we see it we have not heard
the last of the story
and our next story is about the U.S and
China and how their strained Dynamics
are fueling an epidemic of drugs across
the U.S
this is the story of the addiction
epidemic in the United States and how
it's worsening and how Chinese money
launderers are contributing to make it
worse
our next report getting you the complete
story
Chinese money launderers are fueling an
addiction epidemic in America this
network is growing and how does it
function well
Chinese criminals are helping Mexican
drug cartels bypass Banking and
Regulatory crackdowns in the United
States
the strained relationship between
Washington and Beijing is complicating
efforts to tackle this
with China's repeated denial of any role
in America's drug crisis
and just how bad is the crisis the
figures are alarming
in 2021 alone 107 000 deaths were
recorded in America due to drug overdose
out of this two-thirds were due to a
highly addictive synthetic opioid called
Fentanyl
with the opioid becoming the leading
cause of death for Americans
particularly between the ages of 18 and
45 it has begun to emerge as America's
greatest enemy and this has led to a new
threat of drug cartel businesses
witnessing a dramatic change
officials from the U.S believe that
criminal organizations in China have
captured the money laundering business
for the cartels and this is not only
alarming but it is one of the biggest
threats to Public Safety in the United
States
as per officials this network is so
efficient in its functioning that
American law enforcement is finding it
difficult to decode it
in fact most of the communication is
carried out over WeChat it is an
encrypted Chinese instant messaging app
which is extremely difficult to
intercept the state department of the
U.S estimates illicit funds worth over
154 billion dollars passed through China
every year
154 billion dollars tracing the movement
of illicit money is difficult primarily
because Chinese money Brokers pick up
narcotic proceeds in the U.S and once
the bulk of cash is received by Chinese
Brokers they then sell the dollars to
Chinese customers who want to spend the
money in the US
Chinese organized crime charging only
two percent to launder the funds as
opposed to a charge of 10 that is
incurred on running them without Chinese
support this is accompanied by the
constant risk of violence theft and law
enforcement intervention along with
these benefits the funds are delivered
to the traffickers in their home
countries immediately with guaranteed
payment and minimized movement of funds
after all money is the lifeline of drug
cartels and China is enriching this
systematically strategically and
claiming that Mexico and China have a
smooth channel of Counter Narcotics
cooperation
and the opioid drug abuse in the U.S is
completely made in America
view report we on world is one
did India and Egypt have ancient trade
relations
well a new discovery in Egypt has
historians asking this very question
what am I talking about
a Polish U.S Mission has discovered a
statue of Buddha
and experts say that this point stewards
India Egypt ties in the Roman era
and what is the significance of the
ancient Buddha statue
Well India and Egypt two of the world's
oldest civilizations have always enjoyed
close ties since the ancient times
Mahatma Gandhi and sad saglul the former
prime minister of Egypt shared common
goals on the independence of their
countries
and now historians are asking if the
good ties date back to the Roman era
an ancient statue of Buddha has been
discovered in an ancient Temple
and what does this historical statue
look like
the statue has parts of its right side
missing it is 71 centimeters tall with a
hollow around its head
and the hollow was the biggest indicator
of the statue being that of Buddhas
next was the Lotus by its side
the excavation site was one of the
largest seaports in Roman era Egypt
the boats would often receive ships from
India
and the ships would usually come with
spices semi-precious stones textiles
ivory
Buddhism founded by Lord Buddha has its
roots in India Buddhism in fact has
shaped the Region's cultural landscape
the religion originated over 2 500 years
ago in India
Buddhists believed that the human life
is one of suffering and how can one end
the suffering
they believe meditation physical labor
and good behavior can set you free
the aim essentially is to achieve
enlightenment
also known as Nirvana
in fact Buddhism also has its own
Festival
the festival marks the birth
Enlightenment and the passing of Lord
Buddha
the event pays tribute to the life and
teachings of Lord Buddha the holy
teacher who devoted his life to
spreading the message of peace and
non-violence
although Egypt has unveiled many
archaeological discoveries experts say
the flurry of excavations have
prioritized
findings that grab media attention
so will the statue unravel the
significance of Buddhism as far as Egypt
is concerned
did Buddhism play a role in ancient
Egyptian civilizations
and our next story is from Spain
the city of Seville has witnessed a bull
fighter making history
you see the Spanish bull fighter have
been given a rather interesting honor
which is not granted for more than half
a century
what is this honor and who is this bull
fighter
first things first bullfighting is no
joke it is a part of the cultural
heritage of Spain it is a fight
between a man and a bull
but it is regulated by a set of rules
and guidelines
Spain's Jose Antonio morante de la
Puebla the bull fighter in the spotlight
as of now
was awarded the Bulls heirs as well as
the tail
and this is known to be the highest
honor given to a fighter
it is a prize that wasn't given for the
last 52 years
the leader of Seville himself honored
the bullfighter
but the celebrated bull fighter has
earlier faced criticism The Matador has
been called sadistic for his posts on
social media
in fact Jose posted a video of him
fighting a bull
it showed him attacking a bull and
plunging spikes into the back of the
bull
the video was removed and his account
was blocked
the social media platform said that the
bloody scenes represented cruelty and
sadistic pleasure
animal rights supporters cheered for the
social media platform
and this move has enriched the
bullfighting Community sport supporters
of the controversial tradition came to
the matadors defense meanwhile and Jose
himself said that this was a violation
of the freedom of expression
and this response has sparked a debate
between freedom of expression and
Council culture
bullfighting has been criticized heavily
experts say that the sport is a
supremely dangerous one even though
matadors are highly skilled the fighters
go through several severe injuries like
receiving horn wounds which can also be
life-threatening
and it's not only the Matador who is in
the line of danger
Bulls are subjected to various injuries
as well
the equipment used by a matador during a
fight like a lance and a flag are often
stabbed into the skin of the bowl
and this act can damage the Bull's skin
muscles arteries
but let me tell you how a bullfight
leads to a bull's death
you see a bullfight has three stages
each stage lasts for up to 10 minutes
The Matador must respect the timings
else the president gives them a warning
and how does the Matador win
by killing the bull
and once the bull is dead the fight is
over and the Matador is awarded
but that's not all the event carries on
until the audience Witnesses six Bulls
die
and knowing the brutal nature of the
sport
Spain still relishes bull fighting as it
lies at the heart of its culture
bull fights are considered Supreme
symbols of the Hispanic culture
but they are not only enjoyed in Spain
other parts of the world as well enjoy
their own versions of the sport
but Spain comes on top as it has the
longest season of bull fights
and with many parts of the world
witnessing the sport it might worry
animal activists as Bulls continue to be
abused
will animal rights activists lose the
battle against historic Customs will
bull fighters adopt a safer way to play
the sport
we will have to wait and watch
thank you
and just a few days ago we told you
about a leg lengthening surgery that
people are opting for
you know to gain a few inches of height
to change the way they look
and our story tonight is about shedding
some weight
the fight against obesity
and there is a major milestone
our next report telling you more
from fat to Flat do this and lose weight
in 10 days how to lose weight at home
these advertisements are all around us
promising to snatch away a few kilos and
change the way you look
but is there a miracle drug out there
this is to zipitide a drug manufactured
by Ellie Lilly and Company
it was approved to treat type 2 diabetes
under the brand name munjaro the drug is
not cleared for weight loss but early
trial data is convincing
within 17 months overweight people with
diabetes lost up to 16 of their body
weight
this is more than 15.4 kilograms similar
people without diabetes lost up to 22 of
their body weight over the same period
this is more than 22.6 kilograms
but there is another side to this
let's not forget that we live in the age
of social media where there's no dearth
of influences and as a result no dose of
content that is bombarded at us
the quote unquote perfect body standards
are hurled at us and there is no getting
away while we are not here to give you a
lecture about body positivity what we
can say is leading a healthy lifestyle
is of utmost importance
many could see pills like these as
shortcuts
experts say proper diet and exercise can
help you reduce five percent of the body
fat but this percentage stands nowhere
close to what to zapatide can do to your
body
what about the side effects after all it
is a drug that is tampering with your
digestion suppressing your appetite and
releasing new chemicals
patients have experienced diarrhea
nausea vomiting constipation and stomach
pain some users have even developed
inflammation of the pancreas and
gallbladder problems
manjaro's product description warns that
it could cause thyroid tumors including
cancer
industry analysts predict that
trisapatide could become one of the top
selling drugs ever with annual sales
topping 50 billion dollars
for Ellie Lillian Co these are big bugs
and for the world of obesity treatment
it is potentially the most effective
drug to date
but these are sensitive times a drug
like this could be considered a miracle
drug by some while for others it could
give birth to more insecurities Bureau

[Music]
now on to a story that is out of this
world quite literally
in the Autumn of 2000 a bike accident
left young John McFall without his right
leg
his life changed overnight
but he was not going to give up
in fact John was only getting started
22 years and countless paralympic medals
later
John McFall became the world's first
specially abled astronaut
appointed by the European Space Agency
the para astronaut experienced his first
zero gravity parabolic flight test on
Thursday
as he took his first vomit Comet to
space what is that
our next report getting you all the
details
it's been an eventful Journey for John
McFall
he has had an illustrious career prior
to his tint as the first para astronaut
ever
after losing his leg and learning how to
walk again with a prosthetic McFall took
up running as a Leisure activity first
and then competitively
the highlight of Mag Falls career as a
paralympian came in 2008 when he won the
bronze medal for the 100 meter race at
the Beijing Paralympics
but mag fall was only getting started
the paralympian has now put a pause on
his career as a doctor after the esa
selected him to be the first para
astronaut in space
I never dreamed of being an astronaut uh
I was always hugely interested in
science and always looked to the Stars
when I was a child but as I became you
know when I became an amputee uh like
the military there are medical
restrictions on joining which you I
wouldn't be able to join as an amputee
with a physical disability
um so it was only when Easter announced
that they were looking for
a candidate with a physical disability
to embark on this project that it really
sparked my my interest in enthusiasm for
this project
the European space agency has recruited
mag 4 to take part in a paradigm
shifting study mag 4 will observe how
his prosthetic leg behaves in zero
gravity as compared to Earth
John McFall will take the first steps to
determine how the specially abled can
take their Journey forward Beyond planet
Earth we report we on world is one
let me ask you this now what comes to
your mind when I mention the word sleep
is it rest
some much-needed rejuvenation
now what comes to your mind when I
mentioned tourism
a vacation perhaps traveling holiday
beaches
and finally what crosses your mind when
I mention the word divorce
I'm sure there are a lot of passing
thoughts there a lot is running through
your mind let me tell you what I'm
talking about
have you heard of sleep divorce or for
that matter have you heard of sleep
tourism
now if you
put in these keywords on the internet
the search engine will tell you that
these terms are trending and with that
so are these Concepts
let me just begin with sleep tourism
what is it all about
it is said to be the trend of this year
the trend that has brought the terms
sleep and holiday together
it is dominating Trend charts and gone
are the times when people traveled only
for adventure
we are entering times where travel is
more about restful sleep where one can
get that much needed rest
and travel is no longer restricted to
Scenic views or enjoying the nightlife
it's no longer for many people any it's
no longer about Adventure and food
instead it's about choosing a place that
promises a good night's sleep
from food to stay everything is centered
around your ability to sleep and rest
you see sleepers now become a luxury
we spend a third of our life sleeping
and sleep tourism is here to make a
third of Our Lives even better
in simple words sleep tourism means
going on a vacation and opting to sleep
opting for Sleep related services and
amenities
basically amenities that induce peaceful
sleep
and what exactly do you do while on a
sleep tour
you book holidays which are more like
sleep Retreats and all the activities
that you opt for are to improve your
sleep pattern
which means that your hotel rooms will
be specifically designed to cancel
outside noise they will have recorded
sleep meditations that help you doze off
there will be beds that facilitate
better sleep
does that sound interesting
according to experts sleep tourism is a
branch of Wellness tourism and it has
evolved because more and more people
want to escape the hectic schedules they
want to improve their sleeping habits
moreover the Wuhan virus pandemic played
a very big role in this trend and
Reviving it
the pandemic severely impacted people's
sleep patterns
a lot of it had to do with increased
stress levels
altered schedules
in fact according to a study nearly 40
percent of the 2500 adults who
participated in the study confirmed that
they had reduced sleep
since the onset of the pandemic
you see sleep plays a very important
role in the brain functions in fact it
plays a significant role in one's
overall health and as people are
becoming more and more aware of this
they are opting for Sleep tourism
on to the next sleep related concept
it's called Sleep divorce
and no it doesn't mean what it sounds
like it definitely does not entail a
courtroom
in simple words sleep divorce is when
couples or Partners sleep in different
rooms in different homes or in separate
beds
well do you ever feel annoyed because
your partner is snoring or working at
odd times or for that matter does it
bother you that your partner has a
completely different sleeping pattern as
compared to yours
your partner could be an owl and you are
a lock
stolen covers or alarms ringing before
you wake up
does this sound familiar do you feel
that this compromises your quality of
sleep
well this is where sleep divorce steps
in it is done or carried out to enhance
the quality of sleep for both the
partners
now what's important here is the fact
that both the partners do this together
and both feel comfortable
it can be done temporarily or even
permanently based on a couple's
discretion
now some people might be against this
idea because of its name but sleep
divorce has its benefits
one it improves your quality of sleep
and this in turn aids your mental and
physical health two it adds to the
overall health of your relationship
better sleep means a better mood and a
better mood means overall better
well-being
in fact a report that was published on
sleep divorce noted that noted 1 000
tweets on the subject out of which
61.4 percent were positive
on Tick Tock there are more than 355
000 views for the hashtag sleep divorce
so it looks like an increasing number of
people are opting for Sleep divorce but
does it have any downside
where sleep divorce cannot be a solution
in times when you have a sleep related
medical condition
medical conditions can only be treated
by medical experts
and another plausible downside is the
term divorce and its negative
implications on one's relationship and
can have
a bearing on a couple's affection
lastly constantly changing where you
sleep could hamper healthy sleep cycles
and alter your rhythms
sleep deprivation is a worldwide issue
people around the world are reporting
sleep irregularities and this is
severely impacting their quality of life
and increasing the risk of diseases like
cancer heart attacks obesity
sleep is a basic need it is an absolute
necessity thus making Concepts like
sleep tourism and sleep divorce
essential for some
people around the world are now more
worried about their money today than
ever before
and the impact of that worry is felt
everywhere
from the office to their relationships
our next report takes a closer look at
the far-reaching impact that this has on
their lives

discussing it with anyone and that
includes their partners
the survey says 66 couples believe they
are financially incompatible
that means their ideas are not aligned

investing
psychologists warn that this disparity
leads to financial infidelity a
phenomenon that involves couples hiding
their purchases from each other

stressed about money and want a
potential partner to be financially
responsible
among the parameters that count it as
most attractive in a potential partner a
good credit score ranked as priority
having a financial planner was second on
that list while many said they found
deal Hunters attractive
while respondents on the survey had no
problems answering questions about their
relationship and money the survey finds
that couples shy away from discussing
finances with each other
that's mostly due to money shame that
comes from struggling to pay bills or
afford a lifestyle that's considered
attractive

3n3wr-PZBkk,Gravitas: Did Ukraine try to assassinate the Russian President?,"Did Kyiv try to assassinate Vladimir Putin with a drone? Reports say, Ukraine recently sent a Kamikaze drone to kill the Russian ...",2023-04-28T16:18:34Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3n3wr-PZBkk/hqdefault.jpg,"did Ukraine try to assassinate Vladimir
Putin with a drone this week
and did Moscow respond with a flurry of
missile attacks that reheated a war that
seemed to have started to cool down
as retaliation
you see these questions are buzzing
across Europe and the concerned capitals
of the world and not without Reason by
the way
let's just take a closer look at the
developments over the last 48 hours
Let's just piece them together for you
on the 27th of April this report emerged
it said that Kiev recently hatched a
plot to kill Putin outside the Russian
capital
and this plot was apparently the
brainchild of Ukraine's Secret Service
this report was based on a claim that
was made by a prominent Ukrainian
journalist
his name is Yuri romanenko
he is the chief editor of covilia a
Ukrainian website
I'm in an extensive post on Twitter
he claimed that last week Ukrainian
intelligence officials received
information about Putin's visit to the
industrial park in Rhode Neville
and accordingly they came up with a plan
to kill him
they apparently sent
a Kamikaze drone which has a range of up
to 800 kilometers
this drone was Laden with 17 kgs of
explosives
it managed to fly over the border and
passed by Russia's air defense systems
it was supposed to explode and kill the
Russian leader right when he arrives in
rodneyville
but before it could do that the Drone
crashed
and how did it crash
was it shot down or did it malfunction
what really happened
maybe someone knows but no one is
talking about this all we know is that
the wreckage of a drone was found just a
few miles from Moscow
it had crashed in a village called
waroskogo
the local police saying that it was
stuffed with 17 kgs of explosives
now was this the Assassin drone
well the Russians will not say but
here's what they are doing instead
this morning they launched a wave of
airstrikes across Ukraine the worst hit
were the cities of women Kiev kremenchuk
the nipro Michael Lev and poltava
and these strikes were the biggest in
two months
they left a total of 19 people dead
besides damaging critical infrastructure
and now have a look at these images
they are from Oman
they show firefighters battling a deadly
Blaze after the missile strikes Reports
say one of them even hit a residential
building
and at another site in Oman officials
were seen digging through the rubble and
removing bodies after the deadly strikes
and last we checked the rescue
operations were still underway
or today at 4 30 am the enemy launched a
missile attack on the town of Hooman one
of the missiles hit a nine-story
residential building the first entrance
to the building was almost completely
destroyed according to the preliminary
data 109 people lived in the building 46
Flats were damaged and 27 were
completely destroyed emergency rescue
operations are currently underway
I was sitting at my computer and there
was a powerful explosion it struck me in
the back I tried to turn on the light
and it didn't work I went immediately to
look for my children my wife was in the
living room with my younger son I
couldn't open the door when I opened it
I saw nothing
you're more interesting
and have a look at these images now
they are from the nepro
they show rough rescue workers at the
sides of the missile strikes
and Reports say a woman and her
three-year-old daughter were apparently
killed in the stripes
[Applause]
[Music]
so what exactly was Russia targeting
military infrastructure is it
was it a government Hideout or an energy
facility
well there is no Clarity and Ukrainian
officials are saying that the attacks
were not aimed at anything in particular
that they had no military purpose
in fact they say Russia's intention was
to just inflict as much damage as it can
and intimidate the civilians
but how do we view this
you see one interpretation says that
these airstrikes indicate that Russia's
spring offensive has started
so is Moscow about to launch a new round
of attacks as far as Ukraine is
concerned will these strikes be followed
by more such assaults
or were they just a retaliation to
kiev's attempt of assassinating the
Russian president
is Moscow trying to send out a message
to the Ukrainian leadership
I mean just join the dots and sketch the
scenario
on Monday Ukraine hatches a plot to kill
Putin by midweek the plot makes Global
headlines on Thursday and by Friday
morning Russia Rains Down missiles on
Ukrainian cities
if the Drone was an assassin drone
Kiev was playing a dangerous and full
heartly game
because this is not the kind of
brinkmanship that Ukraine's closest
allies would approve

dry and very warm retaining the
subtropical air that has led to forest
fires and a widespread drought
Blooms of heat from the tropics are
expected to continue to affect the
country throughout the coming days
threatening the April maximum

the rising temperatures are being cited
to the entry of a very warm and dry air
mass from Africa coupled with
atmospheric stability and strong
sunshine
the Spanish weather agency said that the
Mercury is expected to creep up to 38 to
40 degrees Celsius in many regions
we are experiencing a rather exceptional
situation with the thermal Ridge of
African origin a kind of heat wave that
reaches from North Africa to Spain favor
to some extent by the continental

this point in the summer it is quite
unusual and in fact it is going to break
some temperature records in various

frequent power cuts and this may further
hinder the ability to manage the
biological material
simply put there is a huge biological
risk associated with the occupation of
this Laboratory
let's just listen in to a statement by
the world health organizations of
representative in Sudan on the situation
the main referral Central public health
law and there is I mean high risk of
biological hazards because in that one
we have for the isolate we have nasal
sized as well as cholera isobits so with
the electricity shut down and with no
technician taking care of all these the
risk of biological Hazard is high and
Harpoon because of the occupations of
the lab by one of the fighting parties
it is not really necessary to say which
party
next question who has occupied this lab
is it the Sudanese armed forces or the
rapid support forces
no one knows and the who has not named
any side in particular
however medical officials in Sudan say
that it has been taken over by the rsf
due to the ongoing conflict and the
inability to access details from on the
ground these claims could not be
verified
what we can tell you for sure though is
that an exodus is underway in Sudan
people are fleeing to neighboring
countries like chart and South Sudan the
U.N Refugee agency is saying thousands
had already fled the violence and that
it was bracing for up to 270 000 more
people to flee
so in South Sudan the planning figure
that we have for the most likely
scenario
um is uh 125 000 returns of South
Sudanese refugees into South Sudan and
45
000 refugees we think the returns in
fact we know the returns will take place
earlier
um they are mostly from Khartoum
um and the refugee flows are likely to
be afterwards our most likely scenario
is a situation where you would have won
uh one of the uh arm part of the
conflict controlling cartoon more or
less and the other part
um really basically going back into that
for with possible destabilization of the
fool and other Southern States uh inside
Sudan
and what about the foreign Nationals
last we checked thousands of them were
stranded in Sudan and this includes not
just the common man but also expats and
Aid workers
they are being evacuated by their
respective governments
Saudi Arabia carried out one of the
first reported evacuations on Saturday
so did America with a special forces
operation over the weekend
as did Britain
its Armed Forces evacuated diplomatic
staff and dependents from Khartoum on
Sunday
and what about India
some 3000 Indians live and work in Sudan
I was
the number before the crisis and New
Delhi launched operation kaveri to bring
all of them back
last we checked over 500 of them had
been evacuated
more flights are scheduled in the days
ahead
two Indian Air Force planes have been
stationed in Jeddah these are not just
any planes they are the
c130g super Hercules
now here's the thing
the Sudan evacuation has once again
brought into Focus the particular
challenges that India faces in any
conflict
there are about 14 million non-resident
Indians and more than 7 million tourists
and travelers from India each year
so there is practically no conflict
today that does not affect an Indian
citizen
and what's worse
a lot of them work in the most dangerous
environments
examples being students in Ukraine
nurses in Iraq or Yemen
or liberals in Libya Syria and Lebanon
and this makes the responsibility of the
government to help those without the
means to return to safety even greater

Ukraine war
here on gravitas we have been decoding
the various twists and turns in this
long drawn bloody conflict and getting
you the bigger picture
tonight we tell you about yet another
twist in the tail yet another turn in
the war and a very significant one
we are telling you how this is becoming
a battle of Tanks versus tanks and
drones versus drones
we get to the complete story in just a
few minutes
also the show for you tonight over 275
new covid-19 sub-variants have been
detected in China how deadly are they
what's the story there should you be
worried
a biohazard risk in Sudan dominating
Global headlines as countries evacuate
their citizens in a Race Against Time

what this means
also the story of China's Mars Rover
which is now lying lifeless we tell you
more
[Music]
and we are starting off with some
breaking news this minute
China is sending diplomats to Ukraine to
negotiate peace and try and broker a
peace deal with Russia now in the latest
the reports are saying that the Chinese
president Xi Jinping has already had a
long phone conversation with
warrnamizolenski
now it is being reported it's emerging
that the two leaders spoke for almost an
hour
and Xi Jinping reportedly told zelenski
that talks were the only way out of the
war adding that there is no winner in
nuclear Wars
and following which the Ukrainian
president has said that the conversation
will help boost the country's ties with
China
now as we piece together the latest
developments of what about Russia
while it wasn't a party to this phone
conversation the Russian leader did have
an in-person meeting remember which Xi
Jinping recently
so what does Moscow have to say now that
Xi Jinping has dialed zielinski
Russia is saying that it has noted
China's willingness to mediate but that
Ukraine's Western friends will not allow
it to sign off on any peace deal
this is what Russia is saying
and let me just remind you that this is
a breaking news story uh we are learning
at this point in the latest that's
coming in now that China will be sending
its diplomats to Ukraine uh but the way
things stand as of now on the ground
neither has the fighting stopped nor
have the preparations for a second major
flare-up
now in case the Chinese diplomats failed
to deliver the task that's been assigned
to them the next page of the Ukraine war
will be tank versus tank and drone
versus drone
you see the two sides are rolling out
the best war weapons from their Kitty
with the hope of winning this war
but who really is winning is the
immediate question that arises
and we'll get to that in just a bit
first we look at Russia's new war engine
in Ukraine
the t-14 armata battle tank
now it looks like most other tanks but
let me tell you here what's special
about it
this tank reportedly has the capability
of shooting down Ukraine's anti-tank
Rockets
it has sophisticated sensors
data networking
and not just that there are drones on
board this tank
and it's highly automated by the way
the tank screw for example does not need
to control the arms loaded onto these
tanks in person
they sit in an isolated armored capsule
which is located in the front of the
Tank's Hull
on highways this tank can go at 80
kilometers per hour
it was first unveiled in 2015 and
Russia's plan was to produce 2 300 of
these tanks by 2020.
that deadline was later stretched to
2025.
so how many of these tanks does Russia
have now
it's hard to see how many of them have
been deployed in Ukraine
again that's something that Russia has
not put on number two
but here's what we can tell you
while these tanks have rolled into
Ukraine they have not yet participated
in a direct assault operation
yet being the word of Interest here
what does Ukraine have
the German made Leopard 2 and American
Abrahams
and here's how they compare to the
Russian T14 armata
the Russian tank needs three crew both
leopard and Abrams need four
leper 2 has a maximum range of 500
kilometers
M1 Abrams 1005 kilometers
Russia's T14 armata has a maximum range
of 500 kilometers
and what about the armament
you see Leopard 2 is fitted with rhyme
metal 120 millimeter l55 smooth board
gun
coaxial 7.62 millimeter machine gun
7.2 7.22 millimeter anti-aircraft
machine gun
everyone a brands has
m256 120 millimeter Smooth Bore Cannon
12.7 millimeter machine gun
7.62 millimeter m240 machine gun
the T14 Armada on the other hand can
fire laser-guided missiles
it's also fitted with a 125 millimeter
two a eight to one meter Smooth Bore gun
secondary weapons can be loaded on top
of this
now the question is which site has
stronger tanks
is it Ukraine or is it Russia
and the answer is it does not matter
what does matter in the Battle of Tanks
is the number of tanks not their
features
and let me just give you an example here
the Battle of course it was the largest
tank battle in history
this battle was fought during the second
world war between the Soviet Army and
the German army
for the German dictator Adolf Hitler the
battle was a chance to assert German
strengths
and improve Nazi Germany's position
among its allies
and for the Soviets the battle was about
protecting Kursk
and they the Soviets won the battle
and it wasn't because they were better
prepared or had better tanks
the Soviets you see one because they had
more tanks more tanks around double the
number of German tanks
also the Soviets had a better supply
chain of Tanks
now this is not something that ex-soviet
state Ukraine can boast about
you see the Ukrainian military is over
reliant on the west on Western weapons
so much so that Ukraine cannot go ahead
with a fresh round of offensive without
these weapons
Reports say Ukraine has lost almost half
of the 800 tanks that it had in its
inventory since the war started
and Russia on the other hand had over 2
000 when it went to war
sure we saw many of these tanks break
down on the way to Kiev
but a year on it will not be wrong to
assume that Russia still has the number
in its favor
because the fact remains that the West
has not been able to add much to
Ukraine's Fleet
just a handful of Western tanks have
been delivered till date
which may explain the hold up in
Ukraine's offensive
it was supposed to begin in November
November 2022
the year has changed it's almost the end
of April 2023 and Ukraine is yet to
sound the bugle for its
counter-offensive
Ukraine's presidential
has made it clear that his troops will
not be able to proceed unless Western
weapons arrive
in fact as I speak Ukraine is still
preparing for the offensive
Reports say Ukraine is expanding its
Army of drones
there is a fundraising campaign aimed at
training drone Pilots equipping them
with sophisticated drones
but not all the drones in Ukraine
storehouses are sophisticated
Ukraine is being forced to use smaller
drones you know the kind used for
filming weddings and Instagram reels
Ukraine has reportedly imported
thousands of these drones in the last
year some 3300 other drones have been
built or purchased
many civilians have sent in their hobby
drones for this project
and Ukraine hopes to use them
to keep a watch on Russian installations
one of Ukraine's drones was recently
found near Moscow and Reports say the
Drone had crashed it was a Kamikaze
drone similar to the Iranian Shahid
Kamikaze drones that have been deployed
by Russia
so we are back to the question who is
winning this battle of tanks and drones
in Ukraine
if you look at the gains wizard we the
counter offensive and if you look at the
state of the Battleground
then the answer may not be easy on
Ukraine's air
and from a battle of Tides we turn to a
battle of narratives
this one is underway in Pakistan as I
speak and waging it are two men who were
once at the helm in Pakistan
the country's former prime minister
Imran Khan
and the former Army chief Lieutenant
General Kamar Javit bajwa
they are both out of power but cannot
seem to get each other out of their
minds it seems
and here's why I say this
Imran Khan has leveled a serious
allegation against bajwa
what did he say
he said he recently dissolved two
provincial assemblies because General
bajwa had asked him to do so
first things first which assemblies am I
talking about
the provincial Assemblies of Punjab and
Kevin
they were both dissolved in the month of
January in a bid to push for early
national elections
and until now it was assumed that this
was Imran Khan's idea only
but you see now the PTI leader himself
is saying that he that he did this on
bajwa's advice
and when exactly did he get this
so-called piece of advice
during a meeting with bajwa back in
January
which was also attended by the president
Arif Alvi it was at this meeting that he
was asked to dissolve the assemblies in
the two provinces if he wanted the
country to go to polls
and is there any Merit to what Imran
Khan is saying
did bajwa really give him such advice
and if yes why did he listen to him
are the two enemies
are we really to believe that quote
unquote a clever cloak like Imran Khan
fell for bajwa's promises
from where we see it this seems to be
yet another case of self-victimization
something that Imran Khan seems to have
mastered
remember what he said when when he was
removed from power when he was removed
from office
he had blamed bajwa for dislodging his
government accused him of playing a
double game of seeing one thing and
doing another
take this statement from December 2022
for example
I am quoting whenever I asked General
bajwa about the change of government
about the change of government he would
say it was not possible
he said we want continuity
I sent the Finance Minister who briefed
them the establishment for two hours
about the Perils of the fall of his
government
he was also assured that don't worry
because we want continuity
General bajwa was playing a double game
and I discovered later that even pti's
members were being given different
messages
so he knew bajwa was playing a double
game
why then did he need his advice a second
time
did he really expect him to be truthful
with him
my point here is very simple if Imran
Khan did go by bajwa's ideas his advice
he seems to have been taken for a fool
that said the timing of a statement is
very interesting it comes right after
another former prime minister remember
warned of a military rule in Pakistan
of course
we told you two days back he had warned
that the current crisis in the country
is enough to lead to a military takeover
let me just go to his exact statement
Pakistan has had many long periods of
Martial law in very similar situations
in fact I would say Pakistan has never
witnessed a more severe economic and
political situation before
in much less severe circumstances the
military has taken over
when the political and constitutional
system fails extra constitutional
measures take place
and for the record by the way Shahid
kakanabasi is no friend of Imran Khan
he is a member of the pmln that is
sharif's party
so him saying this is a very big deal
in fact why just him even Pakistan's
foreign minister has been making similar
statements
earlier this month said that if the
current crisis persists
Pakistan May face an emergency like
situation he also added that he is
apprehensive about the imposition of
Martial law in the country
and how exactly do we view this
was this a hint
an indication of what's about to come
are the leaders of Pakistan really
mulling the imposition of martial law
and is Imran Khan speaking against the
military out of the fair that the Army
has colluded with the ruling
dispensation
there are no easy answers to these
questions
but some developments add to our doubts
developments like these
earlier today the prime minister of
Pakistan convened two emergency meetings
one with the federal cabinet and another
with the Parliamentary leaders of Allied
parties
the participants of these meetings were
apparently briefed on the initial
contacts established for negotiations
with the PTI there were also talks on
the Supreme Court's decision to hold
elections in the Punjab province
was the imposition of Martial law also
discussed at the meeting
who knows
but everything right from Imran Khan's
allegations to the statements of the
pmln leaders to the meetings that are
being convened by the Pakistani prime
minister they all indicate that the
political storm brewing in Pakistan is
set to amplify
and the military could play a huge role
in that
let's now shift our Focus to China
three years and counting of the misery
inflicted Upon Us by the Wuhan virus
the storm is yet to pass
in fact it might only be turning
stronger and more violent
what am I talking about
over
270 new covid-19 sub-variants have been
detected in China over 270 of them this
massive number has been discovered in
just a week
could the new sub variants cause a new
pandemic
the Wuhan virus continues to make
headlines and what is especially causing
concern and sending alarm bells ringing
is that China is showing signs of
re-infections
when a person is infected the immune
system responds to protect the body the
response includes production of
antibodies
but when a virus evolves it can increase
the risk of a re-infection
so are the reinfections a result of the
new sub variants
experts believe that could be true
virologists say that reinfections occur
in nearly six months but a mutated virus
is capable capable of evading the immune
system
and this could even lead to a second
wave of infections
and what precautions has China been
taking
well the Chinese National Health
commission is saying that it will
Implement prevention and control
restrictions
China plans to track the epidemic Trends
and the new variants
but you see in recent history China's
actions speak on the contrary
where Beijing decided to remove the
mandatory PCR tests for travelers
reports said that this was China's next
step towards reopening the country
is this how China wants to contain the
spread of the new sub variants
meanwhile we have been getting you the
latest on the covid-19 situation in
India
the country has seen a surge of over 9
000 cases in the last 24 hours
the death toll has risen to over 530 000
the total death toll with the daily
positivity rate recorded at 5.38 total
Active cases standing at over 40 million
although citizens are facing nearly 8 to
10 symptoms studies show that the
duration of the illness is short and the
current surge is affecting mostly
children
crucial symptoms including signs of mild
fever and we earlier spoke to a health
expert who said that countries could
witness the emergence of new variants as
the virus mutates over time
xbb
0.1.16 being this train in the ring or
the variance coming from the Omicron
Family which has a higher infectivity
rate but lower virulence which means
that it has lesser capability to
severely harm the host
according to the health expert India is
witnessing a seasonal version of the
Wuhan virus
should people be worried about the new
Chinese sub-variants
Health experts advise that people stay
calm and don't let the guard down
children and people above 60 years of
age should take special care
simple steps like wearing a mask washing
your hands regularly go a long way
will the new Chinese sub-variants spill
over to other parts of the world
watch this space as we track the latest
and our next story is from Sudan a
country in the grip of turmoil
for the last two weeks we have been
telling you how two warning sites have
been fighting it out in the Sudanese
capital
in a bit to claim control of the
country's governance
they agreed to a temporary ceasefire
but that too has been looking shaky
and as if that wasn't enough the country
now faces a huge biological risk
have a look at the headline
that is on your screen that will be on
your screen Sudan's National Public
Health laboratory has been seized the
who is saying that this could lead to a
biological disaster
and why is that
because this seized lab is in a sense
quote-unquote a germ bomb a bomb that's
waiting to explode
and this lab contains samples of
diseases and other biological material
this includes samples of Cholera polio
measles
all technicians have been kicked out of
the lab
the fighters have converted into
converted the lab into a military base
the facility is also experiencing
frequent power cuts and this may further
hinder the ability to manage the
biological material
simply put there is a huge biological
risk associated with the occupation of
this Laboratory
let's just listen in to a statement by
the world health organizations of
representative in Sudan on the situation
the main referral Central public health
law and there is I mean high risk of
biological hazards because in that class
we have for the isolate we have nasal
sizes as well as cholera isobits so with
the electricity shut down and with no
technician taking care of all these the
risk of biological Hazard is high and
heartburned because of the occupations
of the lab by one of the fighting
parties it is not really necessary to
say which party
next question who has occupied this lab
is it the Sudanese armed forces or the
rapid support forces
no one knows and the who has not named
any side in particular
however medical officials in Sudan say
that it has been taken over by the rsf
due to the ongoing conflict and the
inability to access details from on the
ground these claims could not be
verified
what we can tell you for sure though is
that an exodus is underway in Sudan
people are fleeing to neighboring
countries like chart and South Sudan the
U.N Refugee agency is saying thousands
had already fled the violence and that
it was brazing for up to 270 000 more
people to flee
so in South Sudan the planning figure
that we have for the most likely
scenario
is 125
000 returns of South Sudanese refugees
into South Sudan and 45
000 refugees we think the returns that
we know the returns will take place
earlier
um they are mostly from Khartoum
um and the refugee flows are likely to
be afterwards our most likely scenario
is a situation where you would have won
uh one of the uh arm part of the
conflict controlling cartoon more or
less and the other part
um really basically going back into that
for uh with possible destabilization of
the Foo and other Southern States inside
Sudan
and what about the foreign Nationals
last we checked thousands of them were
stranded in Sudan and this includes not
just the common man but also expats and
Aid workers
they are being evacuated by their
respective governments
Saudi Arabia carried out one of the
first reported evacuations on Saturday
so did America with a special forces
operation over the weekend
as did Britain
its Armed Forces evacuated diplomatic
staff and dependents from Khartoum on
Sunday
and what about India
some 3000 Indians live and work in Sudan
that was
the number before the crisis and New
Delhi launched operation kaveri to bring
all of them back
last we checked over 500 of them had
been evacuated
more flights are scheduled in the days
ahead
two Indian Air Force planes have been
stationed in Jeddah these are not just
any planes they are the
c130g super Hercules
now here's the thing
the Sudan evacuation has once again
brought into Focus the particular
challenges that India faces in any
conflict
there are about 14 million non-resident
Indians and more than 7 million tourists
and travelers from India each year
so there is practically no conflict
today that does not affect an Indian
citizen
and what's worse
a lot of them work in the most dangerous
environments
examples being students in Ukraine
nurses in Iraq or Yemen or liberos in
Libya Syria and Lebanon
and this makes the responsibility of the
government to help those without the
means to return to safety even greater
our next story is from Japan
if the country finally changing
you see Japan is a citadel of
conservatives
its government is mostly run by
conservative older men
I'm not exaggerating most members of the
Japanese parliament are aged 50 to 70.
about 75 percent of them are males
but that may not be for long
young people are stepping into office
and how
Japan's newest politicians are young
they are diverse and they are asking the
Boomers and the Millennials to move over
takashima
he is 26 years old
only last year he graduated from Harvard
University where he earned his degree in
environmental engineering
and now he has made National History he
has become Japan's youngest ever mayor
takashima secured more than 46 percent
votes in the city of Asia
he defeated three Rivals including the
incumbent mayor
and then there is a 26 year old YouTuber
named shin
he also runs a Pokemon card store
but is best known for his YouTube videos
Shin is a single father
he has a three-year-old son
he campaigned for the heritsuka city
council
under the official name Shin the
heritsuka YouTuber
and guess what he won
and that's not all next we have ayaka
nasuno
she is 25 years old she was bullied as a
child she wanted to create her own
community and earlier this month nasuno
backed the highest number of votes for
the Kawasaki City Council
and then there is 34 year old arfia Arie
her parents are wigor and Uzbek she
studied at Georgetown University in the
U.S even worked for the United Nations
and now Erie has been elected to Japan's
lower house she is the first woman of
uyghur descent to be elected to not only
Japanese but any parliament in the world
you see in a country like Japan that
remains largely closed off to the world
that has extremely low levels of
immigration Arie is one of the few
Parliament members with non-japanese
ancestry
you see Japan has an aging population
it has the world's second highest
proportion of people aged 65 and over
its politics is also dominated by old
and incumbent men
in fact data from Japan's Ministry of
internal affairs and Communications
showing that the ratio of re-elected
incumbents has reached an astonishing 91
percent
in such a scenario the likes of
takashima getting elected is
unprecedented
and as I just told you Japan is one of
the world's most anti-immigration
societies
for the longest time it has kept its
borders closed for foreign workers
Japanese immigration policy is Infamous
for its restrictions
Japan has a total population of 125
million as of 2020 there were only 1.72
million foreign workers in the country
and this merely accounted for 2.5
percent of its working population
and it is despite Japan's crippling
labor shortages
but as I said Japan is changing its
traditional ways the country is trying
to loosen its immigration policies
it is entering the global immigration
War
under a 2019 law specified a special
skilled workers in 12 different sectors
were granted Japanese visas and this
included nursing care agriculture
construction
automobile Aviation sanitation among
others
but stays were limited to only five
years and that too without family
members
but now Japan is trying to revise these
very terms it is going to expand the
long-term work visas to multiple sectors
workers would be allowed to renew their
visas indefinitely and bring their
family members with them
in February Japan also announced that it
will establish new and simplified
immigration pathways
however this is only for high income
earners and graduates of high ranking
foreign universities
researchers Engineers high-level
managers would qualify for a Visa but
they would need need to have an annual
income of at least 148
000 with a master's degree or more than
10 years of work work experience
the government also saying it would be
making it easier for the younger cohort
to seek jobs in
I hope you realize that this is Japan we
are talking about
a country that takes pride in its ethnic
homogeneity
where immigration has long been
considered taboo
which until last year was a Pacific
country before it announced its defense
overhaul its biggest military built up
since the Second World War
and asked China Taiwan tensions
escalated and Russia's invasion of
Ukraine stalked warfares Japan unveiled
a 320 billion dollar defense plan it
plans to buy missiles capable of
striking China it is preparing to
sustain conflicts
you see Japan is no more just defensive
there's no more opposed to immigration
and it is definitely no more governed by
only old politicians
Japan is changing and it is ready to
take on the new challenges

inspirational grateful great eccentric
reliable specimens the AI Tech responded
with an inappropriate answer it spelled
out the n-word things are getting more
serious with a new chatbot the tech is
programmed to only know a user's City
level location but the bot seems to know
more my AI has been spotted gaslighting
users the AI lies about not knowing a
person's location but can spot the
user's movements when asked certain
questions Snapchat claims that it shares
the distance between users with the AI
meanwhile experts have called chatbots
the most equipped to spread
misinformation
AI Bots regularly respond with wrong
facts as far as Snapchat is concerned
majority of its users are children or
young adults who are more vulnerable to
believing what a chatbot says
in 2020 Reports say nearly half of
Snapchat users were between 15 to 25
years of age although a person has to be
over 13 to sign up
Snapchat admits that users might lie
about their age my AI has also been
criticized for being age inappropriate
Reports say when the bot was asked for
advice by a person claiming to be 12
years old the bot happily gave advice
about how to plan a surprise trip with a
30 year old person
what does Snapchat have to say about
this the company says that it will be
more careful and provide age-appropriate
advice to users
but this latest entry in the world of AI
has once again triggered a series of
questions Bureau report we own world
this one
it is 2023 and times have changed
let me Begin by asking you do you think
the world is becoming more inclusive
do you think we live in a world of
empathy
and why am I asking you that
have a look at this doll
do you notice anything
meet this newly launched Barbie doll it
is wearing a puff sleeved dress yellow
and blue in color a pink pendant
necklace
so I manufactured a model recently
introduced this Barbie it is a doll with
Down Syndrome
now before I go on let me just tell you
a bit about Down syndrome
it is a health condition where a person
is born with an extra chromosome
chromosomes are small packages of genes
in the body
they essentially determine how a baby's
body forms
when a baby has an extra chromosome it
changes how the body and brain develop
which can cause both mental and physical
challenges
each year around 6 000 babies in the U.S
are born with Down Syndrome
more than 47 000 in the UK
and over a hundred thousand in India
let's just get back to the Barbie doll
the blue and yellow color clothes that
she is wearing are the colors associated
with Down Syndrome
the pink pendant around her neck has
three upward Chevrons representing the
three copies of the 21st chromosome
the genetic material that leads to Down
syndrome
in fact the matching pink ankle foot
Orthotics are to support children with
Down Syndrome who use Orthotics
it is launched in an effort to help
children find a toy that represents them
to promote inclusivity to support
representation of specially abled
children and to encourage children to
play with dolls that do not look like
themselves
sounds great does it not
well then why did I begin with a
question on inclusivity
because it was launched by the very
company that received backlash over
original Barbies in 1959 way back then
the company launched Barbie with a slim
waist long legs blonde hair high heels
the Barbie that set unrealistic body
image standards for women around the
world even children
while the brand says that their purpose
with this new Barbie is to build empathy
and lead to a more accepting world
let's not forget that we are living in
the times of woke culture we are living
in times where more and more people are
going walk where brand after brand is
pitching inclusivity of size of body
type of neurodivergence
you will find a brand that is pitching
it's inclusion
the point is is our world actually
getting inclusive or are these just
sales pitches
let's say in this case where the company
has launched a product to support
inclusion when it comes to Down syndrome
pitching the idea of incorporation of
special needs
does this Barbie doll endorse the same
or does this company behind the Barbie
doll endorse the same at its workplace
how many employees on its payroll have a
disability
if yes how many of them are given
inclusivity rights how many feel seen
and heard
there is no doubt that from a parent's
point of view having a specially able
child can who can play with a doll she
connects to is empowering in many ways
all for that matter it is great that
brands are not undermining
representation
but you see the fact that diversity
plays a huge role in sales relationships
cannot be ignored
to keep up with the ever-changing sales
landscape sales leaders need to embrace
change in the sales pitches and for that
to happen there has never been a better
time
and with that the question that then
remains is do Brands stand by what they
endorse
or do they just endorse what sells in
the market
let's now talk about China it has
finally opened up about zurong it's Mars
rover
and why is that news important
because one China has been trying to
dodge questions related to the Rover for
long and two it is a story of China
doing what it does best stressing on the
made in China quality
but you see in this case it's export to
space has failed
our next report telling you more
on the 15th of May 2021
China celebrated zurong's landing on
Mars
on a large plane situated in the
northern hemisphere called Utopia
planetia
this Rover made a historical Landing as
beijing's first Rover to land on Mars to
search for signs of ancient life
but over a year later and after months
of speculation it rests in deep Slumber
on the surface of the red planet
[Music]
in fact no notable movement has been
traced in months and after shying away
from questions on this matter China has
broken its silence only to let the world
know that the zorong Rover is dead
it risks lifeless and with it so does
China's dream
what was zuron's primary Mission what
were its features and why is it called
zorong
powered by solar energy zorong is a
robotic vehicle almost the size of a
small car
designed to drive on terrains of the red
planet its primary mission was to look
for signs of life
it did so by investigating minerals and
by exploring the distribution of water
and ice
it inspected the Martian Northern
lowlands a part of Mars's largest impact
Basin and that's not all named after a
mythical Chinese god of fire this Rover
was fully robotic
as per Chinese mythology this God of
Fire lived in kunlan Mountain which is
one of the longest mountain ranges in
Asia and taught humans to use fire
he had a raid face a very fiery temper
and the ability to use and manage fire
in many ways
symbolizing fire and Heat
just like the mythical god the Chinese
Rover had a ground penetrating radar
laser and sensors to gauge the
atmosphere and magnetic sphere on the
terrain of Mars
as per scientists it was designed to
have a working duration of 90 days and
worth 358 days and traveled
1921 meters on Mars
after which it went into hibernation and
never recovered since
scientists say they have lost all
contact with this Rover primarily
because of dust accumulation further the
lack of necessary sunlight has made it
difficult to generate power and start
walking again though it landed with no
mishap
with six scientific instruments
including a high resolution topography
camera it continues to rest in an
unresponsive state with no Clarity at
all if it will ever wake up or if it
will accomplish what it was designed for
the wrong landed on Mars and sent a
long-landing selfie but now it lies dead
on the surface of a planet where it once
arrived to look for signs of life
perhaps the wrong has made the same fate
as most Chinese products do

let's now talk about a curious
multi-million divorce case one that has
been doing the rounds on the Internet
it's been talked about
you might have guessed it already
the Archer of Hakimi and Hiba a book
divorce Saga
this key is half third a mother versus
wife debate
and what is it all about
I'll just break it down for you before
that let's take a look at Hakimi and a
book's relationship
Hakimi plays for Morocco's national team
and Paris Saint-Germain Heba book is a
Spanish actress
the couple started dating in 2018.
Hakimi was only 19 years old then a book
was 31. they did it for two years were
married for three they had two sons
together
and now they are headed towards a
divorce
what went wrong
while some say the two had already
decided to part with others are pinning
it on a rape case against Hakimi
last month the star player reportedly
invited a woman to his Paris home and he
then allegedly raped her
that is what the 24 year old victim is
claiming
Hakimi is now under investigation
and a book has announced that she was
filing a divorce
Hakimi has a reported net worth of
around 24 million dollars he is the
sixth highest paid athlete in Africa he
earns around 215 000 per week
reports see a book demanded more than
half of Hercules fortune in alimony
and what happened next left everybody in
shock
as it turns out most of the Moroccan
players Fortune was in his mother's name
a book's husband legally owns nothing
his assets are registered under his
mother's name
and the internet is going Gaga over how
Hakimi dribbled his wife
his mother also jumped to his defense
saying that he did not do anything wrong
and despite the controversy a book has
demanded over 11 million dollars to
settle the divorce
Hakimi is offering only 2.2 million
dollars
and Reports say a book is also filing a
lawsuit against Hakimi for fraud and
mismanagement of their marital assets
the divorce gets complicated by the day
what motivated hakimi's choice
why did he register all his fortune
under his mother's name
did he not trust his wife to begin with
these are questions that are being asked
and the incident by the way has given
misogynist New Order
a book has already become a running joke
on the internet
how will the divorce Saga unfold remains
to be seen

Russia and Ukraine scores of Nations

attempt to hamper moscow's bid two in
weight cave a plan made by the U.S to
end all G7 exports to Russia has met
with a roadblock as a part of the
negotiations ahead of a summit of the
world's most advanced economies
according to report filed by the
financial times the European Union and
Japan have pushed back against the U.S
proposal EU and the Japanese Diplomat
say that Washington's proposal is simply
not doable according to the documents
seen by the news Outlet a G7 leader
statement is being drafted for the next
month's meet in Hiroshima the statement
includes a pledge to replace the current
sector by sector sanctions regime
against Russia with a complete export
ban and only a few exemptions before
export ban would include exemptions for
agricultural medical and other products
the G7 leaders will meet in Hiroshima on
May 19th for a three-day Summit the
focus of the meeting will be on the
effects of Russia's war against Ukraine
and the economic security green
Investments and also the indo-pacific
region meanwhile The Proposal made by
the U.S comes amidst Washington's Rising
frustration with the existing system
riddled with loopholes which allows
Russia to continue to import Western
technology but representatives from
Japan and the EU country suggested in a
meeting last week that such a move would
not be feasible in addition to the fact
that the officials say replacing the
regime with a full export ban plus
exemptions can risk reopening the
debates where some of the member states
secured exemptions for the industries by
threatening to veto the restrictions and
also the potential weakening of the
already existing measures where they
agreed on 10 packages of sanctions on
Russia meanwhile in the wake of the
response made by its allies the White
House's National Security Council has
declined to comment on the conversations
with the G7 Partners but said that the
U.S would continue to look for ways to
hold Russia more accountable the
disagreement over the measure
underscores the lack of additional
options available to G7 leaders as they
seek to increase the economic punishment
for Vladimir Putin's regime after 14
months of the ongoing War
should not be fooled by calls for a
temporary or unconditional ceasefire

a cup of story tonight is about the
Sudan crisis
for days the clashes between the
country's Army and the Parliamentary
Force have been making headlines and
things have reached a point where the
crisis is spiraling out of control
the result has been a Race Against Time
as countries try and evacuate their
Nationals now

[Music]
it is a race to leave Sudan to leave the
country that has become the face of what
the fight for power can do to a
seemingly peaceful Nation
Sudan is also an example of how little
people affected by this power tassel
between the powerful can really do
some 46 million people live in Sudan
there are anywhere between 47 000 to 50
000 expats and their home countries are
now scrambling to get them out
some countries have been successful some
not as much
Japan has evacuated 45 people
America some hundred people
most U.S government officials and their
dependents
France has evacuated over 500 people
Germany has evacuated some 300 people
including German citizens and other
nationalities
they were taken to the Ethiopian border
on buses
the plan is to take them to the
Ethiopian city of gondar and from there
they will be flown out
this evacuation mind you is no easy task
let's just pull out a map for you
this is where Khartoum is located it is
the capital city of Sudan and this is
where the fighting is concentrated
now Sudan like you can see is surrounded
by land on three sides there is Egypt
and Libya to the north chart and Central
African Republic to the West
South Sudan and Ethiopia in the south
and there is Eritrea in the east
and next to it is the Red Sea
so how do you fly out those who are
trapped in the fire fighting
either you take them by road to another
country like Ethiopia and then go to the
nearest airport and fly your citizens
out or you take the sea route
which means get on a bus in Khartoum and
drive towards the Red Sea
The Distance by the way between Khartoum
and Port Sudan is no cake walk it is
over
840 kilometers it takes over 13 hours by
bus on a regular day 840 kilometers
but currently driving through the
conflict Zone can take up to three days
three days
also your journey does not end when you
reach the port of course
instead a fresh test of patience begins
there are thousands of other
nationalities waiting there relief staff
people waiting for their turn to board a
ship and sail to safety
this is the situation in both Sudan as I
speak
you see evacuating people from conflict
zones is a challenge as it is but with a
geography so unfavorable the task
becomes all the more uphill
in Khartoum you have warning sides
claiming control of critical
infrastructure firing relentlessly
relentlessly at the Army with no one
inside being spared irrespective of his
or her gender political leanings or
nationality
everyone was under threat because there
was no security you were inside the
hotel they shot at a hotel and the
buildings around stray bullets and cars
that had been shot with people inside
are this what this fear is
and by the way diplomats also are not
better off
the Swiss ambassador to Sudan was
recently heard recounting his dangerous
Escape
we could clearly see the rsf escorts
with their pickup trucks and machine
guns and mounted RPGs navigating through
the areas they control it gave us a good
overview of what they currently control
all of a sudden we got to the front line
and the escorts disappeared where tanks
of the regular army were parked we
passed them all this was accompanied by
attacks from the air also by a regular
army with mig-29s luckily they did not
shoot at us but they focused on other
targets
Egyptian embassy staff mail was not
all he was shot dead in cartoon the
spokesperson of the Egyptian Minister of
Foreign Affairs spoke about the incident
adding that Egyptian diplomats ethics
quote unquote require them to be the
last to leave the area after ensuring
that the evacuation operation is
completed
so how many people are exactly still
trapped in Sudan
well the answer is it's hard to say it
is estimated that some 2000 people of 16
nationalities have been evacuated from
Sudan so far some 3000 Indians live and
work in Sudan Reports say over 270 of
them have been evacuated so far
they departed from both Sudan on board
ins sumita around 5 a.m local time
the ship is Jeddah bound it is a 12 hour
long journey following which the ship
will come back to Port Sudan for the
next batch of the Indians
meanwhile Ernest thing has also reached
both Sudan
India has launched operation kaveri to
bring all its citizens living in Sudan
as per the latest update from India's
Ministry of external Affairs around 500
Indians have already reached both Sudan
two Indian Air Force planes have been
stationed in Jeddah
and not just any planes but the
c-130j super Hercules
what's happening in Sudan has also
become a test for leadership outside the
country and Britain's Rishi sonak
appears to be failing that test
miserably
Reports say 71 NHS doctors remain
trapped in Sudan
they have received no help and they
claim to have lost all hope of being
evacuated
NHS workers in Britain have been sharing
stories of their colleagues trapped in
Sudan front pages of British dailies are
urging the sonar government to get the
NHS doctors out as soon as possible
people in Britain are pointing out that
it was quick to evacuate its Embassy
staff leaving behind its citizens they
say it is heartbreaking to see how other
countries are prioritizing their people
instead of those in positions of power
but you know what they say a government
is as good as its conduct during times
of crisis
and what's happening in Sudan sanso have
repercussions in the neighborhood and
Beyond
and from Sudan we shift our Focus to
another country in chaos Pakistan
the SWAT rally of Kerber has been rocked
by two explosions the blasts occurred at
a counter terrorism office 16 people
have been killed more than 55 have been
injured buildings have collapsed
and what happened exactly
well it depends on who you ask
Pakistan police suspects the blasts were
triggered by an electrical fault
that the weapons kept at the office
caught fire due to a short circuit
it says there is no evidence of a
terrorist attack so far
but let's not forget it's Pakistan that
we are talking about
and thought Valley has long control was
long controlled by tarike Taliban
it is the same place where Malala yusufs
I remember was short
look at this Suite by the Prime Minister
Sheba Sharif
he explained the blasts as a suicide
attack
but soon clarified that the explosion is
still being investigated
while some believe the short circuit
Theory others are pointing figures
towards the TTP
it has been wreaking havoc across
Pakistan
it was created by the isi its purpose
was to help the Afghan Taliban capture
Kabul
and with that out of the way the tarike
Taliban is on its next mission
what is that
it wants to take over Pakistan and turn
it into a talibani state
you see Pakistan is dealing with a
monster of its own making
the one it nurtured and sheltered for
several years
it has come to bite it back
Hillary Clinton once bluntly said you
cannot keep snakes in your backyard and
expect them to only bite your neighbors
eventually those snakes are going to
turn on Whoever has them in the backyard
and that is coming true for Pakistan
since 2007 the TTP has carried out
hundreds of attacks and thousands of
deaths have occurred in 2021 the TTP
warned Islamabad to brace itself for an
offensive and since last year it has
been executing it
in 2022 Pakistan was rocked by 376
Terror attacks this was the highest in
the last five years
533 people were killed 8 32 were injured
Terror attacks increased by 28 percent
since 2021.
there were improvised explosion device
ambushes
suicide attacks
rates on security posts
the TTP has been flexing its muscles
over the last few months specifically
on the 17th of February the Karachi
police office building came under attack
four people along with three terrorists
were killed 19 others were injured
the biggest blow however came on the
30th of January
clad in police uniform a suicide bomber
attacked a mosque in Peshawar the
mosque's roof collapsed on hundreds who
were praying inside at least 100 people
lost their lives more than 225 were
injured
between the 25th of December and the
26th
Balochistan
witnessed as many as 18 Terror attacks
18
in 28 hours grenades were held at police
stations and police force IEDs went off
close to Security Forces gunfight was
reported in some parts at least six
security Personnel died 17 were injured
and the TTP claimed responsibility for
most of them
earlier mostly Pakistan Afghan border
regions came under attack
but the terror is slowly shifting to the
country's Heartland
on the 23rd of December
TTP Terror shook Islamabad after a
policeman four security officials and
two civilians were killed in a suicide
blast this blast took place in
islamabad's I-10 sector that borders
Rawalpindi the headquarters of the
Pakistan Army
on the 18th of December the TTP took a
counter-terrorism center in campus Banu
District
they held officers hostage for over 40
hours
Pakistan Security Forces finally
Siege the center they released all the
hostages and killed 25 TTP terrorists
inside
three officers were martyred
the TTP already controls vast parts of
the territory in the Northwest Frontier
of Pakistan but it wants more in January
Pakistani Taliban warned Pakistan's top
leadership it said if any action was
taken against the group the government
will have to pay for it
and the TTP statement explicitly named
the Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and
the foreign minister Bilal Bhutto
sardari
you see
chickens have come home to Ruth
for years Pakistan has been fueling
terrorism and today countering it
remains its biggest challenge
the government itself does not know
what's going on in the country
economic social political crises
continuing to grip the country
terrorism
let's now talk about what's happening in
Kenya
a Christian cult is at the center of
this story that is dominating headlines
and has sent shock waves around the
world
the government there is scrambling to
impose regulations as the police
Discover at least 89 bodies from Mass
Graves
Reports say the death toll could still
rise as the Kenyan Red Cross says that
over 112 people are still missing
what is the story here what is the aim
of this Christian cult
well the followers of Good News
International Church have been living in
secluded areas within Kenya's shakahola
Forest
these followers believe that if they
starve themselves to death
they will reach heaven before the end of
the world
and this has led to the discovery of
over 14 Mass Graves
experts estimate that there could be up
to 60 Mass Graves and that only a
quarter of them have been found as of
now
the police also found at least 29
survivors
but what's surprising here is that not
all of them wanted to be saved
and what's the mystery there why do they
not want to be rescued
well the survivors don't believe that
they are victims
you see they believe that starving and
bearing themselves alive
is the only way to enter Heaven
The Rescuers say that when they try to
provide Aid to these survivors they
refused and even called them enemies who
are not letting them go to heaven
and who is leading this Christian cult
Paul McKenzie who is the head of the
Good News International Church he was
arrested on the 14th of April after the
police got a tip-off about the existence
of these Graves and the police now have
14 days to carry out further
investigations while Mackenzie is kept
in detention
Reports say McKenzie is refusing food
and water
looks like the leader is following his
teachings
so how was the government responded to
this incident
the President William Roto
has called The Cult leader someone who
does not belong to any religion
officials have also called the mass
burials a massacre
people are shocked as a result of this
terrifying event speaker of the Senate
Amazon kingee has asked how can such an
evil of such a magnitude take place
without anybody finding out about it
another question that continues to
dominate discussions is why would
someone starve themselves to death
willingly
well this story goes way back Beyond the
Forest filled with the mass Graves
you see Kenya is a profoundly religious
country 85 percent of the population
identifies as Christian
experts say that there is a growth of a
lot of small churches which might pose a
major problem for the country especially
if they are not properly regulated
according to them
if Kenya sees a larger Growth Spurt of
these churches
more leaders like Paul McKenzie could be
able to brainwash the people
by acting as if they are solving the
followers problems
and Kenya by the way is not the only one
with a dangerous cult
let's just look back and talk about
America's goanna cult this is one of the
most horrific Mass model suicides in
modern history
in the year 1978
914 adults and children lost their lives
because of a Preacher
Who convinced them to carry out a
revolutionary suicide
which resulted in those deaths
the parents were told to feed their
children poison can you believe that
there's another cult related Massacre
this one's in Uganda in the year 2 700
people burned themselves to deaths for
what was called the movement for the
restoration of the Ten Commandments of
God followers were locked in a church
while it was set on fire
and coming back to the U.S Texas
witnessed 76 people burning themselves
to death as well in 1993 followers of
the Branch Davidian cult
died in a wooden Fortress while it was
caught in a blaze the cult was also
accused of stockpiling weapons
the death toll in Kenya is reaching
somewhere similar to the Texas cult
incident
and we will be keeping a close eye on
the latest developments
let's now move on and talk about covet
19.
a new symptom is being talked about in
India pink eye also known as
conjunctivitis
what is the link of this to covid-19
it is being noticed among children and
infants
amid the recent spike in the covid-19
cases children aged below one year are
at the highest risk as per reports
and this rise is driven by the
subvariant of Omicron xvb 1.16 and as
per reports conjunctivitis is the main
symptom among children
what is conjunctivitis it is a type of
swelling that happens in the eyes and
can be accompanied by pain and redness
a lot of times it can lead to irritation
and Theory discharge
it is contagious in nature which means
it can spread from one person to another
further in some cases it can also lead
to light sensitivity which is
accompanied by puffy eyes
in fact recent Studies have confirmed
that young infants are infected more
than older children
what are the doctors saying
they advise vigilance towards pink eye
as it is observed to be a defining
factor in diagnosing covert 19.
while among adults the symptoms include
signs and muscle pain
loss of appetite fatigue also being
noted to be common the good part is that
this can be managed symptomatically and
goes away with treatment for children in
particular
Healthcare Providers have advised the
parents to wash their children's eyes
with warm water
It is believed that this works both as a
remedy also as a preventive measure you
know to stop the virus from spreading
further
and in teenagers the major covid-19
symptoms including
body ache weakness fever sore throat
While most of these symptoms are
manageable and mimic flu
the total duration of these symptoms
ranging from one to three days expected
to be mild in nature Vigilant testing
being alert towards flu-like symptoms
goes a long way
in diagnosing and helping in stopping
the spread of covert 19.
and apart from conjunctivitis
respiratory symptoms are also being
observed while adults and children both
are impacted these symptoms are
predominantly being seen among infants
as per the medical authorities there are
three Essentials when it comes to
battling the current surge first
wear a mask second wash your hands at
regular intervals and third vaccination
of course
and these are a must for children
though our covid-19 cases are on the
rise in India effective measures are in
place to contain the spread
more than 189 000 samples were tested in
the last 24 hours alone with roughly 63
000 Active cases India has been leaving
low stone unturned in its fight against
the Wuhan virus
so if your child complains of a red eye
or your teenager complaints of body ache
or you experience body ache do not
ignore these symptoms or dismiss them as
just being a case of feeling under the
weather
get yourself
and those close to you tested
moving on India recently witnessed the
arrest of pro Palestinian separatists
amritpal Singh
he was nabbed after being on the run for
a month
and his wife Kiran deep Kaur has been
questioned kept under police
surveillance
what led to amrita's arrest
did his wife's movements help in
tracking down Amrita Singh what is the
story of his wife
our next report getting you the details
of amritpal Singh's life remains
shrouded in mystery we know that Singh
was the head of Waris Punjabi an
organization which aimed to mobilize
Farmers against the Indian government's
agricultural reforms
amritpal Singh's speeches were popular
among the supporters of the separatist
kalistan movement
so how did Singh get arrested after
being on the run for months what led to
his arrest
a part of the answer is his wife Kiran
deepkor Reports say kirindeep was the
reason Singh chose not to flee India as
he thought that police would then arrest
his wife The Fugitive chose to put his
wife first and wanted her to safely get
out of the country this did not work out
as kirindeep's attempt to board a flight
to London field she was stopped by the
airport authorities in Amritsar let's
not forget that kirandeep has been under
constant surveillance
but why would Singh's wife try to fly to
the UK well it turns out that
kirandeep's family is based in the UK
since 1951.
the British Citizen and her family visit
India every two years this was also
beneficial for amritpal Singh as he
rooted funds for his operations through
his wife and parked them in the UK
how did the two meet through Instagram
Reports say kirandeep sent amritpal an
appreciation message and said that he
was powerful in his approach towards his
goal
and what did amritpal say when asked
about his priorities
Singh said that his religious goal would
always come first and his wife will
remain his second priority
kirandeep justifies her marriage and
says that Singh is a caring husband and
that it was her choice to marry him
since their marriage and amritpal being
on the Run kirandeep has gone through
questioning by authorities along with
amritpal Singh's mother
in fact in an interview before the
arrest kirandeep said she will be
satisfied if she simply knows where her
husband is even if he's in jail
she also said that she left everything
just to be with him and that she will
not leave the country without him well

in assam's dibrugar jail and was

Beyond world is one
you thought about or talked about
something about yourself that you are
not happy with
something you'd like to change
was it to do with your professional life
your personal life perhaps your health
your eating habits
or the worst of them all
the way you look
you see we live in rather strange times
thanks to social media to a great extent
our aspirations have expanded there are
unnecessary standards that we are
subjected to that are imposed upon us
to quote unquote look a certain way
the so-called Perfect Image
there are unhealthy ideals aspirations
and I'm not here to give you a lecture
about body positivity tonight
what I want to tell you about
if the impact that such aspirations and
standards are having on us
and the length to which people are going
to try and change the way they look
unimaginable lengths
or shall I say Heights
here's what I'm talking about
leg lengthening surgeries
you heard that right and don't worry I
am going to explain what I'm talking
about and break it down for you
people are opting for these limb
lengthening surgeries to increase their
height you know to grow a few inches
taller because they don't like their
height because they feel short and want
to be taller
it's a painful procedure to say the
least
Imagine This
literally breaking your bones to grow
taller
the hours long operation basically
involves cutting the thigh bones in each
leg
and putting rods inside them
and then over the next few months the
length of these rods is increased by up
to one millimeter
around 0.04 inches per day
and that's just one part of the story
post the surgery you have to undergo
physical therapy and then comes the
final stage
when the rods are removed
does that sound painful
well your pocket will feel the pain as
well it is a costly affair
how costly
it can cause you cost you lacks of
rupees thousands of dollars
and just to give you a rough idea to
which at which extent people are going
for this
around 170 000 approximately
1.35 crore rupees that's the amount that
this man for example shared to gain a
few inches and grow taller
Moses Gibson from Minnesota spent the
amount on two leg lendering surgeries to
increase his height by 5 inches
Gibson said he was subjected to
heightism and struggled to even find a
girlfriend because of his height he felt
now these procedures traditionally are
reconstructive procedures
they have basically been used to rectify
discrepancies in the length of the legs
but this painful surgery is now gaining
popularity among the youth
those who want to increase their height
and are not happy with how tall they are
there is actually a term for this it's
called short stature dysphoria
simply put a high level of
dissatisfaction with one's height
would you want to go under the knife to
look taller
tell us what you think about this

a massive earthquake recently hit
Indonesia a magnitude of 7.3 on the
Richter scale at a depth of 84
kilometers
this earthquake has left a trail of
aftershocks
also a number of questions
it triggered a tsunami warning
and while an earthquake has recently
struck Indonesia it's not the only
country of course in this part of the
world to be impacted recently
our next report taking a closer look at
this region where 90 of our planet's
earthquakes occur
take a look
what comes to your mind when I say ring
of fire
a hula hoop a circus jumping ring well
this is the ring of fire a region
located at the rim of the Pacific Ocean
it is approximately 24 900 miles in
length that is 40 000 kilometers also
referred as the circum Pacific belt the
ring of fire is a path along the Pacific
Ocean characterized by active volcanoes
and frequent earthquakes the reason the
geographical location of this belt the
ring of fire includes the Pacific coasts
of South America North America and
Russia it is home to Australia New
Zealand the Philippines to name a few it
is a tectonically active region with a
presence of more than 450 volcanoes
among these are 40 active volcanoes in
the Andes nearly 300 in the Philippines
70 in Indonesia and 40 in Japan
this rounds about to 75 percent of
Earth's volcanoes 75
making it the most seismically and
volcanically active Zone in the world in
fact this is the very reason why it is
called the Ring of Fire
situated on this belt Indonesia Sumatra
Island was hit by an earthquake of
magnitude 7.3
bmkg Indonesia semiological agency has
issued a warning that urged people to
stay away from beaches because of a
Potential Threat of a tsunami It is
believed that the impact of the tsunami
will be far-reaching
while residents in Indonesia began brisk
evacuations trying to move to safer
areas the tsunami warning was lifted
after two hours authorities say that the

still under panic panic that they
persistently live with panic that has
become a way of life have a look at
these statistics
21 earthquakes were felt in the South
Pacific region 15 around Pacific
marginal sea 50 in the Southwest Pacific
regions
these are weekly numbers of these
regions numbers from just last week so
on an average these parts of the world
face a staggering number of earthquakes
daily
though their intensity and depths differ
these numbers are worrisome just imagine

Field Marshal Ayub Khan Yaya Khan who
Unleashed havoc and massacres on
Bangladesh
General Zia UL haq who drove his country
towards extreme islamism
who left Pakistan in complete shambles
but as Pakistan's economic crisis
spirals out of control and prices soared
to unbelievable Heights as the treasury
heads towards bankruptcy as civilian
politicians stare at one another for the
rewards of office at the expense of the
country's people as the government and
the Judiciary Pass Daily orders against
each other almost and as the Army Chief
looks quietly at the Gathering storm
saying nothing
perhaps biding his time
voices are being raised to say that once
again Pakistan seems to have no other
option if it wants stability
a question that was earlier only a part
of dental dinner table conversations is
being asked by the country's own leaders
I am talking about the country's former
prime minister Shahid hakanabasi he has
warned that the current crisis in the
country is enough to lead to a military
takeover
in fact according to him martial law
remains a possibility and all
stakeholders need to address the
political crisis soon
not just that Abbasi also said that
martial law has always remained a
possibility in case of a system failure
martial law was imposed in Pakistan
Whenever there was conflict between
institutions like Judiciary and the
political leadership and there was no
way forward
now here's the thing Pakistan had been
directly ruled for about half of its
history by military generals
but even when the military generals are
not in power on paper
they continue to call the shorts
according to the former prime minister
Pakistan has had many long periods of
Martial law in very similar situation he
goes on to say that Pakistan has never
witnessed such a severe economic and
political situation before
and that the military has taken over in
much less severe circumstances
does that sound worrying
what does the Pakistan prime minister
Sharif have to say
is the Army going to snatch away his
authority if he has any at all that is
and what do his ministers have to say
well let me tell you that this is not
the first time the possibility of a
military takeover has been raised far
from it Pakistan's foreign minister
Bilal Bhutto talking about the
imposition of an emergency
bilaval is the son of a former prime
minister Benedict Bhutto and Grandson of
zofikar aliputo who was hanked by an
army despot in what was called a
Judicial murder
Benazir was sent into Exile by General
Zia and returned to office through an
election only after General Zia died in
a mysterious air crash
herself was assassinated when General
basharov was in power
and despite such a tragic personal
history Bilal Bhutto is talking of an
emergency which can only be
realistically imposed by Army rule
you know that the crisis has gone out of
control just three weeks ago
Pakistan's foreign minister said that if
the current crisis persists Pakistan May
face an emergency like situation he also
added that he is apprehensive about the
imposition of Martial law in the country
basically he was worried that the
political crisis in the country will
spiral out of control
you see this time what Pakistan is going
through is unprecedented
its economy is bleeding people are
starving the level of desperation and
despair on the ground has reached a
point of no return
to the extent that people are dying in
stampedes while trying to get wheat
during the distribution of food Aid
over 20 people have lost their lives in
such stampedes over food in recent days
so it's either dying because of
starvation or dying while fighting
against starvation
such is the sad State of Affairs in the
country
food inflation is at a record high of 47
last month inflation in Pakistan touched
nearly 60-year High 6-0 the rate of
year-on-year inflation hit
35.37 in March this was the most
expensive ramzan for some people and the
country saw muted celebrations and
festivities
and the political chaos in the country
is only getting worse
let me tell you about what another
former leader of the country is up to
I'm talking about Imran Khan
he has launched his election campaign in
Punjab now in any other part of the
world elections follow a due process but
this is Pakistan and Imran Khan we are
talking about
he has launched the election campaign in
Punjab without any Clarity regarding the
date of the polls
saying that the ruling establishment
might not be ready for the election but
he definitely is
there is uncertainty regarding the
elections in Punjab it is the country's
most populous Province it stands nearly
150 lawmakers to the National Assembly
meanwhile the election commission of
Pakistan is waiting for funds from the

[Music]
here's a look at what's lined up for you
on the show tonight
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
story tonight is about Pakistan's
never-ending crisis
the political chaos the economic misery
continues to worsen
a former Pakistan prime minister has now
issued a dire warning on the country's
deepening crisis
the ex-prime minister has warned of a
military takeover
but can a coup end Pakistan's crisis is
Pakistan really headed for military rule
vote Sharif prefer to hand over power to
the Army than to Imran Khan and could
this be the first time that Pakistan
would see what might be called a
friendly coup leaving Pakistan in the
hands of the army chief
we discuss this and more also on the
show for you tonight we tell you about
China's obsession with rewriting history
and it's growing intolerance for descent
as the Sudan crisis continues to deepen
we tell you all about the mission
evacuation as countries continue to
evacuate their Nationals
will Ronaldo be deported from Saudi
Arabia that's a question that continues
to dominate Global headlines and we also
tell you about heartbeat rings for
couples and why they are being talked
about
foreign
for military rule once again
is a coup on the cards
haven't pakistanis had enough of
generals who become dictators
Field Marshal are you Khan Yaya Khan who
Unleashed havoc and massacres on
Bangladesh
General Zia UL haq who drove his country
towards extreme islamism
foreign who left Pakistan in complete
shambles
but as Pakistan's economic crisis
spirals out of control and prices soared
to unbelievable Heights as the treasury
heads towards bankruptcy as civilian
politicians stare at one another for the
rewards of office at the expense of the
country's people as the government and
the Judiciary Pass Daily orders against
each other almost and as the Army Chief
looks quietly at the Gathering storm
saying nothing
perhaps biding his time
voices are being raised to say that once
again Pakistan seems to have no other
option if it wants stability
a question that was earlier only a part
of dental dinner table conversations is
being asked by the country's own leaders
I am talking about the country's former
prime minister Shahid hakanabasi he has
warned that the current crisis in the
country is enough to lead to a military
takeover
in fact according to him martial law
remains a possibility and all
stakeholders need to address the
political crisis soon
not just that Abbasi also said that
martial law has always remained a
possibility in case of a system failure
martial law was imposed in Pakistan
Whenever there was conflict between
institutions like the Judiciary and the
political leadership and there was no
way forward
now here's the thing Pakistan had been
directly ruled for about half of its
history by military generals
but even when the military generals are
not in power on paper
they continue to call the shots
according to the former prime minister
Pakistan has had many long periods of
Martial law in very similar situation he
goes on to say that Pakistan has never
witnessed such a severe economic and
political situation before
and that the military has taken over in
much less severe circumstances
does that sound worrying
what does the Pakistan prime minister
Sharif have to say
is the Army going to snatch away his
authority if he has any at all that is
and what do his ministers have to say
well let me tell you that this is not
the first time the possibility of a
military takeover has been raised far
from it
Pakistan's own foreign minister
zadari talked about the imposition of an
emergency
bilaval is the son of former leader
beneside Bhutto and the grandson of
zulfikar alibuto who was hanged by an
army despot
in what was called a Judicial border
Benazir was sent into Exile by General
Zia and returned to office through an
election only after General Zia died in
a mysterious car in a mysterious air
crash
herself was assassinated when General
Musharraf was in power
despite such a tragic personal history
Bilal Bhutto is talking about an
emergency which can only be
realistically imposed by Army rule
you know that the crisis has gone out of
control just three weeks ago
Pakistan's foreign minister said that if
the current crisis persists Pakistan May
face an emergency like situation he also
added that he is apprehensive about the
imposition of Martial law in the country
basically he was worried that the
political crisis in the country will
spiral out of control
you see this time what Pakistan is going
through is unprecedented
its economy is bleeding people are
starving the level of desperation and
despair on the ground has reached a
point of no return
to the extent that people are dying in
stampedes while trying to get wheat
during the distribution of food Aid
over 20 people have lost their lives in
such staff eats over food in recent days
so it's either dying because of
starvation or dying while fighting
against salvation
such is the sad State of Affairs in the
country
food inflation is at a record high of 47
last month inflation in Pakistan touched
an early 60-year High 6-0 the rate of
year-on-year inflation hit
35.37 in March this was the most
expensive ramzan for some people and the
country saw muted celebrations and
festivities
and the political chaos in the country
is only getting worse
let me tell you about what another
former leader of the country is up to
I'm talking about Imran Khan
he has launched his election campaign in
Punjab now in any other part of the
world elections follow a due process but
this is Pakistan and Imran Khan we are
talking about
he has launched the election campaign in
Punjab without any Clarity regarding the
date of the polls
saying that the ruling establishment
might not be ready for the election but
he definitely is
there is uncertainty regarding the
elections in Punjab it is the country's
most populous Province it stands nearly
150 lawmakers to the National Assembly
meanwhile the election commission of
Pakistan is waiting for funds from the
federal government to carry out that
election
the defense Ministry meanwhile telling
the election commission
that the Pakistan Army will not be
available for providing security
the cash-trapped government has not
authorized funds to meet the expenses
and this is amid the economic crisis
Imran Khan has already been training his
guns on the country's establishment
saying that they have no idea how to get
out of this economic mess he's been
targeting the government over this
well he is not wrong about that
the country's prime minister already has
talked about the embarrassment phase by
the country when it has to go around the
world with a begging Bowl
but Imran Khan UC was not able to solve
the economic puzzle himself either when
he was in power
the vested interests of those who want
to cling on to power have cost the
country and its people dearly
if you have a better definition of
political chaos let me know
and let me leave you with one more
thought
and if not outside the realm of
possibility given the Deep endemic
hatred that has now become synonymous
with Pakistan's politics
what sahabash Sharif prefer to hand over
power to the Army than to Imran Khan
you see their hatred for each other is
well known
they would happily use power to destroy
the other
could this be the first time that
Pakistan would see what might be called
a friendly coup
in which the sharifs walk away and take
a flight to their safe havens
leaving Pakistan in the hands of the
army chief
you see in the Pakistan of 2023 anything
seems possible
and from Pakistan we shift our Focus to
its close Ally China
anything that the Chinese don't like
they alter it to fit their narrative
China rewrites the truths it sends us
facts it presents a polished version of
just about any story
and whoever does not succumb to it is
thrown into jail
getting information out of China is no
easy task the country has been lying
about its Wuhan virus deaths since the
beginning of the pandemic
Now Chinese censorship is quietly
rewriting the entire covid-19 story
early in 2020 on the 11th of February
the deadly new viral infection was
officially named covet 19. and on the
same day a team of American and Chinese
scientists released critical data
the data showed how quickly the virus
was spreading who was dying and when
the study was cited in multiple Health
warnings around the world
it was a moment of Crisis and the
research was a model of international
collaboration something that highlighted
the fatality of the virus it showed the
real picture of the epidemic that was
taking root
but not for long
a New York Times investigation has made
some startling Revelations it says
Chinese researchers quietly withdrew the
paper within days of its release
and in its place a message was put out
one telling the scientists not to cite
the report
on what grounds though
for outdated information it says
and the peculiar move was noticed by a
few observers but it quickly faded amid
the frenzy of the virus
only to resurface now
it is now clear that the study was not
taken down for faulty research instead
it was Chinese Health officials cracked
down on the truths
you see they kicked up a cloud of dust
around the early Wuhan virus cases they
tried to hide the details like the real
dates of the infections how widespread
it was even the death toll
one of the American authors of the study
Ira longini saying and I'm quoting
it was so hard to get any information
out of China there was so much covered
up and so much hidden
the Chinese government did everything in
its power to hide the truth it silenced
the scientists hindered International
investigations
censored online discussion of the
pandemic
and that's not all China's choke hold on
covid-19 information runs far deeper its
censorship campaign has targeted
International journals and scientific
databases
and under pressure from the government
Chinese scientists withheld data genetic
sequences have been withdrawn from
public databases crucial details in
journal submissions have been altered
Chinese officials initiated this Western
Journal editors enabled it and who
suffered ultimately
the general public after all
China's covid-19 censorship shook the
very foundations of shared scientific
knowledge
scientists needed to know whether
transmission patterns changed if there
were new variants
if the world should be preparing for a
global outbreak people deserve to know
the actual scale of the calamity
but you see that was not what China
wanted
the country is obsessed with rewriting
history
and covid-19 of course was a striking
instance but only one instance
even the World Health Organization
agrees in fact
Taiwan is another example you know it
already the country says Taiwan is a
part of communist rule China and for
years China has been selling this idea
to the world it is seeking to impose it
on the United Nations bodies as well
last year in April
a think tank made some revolutions it
said that Beijing was using its
influence at the United Nations it was
compelling ngos to rewrite references to
Taiwan it threatened them to revise
historical documents to fit China's
narrative or risk losing access
China also Twisted the original text of
the resolution to push for one China
principle the resolution stating that
the People's Republic of China is the
only legitimate government of China and
this made it difficult for Taiwan to
participate in U.N Affiliated agencies
in any way
and it doesn't stop there China also
refuses to acknowledge that Hong Kong
was once a British colony all references
were scrubbed out from new teaching
materials last year children's textbooks
in Hong Kong parrot beijing's version of
the history
what China cannot rewrite it erases from
public eye
and such is the case of the Taiwanese
publisher Lee Yan hey he has published
many books that are banned in China he
was visiting his relative in Shanghai
when he was detained by Chinese
officials he was accompanied by writer
bailing
Bay reported Lee's detention via
Facebook
but Lee's relatives requested him to
take down the post and why was that
because it wasn't going to help
and if anything it risked complicating
the matter further because clearly
Chinese officials do not tolerate bad
publicity
and something similar happened to five
Publishers in the year 2015.
they were all connected to Hong Kong's
Causeway Bay Books the bookstore had
sold a number of critical political and
gossipy titles banned by the CCP
the Publishers went missing from Hong
Kong mainland China and Thailand only to
re-emerge later in Chinese detention
you see China is averse to bad PR
and it doesn't spare its offenders in
any way
our next story is about what might be
the fall of the Dollar Empire
Bangladesh have now become the 19th
country to have bilateral trade with
India in Indian rupees
this move essentially removes the role
that the US dollar has in trade and
reduces the cost of trade for both the
sites
how far will the US dollar spiral down
this hole and how many more countries
are replacing the dollar in their trade
after months of deliberations India and
Bangladesh will now trade in Taka and
rupees without the inclusion of any
third currency
and why is this change taking place
The Exchange in India's rupee and
Bangladesh taka will reduce the cost of
settlement it will also lessen the
stress on the Forex Reserves
and the new Arrangement will also
promote trade
as the two countries plan to trade in
their own currencies Reports say the
countries will also initiate a dual
currency card Travelers would be able to
load these cards with rupees or taka the
exchange rates would be decided based on
the two currencies rather than working
with the exchange rate of the dollar
but you see this is not a new move by
Bangladesh the country also decided to
pay Russia with Chinese Yuan to settle
payments for a nuclear plant the over 12
billion dollar nuclear plant project was
mostly financed through a Russian loan
Bangladesh did not use dollars due to
the sanctions on Russia since staying in
Rubles was not feasible for Bangladesh
both the countries planned on carrying
transactions in Yuan
this came amid increasing
de-dolarization efforts by various
countries and the brics Nations that
were opting for a common brics currency
the story of the dying dollar as many
are calling it started much earlier when
countries like Iran abandoned settling
trade in dollar with China and Russia
Saudi Arabia opted to give up petrol
dollar and begin accepting Petro Yuan
Brazil abandoned the dollar and said
that it would be trading in local
currency with China
the brics nations are still being urged
to make an alternative currency to
settle cross-border trade
is the US dollar truly losing its
hegemony
especially after Russia saw sanctions
following the invasion of Ukraine
several countries like I mentioned are
giving up trading in dollars countries
are now promoting the local currency for
trade trading in the local currency also
helps reduce the exchange costs
essentially which are usually High while
settling in dollars
and India stands as a significant
example regarding the dedolarization in
trade
the country will be using its rupee to
start overseas trade with over 19
countries
countries like Russia the UK Sri Lanka
Germany Kenya we'll also trade in rupees
leaving the dollar behind
the U.S dollar also known as the king of
currency became the official Reserve
currency of the world in 1944 and this
gave America a disproportionate amount
of influence over other economies
Reports say that America could have used
the imposition of sanctions as a tool to
achieve foreign policy goals
but now it has almost been proven that
not everybody likes to play by America's
rules especially countries like Russia
and China that look forward to halting
the dollars dominance in the markets and
this is what is known as the
dollarization the process essentially of
substituting the American dollar as a
currency used for trading oil
and other currencies replacing the US
dollar in tree it has been gaining
momentum in recent years the IMF has
been witnessing many central banks no
longer holding dollars as reserves in
the same quantities as the earlier were
an expert say that de-dolarization would
reduce the global dependence on the U.S
dollar and the U.S economy and this
could help mitigate the impact of
America's economic changes on another
country's economy our Nations will also
be able to reduce their exposure to
currency fluctuations and interest rate
changes
the dollarization would help improve the
economic stability and potentially erase
the risk of a financial crisis
will the U.S manage to come back
as the so-called king of currency
we will be informing you about the
latest
and our next story is about the law of
taking its course Against All Odds
a separatist leader was on the run for
over a month in India but Punjab police
nabbed him
and shortly thereafter he was
transferred to a jail in the
northeastern seat of Assam
our next report getting you the complete
story take a look

sides
it was also in Moga District that
amritpal had evaded arrest on March 18th
when the Crackdown against him and his
outfit was launched the Crackdown was
launched about three weeks after he and
his supporters stormed a police station
near Amritsar to secure the release of
an arrested colleague
the Escape was as dramatic as his arrest
on the 18th of March amritpal took a
U-turn merely a hundred meters away from
a police checkpost in a village in Moga
District
while on the Run he released two video
messages and an audio message
urging the Sikh akal attacked Chief to
call a conclave of Sikhs on the Festival
of baisaki to mobilize Sikhs across the
globe
On The Run he was spotted in various
cities of Northern India while his aides
were being arrested one by one in late
March he made an unsuccessful attempt to
cross over into Nepal his wife a British
citizen was arrested two days back from
Amritsar airport when she was attempting

Central Jail in India's Northeastern
State of Assam nine of his associates

Security Act
this quiet against amritpal and his
activities has been on the rise from the
moment he arrived in Punjab from Dubai
in September last year
he began making speeches about taking
the youth back to True Sikhism and
giving them knowledge of weapons
amritpal Singh had first started gaining
traction on social media during the
2020-21 farmers stir against the now
repealed Farm laws
Ahmed Paul's popularity was built over
Facebook live and other social media
sessions with his aggressive speeches
against Regional and National political
parties
feminists activists Khalsa aide and
other groups the law catches up justice

let's move on for now football star
Cristiano Ronaldo is once again in the
news
and what did he do this time what's the
reason
an obscene gesture in public and his
move has attracted backlash it has
triggered calls for his deportation from
Saudi Arabia
let's just get to the details first
on the 18th of Feb on the 18th of April
Ronaldo's Club all Nasser this was on
the 18th of April Ronaldo's Club Al
Nasser competed against al-hilal at the
King 5 International Stadium
slumped to a 2-2-0 defeat
Ronaldo cut a frustrated figure during
the Riyadh Derby he saw a goal ruled out
and a penalty division in the team's
favor overtalked
all Halal fans booed and Jared Ronaldo
they've heard chanting his rival Messi's
name to provoke him
[Music]
foreign
did next has sparked the controversy
while exiting the pitch Ronaldo was seen
grabbing his genitals and it is being
seen as a mark of disrespect for the
home fans
since then the people of Saudi Arabia
have been calling for his deportation
a prominent lawyer took to her Twitter
account to slam Ronaldo
this is what new bind Ahmad said and I'm
quoting
even if the crowd provoked Ronaldo he
did not know how to react
Cristiano's behavior is a crime an
indecent Public Act which is one of the
crimes that allows for arrest and
deportation if committed by a foreigner
Ahmad has vowed to submit a petition to
the public Ministry to look into the
matter many have come out to support the
star on social media his Club al-nassar
has also come to Ronaldo's defense it
says that the gesture was related to an
injury in the groin area
following a challenge from an al-halal
player and that Ronaldo was not mocking
the fans
now this is not the first time Ronaldo
has lashed out on his rival supporters
the incident reflects his frustration
towards al-nusra's performance
the team recently lost its grip on the
Saudi pro league title race and now it
sits three points behind the leaders
earlier this month during a match with
Al Faya Ronaldo was seen arguing with
his opponents the goal last draw left
Ronaldo reportedly Furious over his
team's tactical approach
he stormed down the tunnel after the
match and the very next day the manager
Rudy Garcia was sat after a reported
Feud with Ronaldo
Ronaldo has scored in just two of his
last six League games and now he finds
himself in yet another controversy
was Ronaldo's action an honest mistake
was he really injured or was it just
another another example of his Reckless
Behavior
and will he really be deported from
Saudi Arabia
his contract does not end till the
summer of 2025. meanwhile Reports say
that the superstar has received an offer
to return to his ex-club sporting CP
what is Ronaldo going to do
let me now ask you a question
would you want an expensive diamond ring
on your wedding day or for your wedding
or would you like a ring made of pure
gold
you might want to consider what's being
called a smart ring
in an era of wearable tech like smart
watches smart Tech has now entered the
wedding industry smart rings are
bringing lovers together by letting them
feel each other's heartbeat through
their rings
our next report bringing you more
thank you
the magical Union of Two Lovers could
now get even more romantic or it could
get creepy depends on the way you see
this here's what we are talking about
Advanced Tech is re-innovating the
culture of exchanging Rings wedding
rings or bands serve as a reminder of
one's devotion towards their partner
seeing the ring on their partner's hand
every day is a constant reminder that
the lovers are meant to be with each
other for the rest of their lives
now Tech experts are taking things a
step further they are giving the Rings
the ability to feel heartbeats this
means that if one of their Partners
touches their ring they will feel the
exact heartbeat of their better half
this is not all it will also display the
heartbeat as a moving red line on the
surface of the ring so how do these
high-tech wedding rings work
each one of the Rings is connected to an
app via Bluetooth the specialized app
allows the Rings to be connected users
need to have their mobile phones
connected to the internet to get their
partner's heartbeat in real time if
there is no internet connection the user
will feel the heartbeat which was
recorded the last time some couples feel
that the smart rings are more romantic
as it gives the users the feeling of
being close to their Partners they also
recreate the idea of traditional rings
and provide a new take on the symbol of
love
[Music]
the rechargeable rings are not the only
new invention Advanced necklaces have
also been released which have the same
technology as the smart rings
what's the target audience engaged
couples they can embrace the technology
and not let go of the traditional
wedding rings
wedding celebrations are using all kinds
of tech from drones for photography to
using AI for wedding planning tasks
nowadays several people meet their
Partners through apps AI tools are even
helping people write their wedding vows
artificial intelligence is assisting
Grooms and putting their feelings into
words this is a machine helping a human
express emotions
is that ironic what about people who are
not all that tech savvy do you see
heartbeat rings as a way to win over
your partner's heart or are they a bit
too much
you report we on world is one
and since it's Monday for some Monday
motivation
have you heard of the saying the first
thing in order to be successful is to
love your job we've all heard that
and let me start off this week by asking
you do you love your job
are you passionate about what you do
these are loaded questions but if your
answer is yes
does loving your job make things easier
for you is the immediate question that
arises
you see for decades we have believed
that loving what we do loving our work
is a good thing
loving your job is all it takes to be a
good employee to do better to do well
passion above money they say
but is Passion profitable
both for companies and the employees
and the answer to that question is Way
Beyond a simple yes it's rather
complicated
just have a look at this recent study it
says that passion can blur managers to
reality
what does that mean
let's just say you are more deserving of
that promotion than your colleague but
she gets promoted why
because the manager chose to ignore
credible performance
and you know picked years of
organizational Association instead
and this by the way is just one of the
many examples where managers are
blindsided to the extent that poor
performance is mostly neglected
and often silenced
and in the name of harmonious passion
this takes a massive toll on the overall
growth of the organization
from an employee perspective passion is
even riskier it has two main ingredients
after all Harmony and obsession
while harmonious fashion arises because
an employee genuinely enjoys their work
obsessive passion stems out of
compulsive behavior that lacks
self-control
and what's the outcome you ask
well the former can lead to ineffective
time and effort at work
while the latter can be overly and
elusively idealistic
and both for personal and organizational
performance
in fact passion is believed to
facilitate exploitation at work
and that is because passionate employees
are asked to perform tasks that are
completely unrelated to their job role
and it's normal to assume that they will
work for not money
that they will work at the cost of their
family time
I'm sure you would agree with me that
it's hard to say no to work when you are
in love with what you do
say for example on a Sunday your manager
asks you to join a conference call or
file a report
now someone who loves their work will
probably do it anyway
despite someday being the weekly day off
do you see the price for passion here
perhaps it's a bit too pricey
the fashion for passion is
understandable but it has its own
downsides
in other words if you do what you love
it does not guarantee that you do it
well
or that it will do you good
so what's the ideal way to go about it
having a meaningful conversation with
your manager perhaps about your likes
and dislikes that would be a good place
to start
finding places outside of work to Anchor
your passion is another plausible way
you see at the end of the day it's to
each their own if being a workaholic
makes you happy you do you you let that
be your hashtag Monday motivation
because loving your work is good
however loving it too much
might be a problem
let's now tell you what else made news
around the world time for gravitas

is facing unprecedented levels of heat
this comes amid the country battling a
drastic increase in respiratory problems
triggered by a spike in air pollution
since the beginning of 2023 2.4 million
people needed treatment for medical
problems due to air pollution as per
Health officials this includes nearly
200 000 this is the last week alone
now officials in Thailand want residents
to avoid outdoor activities over the
weekend they said residents should be
wary of extremely high temperatures and
sudden summer storms even in the coming
week officials also warned that
temperatures could cross 50 degrees
Celsius in parts of the country the
intense heat and drought is taken at all
on Thailand there has also been a
sergeant power demand across the country
foreign
the intense heat warnings come even as
Thailand is grappling with air pollution
large numbers of citizens have reported
respiratory problems due to the quality
of the air a report stated Bangkok and
Northern City of Chiang Mai were among
the top 10 most polluted cities in the
world a respiratory disease specialist
at the central chest Institute of
Thailand said she has seen a drastic
increase in patients since February this
year she says patients usually have
respiratory problems like coughing and
sore throats one of the biggest concerns
are tiny particles known as PM 2.5 they
are smaller than the diameter of a hair
it can penetrate deep into the lungs and
even reach the bloodstream as per
reports the average PM 2.5 concentration
in Thailand was 3.6 times the who's
annual air quality guideline limits
according to yours vandelier
the World Health Organization
representative to Thailand in the long
term PM 2.5 poses more risks for
respiratory infections if people have
asthma then can get worse
people can develop chronic lung diseases
even lung cancer
um
the main reasons for toxic smog are
smoke from forest fires Farmers burning
crops double pollution from vehicles and
heavy industry generated fumes the poor
air quality is a growing issue in
Thailand and the incumbent government
has been accused of not doing enough to
combat
the sage these claims come ahead of
Elections scheduled for May 14th
climate change is triggering extreme
weather in parts or in large parts of
Europe This is leading to extended
periods of dry spells Italy is the
latest country to face the heat it is
going to experience its second year of
severe droughts and Lake Garda in
Northern Italy has dropped to its lowest
levels in 70 years last year Italy's
Lakes helped ease the drought this year
chances look Bleak as per a researcher

water in Lake Garda which flows into
that River pole is below half the normal
levels

poor winter rains this more snowfalls
have failed to replenish reserves in
Italy and springs arrival brings more
worries the months of May June and July
are likely to be warmer than average

drought in 70 years last month the
president of the Lombardi region said
water storage levels were less than half
what they were normally at
at this time of the year
is
the agricultural sector is facing the
branch of the droughts called directi
Italy's main Farmers Association say the
sector had lost 6.6 billion dollars last
year they predicted 300 000 more
businesses would lose if the drought
does not end experts say this would
require non-stop rainfall till May or
even June this is when Farmers irrigate
their fields
foreign
set up a control room last month to
monitor water capacity across the
country
she also appointed a national
commissioner to oversee the issue at a
local level the Lombardi government sold
water companies and hydroelectric
operators to limit their usage 19 towns

highest levels of water shortage some
towns had already started receiving

Chilean dolphins are one of the world's
smallest breeds of its kind they are
native to the cold Pacific Waters of

has now been detected in marine animals
as per Soledad Tapia the director of the
country's fishery service two species of
dolphins have been infected by the virus

awareness about cigarette butts and the

this is an often overlooked form of

of the capital city of Lisbon check out
these visuals
oh
[Music]
[Music]
activists have been collecting these
baths for nearly a week they aim to
create awareness among foreign tourists
about the problem of cigarette Bots
the main problem with the bats it's not
biodegradable so basically it contains a
form of plastic and even worse a lot a
lot of toxins and heavy metals chemicals
so with any rain all those toxins
getting flushed out of the cigarette
butt and getting straight on the street
from the sinks into here right now we're
next to Tasia River it goes all straight
into the ocean and the city is not
capable of treating the the water from
the street so everything goes straight
into the ocean according to Andres Noe
two years ago they picked one million
cigarette butts in two months he said it
was beautiful that so many people were
coming together to participate in this
awareness campaign
we act locally but we show the problem
and the craziness with these images like
it's opening eyes and that's what I want
to achieve like to make people stop and
think about okay it's not just one but
it's a lot of little acts coming
together and that's just an example for
the entire world yeah

coming up fairly soon the conservatives
don't really talk about climate very

at least 1 200 children are dying in
Europe every year due to toxic air
1200 that's what European environment
agency has revealed in a study the
agency has also warned that due to air
pollution children are at an increased
risk of Contracting a chronic disease
later in life the study was conducted in
over 30 countries including 27 members
of the European Union now according to
the agency the level of key air
pollutants in many European countries
remain stubbornly above the who
guidelines an expert working with the
double e a say that Europe is failing
its children the study was the European
agency's first to focus specifically on
younger population last year the agency
had said that air pollution resulted in
238
000 deaths in Europe in 2020. the
effects of air pollution sinking their
claws into children right when they're
in the womb it continues to deteriorate
their health as they grow up the agency
says air pollution has an impact on a
child's development and makes them
vulnerable to higher levels of
respiratory disease ear infections and
puts them at an increased risk of
allergies children are the most
susceptible to the ill effects of poor
air quality because they have a faster
breathing rate are closer to the ground
and are outdoors more
the report did not covered in major
industrial nations of Russia Ukraine and
the United Kingdom suggesting the
overall death tolls from Europe or for
Europe could be even higher experts were
also noted as saying that there are some
things that Europe can do to make
European children's lives better such as
reducing the sources of air pollution
reducing road traffic coal and solid
fuel burning and Industrial emissions is
key
but putting clean air zones around
schools where traffic would be
restrained and idling engines prohibited
and planting trees Ivy screens
and hedge fences around playgrounds is
also necessary
research also suggests that around 110
000 people with disabilities lose their
lives each year under the age of 18 due
to poor air quality
from mountain peaks to Ocean depths

was off the charts between October 2021
and October 2022 the average thickness
of the world's reference glaciers
those for which long-term measurements
are available decreased by more than 1.3
meters a loss far greater than the
average over the previous 10 years and
since 1970 there has been a total loss
of about 30 meters of thickness due to a

storm I'm talking about artificial

it can simplify complex topics it has
the ability to master creative processes
AI can help prevent online fraud and now
it can even prescribe medicines here is
more
artificial intelligence has transformed
the healthcare industry in many ways
AI has reshaped the way we diagnose
treat and monitor patients and now ai is
prescribing medication to patients
Yes you heard that right the company
behind it is an Israeli Health Tech firm
its name is genetica Plus
according to the company it's AI
technology can best match
antidepressants to patients it can avoid
unwanted side effects also it can make
sure that the prescribed drug works as
well as possible
how does it happen
technicians collect the patient's blood
samples to generate genetic data
the data is run through an AI system the
AI software then determines the best
drug for the patient that a doctor can
prescribe along with the dosage
in other words AI can help doctors find
the best antidepressants for patients
as per World Health Organization more
than 280 million people suffer from
depression globally
it has been reported that almost
two-thirds of initial prescriptions for
depression or anxiety may not work
properly so there is hope that this
latest advancement in health technology
could lead to a faster and more reliable
cure for depression
the technology is currently in the
development stage it could be launched
commercially next year the company hopes
its technology will be in strong demand
in the future
like genetica plus there are now several
other startups that are exploring the
use of machine learning and AI in the
pharmaceutical industry UK based
Accenture is another AI driven Pharma
company its mission is to use AI to find
faster and smarter ways to discover new
and better drugs
today on average it takes more than 10
years and billions of dollars to develop
a new drug
the idea is to use AI to speed up the
drug Discovery process and bring down
costs
therefore new labs are being built
around the world last year accentia
opened a new Research Center in Vienna
in February in Silicon medicine a drug
Discovery firm based in Hong Kong opened
a large new lab in Abu Dhabi overall
around two dozen drugs developed with
the assistance of AI are now in or
entering clinical trials
the global pharmaceutical industry
generated revenues of 1.4 trillion
dollars in 2021 experts believe that the
potential for AI to transform this
industry is quite huge

Saudi Arabia is pitching itself as a
preacher for peace what all happened in
this eventful week in West Asia we tell
you
ever since China broke her truce between
Saudi Arabia and Iran
region has seen shifts unimagined a few
months ago
earlier this week the Saudi foreign
minister visited CIO Young
this was the first time in nearly a
decade that riyadh's top Diplomat
visited Damascus
in 2011 Saudi snapped ties with Syria
after the latter went into a civil war
the visit is a significant step towards
ending Syria's decade-long Regional
isolation
and a big hint that it might play out
next month
while in Damascus saudi's foreign
minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan met
with Syrian president Bashar al-assad
the meeting discussed steps for a
political solution to Syria's conflicts
that would preserve its Arab identity
and return it to its Arab surroundings
Assad for his part said that the
kingdoms open and realistic policies
have benefited the region however the
statements made no mention of the Arab
League Summit that Riyadh is due to host
next month
while the Saudi Diplomat was overseas
there was action happening in the
Kingdom as well
Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas met
with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman in
Jeddah
the agenda for the visit was discussing
tensions with Israel
but what made news was something else
our bus was in Saudi at the same time as
the Rival group Hamas
as per-palestinian media reports the
Hamas delegation was headed by its Chief
Ismail
the group has not officially confirmed
the visit but if and when it does it
will surely be an important step on the
path to restoring peace between Saudi
and Hamas
the visit is likely to prompt Israeli
overtures toward Saudi Arabia Israel has
for years been trying to extend an olive
branch to the kingdom
earlier this week the Israeli foreign
minister eliquan reportedly said that a
visit to the kingdom is on the cards
despite riyads rapproche small with
archflow to Iran
while these developments leave the U.S
rather disgruntled there is one nation
aiming to make the most of the political
shifts and that is China
almost a month after brokering an
unprecedented truce between Saudi Arabia
and Iran it seems like Beijing is
growing more serious about boosting its
role in the region thank you
Chinese foreign minister Quinn gang
held separate phone conversations with
Israeli and Palestinian officials on
Monday during the talks he expressed
China's concern over growing tensions
between the two
in a call with Israeli counterpart Ellie
Cohen the Chinese foreign minister said
that Saudi Arabia and Iran have set a
good example of overcoming differences
through dialogue
adding that Israel and Palestine need to
show political courage and take steps to
rescue talks
according to the Chinese foreign
Ministry kin also told the Palestinian
foreign affairs minister Riyad al-maliki
that China is willing to play an active
role in the resumption of talks
[Applause]
Israelis and Palestinians have not held
substantive peace talks on ending the
century-long conflict in over a decade
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
netanyahu's government is committed to
expanding settlements in the occupied
West Bank
most of the International Community
considers the expansion illegal and an
obstacle to peace
while several of netanyahu's allies and
his Coalition Partners remain staunchly
opposed to the creation of an
independent Palestinian state

Russia is recruiting a staggering 400
000 more soldiers to fight in the
battlefields of Ukraine
after yivdini progressing statement that
Russia must declare Victory and focus on
consolidating the gains that it has made
so far it was being speculated that war
fatigue may have now begun to hit even
the most committed ranks of the Russian
army
but the fact that Russia is now actively
recruiting more soldiers points to the
fact that the Russians are digging their
heels in for the long haul or the 21st
of April Ukrainian Capital Kiev woke up
to a branch of drone strikes from Russia
so where is this bruising war in Europe
heading to and why is Russia looking to
pump another 400 000 soldiers into the
battlefields of Ukraine on export gets
you the details
this video released by the Russian
defense Ministry
asking real men to step up to fight for
Mother Russia in Ukraine is a statement
of intent
[Music]
Russia has managed to control and the
next or 20 percent of Ukrainian land
and now Russia is all set
for another 400 000 soldiers into the
Ukrainian War theater for those who
expected that the war fatigue has now
begun to set in and that the warning
sides who have thrown everything in the
kitchen Sinker to each other will soon
sit at a negotiating table
this is the clearest reminder that this
war may not end at a negotiating table
for the first time after a lot of 25
days the Ukrainian Capital Kiev came
under a brunt of drone strikes
erit sarens rang out Kiev claims it
managed to shoot down eight iranian-made
Shahid drones the mud-started Ukrainian
spring counter-offensive is yet to make
its impact on the ground and Russia
claims the reason for this is the
success that it has had in nullifying
the advantages brought about by the
hymers rocket systems for the ukrainians
the leaked Pentagon Papers point to a
deep American involvement in the Ukraine
war these are not just American
mercenaries or Soldiers of Fortune the
United States is content to not just sit
on the sidelines and arm the Ukrainian
soldiers to fight the war instead it is
now clear that America is playing a far
more active role what it tells us
is that there is a far more significant
U.S presence
in the Ukraine war then has been
previously reported for example the
documents tell us
that there are in fact U.S Special
Operations soldiers on the ground in
Ukraine
it tells us that there are a hundred U.S
government Personnel on the ground in
Ukraine it tells us that in our in a
24-hour period 72 combat aircraft
sorties were flown by United States
units that's a very high level of
involvement and it supports the view
that this is not a NATO operation or an
international operation but it is a U.S
operation
and I think that may well have been
the intended message from whoever leaked
these documents
the United States this week delivered
the surface to air Patriot missile
defense systems while Germany has also
delivered the second part of its rst air
defense systems that it promised last
year
on the Pacific front Russia flew eight
of its long-range strategic bombers over
neutral Waters in The Sea of Accords and
the Sea of Japan according to Russia's
defense minister Sergey shogu the reason
why Russia's Pacific Fleet is on high
alert is due to a threat it perceives on
its Eastern Front
today from 9 am the Pacific naval fleet
was put on a high alert as part of a
surprise inspection aimed at building
its defensive capabilities also part of
the Aerospace forces military and
support units are involved in the event
the main objective of this inspection is
to increase the abilities of the Armed
Forces to repel the aggression of a
probable enemy from the direction of the
ocean and sea so does Russia fear that
it might get forced into a two-frontal
war
at this moment there are no indicators
that this might happen
last September Russia had recruited
about 300 000 reservists to boost its
ranks for the Ukraine war
there were scenes of Russian men bolting
from their homes to avoid conscription
neither Russia nor Ukraine are
officially declaring the number of
casualties sustained by them in this
meat grinder of a conflict but what is
clear is after this new wave of
recruitment Russia is looking to fight a
war not just for the foreseeable future
but for years to come
Sudan is Africa's third largest Nation
and the ripples of what happened in
South Sudan seldom remain confined
within its borders at this moment as we
speak there's a full-blown Civil War
that is Raging across the country
generals
the chief of the Sudanese Army
with hundred and twenty thousand
soldiers at his command
and general Muhammad
a former Sudanese born on who now heads
the paramilitary group called the rapid
support forces or the rsf with 150 000
soldiers are fighting a no holds bar
battle
heavy weapons have been used in street
fighting inside Khartoum Air Force has
been deployed for bombings
an estimated 20 000 people have already
fled from the country
and there's also an economic angle to
this war as well as Sudan happens to be
the second biggest exporter of gold in
Africa and everyone from the United
States Russia and the United Arab
Emirates are vying for influence in the
country an export gets you the details
thank you
The Game of Thrones in the strategically
located and agriculturally Rich Sudan
has claimed hundreds of lives thousands
have been injured
many people have been unable to reach
hospitals and in some instances even
hospitals have been shelled
there are 59 main hospitals in Khartoum
and as many as 39 are currently out of
service thousands of residents have fled
Khartoum the city resembles a ghost town
deafening explosions rattled buildings
and the cartoon sky was blackened with
thick smoke
dwindling food and fuel supplies lack of
running water and frequent power outages
made desperate civilians huddle in their
homes the American brokered 24-hour
humanitarian ceasefire failed twice on
Tuesday and Wednesday so there's a lot
of people fleeing the city so it's like
a little bit empty it's also Ramadan
right now so a lot of people are fasting
and staying inside what I can see from
here is that people are leaving right in
around the airport area in like area of
heavy fighting then it's blocked off by
soldiers and there's gunshots and
snipers and from here you can't see any
any dead bodies but I have
um my friends who are in that zone and
they can't leave their house and the
electricity is out no internet is barely
working
um and they're all kind of just staying
away from Windows and things because of
stray gun shots
so why did the clashes erupt between
Sudan's military and the country's lean
parametry Force are safe
well it is a case of a power struggle
between the two main factions of Sudan's
military regime
the Sudanese armed forces are loyal to
General Abdel fattah al-burhan the
country's de facto ruler whereas the
paramilitaries of Rapid support forces
or rsf a collection of militias or their
loyalty to the former warlord General
Muhammad hamdan tagalu also known as
the central cause of tension between the
two warring factions has been the
integration of the rsf into the regular
Sudanese Army former AutoCraft Omar
al-Bashir founded rsf in 2013 to crush a
rebellion in Darfur
but Bashar himself was toppled by burhan
and the Galo in April 2019 following
Mass protests against three decades of
his iron fisted rule the pair acted
together again in October 2021 leading a
military coup against the civilian
government installed following bashar's
ouster that coup derailed an
internationally backed transition and
put the Army back in charge but it has
faced weekly protests and renewed
isolation the Sudanese economy has
plummeted
at least 125 people were killed by the
security forces in fortif since the 2021
Coupe
I've hemitzthi swung behind the plan for
a new transition
it brought the deep-seated divisions
with burhan to the surface the situation
reached breaking point this past
Saturday with clashes between the Army
and the paramilitary
major geopolitical dimensions are also
at play with different stakeholders such
as the U.S Russia Saudi Arabia the UAE
and other powers battling for influence
even prior to the conflict about a
quarter of Sudan's population was facing
acute hunger the rapidly worsening
security situation has only imperiled
the lives of thousands trapped
both the generals though are positioning
themselves as saviors of Sudan and
guardians of democracy in a country
which has experienced only brief
Democratic interludes this latest
conflict not only diminishes any hopes
of a transition to democracy but has
created a humanitarian crisis which is
only worsening by the day
it was meant to be the sweet 16th
birthday party of an American Teenager
but instead it turned into a night of
Massacre of a mass shooting that snuffed
out four young lives including that of a
promising athlete who was going to a
university on football scholarship
the Alabama Police have no clue about
the perpetrator of the mass shooting in
this case
every single time there's a mass
shooting in the United States
the same shattering platitudes are
uttered
American families muster the strength to
come out and grieve as one nation for
the young lives that are lost before the
time to gorima shootings but the United
States must ask itself an important
question
for how long will it grieve for its
children who are killed in incidents of
gum Terror
for how long will the United States
continue to be a victim
of its own addiction for buying and
owning deadly guns
the small town of dead whale in the
southern American state of Alabama was
convulsed by a deadly mass shooting
a sweet 16 birthday party turned into a
night of Horror
when an unidentified gunman stormed the
mangany Masterpiece dance studio and
opened fire indiscriminately
four youngsters were killed and over 28
others injured
this is the 163rd mass shooting in which
four or more people have been shot this
year the highest since 2016. the essence
had occurred at approximately 10 34 pm
near the 200 block on Broad neck Street
here in Dave on Tallapoosa County
all right
there were four
lives
not fatalities lies they were four lives
tragically lost in this incident
and there's been a multitude of injuries
as they said this is going to be a long
complicated process
dead wheel is a small close-knit
community in Alabama it has just 3 200
residents who are struggling to come to
terms with the tragedy
the motive for the gruesome mass
shooting is not clear yet but what is
even more shocking is that the Alabama
Police have no leads in the case
no suspects have been apprehended
and the police are still investigating
and looking for any clues that may shed
more light on the attacker Alabama law
enforcement officials have implored the
citizens for any help in solving the
case among those who have been killed is
Phil dowdell an 18 year old promising
athlete who was going to the
Jacksonville State University on an
American football scholarship the
Alabama mass shooting occurred within
weeks of two other high-profile mass
shootings in the states of Kentucky and
Tennessee
on the 10th of April a bank employee
shot dead four of its colleagues and
injured nine others at his workplace in
Louisville Kentucky
two weeks prior to that on the 27th of
March three nine-year-olds and three
other staff members were killed by a
former student at a private Christian
school in Nashville Tennessee
in the aftermath of these latest mass
shootings the usual round of
condemnation and calls for tighter gun
safety measures followed
guns have now emerged as the biggest
cause of children's debts in the United
States
but despite this America simply cannot
seem to give up its Obsession of buying
and owning deadly guns
so what explains this American obsession
with guns why are Americans more willing
to congregate and grieve every time
there is a mass shooting and yet fail to
find the political will to tighten gun
ownership a nation of 330 million people
has about 400 million guns so guns
outnumber people and what this has done
to the American society is that children
are not safe at schools or elsewhere
you could be short dead while walking on
the road while attending a concert or
while shopping at a mall
America that takes great pride in
calling itself the land of the free has
become a nation where children cannot
even attend a sweet 16 birthday party
without the looming fear of a mass
shooting

looking at the daunting task of how to
stop the next Consignment of drugs from

migrant boats stumbled upon something
completely unexpected

Italian police have refused to give more
specific details of the occasion
[Music]
as they continue their search for other
such packages
but how did this Consignment of drugs
reach the Sicilian Coast
according to Italian authorities the
neatly waterproof background packages
must have been dropped by a cargo ship
or a fishing crawler to be picked up and
transported to Mainland Italy by the
mafia
the Italian Prime Minister Giorgio

operation by the Italian authorities as

hand of the powerful and political
and drunk ghetto criminal group it is a
drunketta that controls the bulk of
cocaine that flows into Europe
consider this
after cannabis cocaine is the most
consumed drug in Europe an estimated 15
million adults in the EU are said to
have consumed cocaine at some point the
sale of cocaine in Europe in 2020 was
estimated to be worth 11.1 billion

an entire symmetry with his victims
but the fight against organized crime
and truck trafficking ganks if anything
has become more sophisticated in Italy
in drunketta which earlier specialized
in kidnapping for ransom has now emerged
as a Global Network for Narcotics
trafficking the andrangeta criminal
group is now said to be more profitable
than McDonald's and the Deutsche Bank

raking in billions of dollars annually
by smuggling and selling cocaine
and the Italian government is nowhere
close to cracking down on this crime
syndicate
the Bolivian capital of La Paz has been
in the grip of major turmoil for the
past several weeks on the 12th of April
Bolivian journalists hit the streets
protesting against the possible new law
that will curtail the freedom of press
but the government says that the
proposed new press bill is in accordance
with international human rights
but it isn't just the journalists who
are out on the streets because in the
13th of April teachers from across
Bolivia marched to the capital
for weeks now they've been protesting
against a new curriculum that they say
has been brought in by the government to
stifle critical thinking
these protests have in factor and
violent at times with clashes between
the police and the protesters our next
Port gets you in science as to what is
unfolding in Bolivia at this moment
Bolivian journalists protested against
the proposed new press bill in front of
the Congress and the Government Palace
on the 12th of April
up a banner that read dignity without a
gag and burnt the new bill
in a symbolic gesture some protesters
even taped their mouth shut to denounce
the legislation the new bill 305 is
promoted by the government's majority in
Congress
especially contentious is the article
that penalizes racism hate discourse
discrimination energy of racial
superiority
but the Press Federation of La Paz fears
that the law would be used against
legitimate investigations against
government officials the controversial
proposal has been dubbed as the gag Bill
furthermore freedom of expression in
Bolivia is granted by the current press
law which is nearly a hundred years old
it's even suggested seven year prison
term for doing our functions so our work
can't be subject to prosecution the
Press law gives us rights and they want
to ignore it it's a law that in two
years we'll be hundred and they want to
ignore it
journalists are not the only agreed
community in Bolivia for weeks teachers
in Bolivia have staged protests against
a new curriculum established by the
education Ministry more teachers for
public schools and a higher education
budget are some of their key demands
last month the teachers attempted to
occupy the education Ministry
headquarters in La Paz clashes between
protesting teachers and police
preventing entry had broken out
on the 10th of April violence again
escalated between police and teachers
during a demonstration in La Paz Riot
police were seen cornering protesters
hitting them and firing paint pellets
and pepper spray after
in Bolivia education is free and
compulsory up to high school but the
quality and standard of Education though
has fallen below that of neighboring
countries more than 140 000 teachers
depend on the public budget given the
pertinence of issues at stake it is
crucial that the government of President
Luis asset lends a sympathetic heir to
the concerns and demands of protesting
teachers and journalists

can now easily create fake videos and
images with the help of digital
Technologies you can replace a person's
face with that of another individual it
may be fun as long as it doesn't harm
anyone but unfortunately that's not the
case deep fake technology has become a
growing concern it is being weaponized
against women our next story gets you
more details
as you can see I am here on the
beautiful island of Mystique president
Trump is a total and
I feel really blessed because I
genuinely love the process of
manipulating people
does that make it real fake News Boys
you're being kind don't listen to them
don't listen to him these videos may
look real but the fact is they are
boogers
[Music]
in other words they are deep fake videos
of celebrities
fakes are videos and images that are
digitally created or altered with
artificial intelligence such videos are
designed to deceive people spread
propaganda influence public opinion and
so on
but there is something that's more
concerning about deep fix
the same technology is used to create
sophisticated and Visually compelling
deep fake porn as well
in other words miscreants use high-tech
tools to realistically superimpose
celebrity faces on actors in porn videos
as artificial intelligence continues to
advance and AI tools become easily
accessible things get only worse
primarily for women
non-consensual deep fake pornography is
becoming an even bigger problem amid the
AI race
celebrities like gal gado and Billy
eilish have been victims of deep fake
pawn it is now becoming more common for
non-celebrities as well to be victims of
such non-consensual videos
technology is essentially allowing
anyone to turn whoever they wish into
sexual fantasies and all that happens
without consent
sometimes the same technology is used to
harm former partners also referred to as
Revenge Bond according to sensity an
amsterdam-based company that detects and
monitors AI developed synthetic media
for Industries 96 of deep fakes are
sexually explicit and feature women who
didn't consent to creation of the
content
these sexually exploitative videos are
easily available online for anyone to
buy reducing women to sexual objects
people who create these fake videos are
accepting payments via major credit
cards would you believe that the Deep
fake porn economy is growing the rise of
AI generated imagery has taken
harassment against women to hideous New
Heights some say it has become a means
to punish and silence women experts fear
that with advancements in AI this
particular technology will continue to
become as easy as pushing a button
as a result more people could misuse the
technology to harm others
now an important question how to limit
or ban it some firms that are designing
AI tools are already curbing access to
explicit images for instance open AI the
maker of chat GPT says it has blocked
users from creating AI images of
celebrities and prominent people some
social media companies have also been
tightening up their rules to better
protect their platforms against harmful
material
the gaming platform twitch is an example
twitch recently updated its policies
around explicit deep fake images after a
popular streamer named atrioch was
discovered to have deep fake porn
website open on his browser during a
live stream
the site featured phony images of fellow
twitch streamers other companies such as
Google and apple have also tried to ban
deep fakes from their platforms but is
it enough perhaps not note that keeping
such content off platforms requires
diligence the the impact of deep fake
Pawn can be devastating for people who
are targeted it can damage their
reputation and cause them psychological
distress as we understand governing the
internet is next to Impossible
especially when countries have their own
laws for Content that has sometimes made
it halfway around the world and more so
laws or bans May struggle to contain a
technology that is designed to
continually adapt and improve and what's
even more concerning deep fakes can be
made and published online from anywhere
in the world therefore we need a global
and collaborative response to this issue
lawmakers and technology companies need
to start seeing the problem of a
non-consensual deep fake Pawn as an
emergency that needs immediate attention
and find out ways to hold its creators
and facilitators worldwide accountable

China has a long history of spying on

of using a range of methods to steal
sensitive information the country spies
on corporations other governments and
even its own citizens and now once again
China's intentions are questioned why
because it has designed a surveillance
troop
according to a leaked U.S military
assessment the Chinese military May soon
deploy a high altitude spy drone the
leaked document features satellite
images of the wz8 rocket-propelled
reconnaissance drone such drones were
spotted at an air base in Eastern China
which is located on 560 kilometers from
Shanghai
it's said to be a supersonic drone that
can travel at least three times the
speed of sound also it can fly at an
altitude of one hundred thousand feet
note that passenger planes fly between
31 000 and 38 000 feet which means this
drone will be flying at three times that
height the document does not detail how
the Drone is propelled but it mentions
that engine features are primarily
associated with rocket fuel so now comes
the next obvious question what can this
drone do as per media reports the drones
are part of China's cutting-edge
surveillance system it can help China
gather real-time mapping data the use of
synthetic aperture radar would allow it
to map territory at night and during
foggy weather no wonder the Chinese
military is making technological
advances and the new age tools could

in the middle of a bitterly Fort

The Unwanted plane quote unquote
unwanted plane
there's finally a buyer and that's
Tajikistan
what exactly is the story about our next
report tells you about the deal and why
it has been struck
this is Mexico's presidential plane that
went under the hammer
you heard that right and while you
process that fact here's a quick
backgrounder
the Boeing 7878 Dreamliner tp01 was
purchased for
218.7 million dollars by Mexico back in
2012.
Mexico's version of Air Force One
boasts of white leather seats a double
bed and a spacious bathroom with a
shower it features marble touches in
official government seals emblazoned on
the walls along with multiple flat
screen monitors
over time it became a political tool for
leftist obrador he vowed to sell the
plane if he comes to power in 2018.
in fact among the issues that were a
part of his campaign it was the
presidential plane that grabbed a lot of
attention
and then since coming to power the
austerity loving president refused to
fly in the plane taking commercial
flights to travel instead
obrador hoped to sell the aircraft for
at least 150 million dollars
down from its original 218 million
dollars purchase price
but years went by and the presidential
plane did not find any takers
with obrador vowing to raffle off the
aircraft or even selling it at a lost
the ex-chequer and now he has managed to
finally sell off the controversial plane
for 92 million dollars ending the
political Saga who's the buyer
Tajikistan

kT0FKUXK4C8,Gravitas: Indian temple makes banks overflow with coins,Some Indian banks have refused to take coins as a deposit from the Shirdi temple. Why are coins creating havoc in banks?,2023-04-21T17:56:00Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kT0FKUXK4C8/hqdefault.jpg,"let's now get you the story from India
where the famous shirdi temple is facing
a rather unique problem
a problem of having too many coins
the temple has so many coins that Banks
seem to be running out of space
some banks have refused to take the
coins
how can coins cause such chaos how will
the banks deal with this
Trust of the famous shirdi temple is
dealing with this problem
surely in Western India is considered to
be the home of shirdi Sai Baba
the Saints home which was located in a
small village has now been turned into a
holy pilgrimage site where devotees from
all over the world come to pray
the shirdi temple is known for receiving
massive donations it is considered to be
one of the richest temples in India
the holy site receives nearly over 40
million dollars in donations each year
and now this has started to cause a bit
of a problem
from over a dozen Banks where the temple
trust holds an account
four of them have refused to take money
in the form of coins
the banks collectively have over 1.3
million dollars in coins
all deposited by the temple Trust
this is a case of space crunch
as the coins have a certain weight
compared to notes and take up more space
than any other form of currency
so what will the temple trust do now
knowing that a majority of the donations
will keep coming in coins the trust
plans to contact the Reserve Bank of
India and seek an intervention
the trust will open accounts in other
parts of the country
can the temple restrict its donation to
only notes
well the answer is no as many of the
devotees prefer to donate in coins
also Indians consider the one rupee coin
as auspicious
and why is that according to Hindu
mythology metal is believed to be of
special significance as far as God is
Lakshmi is concerned as it comes from
the earth so Indians always add a one
rupee coin while donating
as a number one signifies a beginning in
place of the number zero which
represents the end
so how has the temple been dealing with
the donations
a personal from each Bank where the
trust holds an account sends its own
Personnel to the temple every month to
gather deposits but in 2019 Banks raised
an alarm about the bags of coins
creating an issue
so how did the temple solve the issue
back then
the temple Trust might have taken the
problem a bit too casually and told the
banks to store the coins inside the
temple premises itself the banks had to
reject the offer as the rules do not
permit such a casual arrangement to
store the deposits
a temple which welcomes flocks of over
50 000 devotees receives more than
thirty thousand dollars in coins each
month might not be able to limit how
many bags of coins it receives
will the temple trough managed to rope
in more banks will should the flip a
coin to decide if it wants to stop the
coin donations
we will have to wait and watch

[Applause]
[Music]
here's a look at what's lined up for you
on the show tonight
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
story tonight is about the Russia
Ukraine war the bloody conflict has been
a series of twists and turns
and a string of question marks
who is winning
how long will the war go on for
what is Russia's strategy at this point
what is Ukraine looking at
tonight we focus on the next big
offensive in Ukraine who will lead it is
Russia planning a spring offenses why
has Ukraine's offensive not taken off
yet who benefits from the war now
this and more coming up over the next
few minutes
also on the show for you tonight we get
to the complete story of the case
against Hunter Biden at the controversy
continues to make headlines we tell you
what a whistleblower has said
banks are overwhelmed by coins from the
shiridi temple we tell you more
Dominic Robb the Deputy Prime Minister
of the UK and one of Richardson's
closest allies has resigned he has been
facing a probe for five months over
alleged bullying and aggressive behavior
in the office we tell you more
and the Brewing politics over Mexico's
presidential jet
which now has a bio by the way the
geekistan we tell you what's happening
[Music]
who will launch the next offensive
in case you are wondering yes we are
talking about Ukraine
you see there seems to be a lull over
there since
and you may say Allah is good
and I will agree
you see the lack of an offensive the
absence of deaths and casualties they
are all always welcome
but we need to realize that this silence
the silence in Ukraine is uneasy
and it is often broken by a deafening
question
this one
who will take the next offensive
because we will be wrong in assuming
that that there will be none that there
will be no offensive that there will be
no land movement in the coming days
that the war has come to an end because
it has not
you see there is a stalemate yes but
this stalemate is temporary at best
the recently leaked U.S papers
confirming what was being speculated for
the longest time that Ukraine is
planning a spring offensive
the Ukrainian military will try to
repeat what it carried out last autumn
you know when it reclaimed some lost
land
but now that critical data on this
offensive has been leaked
are we to assume that Ukraine will put a
pause on its plan
highly unlikely
and I'll tell you why because the fact
remains that a sizable portion of
Ukrainian land remains under Russian
occupation and this has not changed
since the data leak
and neither should Ukraine's plan
so will the next offensive buy Ukraine
will the next offensive be ukraines is
the immediate question
and to answer that you must ask yourself
this question who benefits from an
offensive who benefits from asking
troops to March ahead
Russia or Ukraine
let's just quickly recap the war so far
Russia has managed to capture luhansk
bakmut Donetsk Mario poll melito Paul
zaporizia Quezon
and like we have been telling you Russia
has in a way managed to split Ukraine
into two
you know divide it along the nepro river
it controls the Eastern side in totality
or in parts
and like we told you earlier this week
Russia has also built a Putin line with
which it hopes to protect the gained
territory
so does Russia benefit from marching
ahead risking the lives of more men and
spending on resources
hardly
in fact many would say the Kremlin
already has what it wants which may
explain the Lal since bakwolves
sure there have been a couple of attacks
since like the recent drone attack on
you on Kiev or this bizarre instance of
a Russian Sukhoi 34 jet striking a
Russian city by mistake and leaving the
city's Governor shell shocked
thank you
[Music]
foreign
people have been injured one person
refused to be taken to the hospital one
resident was diagnosed with a closed
head injury and concussion
this was an airstrike but when it comes
to the ground movement there hasn't been
any since birth month
and the ball now falls on Ukraine's
Court
does Kiev benefit from an offensive
more than we can explain
in fact one could say Ukraine needs a
ground offensive a spring offensive
let's just pull out the map once again
all of these cities are under Russian
control
and their occupation has cut off Ukraine
from one much of the Red Sea from much
of the Red Sea something that Ukraine
will look to claw back
if this offensive is to happen in Spring
it needs to happen now
for it is almost the end of April
so what is the hold up all about
weapons
in fact Reports say that in late March
zelenski sent a message on his telegram
he said that Ukraine will not be able to
begin a counter-offensive until the West
sends weapons more weapons and what kind
of weapons does Ukraine need
everything
starting from bullets to tanks to Rocket
artillery
in fact the West has already promised a
lot of weapons
from german-made leopard tanks to
American Patriot missiles and Abraham
tanks
but you see just a fraction of what have
been promised has actually arrived and
that's not enough for Ukraine to go
charging to the front lines
in March by the way zelensky told
Japanese people you mayori shimbun I'm
quoting we are waiting for ammunition to
arrive from our partners we cannot send
our brave Soldiers to the front line
without tanks artillery and long range
Rockets
what if those weapons don't arrive on
time
should your cream be prepared for Plan B
you know settle for the new reality
what some analysts have been speculating
for a while
you know where the eastern part of the
nepro remains under Russian control
and the remaining country eventually
goes on to join the NATO
the military Alliance could already be
preparing for such a possibility
I said in cave yesterday and that
Ukraine's future is in the Euro Atlantic
family and all NATO allies have agreed
that Ukraine will become a NATO member
but the main focus now is of course on
on how to ensure that Ukraine prevails
um
where it goes from here is anybody's
guess
and let's now talk about an upcoming
visit to India that is making news
a visit by the Pakistan foreign minister
Bilal Bhutto sardari to India
he will be visiting India next month to
attend the Shanghai cooperation
organization or sco foreign Minister's
meeting which will take place in Goa in
India what are the dates May 4-5 for
those unworths the SEO is an
eight-member political and security Bloc
and Bhutto zadari is the son of the
assassinated former prime minister
venezibuto and a former president Asif
Ali zadari
the announcement regarding the Pakistan
Minister's visit to India for the SEO
meeting was made by the Pakistan foreign
Ministry spokesperson
and you know what happened just hours
later
a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir
five Indian soldiers were killed
let's just for now talk about the
significance of the Pakistan Minister's
visit
what really are the implications
in one word several
given that beloved's visit would be the
first by any Pakistani foreign minister
since Hina Rabbani cars in the year 2011
it would also be the first high-level
visit by a Pakistani official since
Nawaz sharif's trip to India in 2014.
said about the visit
that his participation in the meeting of
the Shanghai cooperation organization
Council in India reflected islamabad's
commitment to the Charter of the SEO and
that the wizard should not be seen as a
bilateral one but in the context of the
SEO
now it's important to point out here
India has formally sent invitations to
all members of the Shanghai cooperation
organization
including Pakistan and China for the
upcoming foreign ministers meeting India
remember took over the chairmanship of
the mega grouping in September last year
and will be holding key ministerial
meetings and the summit this year given
the relationship between the two
countries at this point what should one
really expect
hours after Pakistan announced that will
attend the SEO meeting India said it
would not be appropriate to focus on
participation by any one country
the Indian ministry of external Affairs
spokesperson arindam bakshi has said
that
as the chair of the SEO India has
invited all member states of the
grouping and some inviting countries for
the foreign ministerial meeting adding
that it would not be appropriate to
focus on participation by any one
particular country
the invitation to the Pakistan foreign
minister was sent in January
and by the way in January Pakistan prime
minister Shahbaz Sharif had offered to
hold bilateral talks between India and
Pakistan
you know what he said
that Pakistan has learned its lesson
after three wars with India and now
wants to live in peace with India if
quote unquote genuine problems are
resolved
and you know what the Pakistan's prime
minister's office said later that
negotiations are not possible without
India revoking its actions the 2019
actions on Kashmir
India meanwhile has maintained that the
owners is on Pakistan to create an
environment that's free of Terror and
hostility for such an engagement will
the latest terror attack in Jammu and
Kashmir cast a shadow over belovedari's
visit to India
we will have to wait and see
now here's a question
has America gone berserk
I know the question sounds sweeping
some would say it's offensive
trust me it does not make me happy to
ask this question in fact nothing about
the story is coming in from the United
States is anything close to making
anyone happy
people in America are being killed like
ants they are being killed for no reason
they are being shot at for no fault of
this
let me just Begin by telling you what
happened in North Carolina a
six-year-old was shot by her neighbor
you know why
because the child was playing basketball
and the ball rolled into the attacker's
yard
imagine that your innocent basketball
Rose into your neighbor's yard and your
neighbor decides to pull out his gun
and shoot you
this is wild
in fact it is the Wild Wild West
where life
and value for life means nothing
where forget about Law and Order even
civilized behavior is too much to ask
for
where the next bullet can be fired
anywhere at any one
you know what
this is not how a civilized society
functions because in a civilized society
it is normally it is normal for
basketball to fly into your neighbor's
Courtyard for a frisbee to get caught in
your neighbor's tree for example
For Your Pet CAP to sneak into your
neighbor's balcony it's absolutely
normal
most of us in this part of the world
have landed in trouble where our cricket
ball has shattered a neighbor's window
or a broken something in someone's
balcony
but trouble means getting a scolding
from the neighbor
you know followed by a round of coding
from the parents as well
but that is where it ends you get away
with apologizing and if you are lucky
you get away without any scolding at all
but imagine being shot at for this
according to reports the neighbor ran
out of his home upset over the
basketball Landing into his yard
and he started firing bullet fragments
landed at the cheeks of the young girl
the six-year-old's father was hit as
well
we are being told that he is seriously
injured
if this is bizarre
let me tell you what else has been
happening in the United States
a black teenager was shot in the head
because he rang the wrong doorbell let
me let me just repeat that for you a 16
year old was shot in the head
because he ranked the wrong doorbell by
mistake
let that sink in
this boy is black he was trying to pick
up his siblings but he ended up at the
wrong address
rang the doorbell and the white
homeowner an 84 year old man saw the
teenager he did not say a word instead
he pulled out his gun and opened fire
through a locked glass door
what explains this Rogue Behavior
you know what the white man claims he
thought the boy was trying to break in
why
because he's black
the 84 year old says that he was caught
on court scared to death because of the
boy's size
what are we to make of that
this incident happened in America Kansas
City
because where else
anywhere outside America
does ringing the wrong doorbell get
considered to be a mistake to this
extent
I don't know if it is commonplace in the
country you are watching us from but I
can't tell you from my experience that
here in India children often like to
rile up the neighbors by ringing their
doorbells and running away it's a form
of Mischief it's one of those things
that people are guilty of doing during
the summer vacations for example
you know spending time with their
cousins or friends
even today it is commonplace for
delivery Executives to end up ringing
the wrong doorbell by mistake
say they want to deliver a parcel to
Flat number one and they go to Flat
number two by mistake
but we don't come out shooting at them
do we
because that has not civilized
that is not how civilized people conduct
themselves
but just a few days back in the United
States a 20 year old woman was killed
after the car she was riding
accidentally pulled into the wrong
driveway this happened in New York the
20 year old was not alone she was
traveling with a group with three others
to be precise
the group pulled into the wrong driveway
of another home and when they realized
that they were not at the correct
address
they started pulling out their car from
the driveway
but you see it was too late
the resident of that house saw the car
pulling away and started firing
20 year old Kellen Gillis was hit in the
neck she wasn't even the one driving so
basically in America you pull into a
wrong driveway and you get killed you
ring the wrong doorbell and you will
receive a bullet in return your
basketball rolls into your neighbor's
yard and you risk losing your father if
not your own life
you know what else puts you at risk of
death
getting into the wrong car
can you believe that
a lot of us have done that we book a
radio taxi for example and when we get
to the pickup point we see multiple
taxis standing there we could end up
getting into the wrong one by mistake
and what happens next
either you realize right away and you
get down or you call up the person who
booked the cap apologize and ask them to
feel free to take your taxi instead
but none of that seems to be an option
in the United States
you know what happened in Texas
two cheerleaders were short at and
injured what was their fault supposed
one of them almost and I repeat almost
got into the wrong parked car this was
outside a supermarket
the car's owner was a 25 year old man
and when he saw the cheerleader trying
to enter his car the man got off his
seat the cheerleader tried to apologize
to him but he preferred to pull his gun
out and Fire
why
because he thought that was the easier
thing to do
what would happen at most he would be
pulled up by a cop
But ultimately he would get away with
citing the Second Amendment and the
right to carry firearms the right to
defend himself
the National Rifles Association will
rally behind him the supporters of
Donald Trump will make him a hero
perhaps
for all you know he will feature in one
of Trump's campaigns
you see this is what America has come
down to this is what years of inaction
has done to America
it has transported the country to the
era of the Wild Wild West
where lawlessness is the law of the land
and staying on with the United States
there is a whole new twist in the hunter
Biden Saga
our tax special agent claims to have
crucial information on President Biden's
son's criminal investigation
the U.S official saying that the
investigations have been hampered due to
certain political considerations
what more information does the special
agent have
what are the reactions to what his
statements have revealed
our next report getting you the complete
story
Hunter Biden has been a long time Target
of Republican criticism there have been
Federal investigations over potential
tax violations and money laundering as
per reports the businessman could soon
be on the edge of being charged for not
reporting all of his income sources and
lying about his excessive drug use and
here's the latest twist in the hunter
Biden Saga an agent of the Internal
Revenue Service tax agency is now on to
the case
the unnamed man claims that he has
sensitive information that could prove
that there was a failure in handling
clear conflicts of interest in the
hunter Biden case the information could
also shed light on a contradiction in a
senior political appointees sworn
testimony to the Congress
his lawyer says that his client is ready
to be questioned about what he knows but
only under proper legal protection legal
protection is vital in this scenario as
the IRS agent is prohibited from
publicly speaking about any individuals
tax filings will the Congress agree to
provide whistleblower protection what
are the reactions to the claims
Hunter Biden's lawyer has promptly
replied saying that the IRS agent is
looking to commit a crime the attorney
has pointed out that it will be a felony
for the agent to disclose information
about the ongoing investigation some
officials can see through the Biden
administration's approach towards the
controversial case the house oversight
committee chair James Comer has called
the new set of allegations concerning
according to the official President
Biden is working overtime to protect his
family from any consequences
Federal prosecutors have been after
Hunter Biden since 2018. years before
his father was elected President Hunter
Biden continues to deny any wrongdoing
and says that he takes the matter very
seriously but denies that he was ever
involved in any illegal matter
this is while Hunter Biden admitted to
doing regrettable things the man has
confessed to being a heavy user of crack
cocaine
but Reports say that when asked about
the same on a Federal Form Hunter simply
said no meanwhile the president has said
he is deeply proud of his son and
continues to stand by him through his
struggles
Joe Biden has always tried to defend his
family but when Hunter Biden was accused
of doing business with China and Ukraine
the president said that it was a smear
campaign and that there was no evidence
because it was just a form of Russian
disinformation but when questioned about
his deal with barisma a Ukrainian firm
Hunter said that he forgot how people
would perceive his business with Ukraine
does that justify Hunter hiding his
dealings with Ukraine he also attracted
controversy for partnering with the
Chinese firm he reportedly caught hold
of 10 stake in a company backed by
China's largest State Banks Hunter's
lawyer said Hunter was at an unpaid
position in the company with the latest
twist Hunter Biden is back in the
headlines
what impact will the claims of the IRS
agent have what's in store for Hunter
Biden the answers to these questions
could be on the horizon
viewer report we on world is one
let's now get to the story coming in
from India where the famous shirdi
Temple is facing a rather unique problem
a problem of having too many coins
in fact the temple has so many coins
that banks have run out of space
some banks have refused to take coins as
they are posing a threat to the banks
themselves
how can coins cause such chaos how will
the banks deal with this search off
coins
the SRI Sai Baba trusts one of the
famous
of the famous Indian shirdi temple is
dealing with this problem
surely in Western India is considered to
be the home of shirdi Sai Baba
the Saints home which was located in a
small village has now been turned into a
holy pilgrimage site where devotees from
all over the world come to pray
the siddhi temple is known for receiving
massive donations it is considered to be
one of the richest temples in India
the holy site receives nearly over 40
million dollars in donations each year
and now this has started to cause a bit
of a problem
from over a dozen Banks where the temple
trust holds an account
four of them have refused to take money
in the form of coins
the banks collectively have over 1.3
million dollars in coins all deposited
by the temple Trust
this is a case of space crunch
as the coins have a certain weight
compared to notes and take up more space
than any other form of currency
so what will the temple trust do now
knowing that a majority of the durations
will keep coming in coins the trust
plans to contact the Reserve Bank of
India and seek an intervention
the trust will open accounts in other
parts of the country
can the temple restrict the donations to
only Norths and the answer is no as many
of the devotees prefer to pay in coins
or donate in coins Indians consider the
one rupee coin as being auspicious as
that
according to Hindu mythology metal is
believed to be of special significance
as far as goddess Lakshmi is concerned
as it comes from the Earth
so Indians always add a one rupee coin
while donating
as a number one signifies a beginning in
place of the number zero which
represents the end
so how has the temple been dealing with
the donations
a personal from each Bank where the
trust holds an account sends its own
Personnel to the temple every month to
gather deposits but in 2019 Banks raised
an alarm about the bags of coins
creating an issue
so how did the temple solve the issue
back then
the temple Trust might have taken the
problem a bit too casually and told the
banks to store the coins inside the
temple premises itself the banks had to
reject the offer as the rules do not
permit such a casual arrangement to
store the deposits
a temple which welcomes flocks of over
50 000 devotees receives more than
thirty thousand dollars in coins each
month might not be able to limit how
many bags of coins it receives
will the temple trust manage to rope in
more banks will should they flip a coin
to decide if it wants to stop the coin
donations
we will have to wait and watch
Dominic Robb one of Richardson arc's
closest allies has resigned
he has been facing a probe for five
months
what for
alleged bullying and aggressive behavior
in the office
let's have a look at the accusations
made against him
in November 2022 a number of civil
servants in the ministry of Justice
spoke out against Rob they said that
demeaning rather than demanding
that he was very rude and aggressive and
that he wasn't just unprofessional but
also a bully
he misbehaved with officials during his
time as brexit secretary in 2018. he was
also issued warnings when he served as
the foreign secretary soon the
opposition party started calling for a
formal investigation
it started with two complaints Rob
requested an inquiry he claimed he had
always behaved properly towards the
staff
the list of accusations soon started
growing senior civil servants also got
involved by January Rob was facing 24
formal complaints shocking claims
emerged against Rob some reported being
physically sick before meetings others
were regularly in tears and in at least
one case were left feeling suicidal
in a letter to sanak Rob said that he
would resign if he was found guilty of
bullying and after a long wait the
findings were finally released on
Thursday
all but two of the complaints made
against Rob were dismissed for the last
24 hours his political fate had been
hanging in balance
finally Rob turned in his resignation
earlier today but he pulled no punches
by the way he claimed that the findings
were flawed
Rob apologized for the unintended stress
that he caused
but he blamed it all on the pace
standards and challenges of the job
his argument was that ministers should
be able to give direct critical feedback
that they should be allowed direct
oversight over their civil servant
officials
not just that he also said and I'm
quoting
in setting the threshold for bullying
solo this inquiry has set a dangerous
precedent
this Sparks an even bigger debate and
the matter does not just concern British
politics it relates to normal workplaces
as well
what exactly qualifies as bullying at
work
in Broad terms what is appropriate
workplace behavior in 2023
you see for the longest time shouting
and verbal abuse have been a workplace
staple
earlier the management was asked to act
like a boss
you know to show Authority keep the
employees under check
but there has been a shift in the work
culture
toxicity is no more blindly accepted
leaders are taught to behave like
anything but a boss
you know they are encouraged to get
involved with the employees and treat
them as equals
yelling is a big No-No
but despite the changing Trends bullying
at work Still Remains prevalent
according to a report by Harvard
Business review about 48.6 million
Americans are bullied at work this this
makes up about 30 percent of the
workforce
in India that percentage is reported to
be as high as 46 percent or even 55
percent
there are quote-unquote Screamers who
yell and bang their fists
and then there are schemas
who are quieter but equally dangerous
you know they resort to plotting gas
lighting smear campaigns to try and push
people out
however employees don't bat an eyelid
before quitting when they feel
humiliated
a toxic boss is considered to be the
greatest threat to a company's culture
according to a survey by the
International Association of
Administrative Professionals a bad boss
is the number one reasons for employees
a reason for employees to quit
you see those times have gone when
workers lowered their heads and listened
to endless verbal abuse
workplace bullying is now seen as a
serious issue
but the boundaries remain somewhat
blurred
there is a difference between actual
bullying and feeling bullied bullying at
work is about isolating people demeaning
and humiliating them gossiping about
them withholding information and tasks
and then in turn blaming it on them
it is cruel and unacceptable
but you see bullying is not expecting a
team to produce quality work on time
it isn't when you are questioned for
missing deadlines
so where does one draw the line
think about it
in early school years when children are
not all that well worth as far as
writing is concerned they are often
tested through different activities or
oral examinations
and this trend usually takes a back seat
as they grow up
the focus largely shifts to written
exams essays open book tests
but with the rise of AI chatbots and
online exams during covid-19
every essay every written test no matter
how difficult is just one search away
and how exactly do we deal with this
you know how do we keep the exam
structures legitimate Fair
is it time to go back to the basics
a Hong Kong education Think Tank
suggests that it is
written coursework is no longer viable
because of the pressing risk of cheating
scrutinizing whether the assignment is a
student's original work has become
virtually impossible
you know on top of AI Bots like chat GPT
there are all sorts of software websites
that can plagiarize stuff online without
leaving a shred of evidence
while written tests can be the primary
mode for assessment
EDF is saying that it should not be the
only one
in fact it says new qualifications are
needed to help the students develop more
skills
so what exactly is the solution you ask
well the think tank recommends students
aged 16 to 19 should be required to take
an additional subject in the 12th
standard
and this subject would be examined
entirely through an oral assessment
and this would not only rule out the
risk of malpractice but also help the
students develop verbal skills
you know boost their confidence
and offer interview experience
it would further help them when they
appear for college or job interviews
as AI Bots raised doubts over the
legitimacy of written examinations
experts have made some other important
observations
written tests often focus more on
cramming and memorization instead of
logic and reasoning
you know they fail to equip equip the
students with practical skills that they
might later need in life
for example personal finances student
loans
appearing for interviews the list is
long
can oral assessments fill the gaps that
have been left by written ones
and can be a really weed out cheating
how exactly will it affect students who
feel nervous during verbal communication
and how long before someone develops a
hack for even this mode of examination
let me ask you this when was the last
time you saw a presidential plane caught
in the middle of a bitterly Fort
election campaign
that's exactly what happened in Mexico
Andres Manuel Lopez abrador this was in
2018 he needed his mission to sell off
The Unwanted plane quote unquote
unwanted plane
there's finally a buyer and that's the
geekistan
what exactly is the story about our next
report tells you about the deal and why
it has been struck
this is Mexico's presidential plane that
went under the hammer
you heard that right and while you
process that fact here's a quick
backgrounder
the Boeing 7878 Dreamliner tp01 was
purchased for
218.7 million dollars by Mexico back in
2012.
Mexico's version of Air Force One boasts
of white leather seats are double bed in
a spacious bathroom with a shower it
features marble touches and official
government seals emblazoned on the walls
along with multiple flat screen monitors
over time it became a political tool for
leftist obrador he vowed to sell the
plane if he comes to power in 2018.
in fact among the issues that were a
part of his campaign it was the
presidential plane that grabbed a lot of
attention
and then since coming to power the
austerity loving president refused to
fly in the plane taking commercial
flights to travel instead
obrador hoped to sell the aircraft for
at least 150 million dollars
down from his original
218 million dollars purchase price
but years went by and the presidential
plane did not find any takers
with obrador vowing to raffle off the
aircraft or even selling it at a lost
the exchequer and now he has managed to
finally sell off the controversial plane
for 92 million dollars ending the
political Saga who's the buyer
Tajikistan
was promised to use the proceeds of the
plane to help the country's poorer
communities
as the left is present bats for change
in the Mexican political system
[Applause]
it remains to be seen at the sale of the
plane will revive its chances in the
2024 elections in Mexico

WgWNwm5Ht-g,"Gravitas | Ukraine, Russia war: The next big offensive. Here&#39;s who benefits from the war",Who will launch the next big offensive in Ukraine? Will it be Russia or Ukrainian military? Reports say Ukraine's spring offensive is ...,2023-04-21T16:07:58Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WgWNwm5Ht-g/hqdefault.jpg,"who will launch the next offensive
in case you are wondering yes we are
talking about Ukraine
you see there seems to be a lull over
there since bakmut
and you may say Allah is good
and I will agree
you see the lack of an offensive the
absence of deaths and casualties they
are all always welcome
but we need to realize that this silence
the silence in Ukraine is uneasy
and it is often broken by a deafening
question
this one
who will take the next offensive
because we will be wrong in assuming
that that there will be none that there
will be no offensive that there will be
no land movement in the coming days
that the war has come to an end because
it has not
you see there is a stalemate yes but
this stalemate is temporary at best
the recently leaked U.S papers
confirming what was being speculated for
the longest time that Ukraine is
planning a spring offensive
the Ukrainian military will try to
repeat what it carried out last autumn
you know when it reclaimed some lost
land
but now that critical data on this
offensive has been leaked
are we to assume that Ukraine will put a
pause on its plan
highly unlikely
and I'll tell you why because the fact
remains that a sizable portion of
Ukrainian land remains under Russian
occupation and this has not changed
since the data leak
and neither should Ukraine's plan
so will the next offensive buy Ukraine
will the next offensive be your Koreans
is the immediate question
and to answer that you must ask yourself
this question who benefits from an
offensive who benefits from asking
troops to March ahead
Russia or Ukraine
let's just quickly recap the war so far
Russia has managed to capture luhansk
bakmut Donetsk Mario poll melito Paul
zaporizia Quezon
and like we have been telling you Russia
has in a way managed to split Ukraine
into two
you know divide it along the nepro river
it controls the Eastern side in totality
or in parts
and like we told you earlier this week
Russia has also built a Putin line with
which it hopes to protect the gained
territory
so does Russia benefit from marching
ahead risking the lives of more men and
spending on resources
hardly
in fact many would say the Kremlin
already has what it wants which may
explain the Lal since Bak moves
sure there have been a couple of attacks
since like the recent drone attack on
you on Kiev or this bizarre instance of
a Russian Sukhoi 34 jet striking a
Russian city by mistake and leaving the
city's Governor shell shocked
thank you
[Music]
three people have been injured one
person refused to be taken to the
hospital one resident was diagnosed with
a closed head injury and concussion
this was an airstrike but when it comes
to the ground movement there hasn't been
any since Bach moves
and the ball now falls on Ukraine's
Court
does Kiev benefit from an offensive
more than we can explain
in fact one could say Ukraine needs a
ground offensive a spring offensive
let's just pull out the map once again
all of these cities are under Russian
control
and their occupation has cut off Ukraine
from one much of the Red Sea from much
of the Red Sea something that Ukraine
will look to claw back
if this offensive is to happen in Spring
it needs to happen now
for it is almost the end of April
so what is the holdup all about
weapons
in fact Reports say that in late March
zelenski sent a message on his telegram
he said that Ukraine will not be able to
begin a counter-offensive until the West
sends weapons more weapons and what kind
of weapons does Ukraine need
everything
starting from bullets to tanks to Rocket
artillery
in fact the West has already promised a
lot of weapons
from german-made leopard tanks to
American Patriot missiles and Abram
tanks
but you see just a fraction of what has
been promised has actually arrived and
that's not enough for Ukraine to go
charging to the front lines
in March by the way zelensky told
Japanese people yumiori shimbun I'm
quoting we are waiting for ammunition to
arrive from our partners we cannot send
our brave Soldiers to the front line
without tanks artillery and long range
Rockets
what if those weapons don't arrive on
time
should your crane be prepared for Plan B
you know settle for the new reality
what some analysts have been speculating
for a while
you know where the eastern part of the
nepro remains under Russian control
and the remaining country eventually
goes on to join the NATO
the military Alliance could already be
preparing for such a possibility
I said in cave yesterday and that
Ukraine's future is in the Euro Atlantic
family and all NATO allies have agreed
that Ukraine will become a NATO member
but the main focus now is of course on
on how to ensure that Ukraine prevails
where it goes from here is anybody's

however it is unlikely to advance
further as democratic-led Senate is
expected to not support it and the White
House has said that President Joe Biden
would veto it those who support the
legislation say it is yet it is to
ensure competitive fairness they say
that the bill will support female
athletes who are at a disadvantage by
having to compete against those whose
gender identity does not match their sex
assigned at Birth
it was a great day for America and great
day for
girls and women and for fairness
in sports they strive for excellence and
they achieved it
and they learn the value of teamwork and
hard work
but because they were forced to compete
against biological men they lost out on
opportunities that they deserved they
watched their peers lose out on
opportunities they deserved as well
so these women did something courageous
this bill does not discriminate against
anyone it does not exhibit any hate
toward anyone what it does is prohibit
Federal funding to institutions that and
I quote permit a person whose sex is
male to participate in an athletic
program or activity that's designated
for women or girls the reason for this
is simple men have certain physiological
advantages over women such as more size
and speed and because of that allowing
biological males to compete against
women and girls robs females of equal
athletic opportunities and fair playing
fields
but there are many who are criticizing
the build opponents say that the bill
will ostracize an already vulnerable
critical game
is a meaningless bill
the Olympics has addressed the question
the NCAA has addressed the question
when will we realize that we have the
right to freedom of religion we have a
right to our beliefs
and in that we have no right to
undermine and threaten the lives of
trans children extreme Mega Republicans
from the very beginning
of the 118th Congress have been focused
on Banning abortion care
and bullying women
Banning books
about our history
and bullying parents
and this week they've decided that they
want to ban trans children
from playing sports
and bullying kids that's the extreme
Mega Republican agenda
the house action comes as at least 20
other states have approved similar
limits on trans athletes at the school
or college level the bill would demand
Landmark civil rights legislation passed
more than 50 years ago the amendment
would prohibit recipients of the federal
money from permitting a person whose sex
is male to participate in an athletic
program or activity that is designated
for women or girls the bill defines sex
as based solely on a person's
reproductive biology and genetics at
Birth

[Music]
story tonight is about the anti-hindu
hit that spreading in the UK
specifically in British schools you
heard that right
let's tell you what a new report has
found
it highlights the plight of Hindu
students and the takeaways are shocking
to say the least
according to it Hindu students are being
bullied for their beliefs
just how widespread is anti-hindu hatred
in the UK and what's the reason
we get you detailed findings we discuss
this and more as a part of our cover
story
also on the show for you aradhya
Bachchan versus YouTube tabloids we tell
you why the 11 year old dragged a
YouTube channel to quote
all about the Yemen humanitarian crisis
we tell you how the people are paying
the price
New Zealand's cat killing contest for
children set the cat among the pigeons
it was forced to scrap that contest
we'll get you more
would you like to have a meal 15 miles

we tell you more about this
[Music]
there seems to be canker or perhaps of
cancer at the heart of something Britain
can be genuinely proud of its schools
and colleges
British schools and colleges have been
the Envy after all of the modern world
you know attracting children of Elites
from around the world
but here's something that may tarnish
that Pride
it seems that schools in the UK have
become breeding grounds for anti-hindu
hate
have a look at this
this is a report by the Henry Jackson
Society
a non-partisan london-based think tank
that strives to spread democracy and
liberal values globally
it has conducted the first national
study into discrimination against Hindus
in the UK
and what does the study reveal
that anti-hindu hate is widespread in
British schools
that Hindu students have become victims
of bullying
racial discrimination
threats of conversion
some children keep hearing that as quote
unquote unbelievers they are destined
for hell
can you believe that
others are labeled terms like kafir
which some perceive to be a derogatory
term for unbelievers
let me start with some figures according
to the study 51 of Hindu parents
surveyed said that their child had
experienced hate crimes in his or her
school
81 percent of the parents said the
schools were unable to identify the
crime as anti-hindu hate
we wonder if they were unable or
unwilling
85 percent of the parents said the
schools did not address anti-hindu rated
incidents
there were a total of eight cases of
physical abuse that were described in
detail by the parents and there were at
least three cases of students having to
move schools due to anti-hindu bullying
and if I speak of a specific instance
instances and testimonies one parent
revealed that her child used to go to
school with a religious symbol on his
forehead and he was bullied to the point
that he no longer wanted to attend
school
can you imagine the plight of that
student
and what's worse the same thing happened
at other schools so much so that the
child had to change his school three
times within East London three times
another parent revealed that her child
had beef thrown at her by her Muslim
classmates they labeled her as a kafir
and told her to convert if she wanted
the bullying to stop
another parent said that her child was
told her religion was inferior this is
what his classmates once told him and
I'm quoting
you are not going to survive very long
if you want to go to paradise
you will have to come to Islam
Hindus are the herbivores at the bottom
of the food chain and will eat you up
and then have a look at this testimony
one parent said that his child was often
held accountable for political issues in
India he was asked to give
clarifications for political decisions
back home
and by the way it isn't just students
perpetuating this hate
the teachers and the authorities have
been equally blamed
in fact one parent said that his child's
class teacher would often show material
that would highlight perceived ills
within Hinduism like castism and this
type of selective highlighting and
attribution of castism to Hinduism would
often lead to bullying
these testimonies are appalling to say
the least and the lack of action even
more so
the parent surveyed say that every time
they complained their requests were met
with this deal
and were not followed up thoroughly
how should we perceive this
our British schools deliberately letting
anti-hindu hate perpetuate on their
campuses
some of you may feel that I am
exaggerating misbehavior of the kind
familiar in schools as is known school
children can be cruel but I don't ask or
raise these questions without reason
in the last couple of years you see we
have witnessed several instances in the
UK of Hindus being targeted for their
identity
just have a look at what happened last
year
in September 2022 there was a string of
attacks on Hindus living in Leicester
and Smithwick videos showed mobs of
British Pakistani men vandalizing homes
cars businesses owned by Hindus
these attacks started right after the
Asia cup where Pakistan was badly
defeated by the Indian side Soul rattled
British Pakistani men decided to take
their anger out on the Hindu community
in the UK
and what's worse the British media
portrayed this as communal clashes they
did not talk about who started the
violence
the headlines took the easy way out by
blaming both the Hindus and the Muslims
for the unrest
and then take this headline
I will look at what it reads
Lester disorder fear lingers among
cities Muslims and Hindus
but the violence started with Muslim
attacks
my point here is simple hatred against
Hindus in the UK hatred against Hindus
in the UK is not restricted to one
Community or one school or one area
look at this report now
the new Statesman published this in May
2022 the headline reads how labor lost
the Indian vote
and what follows our lengthy paragraphs
on how radicalized Indian politics has
made Hindu voters in the UK it links
quote-unquote Hindu nationalism in the
UK for the political decision of the
Indian Waters
but this is far from being the whole
story
in the same period the British have also
proved that at the larger level among
the electorate there is astonishing
Enlightenment and liberalism perhaps
unmatched anywhere else Britain has made
a practicing Hindu with an Indian wife
prime minister of Britain indeed the
first non-white Prime Minister in its
history
does not hide his Hinduism
he worships Lord Krishna in the prime
ministerial home 10 Downing Street
not merely that he has pulled the
opinion poll ratings of his party from
the depths to at least a fighting level
proving that voters across the political
divide are not racist pure and simple
so do the two facts contradict each
other
in a way what is certain is that while
the majority of British Waters reject
racism there is a strong entrenched and
Powerful section that is making racism
more powerful more intolerant
it so happens that Hinduism is the third
largest religion practiced in the UK
Hindus are a positive contribution to
the British economy community building
and cultural diversity
but you see nothing is perfect
and from the United Kingdom we turn to
the United States
is it about to witness the return of the
Kennedy Dynasty
a dynasty that once ruled American
politics public service and
entertainment from Senators to
ambassadors to athletes to a president
members of this family have been some of
the most successful Americans in recent
history
will a science now restore this family
to its days of Glory
what am I talking about
Robert F Kennedy Jr the nephew of former
U.S President John F Kennedy and the son
of former U.S attorney General Robert
Kennedy
he has launched his bid for the 2024
Democratic presidential nomination a bid
that might bid him directly against the
U.S President Joe Biden
the 69 year old made the announcement in
Boston he made an extensive
campaign-launch speech as well
lambasting school and business closures
during the pandemic
also insisting that the U.S government
and the media lied to the American
people
let's just listen in to some of the most
telling excerpts from his speech
I've come here today
to announce my candidacy for the
Democratic nomination for president of
the United States
my mission over the next 18 months of
this campaign and over my throughout my
presidency
will be to end the corrupt merger of
state and corporate power that is
threatening now
[Applause]
there's nothing else to impose a new
kind of corporate feudalism in our
country
to commoditize our children our purple
Mountain's Majesty
so Kennedy has made his intention quite
clear he is going to pull no punches
when it comes to attacking the current
government
but who exactly is he what are his
credentials and does he stand a chance
of winning
let's just take this one at a time
Kennedy junior is an Environmental
Lawyer and author he is the president of
the water keeper Alliance a Global
Network of environmental organizations
and in the past he has served as the
assistant district attorney in New York
City
in fact he is notorious for promoting
the scientifically discredited link
between vaccines and autism
since the emergence of covid-19 he has
been accused of promoting covid-19
misinformation
in the year 2022 Kennedy invoked Nazi
Germany in an anti-vaccine speech at the
Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC
he likened vaccine policies in the U.S
to the actions offered totalitarian
state
even suggesting Anne Frank was in a
better situation when she was hiding
from the Nazis
and the previous year in 2021
Instagram and Facebook took down his
account why
for repeatedly sharing debunked claims
about the coronavirus or the vaccines
and in 2019 three members of his family
his sister Kathleen Kennedy Thompson
Brother Joseph P Kennedy II and niece
mayeth Kennedy McCain forcefully
denounced his anti-vaccine views in a
political magazine oped
they argued that he was part of a
misinformation campaign that is having
heartbreaking and deadly consequences
and this anti-vaccine activism has
earned him allies on the right
in fact in the year 2017 then president
Donald Trump tapped him to oversee a
vaccine review panel
drawing criticism from scientists who
said that it could legitimize unfounded
skepticism
so these were the controversies around
him
what about his chances of winning then
well if we go by the opinion polls he
has little chance of success at least
for now
and that is because only two candidates
have announced their bid so far
and Biden is well poised to beat both of
them
but one cannot be sure if things will
remain the same in the days ahead like I
said Kennedy junior is a member of a
storied U.S political Dynasty
he is the nephew of JFK
the youngest person to assume the
presidency
also the youngest president to die
he served at the height of the Cold War
his policies are said to have
revolutionized American politics
so a section of the American Water base
may give Robert F Kennedy Jr a chance
given the success of his family in
American politics but his track record
his statements his anti-vaccine policies
the controversies
may prove to be a big obstacle
Fame comes at a price
a hefty one at that
you see being in the spotlight leaves
little room for privacy
and then there is a Paparazzi culture
where cameras are waiting for you just
about everywhere you go
what the celebrities are eating what
they are drinking where they are going
with whom they are spotted just about
everything becomes fodder for a tabloid
a Blog a YouTube video
sometimes Gathering millions of views
basically profiting from a public
figure's personal life
but what happens if a male child in her
Tender Years finds herself in this
situation
11 year old aradhya Bachchan the
granddaughter of Indian Mega star
Amitabh Bachchan has fallen victim to
fake news on YouTube
as many as nine YouTube channels were
spreading misinformation about the 11
year old
these were the ones that came under
scrutiny the actual number could be
higher
you see it doesn't take much to run a
YouTube channel these days and share
content about celebrities
the YouTube entities in this case were
spreading rumors about aratia's health
they claim that she was critically ill
some said that she had trouble walking
some went as far as to say that she was
no more on top of that they claimed she
was distressed
can you believe that
and all this for what
to attract eyeballs and gain viewership
these are the kind of videos that are
profusely shared forwarded countless
times
they're tweeted retweeted after all
everyone wants to know what Abhishek and
Australia bachchan's daughter is up to
but does that mean how privacy is a joke
whether it's a common person's child or
a celebrities child don't all children
preserve to be treated with respect
their privacy safeguarded shouldn't
their personal information be handled
safely and responsibly
outraged by the rumors
the Bachchan family moved
suing the YouTube channels through her
father for two crore rupees
as in over 243 thousand dollars
the matter has been heard in the Delhi
High Court
and taking a strong view the court has
said that spreading misinformation about
a child that too about their physical
and mental health is completely
intolerable in law
in fact it has ordered Google to take
down the videos on YouTube as well as
from other websites
the responsible YouTube entities have
been asked to be immediately delisted
and deactivated if any such videos are
uploaded in the future
can notify the court and they will be
taken down
the tech giant has landed in hot water
questions are being raised about the
responsibility when it comes to
screening the content the court has
questioned Google's policy over such
sensitive matters
Justice C harishankar who is taking care
of the case said and I'm quoting
there is mostly misleading information
which is deformatory
and then there is misleading information
which says that someone is dead
YouTube does not run for charity it is a
profit making platform
if you are making money out of what you
are doing you have a social
responsibility
the court has directed Google to
disclose its policy its compliance with
the it rules 2021 coming under question
the court has also directed The Tech
Giant to provide details of the
infringers it has asked for their
contact numbers and their email IDs
you see this is the first of its kind
Court ruling it is a landmark judgment
on three counts first off it upholds a
child's privacy
secondly the court mentioned that all
children whether a celebrity's child or
a common person's child they should be
treated with respect
and lastly YouTube and Google should
have a zero tolerance against fake news
in the same way as child pornography
celeb kids have always been on the radar
of trolls
fake news is peddled about them without
any restriction social media handles
take zero responsibility to verify the
facts the Bachchan family did not take
this lightly and neither did the court
and it will be taking up the case again
on the 13th of July
and our next story is about the
deepening humanitarian crisis in Yemen
several people there have died after
they attempted to get a few dollars
worth of Charity handouts during the
holy month of ramzan
that's the level of desperation and
hunger
this comes as Yemen reaches nearly a
decade of its Civil War
and this is how people on the ground are
paying the price
for the Civil War
how severe hunger is driving people
towards self-destruction
Yemen's Capital Sanaa witnessed citizens
of the water Nation flocking to receive
charity handouts from local merchants
but what was meant to be a peaceful
distribution turned into a chaotic scene
for dozens of people
packed tightly together unable to move
screaming for help
some people stretching out their arms in
hopes of survival
while the visuals show shoes and
slippers heaped into piles
these were citizens looking to receive a
small sum of money just days before the
Muslim holiday of Eid al-fitr which
marks the end of the holy month of
ramzan
this might sound shocking but the crowd
of hundreds
gathered there to gather a donation of
nearly nine dollars per person it can
certainly certainly be considered a
crisis when over 80 people sacrifice
their lives for merely nine dollars
that is how bad the hunger crisis is in
the country
what is the current status
the dead and the injured have been
transferred to hospitals
while the head of the hoodie Supreme
political Council has ordered an
investigation into the incident the
houthi Iran General Authority for zakat
has announced that it will be providing
around four thousand dollars for the
victims and up to eight hundred dollars
for those injured
a stampede driven by despair driven by
people who just wanted something to eat
could be the result of a war which has
created a culture of death and sadness
as it continues to complete a decade as
it completes a decade
the country's conflict started in 2014
when hudi forces toppled the
saudi-backed government they spiraled
into a wider War when a saudi-led
coalition intervened to lash back at the
houthis eventually it became a proxy war
the U.N describes the situation in Yemen
as the worst humanitarian crisis in the
world
but this gruesome Stampede is not an
isolated incident
a severe economic crisis has also
brought Pakistan to its knees we've been
telling you about this just how bad the
situation on the ground is the crisis
hit country is not able to feed its
citizens and Pakistan's attempts at
Distributing free flower resulted in
multiple stampedes and in the depths of
innocent starving citizens
the brunt of the economic turmoil can be
felt as over 20 people have been killed
in stampedes since the start
of the fasting month of ramzan recently
at least 12 people were killed in a
crowd crush this was at a factory
Distributing food for ramzan
Pakistan has witnessed a series of
stampedes and this is not surprising as
the country spirals downwards when it
comes to debt while it hopes to unlock
another additional fund of three billion
dollars from the IMF the citizens
continue to pay the price and they
question just how long will it take
for their situation to improve
foreign
shifting Focus for now let's talk about
cats
feral cats to be specific
they look cute they are fluffy
but they are considered villains in some
parts of the world
especially New Zealand which plans to
hunt them down and animal rights groups
have stopped the country from holding a
cat hunting contest for children
yes a cat killing contest for children
our next report getting you the complete
story take a look
we have all heard of this question are
you a cat person or a dog person
well New Zealand is definitely not into
feral cats in fact it is gunning for
them quite literally how well it planned
a contest for children where kids could
hunt and kill feral cats and receive a
top prize of a hundred and fifty dollars
can you believe this basically telling
kids kill these animals and get rewarded
New Zealand Justified The Killing
contest by saying that the drive is an
initiative to protect the native species
the organizers received angry messages
from the public there was a backlash
from animal rights groups and the event
eventually had to be canceled
feral cats stand as a threat to the
survival of several native species in
neighboring Australia they are a threat
to the survival of more than a hundred
native species
feral cats are blamed for taking away
the lives of millions of birds reptiles
and mammals this often prompts the
authorities to launch regular culls
new zealanders have strong feelings
towards these troublemakers
the former prime minister John Key once
said that cats are the only true sadists
of the animal world they are serial
killers who torture without Mercy
a feral cat is an unsocialized outdoor
cat which has no interaction with humans
these cats are fearful of people and are
not capable of becoming a house pet they
are used to the wild but their kittens
Can Be Tamed if taken care of before
four months
they are the single biggest threat to
the country's native species but these
are just regular sized cats how much
harm could they have possibly caused
let's have a look at the numbers the
felines have helped Drive nearly 20
mammal species to Extinction since
preying on Native species is easy for
them ferals kill nearly 1 million native
birds every day and if that's not enough
the cats also kill over 1.7 million
reptiles every day across Australia
conservationists say that the
authorities need to adopt a holistic
approach towards addressing all threats
to biodiversity
rather than concentrating on a scatter
gun approach where certain contests just
hand guns to children and tell them to
go on shooting sprees to kill feral cats
experts say that the government should
focus on issues like habitat loss caused
by Urban expansion logging and Mining
which could easily be a reason for the
felines to be afraid and roam in the
wild while hunting for food
in fact New Zealand has announced its
bold goal of becoming completely
Predator free by 2050. does this mean
the island nation will continue to plan
similar contests to shoot down predators
Bureau report we on world is one
let me now ask you this
what according to you if the ideal age
for retirement
is it 65 or maybe even earlier than that
it reduces by half if we talk about
sports persons or athletes
but that is not what the Japanese think
they are pushing the limits to say the
least
you see 80 year olds are hitting
football pitchers you heard that right
and they are not letting their age stop
them
take a look at our next report to find
out more
as football players are here to prove
that
meet mutsuhiko numura
he is 83 years old but that does not
stop him from kicking the ball on Pitch
he played for Japan's national football
team his career has spanned 70 years in
18 World Cups
[Music]
now plays for the over 80 division of
Tokyo soccer for lively
football is a high contact sport it was
once considered off limits for older
people given the risk of injury
but healthy older people are changing
the common perception the whistle blows
there's a kickoff and the match Begins
the pitch is swarmed by several
gray-haired players including mutsohiko
nomura with stiff backs creaky knees and
labor breathing
the SFL players log under the blazing
sun a few of them stumble and wobble on
the pitch and 89 year old runs out of
breath
he asked to be substituted about 10
minutes into the match
unable to play the rest of the 15-minute
half
eldest of them all is shingo shio Zava
at an age of 93. he was once a race car
designer now he plays goalkeeper for
sfl's White Bear Team
he credits football for motivating him
to quit smoking and speeding up his
recovery after treatment for spinal
stenosis
shiozawa says the sport saved his life
and that if he hadn't played football he
would have been dead
after the game the teammates toast their
prowess with cans of beer in a ritual
familiar to many younger players you see
these players are pushing the boundaries
of active living in Japan
when I was a child men in their 50s and
60s were considered grandpas nowadays
all of us are doing this in our 80s it's
really quite a shock
Japan's average lifespan is inching up
the country has a population of 126
million a third of them are age 65 or
more Japanese life expectancy is now at
85 it ranks amongst the world's highest
elderly security guards and shopkeepers
have become a common sight when it comes
to football Tokyo created a division for
the 0 to 60 age group two decades ago
in 2012 the 0 to 70 division followed
five years later came the zero to 75
category
at that rate 0 to 80 was simply a matter
of time
people spirits and their physical health
are being enriched people are trying a
lot of things so that's why even Society
ages the elderly are healthy and this is
a good direction to be headed in
the elderly in Japan are not letting
their age get in the way
the middle-aged generation looks up to
them
it seems 80 is the new 50 in Japan
I mean I will ask you this
what was your most memorable memorable
meal
was it the food that made it special was
it the company
the restaurant perhaps the ambience
was it all of that
you see meals become experiences that
stay with you
especially if you are a foodie
and of course they don't always have to
be fine dining experiences
but if fine wine and dine is what works
for you this story would be of special
interest and the reasons are many
the food by the way is out of this world
quite literally
let me tell you what I'm talking about
how about having a meal on the edge of
space
sounds like a dream does it
you have some Fine Food some wine
and you are 15 miles above planet Earth
can you imagine that does that sound
like something you won't do and out of
the World experience
well here's how it is being made
possible
it's called a luxury pressurized capsule
it goes by the name Celeste
it offers passengers a chance to be up
in the air Aloft under a helium balloon
does that sound great there's more to it
as a result of this you get to be on top
of the world again quite literally you
get to see planet Earth
and how much will this meal cost you
the price starts at 120 000 Euros that's
around 105 000 pounds
the cefalco company was founded by
Winston farret the astias
its ambitious goal is to start flights
when in the year 2025.
and it basically is adding a French
Dutch French feel and experience to that
race which is only heating up as far as
other space tourism firms are concerned
there are of course other such companies
or as they are called strato tourist
companies
what do they promise
an unforgettable experience
the falto for example promises what is
called the overview effect
it invites people to feel the
extraordinary emotion that only 600
astronauts have felt so far and believe
it or not seats have already been
completely taken they're all booked
and of course the space tourism race
continues to expand the list is long
there's also the 1.25 million dollar per
ticket plan for Jeff bezos's blue origin
rocket
there's also Richard Branson's Virgin
Galactic space plane
let's just tell you a bit more about
Celeste
it plans to carry six passengers there
will also be two pilots
what is the duration going to look like
well it will take around 90 minutes
to reach an altitude of 15 miles
and then spend three hours there
enjoying that view
before coming back to planet Earth in
another 90 minutes
passengers will be enjoying Michelin
star Cuisine experiences
and there's also no rigorous training
that is involved
there's also Avaya get in a Japanese
startup that aims to offer gentle
Journeys to 15 miles altitude from late
this year aboard a small capsule
measuring five feet in diameter
it will carry a pilot and a passenger
and the price tag that comes with
admiring the view from the large windows
will be around 150 000 pounds
so clearly while the race to space
continues to heat up
so does the race to become a leader in
the field of space tourism
meanwhile a rare hybrid solar eclipse
over a remote town on Australia's West
Coast Drew thousands
especially those who believe in
astrology
eclipses are dramatic wild cards they
affect horoscopes but apart from the
stargazers and the enthusiasts there are
astronomers who keenly wait for such
experiences
our next report telling you more about
how such celestial events are rare
opportunities for scientists to unravel
the mysteries of our sun
it's the source of all life on our
planet the custodian of our solar system
not just heat and light its
gravitational power keeps the planets
moving in Symphony
foreign
but we know very little about our star
due to its distance and its blinding
light which obscures itself despite
being the brightest object in the sky
however there is one small window of
opportunity to peep closer and deeper to
know what the giant ball of fire is
hiding
that's what happened on Thursday when
parts of our planet witnessed a rare
Celestial phenomenon
a rare hybrid solar eclipse over a
remote town on Australia's West Coast

as the moon crossed the Sun for a minute
day became night and as the sun was
eclipsed temperatures dropped two
oh just so thrilled and felt so eerie
and I had shakes I just like so
surprised and just something like I'd
never experienced before really
everything went cold and yeah it's an
amazing thing to say and just feeling
like the change in the atmosphere like
being around all these people as well
and like kind of getting a sense of
their experience too and then hearing
that countdown over there with a crew
from Japan so yeah just so special the
hybrid solar eclipse was tracked from
the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean
the lucky few people either saw the
darkness of a total eclipse or a ring of
fire as the sun peaked from behind the
new moon
such celestial events happened about
once every decade the last one was in
2013 and we won't see the next before
2031.
but apart from the excitement and
Jubilation of witnessing the eclipse
there are scientists who wait keenly for
these once in a decade events
in such a natural eclipse the moon plays
the perfect occulta it blocks the
surface of the Sun through briefly and
this gives astronomers a rare Glimpse
very low into the solar atmosphere

the treaty was signed at the end of the

basically for scientific cooperation by
setting aside disputes over territorial
sovereignty

according to a report by the center for
strategic and International Studies
China wants to fill a major Gap in its
ability to access the continent
there are also concerns over China's
growing array of scientific polar
observation satellites the new facility
would provide it means to intercepting
other nations satellite Communications
it is estimated that the construction of
the station could be completed by 2024.
obviously Beijing has denied claims that
the station would be used for espionage
China would insist that it's purely
about scientific research but ultimately
that could be uh just
um a pretext for uh facilities that help

activities

gampi here's a quick look at what's
lined up for you on the show tonight
oh
my God
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
story tonight on gravitas is about
monkeys
don't worry you heard me right
monkeys have been making headlines and
have triggered a number of question
marks over the last few hours
this simply put is a story of Monkey
Business
it's a story of how Sri Lanka has come
up with a rather unique way
to repay Chinese debt
you know how
Sri Lanka could export hundred thousand
monkeys to China
why what's brewing and what is China
saying about this we tell you this and
more as a part of our cover story
tonight also on the show for you we tell
you how a leaked document has revealed
the story of China's supersonic drone
what can it do we discuss
India is gearing up to host the maiden
Buddhist Council we tell you about the
significance and what's on agenda

the all India Institute of Medical
Sciences in New Delhi we tell you how
and why Nepalese leaders have time and

we tell you what a new study says
[Music]
tonight is a rather strange one
it's about monkey business between Sri
Lanka and China
did you know Sri Lanka is exporting
hundred thousand monkeys to China
why you were of course asking
one explanation is that it wants through
this transaction to reduce its huge debt
to China
over seven billion dollars
we'll all know that Colombo does not
have the seven billion dollars but how
exactly is Colombo going to help solve
this gigantic Problem by feeding monkeys
to the dragon is the immediate question
that arises
but let's just start with this
these are talk makakis
this species has is found mainly in Sri
Lanka they are endangered and they
feature on the red list of iucn What's
called the international Union for
conservation of nature
and like we've been saying Sri Lanka is
reportedly shipping hundred thousand of
these monkeys to China
the obvious question of course is what
will China do with these monkeys
you know hundred thousand monkeys it's a
lot
well the official word is that the
monkeys would be put in zoos and how
many zoos
lunken media are quoting the country's
agriculture minister
as saying that China has requested for
these monkeys to be exhibited in Chinese
zoos
tell you what those are a sad place for
animals to be in but China has 18 zoos
and apparently five thousand monkeys
already in them they don't need any more
but the fate of these ill-fated hundred
thousand monkeys is not to end up in
zoos
but as specimens in labs
Chinese Labs where they will be
experimented upon injected with drugs
pricked with needles
you see China like many countries uses
monkeys to tres test drugs vaccines
Cosmetics Etc and as I speak China
desperately needs lab monkeys
you see in 2020 when the Wuhan virus
crossed borders and the world started
talking about China's wet Market the
wildlife business China was forced to
impose a ban on overseas Wildlife trade
to save face
and this in turn hurt the Chinese labs
in 2021 reports said China is running
out of lab monkeys to experiment upon
in 2022 Chinese mouthpiece the global
times reported that experimental monkeys
have become a hot commodity in China
not just that the report went on to say
that in the past five years the prices
of experimental monkeys have increased
about eight times in China eight times
adding that cost per s the cost per
primate has gone up to 150 000 Yuan that
is over 21
000 per monkey
the good thing is China has a leverage
on Sri Lanka so it gets monkeys for free
and not everyone by the way in Sri Lanka
is okay with this monkey business
the issue is dominating the public
discourse the executive director of Sri
Lanka Center for environmental justice
recently shared some startling facts
he told the people of Sri Lanka that as
per the globally accepted criteria for
the definition of zoos there are just 18
zoos in China
and what's more these those already have
around 5000 monkeys each
basically China's claim of exhibiting
the Lincoln monkeys does not make much
sense
Naveen the senike a former minister in
fact said these monkeys should quote
unquote only be sent abroad on Exchange
programs between zoos
and it is inhuman knowing fully well
that there is a great possibility that
they will end up in labs and be
subjected to torture
they are beautiful animals and have
every right to live a full life roaming
in their natural habitat
so the government of Lanka Sri Lanka is
facing quite
a strong opposition for its monkey
business with China One wonders how did
the thought of such a deal even come
about
you see for Colombo shipping monkeys is
a win-win situation
one it gets to please China
you know repay a portion of its debt in
kind
and two it gets to get rid of the monkey
Menace
what's that about
local media reporting that the
population of monkeys in Sri Lanka has
crossed 3 million and these animals by
the way have been terrorizing Farmers
according to Lanka's agriculture
Minister monkeys and giant squirrels
destroyed nearly 100 million coconuts
each year
which amounts to a loss of nearly 19.3
million dollars
last year in fact Sri Lanka removed
these monkeys from the protected list
allowing the farmers to kill them
and now Sri Lanka is planning to Exile
them
but here's something that you should be
noting here
Sri Lankan law does not allow for the
export of these monkeys or for that
matter they export of any live animals
but the debt-stricken country could be
looking to make an exception for China
which by the way is rubbishing the very
existence of such a deal
the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka has put
out this statement it says the reports
of monkeys being sent to China is
disinformation at best
adding that the concerned government
department is not aware of the request
for monkeys
well it does not add up then that lunken
ministers are issuing public statements
regarding this very deal
the country's transport Minister
recently clarified that the discussion
for monkeys is not between the two
governments but between the government
of Sri Lanka and a Chinese company which
Chinese company
probably some companies supplying lab
monkeys
but whatever this hush-hush monkey
business is about it is questionable on
multiple levels ethical moral
and of course let's not forget the cost
of the Chinese lab experiments
remember the Wuhan virus began with one
such experiment with bats
the next pandemic could involve monkeys
and we are staying with China for our
next story from monkeys we move to
drones
supersonic drones that can travel three
times the speed of sound
China could soon be deploying one such
drone
and how do we know this
because of certain leaked documents from
America's national geospatial
intelligence agency
in fact a Washington Post saying that
the document features satellite images
of these drones they are called
wz8 rocket propelled reconnaissance
drones
these drones in fact were spotted at an
air base in Eastern China some 560
kilometers from Shanghai
the question is how does China plan to
use these drones
to spy over ladakh to monitor everything
happening in the South China Sea or the
larger Indian Ocean region
well America has a theory here and the
league document reveals this very Theory
America saying that China has almost
certainly established a drone unit at a
base that falls under the Eastern
theater command it just so happens that
the Eastern theater command is that
branch of the pla that is responsible
for Chinese military action vis-a-vis
Taiwan
so are we to believe that the Chinese
supersonic drones will be deployed over
Taiwan
the leaked document also draws up a
possible flight path for this spy drone
here it is
and if you zoom in you will see that the
Americans believe that the age 6m Badger
bomber carrying the Drone will take off
from the Luan Airfield in China
and then head towards the Taiwan Street
and once it is over the street the Drone
will be released which will fly over
taiwan's yilan County
and then move to the heart of Taiwan
Dawn West and exit the Taiwan airspace
near the city of Tainan
American intelligence in fact also
believing that the spy drone will be
flying over South Korea
here's what is being reported about this
road one like I told you it can travel
at three times the speed of sound
two it can soar to an altitude of
hundred thousand feet
now just for your reference your
commercial planes fly at the height of
31 000 to 38 000 feet and this drone
will be flying at three times that
height
and it will be using rocket fuel
you know what they say
truth is the first casualty of War
and this phrase has never made more
sense than now
especially if you look at the Russia
Ukraine war
why am I saying this
a year since the war started the gap
between truth and falsehoods is growing
wider by the day
and the reason is quite simple
this after all is the first war to see
algorithms and Tick-Tock videos being
deployed alongside fighter planes and
tanks
so you know one has to navigate things
rather carefully
tread with caution to get an accurate
account of what really is is unfolding
because both sides have weaponized
information of course for the benefit of
their respective governments
and even specific battle stories are
questionable
for instance
the number of casualties
headlines in Western media saying that
Putin's forces are being humiliated that
they have suffered heavy casualties
and on the other hand the Russian media
saying that it is Ukraine that is being
humiliated it is Ukraine that has
suffered more casualties
and these rather wild variations also
extending to accounts of Destruction on
both sides
you know Ukraine saying that it has
destroyed more military equipment Russia
saying it has entirely weakened
Ukraine's Frontline defenses both sides
essentially saying the other is lying
and these differences illustrate the
kind of story each side wants to offer
to its own people
just to put it simply
Ukraine wants to encourage its people
through the tale of a successful
resistance
and Russia on the other hand wants to
convince its people through stories of
its military games
and neither side wants to talk about the
casualties and the damages in their
ranks
my point here is simple yes this is a
military battle
but it's also a battle of narratives
a war of disinformation
and here's more proof
you see for the last 12 months there
have been numerous reports on the
Russian president's health
you know the Western media has made all
kinds of claims right from how he is
suffering from blurred vision and
numbness of the tongue to how he is
using a body double due to his worsening
health condition
also to how he was seen limping during
his visit to Crimea
now these claims were wild as it is
what's worse they have now come up with
a new one
have a look at this report British
tabloids now saying that Putin may have
undergone treatment for thyroid cancer
and what's the basis for these claims
you wonder
and a parent's car that was spotted on
Putin's neck
and this Mark by the way was apparently
seen as Putin clasped a candle at a
midnight Orthodox Easter Cathedral
service in Moscow
the report saying that this Mark
represents proof of credible claims that
the Russian leader could be suffering
from thyroid cancer
now here's the thing the outlets
carrying this news have provided no
medical evidence to back their claims
you know they've just made these
allegations based on a mark on the
Russian president's neck
and what's worse for the last one year
they have made similar accusations from
time to time
yet the Russian president in Norway
seems to be in bad shape
so we cannot take every story on face
value we cannot confuse visibility with
transparency because we don't know how
much of the information is actually
being filtered modified or even
concocted
and you know what's worse
social media is complicating the matters
even further
and it's not a Level Playing Field
anymore it is entirely controlled by the
West
I'm of course talking about tech giants
like Twitter Facebook Google Apple these
companies these private companies seem
to have only openly aligned themselves
with the West
they are pushing one narrative and
restricting the other side of the story
Google has barred Russian State media
from monetizing content on its platforms
Apple has blocked RT and Sputnik from
its App Store everywhere outside Russia
Twitter for that matter is labeling all
posts by the Russian State media adding
a warning of thoughts on pro-russian
stories
and then we have meta
have a look at this report from last
year it says Facebook and Instagram are
allowing posts calling for violence
against Russians and their President
Vladimir Putin
so the point I'm trying to make is quite
simple the Western media in cahoots with
tech Giants are overstepping their
purpose they are deciding when it's okay
to call for violence and when it's not
Russia is the aggressor in the Ukraine
conflict yes
but you see the West's Monopoly on
information flow is making things rather
complex
on to India now it is all set to host
the world's first Global Buddhist Summit
the two-day event will begin on the 20th
of April
eminent Buddhist delegates from around
the world will be gathering in New Delhi
the Dalai Lama has already arrived in

the event is organized by India's Union
Ministry of culture and the
international Buddhist Confederation
prime minister Narendra Modi will
inaugurate it
so what is this Summit about what is on
the agenda and why is it important
the event is the first of its kind as
you might already know Buddhism was born
in India it is the land of the Buddha
the religion originated in bihar's
budgaya Village all the important places
connected to the life of the Buddha such
as rajgir and nalanda or in India
people come from around the globe for
pilgrimage to these places the summit
highlights the country's significance as
far as Buddhism is concerned for the
first time Global contemporary issues
will be discussed from a Buddhist
perspective
at such a scale the discussions will
follow the theme of responses to
contemporary challenges from philosophy
to practice
what exactly will be discussed peace and
Buddhism environmental crisis health and

Asia along with Gulf Nations
India also hosted a global Buddhist
congregation in November 2011. it
brought together the entire Supreme
hierarchy of the Buddhist world and
representatives of the Buddhist
Community the international Buddhist
Confederation was formulated through
this conference let's see how the
upcoming Global Buddhist Summit unfolds
Bureau report weon world is one
I'm from New Delhi we turn further north
to Punjab the 19th largest state of
India also known as the land of Five
Rivers for a long time the Specter of
drug abuse has haunted this state
but despite the efforts made by the
authorities
this narcotics crisis still persists
I'm going to start with this report on
the 16th of April officials from India's
border security Force recovered two
packets of Contraband drugs this was in
the city of gurdaspur
the packets were reportedly tied in a
single piece of cloth a hook along with
a nylon rope and a luminous strip was
also found attached to the consignment
officials say that this indicates that
the packets came from across the border
and here's what adds to their doubts
on the same day BSF troops recovered
three kilograms of heroin dropped by a
Pakistani drone near the international
border in punjab's Amritsar
and Reports say BSF Personnel heard the
buzzing sound of the Drone entering the
Indian Territory from across the border
and they immediately shot the Drone down
upon inspection they recovered three
packets of heroin attached to an iron
ring with a hook and four luminous
strips
now here's the thing it is common
knowledge that Pakistan pushes drugs
across the Indian border
in fact two years back a report said
that more than 80 percent of illegal
drugs entering India come from Pakistan
it revealed how Pakistan has an absolute
Monopoly in the subcontinent's narcotics
trade
in fact Pakistan's deep state is an
active proponent of this trade
the inter-services intelligence is
involved in pushing drugs into Punjab
and Jammu and Kashmir
in fact on multiple locations Indian
officials have intercepted these
shipments
in fact some of you might have heard of
The Golden Crescent
it is one of the biggest opium producing
regions in the world
it straddles Central and South Asia
basically Pakistan and Afghanistan
now we know that every producer needs a
middleman for Afghanistan that middle
man is Pakistan
it is a well-oiled Machinery the Opium
is grown near the Aflac Border in places
like Kandahar and Helmand
and from there the drugs are transported
through land to Pakistani ports
and there's a lot of tacit support from
Islamabad
you see the local Dawns get a free pass
the government officials often look the
other way
and so these drug shipments make it to
Sea
in rare cases foreign navies catch them
I can give you examples here
in August Sri Lanka sees a fishing
vessel with 290 kilograms of heroin
in September They seized two ships they
were carrying around 500 kilograms of
heroin
and the same month India also made a
huge drug bust around 3000 kilograms of
heroin was seized at the Mundra port in
Gujarat
but you see the full extent of this drug
trade has remained unknown for the
longest time and as it turns out the rot
runs much deeper
on the 18th of April the chief minister
of Punjab dismissed a senior cop over an
alleged Nexus with drug traffickers
this move came after three reports
prepared by anti-drug special
investigation Force which revealed how
the cop was helping the drug smugglers
by leaving loopholes in the
investigations
and what does that tell you
that Pakistan may be slipping drugs into
India
but there are certain rotten apples that
are helping facilitate this very crisis
let's now move on to the UK it is
gearing up for a special day the clock
is ticking the countdown has been
underway for a grand ceremony
the king's coronation
it is a ceremony that will be watched
around the world and we will be getting
you all the updates as and when they
happen
now the coronation is still days away
but it has been making headlines for
weeks now given the preparation that's
involved also the Curiosity that's
attached to the event
in the latest the ceremony is making
headlines for a gift for the king
what is the gift and who is it from
two shards of the True Cross
are a gift from Pope Francis to King
Charles
let me break it down for you basically
small shards of wood from what some
believe is the true cross on which Jesus
Christ was crucified have been
incorporated into a cross that will lead
King Charles's coronation procession
so these shots will be making their
presence felt during the grand
coronation ceremony they will be a part
of the coronation procession
and let's just tell you a little bit
more about the gift
the tiny fragments are shaped like
crosses one of which is one centimeters
and the other is only five millimeters
they have been set into the larger
Silver Cross behind a rose crystal
gemstone
the cross of Wales was gifted from
Charles to the church in Wales and will
be blessed by the Archbishop of Wales
Andrew June in uh in Andrew John in a
service
and when it arrives in London it will be
shared between the angelican and the
Catholic churches
according to reports it was made from
recycled silver bullion which was
provided by the Royal Mint in South
Wales
and includes a shaft of Welsh windfall
Timber and Welsh sleet
and let's just tell you a little bit
more about the True Cross
the True Cross is basically used for the
cross upon which Jesus Christ is set to
have been crucified
there is religious veneration attached
to it
and what about the story of the True
Cross its Journey
It is believed that the True Cross was
found by Saint Helena mother of
Constantine the Great this was during
her pilgrimage to the Holy Land
she discovered the hiding place of Three
Crosses this was sometime between 326
A.D and 328 A.D
one of which is said to Bear Jesus's
name
and fragments from the cross have been
shared among mostly Catholic
organizations around the world
in fact the earliest historical
reference to the veneration of the True
Cross was in the mid 4th century and by
the 8th Century there were legendary
details
about the history of the wood of the
Cross before it was used for the
crucifixion
as per traditions in fact three crosses
were found buried near the site of the
Holy Sepulcher
and in order to find out which was the
True Cross
the patriarch macarius of Jerusalem had
a sick person touch each of the three
crosses
so how was the True Cross discovered
well when the sick person was healed
upon touching it
but that's just a summary of how the
True Cross is believed to have been
discovered
there's more to the story the True Cross
is said to have been split into three
parts
one-third remained in Jerusalem
one-third was brought to Rome and one
third was taken to Constantinople
to make it impregnable
and that's not where the story ends the
story of the True Cross has a series of
disappearances attached to it multiple
disappearances it was hidden many times
later rediscovered
The Relic has seen multiple Journeys and
now it is making news as two shots of
the True Cross will be making their way
and their presence felt in London
Nepalese leaders have often relied on
India for Medical Treatments and this
time it is The Nepalese president Ram
Chandra podel
the leader has been airlifted to New
Delhi after he earlier fainted due to a
suspected infection
our next report getting you the complete
story take a look
Nepal's newly elected president Ram
Chandra paudel is scheduled to go
through advanced treatment for chest and
abdominal problems padell will be
treated at one of the best government
hospitals the all India Institute of
Medical Sciences in New Delhi so what
happened to the leader on Tuesday Podell
complained of suspected chest pain he
fainted
and was rushed to a hospital in
Kathmandu even though he was treated for
a chest infection doctors advised that
the leader be sent to New Delhi for
better and advanced treatment The
Nepalese president was then airlifted
and arrived in the Indian capital for
further treatment but this is not the
first time a Nepalese leader was in
India for Better Health Care Facilities
take the Nepalese prime minister pushpa
kamaldahal for example who is known to
visit a major Private Hospital in India
for routine medical checkups another
example is the former Nepalese prime
minister KP Sharma Oli who visited New
Delhi to undergo a kidney transplant in
2007. so what's the reason behind this
why do Nepalese leaders rely on Indian
Health Care Well India is home to one of
the world's largest Health Care Systems
despite the huge challenges it faces a
massive population being a part of the
problem the country provides free health
care to over 1 billion people
the nation has also seen significant
victories and accomplishments like
eradicating polio in 2011 and reducing
communicable diseases by a remarkable 50
percent between 1990 and 2016 and when
it comes to the covet pandemic era the
country's technological advancements
paired with a strong research base
helped lower the number of active cases
Nepal's Health Care system on the other
hand does not enjoy the same reputation
and there's a long way to go before the
country establishes a resilient Health
System
do you like to have a nice juicy drink
in the Summers
you must also have a favorite fruit
juice
well we may have bad news for some of
you juice lovers
studies show that drinking too much
fruit juice may increase the risks of
developing type 2 diabetes
so does this mean that we just stop
having fruits
absolutely not after all eating whole
fruits is actually quite healthy well at
least healthier than having the juice
that they contain
but why are researchers targeting fruit
juice
experts say that fruit juice contains a
large amount of sugar which can raise
the blood sugar levels rather quickly
and this spike in the sugar levels can
easily harm the people especially those
who already have a certain type of
diabetes
so let's just first see how many types
of diabetes exist
first comes type 1 diabetes which is an
autoimmune disease this is when the
immune system starts attacking the
healthy cells in the pancreas the place
where the body creates insulin
next is type 1.5 diabetes also known as
the latent autoimmune diabetes
this is similar to type 1 but only
occurs during adulthood
now comes type 2 diabetes which is the
most common type of diabetes
type 2 causes the body to become
resistant to insulin and this results in
the sugar building up in the bloodstream
studies show that having whole fruits is
much better than having the juice
what does the juice contain that we
don't know about
well let's talk about the calories a
regular glass of orange juice contains
nearly 100 calories as compared to the
60 calories in a whole Orange
next is fructose which is a form of
sugar
half a pint of fruit juice contains more
sugar than what the who recommends which
is ideally 30 grams for men and 24 grams
for women
you see fruit juice also lacks fiber a
whole fruit always contains more fiber
as compared to the juice and highly
processed juices which might not even
have any fiber
so should a person just stop consuming
fruit juice
of course we wouldn't advise that
why take away the juicy Joy from
anyone's life
all that the researchers recommend is to
tone down your consumption maybe you
only have a few glasses of juice a week
because fruit juice is not all bad for
the body it is a good source of vitamin
C drinking juice can remove certain
toxins from the body as well
it helps with the body's digestion
process it helps to lose weight but one
thing to remember is to moderate the
number of glasses that you are drinking
now why you regulate your fruit juice
intake there are more ways to stay safe
from diabetes
you could stop having foods with added
sugars sugars like corn syrup help boost
the shelf life of the bit goods and
beverages but they also end up
increasing the risk of heart disease and
diabetes
avoid foods with trans fatty acids
trans fats are commonly used to improve
the flavor of the processed foods but
have been linked to increased
inflammation and insulin resistance
trans fats can be so harmful that they
have been outlawed in multiple countries
and this one might be hard for some
people reduce your alcohol consumption
especially if you have diabetes
increased alcohol consumption can limit
your liver's ability to release glucose
and this might cause fluctuations in the
blood sugar levels and interfere with
certain diabetes medications
so are you up for the challenge to have
lesser glasses of fruit juice
but make sure you don't squeeze the pulp
out of your life
and it's that time of the year when most
people around the world file their taxes
a survey by travel app Hopper such as
more than 60 percent of its users expect
to spend their tax returns on travel
so before you file your returns have a
look at this story
thank you
[Music]
Paris
Dubai
Amsterdam
[Music]
Madrid
and Rome
these were the most attractive tourist
destinations of 2022
but in 2023 priorities have changed
travel is not a luxury anymore it is a
right for many
years lost due to the pandemic rising
cost of living and stagnant wages mean
Travelers are looking to get maximum
Buck for every dollar they managed to
save
April is a good time for most
Millennials and gen C workers who travel
more than their ancestors
because they are most likely to receive
income tax returns for their
overpayments
a survey by travel app Hopper suggests
more than 51 of its users are expecting
tax returns and of those 60 plan on
spending some or all of it on travel
and popular tourist hotels are running
at capacity all over the world however
there are some places that you could
still visit on a bargain that's because
the dollar has gained almost 300 percent
compared to currencies of some countries
countries that have become attractive
due to the local currency depreciation
are Argentina Brazil Norway Sweden and
India
a look at Hopper's app reveals a round
trip to these countries averages around
a thousand dollars but the added
advantage of traveling to countries like
India is the low-incountry travel cost
your dollar can get you 20 percent more
goods and services in India than it
could in 2019.
fewer report we on world is one
do you love
you love manicure session perhaps
experimenting with different nail paints
well you might want to slow it down
especially if you love gel nails
they might come in beautiful colors but
they have a dark side to them
they could give you life-changing
allergies
I know I am not exaggerating this
it's true gel nail manicures have their
own appeal they are beautiful they are
sophisticated One Salon wizard can keep
you covered for the next two or three
weeks
but at what cost
you might not know this gel nail
products contain harmful chemicals they
are called methocrates
you know how gel nail paints work right
for those and worse they are applied in
liquid form and then they are hardened
under a lamp
and this happens because of the
metacrylics
but did you know what else can happen
because of them
skin rashes peeling skin
your nail can loosen and could fall off
and in rare cases you may even develop
breathing difficulties
other severe symptoms include swollen
cuticles sores on your fingers eczema on
the face around your eyelids neck
basically wherever your nails touch your
body
and once you develop sensitivity to
these compounds there is no going back
it can invite trouble for you down the
line
and how is that
you see the Plastics used in gel
polishes are similar to those used in
Dental fillings joint Replacements
cataract treatment
and even in some diabetes treatment
isn't it too big a risk to take
but why does this even happen and why
has it become so prevalent
because of the lack of awareness and not
following the procedure properly
in fact toxicologists say that each gel
polish formulation is designed to be
cured by a specific lamp and if you
don't cure it for the right amount of
time under the right light
the Polish will not Harden it will stay
liquefied and you will be at a high risk
of developing an allergy
and the danger further increases if you
frequent a dodgy Nail Bar
you know you might find a salon that
offers drill manicures at half the price
of a luxury one but these professionals
might be mixing and matching different
gel products sourcing budget tubes or
not using the right kind of lamp
budget copy caps are produced as cheaply
as possible
sure they can help you save a few bucks
but they might be bombarded with harmful
chemicals
and then there is the recent rise of DIY
gel manicures
they became All the Rage when people
were stuck in their homes during the
pandemic
when nail salons were shot and people
had all the time to experiment
most uninformed users buy gel polish
from one place and their lamp from
another and they don't realize the
importance of carefully matching these
two
also when you paint your own Nails there
is a high chance of getting the product
on your skin
and this photo increases your chances of
developing an allergy
and even if you are doing all the things
right
buying the right products getting a
matching lamp
you might still be at a risk of Aging
your hands
and worse
developing skin cancer
because not only gel polishes but the UV
lamps as well are dangerous
ultraviolet light causes damage to the
skin cells
isn't that why dermatologists advise you
to wear sunscreen when you cure your
nails under UV lamps you put them in
close contact with harmful radiation
in a study published in the journal
Nature Communications researchers found
that exposing skin cells to UV light for
20 minutes killed around 30 percent of
the cells and those who survived
suffered DNA damage
the damaged patterns was similar to
those observed in melanoma patients
is that the price you would like to pay
for beautiful nails
but this does not mean you can never
treat yourself to manicures of course
occasional gel nails might not hurt and
not to forget there are hosts of
Alternatives in the market
there are dip powder manicures press on
nails as well and the good old
traditional nail polish
this I'll tell you what else made news
around the world time for gravitas

Wild's polar regions according to a new

increasing its Antarctic footprint this
is beijing's fifth station in the
southern Polo region China has
undertaken ambitious Expeditions and
developed world-class research
facilities it is now sought to develop
new shipping routes in the Arctic and
expand its research in Antarctica the
Western governments now worry that
beijing's increasing presence in the

to a report by the center for strategic

station is on the inexpressible island
to the South near the Ross sea it is
expected to include an observatory with
a satellite ground station which will
help China feel a major Gap in its
ability to access the continent
let's take a look at how the map looks
like
there you go so this is where the new
station will be created at the South
of the Antarctica
that's where the news station will be
you know constructed by China this
they're saying or this is how the news
station looks like let me just explain
to you how the news station looks like
it has a helipad it has a future Wharf
this is where the ships will be docking
and will be you know
putting their lines there it has a
future Logistics and Warehouse area it
has a future energy generation and
storage area it has a future research
Observer Observatory and also satellite
antennas area and the foundations for
main building being powered and also I
forgot to mention a helipad now the
report further outlined on how despite
providing Communications for China's
growing array of scientific polar

also provide equipment that can
concurrently be used for intercepting

identify new support facilities
temporary buildings a helicopter part
and foundations for a larger main
building and the 5 000 square meter

to collect signal intelligence over
Australia and New Zealand it is

2024.

Professor James DJ Brown is an
international Affairs expert and a
political analyst he's joining us from
Tokyo Japan Professor welcome to the
program
thank you very much
now let me just start by asking you is
this proof that China's uh is its proof
of China's expansionism with the
construction of this base in Antarctica
I think it's premature to see it's proof
but it's certainly something which
raises further concerns if as the
Chinese claim that it's purely about
scientific research well then that would
be fine after all other countries
including the United States and European
countries conduct research there but the
major concern is that will that really
be the case with China as a as a
one-party State as a country with no
clear divide between civilian and and
Military institutions the Warriors the
these facilities will actually just be
cover for activities of the people's
Liberation Army
Professor this building of this base has
sparked surveillance fears in the west
should the West be worried
well I think the the worry is that China
has a has a record of not actually
keeping to its word I think what comes
foremost to mind here is guarantees that
were given by President Xi Jinping that
China would not militarize the South
China Sea would not put military
capabilities on the islands that it's
building there and it clearly went
against that so the worry is the same
would happen here the China would insist
that it's purely about scientific
research but ultimately that could be
just
a pretext for uh facilities that help
with surveillance and also military
activities
now the artificial base is armed to the
teeth this is according to researchers
and also observation that has been made
so far with deadly Hardware including
missile aircraft flight hangers uh spy
planes what is China trying to prove
with this
well the the main point is the the China
now sees itself not as a regional actor
it sees itself as truly a global power
with interests in in all regions and so
for that reason it feels that uphold
it's its influence and its uh economic
power it's uh its military its Security
Services need to have reach that goes
well beyond China's Shores and even
extends into polar regions
finally Professor Beijing has plans to
have the world's most powerful military
is the world ready for China's wild
domination you think
well I I think not I think that if we
look at opinion poll data about China
over the last few years we can see that
it's turned significantly more negative
now yes
um China's rise China's economic
investment has been welcomed in many
parts of the world but in in many others
there's growing concern and growing
negative attitudes towards the the
Chinese Communist Party

now you might have your own arguments
sodas after all contain way more sugar
than this
how bad can bournvita be
but do soda brands Market their drinks
as health drinks
they do not
they aren't in a position to do that
there is overwhelming evidence against
that there is 10 grams of sugar in every
100 milliliters of Coke but bournvita
does claim to be healthy
in fact recently an Indian influencer
revanth himatsinka
slammed Bonita he claimed that the brand
was promoting dubious health benefits
his video garnered 12 million views when
Cadbury sent him a legal notice
the influencer had to take down his
video
but what he said is gaining traction
and that's why we're talking about this
tonight
a host of food experts ngos doctors have
now joined the debate
one could ask is this another Maggie
moment
and the answer of course is it's hard to
say
Maggie like most of you may remember was
banned in India back in 2015 about 300
million packs of Maggie were destroyed
because they contained excessive levels
of lead and monosodium glutamate
Maggie's parent brand and cadburys rival
Nestle also made some concerning
Revelations recently
in an internal document Nestle admitted
that over 60 percent of its food and
beverages were not as healthy as claimed
this included more than 90 percent of
its drinks
can you imagine that
Brands Market a whole lot of products as
health conscious
they cite medical testimonials which
more often than not turn out to be fake
soda companies took their sweet time
before revealing their true nature so
did cigarette brands through the 1950s
and 60s companies convince smokers that
cigarettes were not only cool but had a
calming impact as well
their sales peaked during that period
but once the public was made aware about
the lethal effects the sales plummeted
according to the U.S federal trade
commission's data cigarette sales in the
country have dropped by 70 percent since
1981.
while it takes a lot of time for impact
on sales to play out there is usually a
turning point a moment of realization
perhaps when the reality hits the
consumers
and their own sales gradually decline we

hello and welcome you're watching
gravitas with me Marty gampir here's a
look at what's lined up for you on the
show tonight
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
our cover story tonight is about the
Russia Ukraine war
who's winning that's a very good
question which still have no concrete
answer it has continued to dominate
Global discussions and headlines but one
thing is clear as of now
Ukraine is no longer the same
in fact it may have changed a bit too
much
given Vladimir Putin's latest moves
and what am I talking about
a line
that's right Russia has drawn a defense
line in Ukraine it is 800 kilometers
long it has trenches and dragon teeth
and tonight on gravitas we ask if this
new line is the new reality of Ukraine
how does it change things on the ground
also on the show for you tonight we have
been closely monitoring the latest
coming in from Sudan as tensions
escalate we get to the stories of
Indians stuck in the country amid
clashes between the Army and the
paramilitary forces
[Music]
trouble continues to mount for Rishi
sunak the lists of his troubles is long
we get you the complete Lowdown
China's secret police stations and its
web of surveillance America now has made
two arrests in relation to this secret
police stations
we'll go first shot shop
we tell you how and why the airline has
hit fresh turbulence
[Music]
you must have heard the phrase drawing a
line
what does it mean
well it means to create a boundary
a line which the others cannot cross
before the second World War
France Drew what was known as the magnot
line
that extended to 280 miles intended to
prevent a German invasion this defensive
line reinforced with concrete and steel
had to bunkers even gun batteries
trenches
minefields that was such technological
Marvels that France considered the line
to be impregnable
you know why I'm telling you this
because Russia has drawn one such line a
line that cuts Ukraine into two which
Russia intends to turn into a defensive
line which can never be breached by
Ukrainian forces
and tonight I want to tell you about
this very line
the Putin line
it is 800 kilometers long on one side
are territories that Russia has acquired
or plants to
and on the other side is what remains of
Ukraine
let me first show you where this line is
it stretches from luhansk to the Crimean
peninsula the line is drawn along the
nipro river it passes through donesk
zaporizia and Carson
and this is the same line by the way
that we have been showing you for weeks
now when telling you that Russia is
trying to split Ukraine into two along
the nepro
now we can tell you that Russia has
converted this line into a defensive
Fortress wall
let me tell you what it looks like
there are trenches
there are anti-dank ditches
also obstacles meant to hinder the
movement of vehicles
you know like dragon teeth
this is in fact what they look like
such mechanisms were used by the Germans
in the Second World War
South Korea has built something similar
on a beach in yonpion Island
in fact Russia has Dragon Deeds around
Mario fall we wish we had more visuals
to show you
but drones and cameras are yet to
capture the extent of Russia's
fortification we can tell you though
that in the towns of tenuwat Russia has
dug a kilometer long anti-tank ditch the
fourth in line is not thin some potions
feature bunkers along with concrete
parapets for snipers to hide behind
and then there are Barbed wires
minefields basically it is a multi-layer
defense system that Russia has put in
place
for Europe the Putin line is a blast
from the past
let's just go back to the second world
war like I was showing you earlier the
French built the magnet and the Germans
created the psych freed line or West
Wall the psych freed stretched over 630
kilometers as it so happened the Germans
simply went around the magnet
entering France through Belgium and the
psych freed could not prevent German
defeat in the Second World War
however will Ukraine be able to break
the Putin line is the immediate question
that arises one that we are asking
tonight
well analysts doubt Ukraine's capacity
you see the news of Russia's line of
defense being built first emerged as
early as November 2022.
with the UK's Ministry of Defense saying
and I'm quoting
Dragon's Teeth have likely been
installed between maripol and nikolsky
Village
I'm from Northern maripol to strike
cream Village
and around that time reports pointed out
that Ukrainian tanks which were mainly
designed during the Soviet era could be
damaged if they are driven over the
blocks
they meant the Putin line
so will it stop Ukraine's ambitious and
now out in the open secretive spring
offensive then
well unless its war machines are
upgraded overnight but what are the
chances of that happening and of the
West sending massive reinforcement
if you watch this show Daily then you
already have the answer
it seems and we can't say no more than
since Wars are never short of surprises
that Ukraine has made peace with its
reality
and nowhere is this as visible as in
Kiev the capital of Ukraine
what if I tell you that Kiev has
suddenly become quite a happening place
the kind of place it was before the war
started full of bars and clubs
the city's wartime curfew has been
relaxed bars are now allowed to remain
open till midnight clubs are hosting
weekend Day events
and there are secret bars operating well
into the night
in fact the head of Kiev City
Administration says the new and more
lenient curfew should help reduce the
social tension
you see there is a growing ground
confidence that Russians will not move
to take EF something that we have been
telling you for a while now
and today we can tell you that in all
probability the war will freeze at the
Putin line maybe there will not be an
official ceasefire but there could be an
unspoken understanding of the kind that
existed after Russia took Crimea
so there are attacks still being
recorded here and there
but as far as the larger picture is
concerned if you zoom out you will see
that Russia is now comfortable with the
gains that it has made and it will be
spending its Financial military as well
as strategic energy defending the gains
and you have this from the horse's mouth
by the way
Russia is not mincing words
situations
and these are some of the visuals from
that wizard
s
so this is Ukraine a Country Split along
the Putin line
and Russia is normalizing this new
reality for the country
our next story is from Sudan Africa's
third largest country located right at
the crossroads of sub-Saharan Africa and
West Asia
it has a history of military coups and
numerous instances of civil strife and
as I speak it is in the grip of yet
another spell of unrest
have a look at these images they are
from Khartoum Sudan's national capital
they show an explosion it unfolded on
Tuesday during a live television
broadcast
have a look
and have a look at these images now they
are from Monday night they show
anti-aircraft gunfire Illuminating the
Skies of cartoon
thank you
and look at these visuals now
they are from the 17th of April
they show Flames tearing through a plane
at an airport in the center of cartoon
what is all this about what exactly is
going on why is there unrest in Sudan
well at the heart of these clashes are
two men
Sudan's military leader Abdel fatah
al-burhan
and the commander of the parability
rapid support forces Muhammad hamdan
dagalu
you see until recently they were allies
they worked together to topple the
ousted Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir
but now things have changed and they are
involved in a bitter power tussle
a power struggle and an existential
fight for dominance
and why is that
let me break it down for you
you see ever since the coup in 2021 the
rsf led by Gerald has worked alongside
the Sudanese Army to help keep the
military in power
however tensions arose during
negotiations to integrate the rsf into
the country's military as part of the
plans to restore the civilian rule
there were differences on who would be
subordinate to whom under this new
hierarchy what would things look like
and this led to clashes between the
followers of both the leaders
these clashes have now culminated into a
civil war of sorts
for the last three days sounds of
gunshots have been ringing across the
city as huge fires in gulfed several
parts over 185 people have lost their
lives as a result of the unrest
at least 1800 have been injured since
the fighting started 1800.
the situation is so bad that people who
stay in cartoon say their life has
become a living hell
here are some voices
uh we're fine uh we're safe the power
has
out
that was something
you know it's like I don't even know
what it is anymore is it a
rocket-propelled gray grenade is that a
military strike I don't even know
yesterday uh morning around like nine or
so
um it sounded like there was a
thunderstorm of sorts and um we woke up
and went outside there were fighter jets
um and just sounded like gunshots and
um
just there there's a lot of chaos going
on
um and there's like smoke everywhere I'm
staying in my home the situation in the
morning is very bad but now the
situation is coming normal
but the outside the road uh all the
market close everything it's closed and
the electricity
cutting from yesterday until now
and no other
no electricity many trucks and many
soldiers
we will see many uh like helicopter now
all the people outside is afraid now I'm
talking to you and I hear many sounds of
the gun near to my house
so you know what's happening you know
why
why it's now 10
India
you see a huge number of foreign
Nationals are stuck in Sudan due to this
unrest this includes a significant
number of Indians as well
as per our estimates there are at least
3 000 Indians living in Sudan most of
them are unable to venture out due to
the fighting
and if I speak of specific instances
there are around 31 tribals from
Karnataka who are stuck there with their
supplies of food and water running out
they reportedly belong to the haki picky
tribe
this is a semi-nomadic tribe a lot of
members of this tribe apparently live
and work in Sudan
31 of them are now stuck due to the
fighting
the Karnataka State disaster Management
Authority saying that it has informed
India's external Affairs Ministry and is
following up with the Indian Embassy in
Sudan in order to speed up the
evacuation process
now remember Indians are not the only
ones stuck in Sudan citizens from
various countries who were working there
have been left stranded due to the
sudden crisis
have a look at this report now there are
around 3 000 people from Kenya stuck in
Sudan Kenya State Department for
diaspora Affairs is said to be
assembling all the logistics required to
evacuate them at the earliest
and that's not all have a look at this
report now
a number of Chinese workers and students
have been stuck in Sudan due to the
unrest Reports say they are at risk of
food shortages
and that beijing's Embassy in Khartoum
is showing no signs of evacuating them
in a nutshell what's happening in Sudan
has not only endangered Unity within the
country but also endangered the lives of
countless foreign Nationals who live and
work there
and here's hoping the country is
concerned are able to bring them back
safely as soon as possible
on to the UK now once again reaches an
oxen to be in trouble
what is it this time
well he is facing a parliamentary probe
why
over his wife akshara murthy's
shareholding in a child care company
it's a question of Declaration of
Interest let me break it down for you
sanak's wife owns shares in our child
care agency Kuru kids
she became a shareholder on the 6th of
March on the 15th of March the
chancellor of the exchequer Jeremy Hunt
presented his 2023 spring budget
and among other things
new child care policies were introduced
new child care workers were given an
incentive of 746 dollars
but this was doubled to nearly fifteen
hundred dollars under one condition
that the child minder needs to join via
an agency
and guess what
koru kids was one of the six agencies
involved in the scheme
Jeremy Hunt has given taxpayers money to
akshita's company former Health
secretary Matt Hancock also has a stake
in koru kids
naturally rishisanak faced questions
over the new policy on the 28th of March
in fact a labor MP quizzed him asking if
he had any interest to declare
and this is what sanak replied saying
I'm quoting no all my disclosures are
declared in the normal way
meaning he did not have any selfish
interest to declare
and hours later koru kids bosses
attended a Downing Street reception
and it doesn't take a genius to join the
dots
koru kids would benefit from the new
policy and so would akshita Murthy the
prophet would ultimately trickle down to
the sanak family's bank accounts
if anything the investigation is an
embarrassment for sanak
you see he banged the drums of Integrity
accountability he made promises about
maintaining transparency
and now the leader claims he has rightly
declared his interests that he has
mentioned his wise minority's sake in
koru kids
where and how
in a list of ministerial interests that
is yet to be published
so why did sanak hash it up in front of
the liaison committee
he never mentioned it when he was being
grilled by the empties why was he silent
then
you see he did not just omit an interest
but told the committee that he did not
have one
and now after facing the heat he goes
back on his words and says that he has
declared it also note that he has said
the list of interest is long overdue it
hasn't been updated for almost 12 months
sonak and Murthy are the richest ever
occupants of 10 Downing Street murthy's
father is a co-founder of Indian I.T
giant Infosys
she owns about 0.9 percent of the
company which is worth nearly 600
million dollars the couple in fact has a
history of tiptoeing around the rules
remember how they faced criticism when
sanak was the Finance Minister
Murthy had a non-domissile tax status
this meant that she did not pay tax in
the UK for her earnings overseas
after public backlash and name calling
Murthy ultimately gave up the status she
agreed to pay British tax on her Global
income as well
and how can we forget the Twitter storm
over her 47 teacups
in other words the narc list of troubles
running long we have been telling you
this for a while now the cost of living
is soaring in the UK
but recently it has reached New Heights
and it's not just energy or interest
rates
but the bread the food Staples their
prices have also increased by up to 80
percent in some British shops
according to the consumer Group which
forage oats cost 35.5 percent more than
they did last year prices for skimmed
milk are up by 33.6 percent cheddar
cheese costing
the cost of which has risen by 28.3
percent butter 23.2 percent more
expensive wide bread almost 22 percent
the analysis of the government data by
labor also found some dramatic increases
the price of carrots for example is up
80 since 2019. Tomatoes by 142
cauliflowers by a staggering 161 percent
so you see these are very basic things
that we have that we are talking about
food items that are taken for granted on
the dining table elsewhere
and do you know what this means
that the poorests are being hit hardest
by inflation because like other luxury
items food Staples are not something
they can cut back on
the less privileged britons are
suffering the country is reeling with
worker strikes as well almost 200 000
hospitals and medical procedures were
canceled last week why is that
because of the junior doctor strikes
over 27 000 staff workers refused to
show up to work nurses are again gearing
up to strike on the 30th of April
britons are starving for Essentials
and what is sonak's government doing
announcing Child Care policies with
hidden selfish interests it seems
India is again in the spotlight and this
time it has promises promised to send
more humanitarian Aid to Afghanistan
while countries like Pakistan aim to
lash back at the country
our next report getting you the complete
story
India has signed an mou with the UN
world food program to send 10 000 tons
of wheat for the people of Afghanistan
the mou marks the fifth tranche of food
assistance that India has promised to
provide this is notable as experts have
commended India's prompt response in
rendering humanitarian assistance to
countries in need last year the world
food program arranged support to feed 23
million food insecure people across
Afghanistan India had contributed a
staggering forty thousand tons of wheat
the nation's humanitarian efforts have
not gone unnoticed the country director
of the wfp in India Elizabeth fauri has
shown gratitude towards the Indian
government and said that the nation's
support has been a Lifeline for families
in need India has not only been
consistent in providing food assistance
but also stands as a crucial part of
wfp's Mission to assist Millions across
Afghanistan
meanwhile India's neighboring country
Pakistan has threatened Afghanistan with
cross-border strikes with the U.S also
planning to support Pakistan in such
operations such instances could
eliminate any chance of the two Nations
forming good ties
this comes while India sets an example
of how Nations should prioritize the
people of Afghanistan reeling under
severe crisis
India continues to focus on humanitarian
Aid
which not only helps with supplying food
assistance and medical supplies but also
providing salaries for health care
workers Educators and civil servants
this is the type of Aid that the Afghan
food crisis demands right now in which
over 19 million people that's nearly
half of the total population are
affected by severe hunger
this crisis is the result of extended
droughts political instability and the
covid-19 pandemic will countries like
Pakistan continue to prioritize violence
over humanitarian Aid
Bureau report we on world is one
our next story is about police stations
that are being run by China
what's the big deal about that you
wonder
well these are no ordinary police
stations that I'm talking about I'm not
talking about police stations run by
China on Chinese soil
these are secret police stations that
are run by China in other countries
are you confused how does that even work
out
well don't be confused this is China we
are talking about after all and as we
have been telling you right here on
gravitas China's murky web of
surveillance runs far and wide
these secret police stations run by
China in fact are spread out around the
world
just for a quick background here
have a look at this
an investigation by Safeguard Defenders
blew the lid off China's overseas police
stations
this 2022 investigation published by the
spain-based advocacy group reported that
China had set up the so-called overseas
service stations
what was the motive what is the dragon
trying to do now through these covert
setups
well the investigation found that these
stations illegally worked with the
Chinese police to pressure fugitives
quote unquote to return to China
I'll get to that in just a bit let's
first tell you what happened over the
last few hours in the latest U.S federal
agents have arrested two men for
allegedly operating a Chinese secret
police station
where you ask
in the buzzing Lanes of Manhattan in
America to be precise in the Chinatown
District of Manhattan
in fact the prosecutors say this is part
of a Crackdown on beijing's alleged
targeting of dissidents
who are these individuals who were
arrested
Lou Jian Wong and Chang Jinping
they face charges of conspiring to act
as agents of China's government without
informing U.S authorities
and obstruction of justice
according to the prosecutors
Lou and Chen led a non-profit
organization that lists its Mission as
providing a social Gathering Place for
people from China's fujian province
in fact their New York operation
occupied a full floor in a non-descript
building in Chinatown near the Manhattan
Bridge
before it closed in the fall of 2022 the
site was being used at the very least
quote unquote for government services
like helping some Chinese citizens renew
their driver's licenses
it was also used
for more quote-unquote Sinister
activities
in fact in 2022 Lou helped open the
so-called police station he was asked by
China's government to locate an
individual living in California who was
considered a pro-democracy activist
in 2018 Lou had sought to persuade an
individual considered a fugitive by
China to return home
prosecutors said Lou and Chen admitted
to the FBI that they deleted their
Communications with a Chinese government
official
and the FBI director
has gone to the extent of telling a U.S
Senate committee in November that he was
very concerned about the presence of
such stations in U.S cities
so what does China have to say about
this
well no surprises it says it's up to
nothing wrong
the Chinese foreign Ministry
spokesperson Wong when bin has disputed
U.S claims of a Chinese secret police
station in New York According To Wong
China maintains a policy of
non-interference in other countries and
these alleged police stations do not
exist
let me repeat according to him China
maintains a policy of non-interference
in other countries
what a joke right
a policy of non-interference and China
don't quite sit well in the same
sentence do they
well the U.S is quite clear it has been
ramping up its probes in fact into what
it calls transnational repression by U.S
adversaries like China to intimidate
political opponents Living in America
the top federal prosecutor in Brooklyn
has said that America cannot and will
not tolerate the Chinese government's
persecution of pro-democracy activists
who have sought refuge in the country
and that's not all prosecutors on Monday
unveil charges against 34 Chinese
officials for allegedly operating a
troll farm and harassing dissidents
online
this includes disrupting their meetings
on U.S technology platforms
and the story does not even end here
have a look at this report now
Chinese Nationals engaged in online
fraud arrested from Sri Lanka according
to this report at least 39 Chinese
Nationals have been arrested
meanwhile Sri Lanka's relations with
other countries are going well
I'm talking about its ties with India
what's happening there
have a look at this report
it says and I'm quoting from it The
Reserve Bank of India and National
payment Corporation of India are in
early talks with Thailand Sri Lanka and
other countries to extend the reach of
the unified payments interface that's
Ubi
let me break it down for you as you
would be aware UPI is a system that
basically helps with having multiple
bank accounts in a single mobile
application this puts together multiple
banking features
it enables easier Merchant payments so
on and so forth
and these talks with countries like Sri
Lanka and Thailand for UPI enhancement
is a major boost for India's UPI soft
power
remember earlier in February prime
minister Narendra Modi and his Singapore
counterpart also made a significant move
by putting in place cross-border
linkages through the fast payment
systems UPI and Singapore's pay now
and things are moving forward with the
linking UPI with other countries payment
mechanisms as well
but to put it simply this will basically
help users make payments faster
and lower the cost fund transfer
on to the world of Aviation now
we'll go first go out of business
if you have bought a ticket to a go
first flight what are the chances that
your flight will be canceled
well some of you may have already
received notifications involved
informing you of go first cancellations
be it of its flight to the Maldives
Mumbai or Ahmedabad
now this particular video went viral
last week
after Gophers canceled its flight from
Goa to Mumbai reportedly 10 minutes
before departure
[Music]
and while flight cancellations are not
new or rare go first has been raising
some serious questions with its fast
increasing frequency of cancellations
one of the questions being is the
airline going out of business
we'll go first stop Flying
and this question became louder
following reports claiming that the
vadia group is trying to sell stick or
exit go first
the vadia group is an Indian business
conglomerate
the group owns textile company Bombay
dying Britannia limited also low-cost
Airline go first
a Reuters report quoted a force as
saying the wadia group is reluctant to
invest more until the issue with pnw is
resolved after infusing around 30
billion rupees or 366.2 million dollars
in the last 15 months to keep the
airline afloat
you see the last 15 months have not been
the best for go first
now just to give you a quick background
golfas was founded in 2005. back then it
was called go air
there was just one aircraft and Airbus
A320
This Plane would fly from Mumbai to
Ahmedabad
sometimes to Goa or coimbatore
over the years go air was rebranded new
sectors were introduced and by the time
the Wuhan virus pandemic hit in 2020
Gophers was flying to 27 destinations in
India
and to nine destinations outside India
including Phuket and Mali
the pandemic changed this airline's fit
you see the go fast fleet has only
Airbus a320s
90 percent of the fleet is powered by
Pratt and Whitney jet engines
and many of these engines encounter
technical error some needed repair some
needed maintenance
but BMW was not able to send
replacements
why is that
because of supply chain related issues
labor shortages
and problems because of the Russia
Ukraine war
as per the Gophers contract with Pratt
and Whitney the latter is supposed to
provide a spare engine within 48 Hours
of an aircraft getting grounded because
of a faulty engine
when pnw failed to keep its end of the
promise go first had to ground around 28
of its 59 planes
by March 2023 go first was operating 27
fewer flights than March 2022
Reports say go first has asked Raytheon
Technologies to compensate for the
losses but the latter has refused
go fast is now reportedly planning to
take the legal route and Sue the
American Giant
but will that change the situation on
the ground
you see 28 of its 59 planes still remain
grounded
and a big question mark continues to
hang against the airline's future
is Gophers going down for no fault of
its own
and what exactly are its options now
you see low-cost carrier Indigo also has
had to ground a lot of its a320s because
of the same pnw Supply issue
we are looking at some 34 Indigo planes
but Indigo has a much larger Fleet some
300 plus planes so the grounding has not
really impacted Indigo as much
if anything Indigo has only increased
its domestic Market
according to the latest data from the
dgca or the directorate general of civil
aviation Indigo has increased its
domestic share from 53.8 percent to 55.7
percent
and go first on the other hand saw its
market share fall from 9.8 to 7.8
percent and in the last few months the
airline has been forced to stretch the
remaining Fleet to permissible limits
and even then it has not been able to
avoid cancellations
is there a solution in sight
well none immediately
you see when prattened Whitney officials
visited India in November they said that
they expect the crisis to be resolved by
early 2023.
it is mid-april and nothing really has
changed as part of the wadia group and
go first are concerned they are denying
reports of selling Stakes or off the
promoters exit
but that has not been enough to douse
the passenger fears and the fire
the prime minister of the UAE Sheikh
Muhammad bin Rashid al-maktoum have made
headlines for his initiative to feed the
world's most underprivileged populations
his campaign is witnessing massive
growth and has received over four
billion dollars in contributions to feed
the poor in the holy month of ramzan
this is what Sheikh Muhammad tweeted
when announcing the initiative I'm
quoting
our goal is to provide hundreds of
millions of meals sustainably for
decades through the endowment project
and what exactly is this initiative all
about
well it's called the 1 billion meals
endowment campaign
and how does the meal campaign work
the initiative is based on a food
endowment fund
the fund is open to donations from
various institutions and works towards
contributing towards International
efforts to beat food crises all around
the world
especially in countries struggling with
food insecurity
and the main focus of the food endowment
fund is to support victims of conflicts
survivors of natural disasters
and people experiencing extreme poverty
the 1 billion meals endowment campaign
will also align with the United Nations
sustainable development goals for 2030.
so how much contribution has the
campaign received
emirati businessman Abdul Rahim
al-zaruni has recently contributed 1.3
million dollars in an effort to develop
Sustainable Solutions to Fight Hunger
crises
Gulf Islamic Investments our financial
services firm announced its contribution
of 2.7 million dollars for the campaign
the Arab India spices group a pulse
Processing Company contributed a total
of 1.3 million dollars
the campaign has a very Democratic
approach when it comes to contributions
it has open doors for institutions
companies businessmen even individuals
to come and donate
but this is not the first time Sheikh
Muhammad has launched such an initiative
the latest campaign is an extension of
his previous food Aid drives
he launched two previous campaigns the
first campaign was called the 10 million
meals endowment campaign followed by the
100 million meals campaign
Sheikh Muhammad kept leveling up his
game to feed as many poor and launched
one billion meals for the holy month of
Ramadan this year
so what if you want to make a donation
for the campaign
there are several donation channels the
campaign has its main website there is
also a dedicated call center which has a
toll-free number contributions can be
made through bank transfers donations
can also go through Via SMS by texting
the word meal
the 1 billion meals endowment campaign
has already gathered billions of dollars
and seems to be gaining traction among
the wealthiest
will this campaign be able to create a
difference and save Millions from Hunger
let's move on for now
bonwita is a household name in India
it might have been a part of your
childhood as well
after all the drink gives boring milk a
tasty twist
children get hooked on to its sugary
taste parents buy it because it is
endorsed as a health drink
Cadbury is one of the most trusted
brands in India bonvita is given to
children like a healthy [ __ ] auction
among many other benefits the drink
promises a steady punch of vitamin D
vitamin B2 B9 B12 fibers and whatnot
but is it really as healthy as Cadbury
claims
as for its own label every serving of
bournvita contains 7.5 grams of sugar
and this corresponds to one and a half
teaspoons of sugar
do you know what is the recommended
sugar limit for a child
six spoons
if a kid drinks bournvita milk twice a
day which most mothers strive to do half
of their daily quarter of sugar will be
met
do you think a child would give up
candies chocolates fruit drinks simply
because they are having more meter
that's a question that is being asked
do children really need this additional
sugar in their daily diet
now you might have your own arguments
sodas after all contain way more sugar
than this
how bad can bournvita be
but do soda brands Market their drinks
as health drinks
they do not
they aren't in a position to do that
there is overwhelming evidence against
that there is 10 grams of sugar in every
100 milliliters of Coke but bournvita
does claim to be healthy
in fact recently an Indian influencer
rayvanth himatsinka
slammed Bonita he claimed that the brand
was promoting dubious health benefits
his video garnered 12 million views when
Cadbury sent him a legal notice
the influencer had to take down his
video
but what he said is gaining traction
and that's why we're talking about this
tonight
a host of food experts ngos doctors have
now joined the debate they are
amplifying the message of bonvita being
a possible health hazard
one can ask is this another Maggie
moment and the answer is it's hard to
see
Maggie like most of you may remember was
banned in India back in 2015. about 300
million packs of Maggie were destroyed
why is that because they contained
excessive levels of lead and monosodium
glutamate
Maggie's parent brand and Cadbury's
rival Nestle also made some concerning
Revelations recently in an internal
document Nestle admitted that over 60
percent of its food and beverages were
not as healthy as claimed this included
more than 90 percent of its drinks
can you imagine that
Brands Market a whole lot of products as
health conscious
they cite medical testimonials which
more often than not turn out to be fake
soda companies took their three time
before revealing their true nature so
did secret Brands through the 1950s and
60s companies convince smokers that
cigarettes were not only cool but had a
calming impact as well
their sales peaked during that period
but once the public was made aware about
the lethal effects the sales plummeted
according to the U.S federal trade
commission's data cigarette sales in the
country have dropped by 70 since 1981.
you see the big food live does not have
legs well it takes a lot of time for
impact on sales to play out there is
usually a turning point a moment of
realization
perhaps when the reality hits the
consumers and thereon the sales
gradually decline

arrested two New York residents for
allegedly helping establish a secret
Chinese police station in Manhattan's
Chinatown now this is the first time
such a police case has been filed and
action taken by the United States they
face charges of conspiring to act as
Chinese government agents without
informing U.S authorities and also
obstruction of justice 61 year old luge
young won and his 59 year old companion
Shen Jinping were produced in a Brooklyn
Federal Court on Monday they were
released on bond later U.S prosecutors
said that the accused set up a secret
police station at the behest of fuju
branch of the ministry of public
security China's national police force
the station was allegedly closed in the
fall of 2022. officials allege that this
was the building being used by the
accused as a secret police station U.S
officials said that the accused main job
was to help track down and harass
dissidents from China and as for the
officials here they also admitted to the
FBI that they had destroyed all evidence
of their communication with the Chinese
official
foreign
typical officers the MPS officers who
have been charged today are not focused
on preventing crime rather the
complaints charge these MPS officers
with engaging in transnational
repression
schemes targeting members of the Chinese
diaspora community in New York City and
elsewhere in the United States
and as shown in these complaints the MPS
has repeatedly and flagrantly violated
our nation's sovereignty including by
opening and operating a police station
in the middle of New York City
let's also take a look at the reactions
that have come and reacting on this
David Newman the U.S principal Deputy
Assistant Attorney General for National
Security had this to say efforts of the
People's Republic of China's government
to export authoritarian methods to
stifle free expression in the United
States is a threat to American democracy
that we will not abide
on Monday prosecutors also unveiled
another set of charges against 34
Chinese officials they've been accused
of operating what they call a troll farm
and harassing dissidents online by
disrupting meetings or newest technology
platforms
but what exactly is a troll Farm now a
troll Farm it's an organized group of
individuals on the internet trolling
people with the aim to disrupt an online
community troll Farms conduct
disinformation propaganda campaigns by
creating fake social media profiles and
targeting a particular Community now all
the 34 accused of creating this troll
Farm are absconding as per the charges
the troll Farm had created thousands of
fake social media accounts to Target
Chinese dissidents through online
harassment and threats
these kind of behaviors should not be
tolerated it's about our sovereignty
it's about our day of life it's about
our freedom you know in America people
should not be fearful of speaking their
mind whether it be the critical views of
our own government or any foreign
government for that matter the
abrasiveness
um and the their willingness to take
that kind of uh actions on American soil
is bone chilling
well let's now take a closer look at the
apparent web of these secret Chinese
PlayStations we'll also try and answer
some pertinent questions about its
operations as well the first big
question how many south secret police
stations are being operated by China
across the world well according to a
report by Spanish organization Safeguard
Defenders 54 such secret Chinese
stations were reported in the year 2021
a year later in December 2022 reportedly
48 more stations emerged after they were
exposed in the Netherlands in Spain last
year around 13 countries then began
probing this matter however China denied
the allegations and claimed that these
are not police stations but merely
service centers for expatriates who need
help with administrative work like
renewing certain documents China has
also claimed that these were set up in
response to the covet pandemic however
the reality on ground is very different
now as per officials they claimed that
these secret police stations are set to
monitor Chinese dissidents and refugees
officials claim they're also used to set
up troll Farms according to safeguard
Defenders over 100 such police stations
secret police stations have been set up
in at least 53 countries across the
globe including the United States Canada
Brazil Argentina UK the Netherlands and
Italy
several South stations have been
reported in cities across the globe from
Quebec and Toronto in Canada New York
and the United States Buenos Aires in
Argentina to Europe to European cities
like Paris Rome Glasgow and Amsterdam
these Chinese police stations across
continents have emerged secret police
stations have also been reported in
Serbia Romania and even the United
Kingdom however when the allegations
emerged in December 2022 the Chinese
Foreign Affairs Ministry reacted
and rubbished these charges China said
I'm quoting here we hope relevant
parties stop hyping it up and creating
tensions it also added that using it as
a pretext to smear China is unacceptable
for more on this we're now joined by
Jean-Pierre from Hong Kong Emeritus
professor of political science at the
Hong Kong Baptist University and has
also worked at the French national
Center for scientific research so thank
you so much for joining us
pleasure now my first question to you
two New York residents have been
arrested for allegedly running these
covert Chinese police stations what's
your take on the situation and also what
would you say are the objectives of such
operations
well I think is the first time that uh
such uh operation has been conducted in
the United States and even in the world
we as you indicated in your previous
comment you there's been a number of
outpost uh
Chinese security outposts around the
world in particular where Chinese
communities are rather large like in
Europe and in in America now the we
don't know much about the objective of
of these Outpost one is to uh as it has
been claimed by the chain authority to
serve the Chinese Community to better
protect it at the same time to take
control of it or to better control this
community and all the Chinese Nationals
we were living in particular countries
so it's it's a really a new development
because in the past actually people
checking Chinese communities were in the
Chinese embassies themselves so why do
they need to
set up such outposts outside of the
embassies in order to you know control
and and reach out the community around
the world and I think it's part of the
the new uh you know the new State uh
which has been uh consolidated by by
ceiling pain which is uh which is aimed
at controlling China Chinese interests
around the world wherever they are
also from what we know so far China of
course as I mentioned earlier as well
claims that such offices are run by
volunteers and to be fair the station
did provide some Chinese government
services like renewing documents again
as I mentioned but they did fail to
register with the justice department as
agents of a foreign government now even
if we were to entertain this
plausibility how do you assess the
impact of this on U.S based dissidents
or in any other country for that matter
wow I think it's uh it's troubling
because it means that the Chinese State
or the party state is willing to more
closely control its Nationals overseas I
mean there are a number of reasons for
that one is corruption and you know the
Fox Hunt operation which is which has
targeted The Runaway uh business people
or corrupt officials and but but of
course it's also aimed at a better
keeping in check any kind of descending
voice
from Chinese abroad
you know Han Chinese or natural minority
people like the Wego we know that the
Wego also very much watched by the
Chinese officials outside of China so uh
I think the idea is to uh by the Chinese
state is too high a number of local
Chinese uh and we're going to be paid to
serve the Chinese interest foreign
nationality they may be more uh you know
more in much more integrated local
communities and they can better serve
the interests of the of the Chinese
State and um and that's clearly part of
uh you know the Communist parties the
United phone strategy which is which are
you know outside of China has a big big
department in China with overseas
Chinese and of these Chinese communities
right now Professor also what would you
say could or should be done to hold
Beijing accountable what does this mean
for China in the International Community
yes I think I think a number of
countries have already dismantled those
outposts like the Netherlands as you've
mentioned I know there are a few in
Falls in Germany and elsewhere I think I
think it's what the FBI has been doing
is a very kind of a standard operation
which I'm sure has been also conducted
by other uh internal security services
around the world in between in Western
Europe
all right Professor thank you so much

Atlantic all 228 people on board were
killed in this crash the verdict has
left families of the victims deeply
disappointed our next report gets you

in the early hours of the 1st of June
2009 Air France flight 447 seemingly
vanished Into Thin Air
the flight from Rio de Janeiro on Route
Paris had 228 people on board the flight
disappeared in a radar Dead Zone over
the Mid-Atlantic
the Airbus A330 had vanished without a
distress call for two years the world
was left wondering what happened to the
plane
finally in May 2011 the search teams
found the black box on the ocean floor
at a depth of more than 4 000 meters
but the Black Box only revealed a story
that was more prosaic and more
inexplicable than anyone had imagined
the official investigation found that
multiple factors contributed to the
crash
this included pilot air and the icing
over the external sensors called pitot
tubes an Associated Press investigation
at the time found that Airbus had known
about the Fatal flaw since at least
2002.
the crash had a lasting impact on the
industry leading to changes in
regulations for AirSpeed sensors and in
how the pilots are trained the crash
also triggered a legal battle it took 13
years for the case to reach the court
and after a two-month trial a French
Court acquitted the companies of
manslaughter charges sobs broke out in

we all believed but unfortunately we
came out with nothing because our dead
are really dead they died for a second
time today you see I am very sad I feel
sick in my stomach I'm disgusted equally
the three judge panel ruled that there
was not enough evidence of a direct link
between Decisions by the companies and
the crash
unusually even State prosecutors argued
for acquittal saying that the
proceedings didn't produce enough proof
of criminal wrongdoing by the companies
the verdict is very hard to understand
for the families we told mistakes were
made or not made Airbus and Air France
were not found criminally responsible
you saw how the verdict was read it was
tortured
prosecutors put the owners primarily on
pilots who died in the crash
Air France said the full reasons for the

the first in the country's history to be
indicted and then arraigned during an
interview
to the Fox News Channel program tackle
Carson tonight
he in fact said that if he's convicted
of a crime then he'll still run for the
presidential elections in 2024 listening
to what Donald Trump have said
is there anything they could throw at
you legally that would convince you to
drop out of the race if you get
convicted in this case in New York
no I'd never dropped something I think I
wouldn't do it
in the interview the former president of
course raised its doubts if Joe Bon
would in fact seek a re-election to the
White House in the forthcoming U.S
presidential Pawns
I don't think he can
but say what you want they didn't expect
him to get it yeah people could say
he won an election you know they it
always goes I got the most votes of any
person any sitting president in history
I was told if I got 15 million less I
couldn't lose
the Donald Trump in the interview also
spoke about his experience at the court
the former U.S president said that his
experience at his arrangement in New
York last week was just horrible
and Trump's first ever interview since
his indictment in consequent argument
has come after the 76 year old Trump
pleaded not guilty to all 34 counts of
felony that have now been leveled
against him
prosecutors in Manhattan accused Donald
Trump the first sitting of former U.S
president to face criminal charges of
trying to conceal a violation of
election laws during his successful 2016
presidential campaign
prosecutors have accused him of
orchestrating payments to two women
before the elections to suppress the
publication of their alleged sexual
encounters with him
the Trump was arrested and then charged
with 34 counts of felony over hush money
payments before the 2016 presidential
election
meanwhile the Republican Presidential
FrontRunner has also stated that the
United States has lost its influence in
the world since the time that he stopped
being the president
but the question of course enough is
will Donald Trump's
campaign for the top job in America be
damaged due to the indictment now
indictment or even a conviction does not
legally bar Donald Trump from running
for the president's job according to the
U.S Constitution for a person to run for
the country's presidency there are only
three requirements for the candidate
which includes a natural born citizen
the candidate has to be at least about
35 years old and a U.S resident at least
14 years however it may be difficult for
an indicted candidate to win votes and
what sort of a impression that would of
course leave on the minds of the people
is something that we need to wait and
watch for
is tracking the story very closely for
us and she's joining us live on this
broadcast from New York Susan we've
heard from the former president of the
United States of America in this
interview that he of course gave to his
favorite News Channel if one could so
put it now he's in fact gone on and said
that irrespective of what happens with
the court proceedings he is going to be
in the running for the top job in the
United States
foreign
[Music]
to give some context during that
interview he talked about how divide
Administration has
criticized by the administration's
domestic and foreign policies and said
that he would be the best person running
for that job that he didn't he didn't
really talk about other people or
potential other nominees running against
him he was focused on his own agenda but
I think what's important to note is
whether Donald Trump wants to run or not
and despite the fact that he's the
front-runner in the Republican party as
the months go by
with so much happening to him with the
indictments and the arraignments and
then he'll continue to be in the news so
I call whether or not those independent
voters and and
not Republicans will decide to give
Donald Trump another chance at the White

a series of documents containing some
pretty highly classified intelligence
has now made its way online the papers
contain information relating to Ukraine
war it also talks about information
gathering on close U.S allies
the leak is being called by some as the
biggest in the United States in almost
about a decade and it is called the
United States and its allies completely
off guard there is more and more
troubling information that is emerging
every r as the world is delving deeper
into this intelligent strove our next
report gets you the details of the
revelations that focus on Serbia and the
role that it reportedly sought to play
in the Ukraine war take a look
a raging war in Ukraine 13 months of
non-stop fighting thousands dead
Millions displaced Ukrainian cities lie
in Ruins and the global economy goes
through a rough patch
but beyond the battlefield there's
another War raging in the Diplomatic
corridors
Western powers are trying to bolster
defenses by assuaging old allies and
trying to get support from other nations
to box Russia into a corner
however in Europe there is a country
which has refused to join the dictate to
sanction Moscow Serbia
but is that the whole truth if leaked
Pentagon documents are to be believed
then Belgrade has quietly been working
with NATO allies to help arms Ukraine
the latest Revelation on Serbia is
causing a lot of heartburn as per the
classified Pentagon documents Serbia
declined to provide training to
Ukrainian forces but did commit to
sending lethal Aid or has already done
so
the government of Serbian president
Alexander gutich has professed
neutrality in the Ukraine war we mustn't
forget Serbia has deep historic economic
and cultural ties with Russia
if what the documents say is true they
point at Washington having forced a
change of heart in Belgrade match to
moscow's displeasure
every plan in every wall is a closely
guarded secret Nations go to Great
Lengths to keep the strategy Under Wraps
and the adversary tries every Espionage
tool in the book to pull them out
so we're taking this very very seriously
there is uh
no excuse for these kinds of documents
to be in the public domain I would like
to highlight that they present a a very
serious risk to National Security and
have the potential to spread this
information the century so far we have
seen
four vast intelligence related leaks
clearly the beans have been spilled and
the U.S is trying hard to reduce the
Damage Done
a trove of top secret documents mostly
relating to the Russia Ukraine war is
now in the public domain the Biden

drifts of grave volcanic dust it
triggered an aviation warning around
Russia's Far Eastern Kamchatka peninsula
take a look at this report
large clouds of dark ash rose into the
Skies of Russia's Far Eastern Kamchatka
Peninsula after one of the country's
most active volcanoes erupted on Tuesday
it's nine in the morning said one woman
under a darkened Sky the ash is falling
the shivalooch volcano erupted just
after midnight and reached its peak
about six hours later
the ash cloud from the volcano covered
almost 42 000 square miles according to
the Kamchatka branch of Russia's
geophysical survey
it created the deepest Ash the area has
seen in 60 years
Tuesday's event could have a larger
impact on the climate than the massive
eruption at a volcano in Iceland in 2010
said WWF climatologist Alexei kakoran
the cows some small cooling small
cooling Maybe
0.1 000 degrees maybe even less maybe a
bit more nobody knows yet yeah in short
period maybe one year maybe smaller
maybe a bit larger anyway it's small

around 24 hours after the initial
eruption of 5.8 magnitude earthquake
struck off the kamchaka coast the
Geological Survey said
Russian scientists said the Quake was an
Aftershock from another earthquake that
happened on April 3rd
about 300 000 people live on the vast

threat has loomed since the end of March
when the number of Tremors within the

day
the government raised alert levels from
yellow to Orange and order the
evacuation of 7500 people living in the
foothills of the flat and the flanks of
the volcano
Arena
is
all seismicity was initially
characterized by Rock fracturing the
Colombian Geological Service explained
that this meant magma was trying to move
from the volcanoes Southwest towards the
crater
movements of other fluids within the
volcano have caused it to spew gas and
triggered further seismic activity
is
authorities fear that a major eruption
could cause the kind of Devastation that
rocked the area in 1985. in a matter of
hours an eruption of lava had melted
part of the volcano's snow cap creating

at the Arizona State University says
that the state is currently in a
shoulder season before transitioning
officially into the summer explanations
have been given on warming due to
human-caused climate change that has
caused extreme droughts storms and
wildfires around the globe
well what's going on in Arizona's we're
underneath what's called a ridge of high
pressure and that tends to make
temperatures really hot in Arizona and
the Phoenix metropolitan area what makes
it a little bit more challenging is that
Phoenix and Arizona has been really cold
for the last few months which has been
great for our snowpack but then when we
go from really cooler temperatures to
really warmer temperatures all of a

saw an average 2 meter loss of ice
thickness during last year's
record-breaking warm summer
blaming it on climate change for the
retreat the region witnessed an increase
in 1.5 degrees Celsius since the 19th
century
a glacier researcher at The Perennial
Institute of ecology says it's a
dramatic situation for the glaciers on
the franco-spanish mountain range
they are reaching their limit the
temperature rises we have been
experiencing in the last century and
especially in the last two or three
decades are subjecting them to an
environment in which they cannot survive
they are not generating new ice and the
existing ice is slowly melting
to analyze the early ice laws scientists
use high resolution satellite imagery
and visuals obtained on Research flights
in 2011 to map the ice Mass evolution
they compare it with data obtained on
field visits and 3D models of the
mountain Bridges produced last summer
with the help of drones
summer 2022 saw record-breaking heat in
many parts of the Iberian Peninsula
which scientists say resulted in losses
of up to 5 meters of ice thickness in
parts of some of the fastest melting
glaciers
in smaller glaciers ice in many cases
has already retreated to the shade of
ridges carved by centuries of erosion
in 1984 a study concluded that there
were 44 glaciers in the Pyrenees right
now there are 17 left this year we took
four of the list and pencil marked five
we will have to go next year to verify
whether we can still call them glaciers
by then
what this effectively means is that with
two or three Summers like the one that
was witnessed in 2022 there will be no
more glaciers left in Pyrenees
despite an El Nino threat the Indian
meteorological department has predicted
that the country will have a normal
Monsoon this year the IMD said that the
country will receive close to 96 percent
of its average seasonal rainfall between
June and September however the meta
office cautioned that the second half of
the monsoon season could be hit by the
El Nino
this is an unusual warming of the
Pacific Ocean that plays havoc with the
weather systems around the world this
may eventually lower precipitation
levels in July and September the the
forecast for this year is at the lower
end of the imd's range for normal
rainfall from 96 to 104 percent of the
long period average
in the last four years that is from 2019
to 2022 India has received normal to
above normal rainfall
according to I am the director in terms
of the spatial distribution normal
rainfall is expected in many parts of
the peninsula and East Central India
including Karnataka Kerala Goa Andhra
Pradesh Tamil Nadu Southern parts of
Telangana puruchari chattisgarh anurisa
normal to above normal rainfall is
expected in the Northeast including
arunachal Pradesh Assam meghalia
nagaland and Manipur along with parts of
Jammu and Kashmir Punjab and some parts
of uttar Pradesh normal to below normal
rainfall is likely in Rajasthan haryana
Maharashtra and Gujarat
last year too the IMD forecast had said
that Monsoon would be normal or 99 of
the long period average however the
country received 92.5 centimeters or 106
percent of the long period average last
monsoon season that was above normal
in 2021 rainfall was 99 of the LPA

climate change and Coastal erosion have
been the culprits behind many damaged
Shoreline properties in recent years but
the situation unfolding in a town near
Rio de Janeiro in Brazil is in an
entirely different Lake atafuna Town in
Brazil is home to more than 6 000
residents and sits about 200 miles north
of Brazil's most famous beaches
the town was once a cynic coastal town
but in recent decades it has become
known for climate related damage than
its charm
every year the Atlantic Ocean swallows
at least six meters or about 20 feet of
the town
hundreds upon hundreds of houses have
been devolved
transforming the picturesque Coastline
into an underwater graveyard of wrecked
structures
according to climate experts the town's
long time suffering has been exacerbated
by global warming as sea surface
temperatures rise throughout the world
heightened sea levels have sent more
currents careening into the town's Coast
but uniquely for atifona one more
ingredient that has contributed to the
town's worsening situation is the water
loss at a nearby River
the paraiba de Soul river whose mouth
sits in atifona is regarded as one of
the most significant river basins in the
country in terms of urban water supply
the 700 mile long river provides water
for more than 15 million people in a
hundred and eighty four towns in cities
however due to consistent over pumping
that water supply has shrunk in recent
decades the effects have been
catastrophic
a geologist at a federal University
explained that the reduced River volume
has meant less sand has been transported
to atifona
without the river sediment that
previously washed sand ashore the delta
and stabilize the coast the community
has been left defenseless against ocean
currents even more land has been exposed
for the Atlantic to gobble up
the rapid erosion is widespread
throughout the Brazilian Coastline but
has proven uniquely disastrous for
artifuna
as per expert reports in one year
between 2008 and 2009 the sea Advanced
as far as 27 feet into the town for the
thousands of residents who continue to
live along the coast and pray for a
change in the ocean's Wrath
the memories of years past continue to
sting
the country has launched a social
assistance program that pays 1200 rare's
which is roughly about 230 dollars a
month to more than 40 families who lost
their homes to erosion
from increasing temperatures to severe
cold from extensive rains to deadly
droughts climate change is showing its
effects every day and everywhere the
impact of climate crisis is such that it
is not only impacting weather conditions
but according to a recent study it is
now impacting America's favorite pastime
baseball
how watch this report
even America's favorite pastime is not
immune to climate change as Per a recent
study conducted by several researchers
from Dartmouth College it revealed that
warmer temperatures will now be causing
more home runs in professional baseball
a study published in the bulletin of
American Meteorological Society analyzed
data from over 100 000 major league
baseball games and at least 220 000
battered balls the study attributed that
at least 500 home runs since the 2010
season was scored due to warmer
temperatures
the researchers further found that
because temperatures are on an average
higher now than decades ago the air is
warmer more often and therefore thinner
during baseball games
as a result baseballs face less
resistance while flying through the air
making it easier for them to travel
farther
Major League Baseball saw spike in home
runs in recent years enough that the
league controversially used multiple
different types of baseballs in one
season to dampen the offense at times
without informing the public or players
until it was reported by other outlets
the Dartmouth researchers acknowledged
that the climate change factor is likely
minor as MLB teams hit at least
5215 home runs last season
meaning the warmer temperatures only
account for about one percent of the
long balls
different baseballs faster pitches
stronger battles and generally altered
strategy with an emphasis on certain
metrics like launch angle have a greater
influence on home runs than climate
change
however the researchers also said
climate change could have a larger
effect in the future estimating at least
192 additional home runs per season by
2050. and in estimated over 467 by 2100
in worst case warming scenarios the
Dartmouth study and another commission
by MLB in 2018 found that the number of
home runs per game increases by 2
percent per 1 degree Celsius temperature
increase although scientists and experts
around the world are trying to combat
the climate crisis studies like these
ones are important because they help to
demonstrate how climate change will
change every aspect of daily life

yYBcc-q52Hw,Pentagon INTEL LEAK: &#39;Leaked&#39; documents reveal US spying on Russia&#39;s war in Ukraine | WION,The Department of Justice has launched an inquiry into the recent social media postings of what appears to be a large number of ...,2023-04-11T08:20:10Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yYBcc-q52Hw/hqdefault.jpg,"now top story this hour the public
airing of the highly classified
documents about the Ukraine war it sent
shock waves across the United States
government the White House now says that
it is concerned that there could be
additional leaks the U.S justice
department is currently investigating
the origin of the leagues and the
repercussions on the ongoing war in
Ukraine when asked if the United States
was bracing for more online releases and
what the motive could be the National
Security Council spokesperson John Kirby
had this to say
the answer to both questions is no I
can't there's a justice department
investigation going on right now a
criminal investigation I'm certainly not
going to say anything that would
Prejudice that and that work is just
starting so we don't know who's behind
this we don't know what the motive is
and I think I can't remember who asked
before but we don't know what else might
be out there
meanwhile the report also suggests that
the leaked documents may have origins in
the chat room for gamers as per an
anonymous 18 year old gamer these
documents had appeared in this
particular chat room for months multiple
chances of documents have appeared on
social media sites in recent weeks the
information it covers a wide range of
topics from U.S assessments of the war
in Ukraine to intelligence gathered on
Washington's diplomatic allies let's now
tell you about the four major key
takeaways from the leaked Pentagon files
first up according to the league
documents a pro-russian hacking group it
may have targeted Canada's energy
infrastructure Zara which is a hacking
group working under the guidance of
Russia's Federal Security Service it may
have broken into Canada's Gas
Distribution Network
apart from this the league document also
revealed how Washington its penetrated
Russian intelligence apparently the
United States has a much clearer picture
of Russian intelligence operations than
a does of Ukrainian planning the
American intelligence has also been able
to obtain daily real-time warnings on
the timing of Moscow strikes and even
its specific targets and this list does
not end here the leak also suggests that
Ukraine's air defenses risk running out
of missiles and ammunitions within weeks
one of the documents that was dated 23rd
of February and marked a secret it
outlines in detail how Ukraine's Soviet
era s 300 air defense systems would be
depleted by May 2nd at the current rate
of use that's also being called the rate
of burn
the documents also contain intelligence
gathered on America's allies including
South Korea and Israel one document
mapped out American assessment of
scenarios that could lead to Israel
providing weapons to Ukraine however
South Korea says that the lead U.S Intel
documents are untrue and doctored Seoul
has said that its law forbid supplying
weapons to countries engaged in conflict
meaning that it cannot send arms to
Ukraine a senior intelligence official
has described the league as a nightmare
for the five eyes that refers to five
nations that share intelligence
information that's the United States
Britain Australia New Zealand and Canada
for more on this we're now joined by
John Blackman from Australia he's a
professor of intelligence studies and
International Security at the Strategic
and defense studies Center at the
Australian National University and a
former Army officer sir thank you so
much for joining us
good to be with you thank you for having
me on your show
so it is a fascinating development it is
very different to the Wikileaks of a
decade and a half ago and of the Snowden
Revelations this is one that appears to
be uh the snapshots taken with a camera
on a system that is not something you
could email outside USB ports are
blocked so the camera is now the
principal mechanism to actually acquire
the data it's been shared evidently with
the united with the Russia that's been
doctored by Russia and that's been used
weaponized if you like by Russia in an
attempt to undermine uh resolve and
Coalition support for the Ukrainian
position in the war against Russia this
is very much a an attempt to damage
Ukraine
well according to the lead documents the
pro-russian hacking group may have
targeted Canada's energy infrastructure
as well so I hope you can hear me now
there was a slight glitch there my
second question to you sir as per
opposed the origins of the Sleek maybe
from gaming chat rooms as per an
anonymous 18 year old gamer these
documents appeared in the chat rooms for
several months what's your take on that
so this is a very interesting
development uh you know gaming and the
the the apps on on online are now very
much uh a platform that can be used the
thing is once you get something
digitally onto uh the the web they can
be shifted and you know shared around
and all sorts of platforms and there's
no question a lot of people very
interested in playing in their space uh
people who are either Keen to
collaborate with Russia those who are
even Americans who are hostile to the
Biden Administration sympathetic to the
Russian cause there's a lot of really
interesting Dynamics at play here
reflecting America's internal challenges
and of course Russia's own desire to try
and change the Dynamics because it knows
it's been remarkably unsuccessful on the
battlefield in Ukraine so far right now
just for more clarity on this sir as per
John Kirby there are large parts of the
documents that may have been doctored
but of course it still contains a lot of
information about the war in Ukraine
information on U.S allies it also
revealed how Washington has penetrated
Russian intelligence so how do you
assess the Practical implications of
this
so a lot of what was available in those
reports is actually already available
from open source reporting there is
remarkably detailed and accurate
reporting from a range of Institutions
that are available online on Twitter and
other platforms that provide Blow by
blow Day by Day updates on the war in
Ukraine what is particularly telling is
the uh the revelations about America's
Espionage and its ability to see what
the Russians are doing and see what our
Coalition partners are doing and that is
clearly something Russia will be doing
will be acting upon to
prevent the continuation of that kind of
electronic and other surveillance from
Russia from the United States and also a
road and undermine confidence and
Coalition trust a Ukraine it is very
reliant on the United States there is
clearly an attempt here as part of a bit
of a mind game if you like with the
ukrainians to try and generate a bit of
a gap between the United States and the
Ukrainian government over over the way
ahead it's it's a complicated situation
it's very interesting though the
contrast with with the past
that's another another important finding
here called
the court structure as well it may have
broken into Canada's Gas Distribution
network if that is indeed true what can
you tell us of the Fallout of that
so yes it's I I have no way of
corroborating that but if it is true it
would point to the kind of uh concerns
expressed on a number of Levels by uh
pundits and cyber security experts in
recent years about the the vulnerability
of infrastructure we have gone from a
society that's web enabled to web
dependent and in turn we're vulnerable
and those vulnerabilities are in the in
terms of critical infrastructure in a
range of areas oil Dam electricity
various other you know hospitals and
emergency services that can be
interrupted interfered with and
disrupted and damaged
this is a game of cat and mouse though
it's important to remember that while
cyber attacks have in the past proved
effective the the situation in Ukraine
demonstrates that there are
countermeasures that are being developed
and there are counter encounter measures
that this is an iterative process so the
idea that you can just you know easily
do what was done with stuck and stuck
snacks stuxnet a decade ago in Iran is
not so easy to replicate because counter
measures are now very much part of the
industrial landscape and so while it's
possible that Canada may have some
vulnerabilities there I'm fairly
confident that like in other countries
there are considerable domestic cyber
security agencies that work to bolster
resilience and
defensive capabilities to deflect those
kinds of cyber attacks in future all
right so thank you so much for joining
us on Reon world as one with your
insights on this

to Beijing could have ended in two ways
one where Europe brings China on board
the Diplomatic table or two
China brings Europe to its side to see
how different the same table looks we
can conclude now that the trip has done
a bit of both
on his way back from Beijing Emmanuel
macron was interviewed by Politico and
he made this statement
I'm quoting here Europe must reduce its
dependency on the United States the
great risk Europe faces is that it gets
caught up in crises that are not ours
and this prevents it from building its
strategic autonomy
now coming from a key European country
like France this has raised many
eyebrows while macro was talking in
reference to Taiwan the comments are
being seen in a broader light as by
experts macron had a similar stance on
the defense industry as well nuclear and
renewable energy as well and even
dependence on the US dollar the Western
world is mostly seen as United States
and Europe
well that is wrong from geography's
point of view it has made sense in
politics but maybe not anymore the White
House is vehemently pushing for policies
to counter China it is already facing a
deterrence is already facing a
difference of opinion from South Asia
and Africa where most of the countries
are not giving in to Washington's
diplomacy bullying to say the least they
are choosing their interests over a
crisis that has nothing to do with them
and France is eyeing this club china had
to make sure that Europe does not get
sucked into playing America's game these
statements are Testament to that Europe
is ready to accept a word in which China
becomes a regional
if we quickly zoom out on the world map
we see a similar pattern emerging in
West Asia as well a region that was long
seen as Washington's playground
but U.S influence has come under Fire at
least in this region Joe Biden might say
that the US is not going anywhere

they don't need the U.S to shape West

Tas tells you stories which others want
and tonight we will tell you about this
new strategic map that is being drawn
they say your enemy's enemy is your
friend is that the foundation of the new
defense bridge between India and America
this is what separates us from others
who claim to be telling you Global
stories that matter in the last three
days Beyond has been traveling across
Syria you are in Latakia City right now
tell us what is the situation on ground
at gravitas we don't just tell you
stories from selected countries from
around the world two years since the
Myanmar military coup the people of
Myanmar continue to live in a nightmare
because it does not suit their
propaganda or because they are too
scared to speak truth to power
stress of it and lifeless
today was an exception
have a look at these visuals they are
from this morning itself
the Wagga border was buzzing with Sikh
pilgrims
going to the sacred SRI punja sahib
gurudwara which has the marks of the
hand of the great Guru nanak founder of
the Fitz
in an anomaly this holy Shrine of seeks
was left on the Pakistan side as a
result of partition and Reports say at
least 2
470 pilgrims have crossed the border
into Pakistan since Saturday
what for
to celebrate the Festival of besaki
which marks the first day of the crop
harvesting season
this year
Pakistan is holding a grand celebration
a number of events at various Sikh
shrines why is that what exactly is
Islamabad trying to achieve through all
of this
we will decode Pakistan's intentions in
just a bit but first let's tell you what
all it has planned
have a look at this map
on the 12th of April the Pilgrims from
India will be taken to Gurdwara Shri
panja sahib located in the ravalpindi
district
this Gurdwara houses the handprint of
the founder of Sikhism Guru nanak
the pilgrims will then be taken to
Gurdwara Dera sahib on the 15th of April
located in the city of Lahore this
Shrine commemorates the sport where the
fifth sea Guru Guru Arjun Dev was
martyred
and on the 16th of April the pilgrims
will go to qatarpur sahib this is one of
the holiest sites in Sikhism it is
located along the Ravi River in
Pakistan's Punjab province
so it is an elaborate tour
spread across the lengths and breadth of
Pakistan's Punjab province
it has been organized by the evacuate
trust property board a statutory body of
the government of Pakistan which looks
after the holy places of minorities
and according to reports it has
partnered with the shirumini Gurdwara
rabandan Committee of India to organize
this Grand Event
now this pilgrimage is a dream for many
Sikhs
this is perfectly understandable
for they are unable to visit these sites
on a regular basis because of the tough
Visa regulations
due to the floor ties between the two
sides
but why has Pakistan suddenly become so
welcoming
towards the Sikh pilgrims
there are two possible interpretations
here
it may be an attempt to woo a certain
Community or it may be an effort to send
a larger signal to New Delhi a signal
that Islamabad wants to diffuse tensions
with New Delhi
and it helps to look at some recent
developments
you see throughout the last three months
Pakistan tried to talk peace with its
Hawks speaking like Doves on multiple
occasions
take this report from February for
example this is when the former Chief of
inter-services public relations have
said that dialogue with India is the
need of the hour
in fact he asked Pakistan's
intellectuals to engage with India to
try to create a space for themselves
within the Indian Society
and a month before this in January this
year the Pakistani prime minister Shiva
Sharif gave an interview to al-arabya
where he asked the Indian Prime Minister
to hold serious talks and resolve the
bilateral issues between the two sides
let me just quote from his exact
statement
we had three wars with India and it only
brought more misery poverty and
unemployment to the people
we have learned our lesson and want to
live in peace provided we are able to
resolve our genuine problems
now we don't know what about Sharif what
made Sheba Sharif say this were
Pakistan's domestic compulsions the real
reason the unprecedented Financial
turmoil that it is facing at this point
it could be
after all have a look at the State of
Affairs in the country in the last two
weeks a total of 21 people have lost
their lives in stampedes at food
distribution centers 21 deaths that's
the level of desperation and despair in
the country
have a look at the state of the
Pakistani rupee
it stands at 281 against the dollar 281
last week it fell to an all-time low of
287.
and if I speak of the national debt a
new report saying the country has to pay
a whopping 77 billion dollars in the
next three years most of it to Saudi
Arabia and China
and if I speak of the Forex Reserves
they stand at an embarrassing 4.2
billion dollars
that's the amount of money Pakistan has
as savings
so my overall point is simple does
Pakistan expect India to help in return
for gestures like letting Sikhs visit
shrines there
there have been expert voices in
Pakistan by the way talking common sense
that trade with India would bring the
food prices down
but since it's Pakistan that we are
talking about one cannot help but be
cynical
the country after all has a track record
of biting the very hand that feeds it
it has a habit of promising one thing
and doing the exact opposite
so every gesture that it makes every
negotiation that it pushes for
must be taken with a pinch of salt
because the one thing that Pakistan will
not discuss is how to end the terrorism
if agency isi sponsors in Jammu and
Kashmir in India this is where every
effort towards peaceful dialogue comes
apart
but in the meantime we wish our Sikh
Brethren a happy basaki and a safe and
sacred pilgrimage
and as Pakistan opens its doors for the
Sikh Pilgrims from India
back home it is unable to protect its
Christian minorities
let me start with this report it's from
last month
this is when Pakistan's Mission at the
United Nations received hundreds of
letters seeking concrete steps to
protect the Christian Community in
Pakistan
you see these letters highlighted the
systematic persecution of the Christians
in Pakistan
the unjust punishments that they are
subjected to citing blasphemy
the fourth marriages of young Christian
girls to older Muslim men
they are serving of land and belongings
of Christians
and the forced conversions in various
parts of Pakistan
let's just have a look at some recent
developments first
in February this year
two Christian farmers were killed in
Pakistan one of them was beaten to death
by his Muslim land owner
in January a guava farmer was gunned
down
why
for resisting the stealing of fruits
from his Orchard
and he too was a Christian he was killed
by three Muslim youths
in fact Reports say the accused of still
walking free
and if you think that is bad then have a
look at this report
a few weeks back a 15 year old Christian
girl was kidnapped she was abducted by a
60 year old Muslim who later forcibly
married her and converted her to Islam
the girl's family saying that they went
to the police but the cops refused to
accept the complaint
and it doesn't even end there
last year a Christian priest was shot
dead in Peshawar what exactly was his
crime no one knows
the Peshawar police has linked the
attack to terrorist elements
you see even schools run by Parkers or
even schools run by Christians are under
attack in Pakistan
last year a school in Pakistan's
sheikhapura city was ransacked by a
group of goons
Reports say at least 14 armed men raided
the school tortured the staff and
damaged their vehicles
why
because this school was providing free
education to Christian students
now these were just a few instances
there are many more many more stories of
Horror
many more accounts of atrocities but you
get the point here
the life of Pakistan's Christians has
become a living hell
let's talk about the numbers now they
tell you the story as well in 1998
Christians made up 1.59 percent of
Pakistan's population
in 2021 the figure had dropped to just
1.27 percent
if I speak of literacy only 35 percent
of Christians in Pakistan are literate
according to an islamabad-based NGO and
I saw media reports over 80 percent of
Christian family units of six to eight
people live in two room houses
and let's not even talk about the kind
of jobs that they do
to this day every Cantonment city in
Pakistan has an area known as Lal kurti
this is where Christians reside
and do odd jobs at the households of
generals jobs like laborers cleaners
Farm hands
according to one report in fact 80
percent of sanitary positions in
Pakistan are held by Christians eighty
percent
have a look at this report now
it's from December 2021. let me quote
what this Pakistani newspaper said about
Christian workers
the Christian cleaners have kept the
sewer system moving in karachi's
enormous part Metropolis by unclogging
decaying drain pipes or feces and
dangerous Hospital waste
and you see doing menial jobs is just
one part of their struggle
the other is Pakistan's blasphemy law
under this law anyone who offends Islam
is given a death penalty
and Pakistan has now made this law
stricter it has raised the minimum
prison sentence to 10 years for anyone
who insults the wives companions family
members of the Prophet Muhammad
formerly the maximum was three years and
now it is 10 years
and you'll be shocked to hear about the
kind of cases that Christians are
charged with under the blasphemy law
have a look at this report
in July last year a Christian mechanic
was sentenced to death for saying that
he only followed Jesus Christ
in June 2022 two Christian brothers were
sentenced to death for allegedly posting
Blasphemous content on a website
their family said they were framed that
someone created a fake website in their
name
but the court hearing the case could not
care less
now I could go on with examples
regarding how the kind of treatment
Christians in Pakistan are subjected to
has been making headlines but the thing
is there is frankly very little that the
world can do about it time and again
various Global bodies have urged
Pakistan to treat its minorities better
to punish those who perpetuate crimes
against Christians and Hindus
yet there has been no end to targeted
attacks against them
shifting Focus for now Chinese Naval
shocks have been circling their prey
it was the third day of its military
drills in the Taiwan Street
the operation was dubbed joint sword
in fact Ivan says 11 Chinese warships
and 59 warplanes surrounded
35 of these aircraft crossed the median
line of the Taiwan Strait
they enter taiwan's air defense
identification Zone
age 6K Fighters carried out multiple
waves of simulated strikes on several
targets
the Shandong aircraft carrier was also
used
jet fighters and helicopters took off
and landed on the carrier around 120
times over the last three days 120 times
clearly China is furious
have a look at this clip it was released
by The People's Liberation Army on its
WeChat account what does it show
missiles reigning from Air Land and Sea
into the Iron's territory and exploding
in flames
and why is all this happening
because of yet another American house
speaker
you see the Taiwan President Sai England
met Kevin McCarthy this was last week in
the countdown to that meeting with the
U.S House speaker China had already sent
three warships in the East China Sea
last week
but that did not discourage Taiwan
this is what Psy inguin had said right
after stepping off her flight
we showed the International Community
that in the face of pressure and threats
Taiwan will be even more United and will
absolutely not yield to suppression nor
due to obstructions stop exchanges with
the world
now that's just an indication of the
kind of messaging that the leader of
Taiwan has been sending out
we just played out what the leader said
for three days its foreign Ministry has
issued fresh warnings to the island
listening now to this reaction
a spokesperson for the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs has previously issued a
statement on size Transit visit to the
United States pointing out that in
response to the serious wrongdoings of
the United States and Taiwan and
collusion China will take Resolute and
forceful measures to safeguard National
sovereignty and territorial integrity
now as I told you Chinese Naval sharks
are circling their prey and the question
is when will Beijing take the final leap
it has become just a question of when
and not if
you see the U.S intelligence suggests
that it will happen in 2027.
it claims that Xi Jinping has instructed
the pla in fact to be ready by then
is China going to invade Taiwan in the
next four years
you see Taiwan is recognized by only 13
countries
and all of them are small island States
or countries that lack diplomatic
significance as such
the list does not include the U.S
only last month the Central American
country Honduras remember severed it
ties with Taiwan it said there is only
one China in the world
and China on the other hand is boosting
its diplomacy like anything it is
building a circumference of friends
in fact Beijing recently brokered peace
between Iran and Saudi Arabia it is also
trying to play a mediator in the Russia
Ukraine war
in fact only days ago the French
President Emmanuel macron paid a visit
to China so did the foreign Ministers of
Iran and Saudi Arabia
the case in point is from being a global
outlier president Xi Jinping is trying
to become the Emperor of diplomacy
He is building a support base why
so that nobody moves a finger when China
invades Taiwan is it so that it's left
alone and vulnerable as China forces it
into a reunification that's the question
that is being asked
tensions across the Taiwan Street in
fact are at the highest that they have
been in several years
Chinese fighter jets flying towards
Taiwanese airspace routinely such
incidents have increased five-fold
between 2020 and 2022
the current status quo Arrangement is
not going to last for long
Taiwan itself is aware of that
but you see it's backed by the US and
Japan
but is China in a position really to
take on American forces will it be ready
by 2027 to take the island
it would be a tough military operation
in itself
Russia despite sharing a land border
with Ukraine is still stuck in a long
War
how would China execute its plans with a
sea separating it from Taiwan when will
the country take the final leap
meanwhile the United States is
scrambling to find the source of the
leak of Highly classified documents
we've been telling you about this the
documents have revealed sensitive
details about America's allies and
Ukraine's vulnerabilities as the war
with Russia goes on
is America eavesdropping on key allies
and could this lead to a huge crisis for
America's geopolitical relations
let's break it down for you
the Pentagon documents which were leaked
online contain exclusive information
which can only be obtained if one keeps
a close eye on their friends
you know almost like spying on your
neighbors
in fact the documents contain data on
Ukraine South Korea Israel some European
countries as well
what exactly is this controversial data
all about
let me start off with Ukraine
a document marked secret describes how
Ukraine's air defense systems are bound
to run out by me if the country
continues to flush out the stockpiles at
the current rate
and this data lead by the way comes as
the U.S and Ukraine have started
developing a mutual trusting
relationship over intelligence sharing
Ukraine is now on its doors as Reports
say that Kiev has already altered some
of its military plans because of this
leak
and America also is in a difficult
position with its for Russia some
documents showing that America
penetrated the Russian Ministry of
defense and the Wagner group this was
done through intercepted communication
the U.S in fact has also targeted Israel
as the documents claim that Israel's
Mossad intelligence agency which is the
National Intelligence Agency
lighted protests against the Israeli
Prime Minister Netanyahu is
controversial judicial reforms and
Netanyahu lashback saying that the
information has no Foundation whatsoever
South Korea in fact has also been
mentioned in those documents its
officials have been accused of planning
to supply weapons to Ukraine after
coming under America's pressure
this can be highly controversial as it
is against seoul's policy to export
weapons to countries in conflict
the U.S has imposed the same intention
of weapon Supply on Israel and European
countries
the documents saying that the countries
will consider providing lethal Aid due
to increased U.S pressure or because of
a degradation in their relationship with
Russia
and how exactly are the countries
reacting to this big leak
America's allies are doing damage
assessment they are struggling to
determine whether their own sources or
methods have been compromised
countries are alarmed looking at a
document titled Russia Ukraine battle
for the donbass region likely heading
for a stalemate throughout 2023
the document assesses the endurance of
Ukraine's operations
some countries pointed out that
America's assessment of Ukraine does not
help the war
but the question that arises is is all
the leaked information even true
Ukraine believes that the documents are
inauthentic and have nothing to do with
Ukraine's actual plans
in fact Kiev says that the data is just
a large amount of fictitious information
spread by Russia
and when it comes to hard facts the
documents contain errors regarding the
war in Ukraine especially the
battlefield casualty estimates which
seem to minimize the Russian losses
and how exactly is the U.S handling this
controversial situation
America's officials saying that they
have spoken with allies and informed the
congressional committees about the leak
the Department of Defense is still
reviewing the validity of the photograph
documents which are currently spreading
across social media platforms you heard
that right
in fact the U.S has said that the
documents could be doctored to spread
false information and damage the
country's reputation
with countries scrambling to protect
their personal information and building
walls to reinforce data security
will the U.S gain back the trust that it
has lost
what the leaked Ukraine war information
handicapped the country on the
battlefield
moving on for now
do you remember Bonnie and Clyde
the American criminal couple that robbed
banks and funeral homes during the Great
Depression
well the door is long dead but there is
another Bonnie who robs Banks
Bonnie Gooch and she is proving that age
is just a number
what am I talking about
this 78 year old allegedly broke into a
bank this was in Missouri
dressed in all gray a black mask Black
sunglasses
Bonnie slid a note to the teller
the note had a demand and an apology
scribbled on it
our demand for what
13 000 small bills and an apology for
creating Ruckus
this is what it read I'm quoting
thank you sorry I did not mean to scare
you
in fact surveillance video captured
Bonnie banging on the counter asking the
teller to hurry up
and in the hurry she told the teller not
to count the money and just hand it over
to her
the 78 year old made a rather quick
Escape but not for long
she was caught around three kilometers
away from the bank
and police officers found cash scattered
on her car's floor
she was smelling strongly of alcohol
she was cuffed and jailed for stealing
and this by the way was not the first
time Bonnie attempted a heist
in 2020 she was convicted of robbing a
bank this was in Kansas City and at the
time her son said that Bonnie was acting
out
she had left the house angry saying that
she was going to rob a bank
and as it turns out Bonnie was not
joking she went ahead and did exactly
that
but her sentence for the crime was
suspended she was released on supervised
probation which expired in November
2021.
and before this Bonnie was found guilty
of robbing a California Bank this was in
1977.
they say you should keep trying until
you succeed
and Bonnie took this quite seriously
but clearly she did not get better with
time
all her attempts failed miserably
not everyone can pull off a smooth money
Heist
sometimes things do not go as planned
some thieves cleanly do not do their
jobs well
have a look at this one
in 2021 a Thai burglar broke into a
house
he got a little too comfortable he
switched on the air conditioner in one
of the rooms
and decided to take a quick nap
in a hilarious turn of events the house
belonged to a police officer by the way
he was woken up by a cop and then
arrested
the viral videos of this failed robbery
left medicines in splits
you see sleeping on your job can not
only get you fired but arrested as well
and some thieves know exactly what they
want they have their priorities straight
they choose food overloot
kitchery is an Indian comfort food a
dish which is quite popular one that is
very good for your health as well
but it turned out to be injurious for a
burglar
last year a man broke into a house this
was in Assam in India tired and hungry
after all the stealing he started
cooking khichdi the neighbors heard the
clatter of the utensils and informed the
police the hungry burglar was arrested
by the police then
have a look at this video it's from
Michigan
a clumsy crook managed to topple a whole
display case over himself this was
during a robbery
you see it takes some skills to be a
seasoned thief and not everyone can fit
the job description
and our next story is about a possibly
groundbreaking set of new vaccines
which a leading pharmaceutical firm
moderna says rather claims will be ready
by the year 2030.
the jobs
it claims will be able to cure cancer
cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases
could this lead to the end of
life-threatening diseases
let's get to the details first
after moderna's success when it comes to
creating the covid-19 vaccine studies
say the firm's vaccinations show
tremendous promise
in fact researchers say that 15 years
worth of progress has been unveiled in
just 12 to 18 months thanks to moderna's
effective covid-19 jobs
and the pharmaceutical firm is now
concentrating on personalized cancer
vaccines which will fight against
multiple tumor types
so what exactly is modern art strategy
towards cancer
researchers say that they will be using
therapies based on mRNA also known as
messenger ribonucleic acid
how exactly does mRNA work what's the
strategy
the MRNA molecule is first injected into
a patient
the molecule then instructs the cells to
make certain proteins which will alert
the immune system to strike the virus
the immune's response the immune
response will then destroy the water
cells without causing any harm to the
healthy cells
moderna carried out Trials of its mRNA
vaccine for Respiratory singtel viruses
which usually cause mild cold-like
symptoms
the vaccine was proven
83.7 percent effective
when it comes to preventing at least two
symptoms cough and fever
and this led to the FDA granting the
vaccine a breakthrough breakthrough
therapy designation which means that
it's regulatory review will now be
expedited
so how exactly will modernize
personalized cancer vaccine work really
first a biopsy of the cancer patient's
tumor will be studied in order to
sequence its genetic material
so that it can identify mutations that
are not present in the healthy cells
and in the second stage a machine
learning algorithm will identify which
mutations are driving the growth of the
cancer
the algorithm will also learn how to
trigger an immune response
and now comes the role of the mrnas
once injected into the patient the MRNA
turns into protein pieces which are
identical to those found in tumor cells
immune cells then encounter the protein
pieces and destroy the cancer cells
moderna in fact is not the only one
creating new vaccines another leading
pharmaceutical company Pfizer is also
planning to start clinical trials often
mrna-based influenza vaccine
the pharmaceutical giant saying that the
covid-19 vaccine development process has
helped in carrying out mRNA research
while firms move on to developing new
vaccines the covid-19 virus has still
not left the people of India
India has reported over 5 800 cases of
the Wuhan virus in the last 24 hours the
daily covid-19 positivity rate standing
at 6.91 percent
while the recovery rate is packed at
98.73 percent
in fact the country has witnessed 14
covid-19 related deaths with four deaths
each reported from New Delhi and the
Northern State of Himachal Pradesh two
deaths in the southern state of Kerala
and a single death each from Gujarat
Jammu and Kashmir Maharashtra and
Rajasthan
although safety masks have still not
been mandated the Indian government has
launched a nationwide mob drill in order
to inspect the hospital preparedness in
which both public and private facilities
will be participating
is it too soon to develop new vaccines
while covid-19 variants continue to
spread
or do scientists perceive covid-19 as a
seasonal virus now
well the only thing that you and I can
do is take precautions and always
keep your guard on
and one of the biggest success stories
of India has got a thumbs up from the
international monetary fund
a recent IMF paper has praised India's
digital public infrastructure adding
that it is a lesson for many countries
to follow
take a look
India's digital public infrastructure
which includes the aadhaar unified
payments interface in other words
digital payments in digilocker is
collectively called India stack
the convergence of these three help
millions of Indians to conduct online
paperless cashless transactions
the IMF paper which is titled stacking
up the benefits lessons from India's
digital Journey argue that India's
digital infrastructure help people
during the pandemic the paper noted that
India's digital infrastructure was able
to provide support to at least 87
percent of the households in the first
months of the covert pandemic in fact
the Indian government estimated that it
could save about 1.1 percent of the GDP
in expenditure up to March 2021 due to
the digital infrastructure reforms
the paper particularly noted how the
government pushed for financial
inclusion through the jandhan scheme
which provided low-cost zero balance
accounts to millions of poor Indians by
linking their accounts to aadhar and as
per the paper it's not just bank
accounts India's digital infrastructure
had overcome logistical challenges while
delivering vaccines as well
a large part of India's digital
infrastructure is centered around
digital payments like paytm Google paid
to name a few
digital payments now account for 68 of
all payment transactions by volume
roughly 4.5 million individuals and
companies have benefited from the easier

build a report Beyond world is one
and as we end the show tonight
there is some good news
more good news
this story is about tigers the big cats
have seen their numbers increasing in
India with conservation efforts paying
off
our next report taking a closer look at
the Journey of India's conservation
program project tiger the Milestones
that it has crossed and the journey
ahead
they are Majestic Regal awe-inspiring
and their numbers have been a cause of
concern for decades
in the 1940s tiger numbers started
declining steeply thanks to the rising
human population which brought with it
deforestation and agricultural expansion
Tigers need large spaces to roam about
and hunt
their habitats were impacted there was
an increase in human tiger conflicts
unregulated poaching made matters worse
India officially banned tiger hunting in
1972.
and in the year 1973 the Indian
government launched the conservation
program project tiger initially the
project covered nine tiger reserves
since then it has come a long way now it
includes 53 tiger reserves spread out
over 75 000 square kilometers and the
efforts have yielded results and how
tiger numbers have once again increased
in the country marking the completion of
50 years of project tiger Indian Prime
Minister Narendra Modi released the
latest tiger Census Data India's tiger
population as of 2022 is
3167. this is around 70 percent of the
world's wild tiger population which is
roughly 4 500. the 2018 tiger census
that was released in July 2019
established the presence of
2967 tigers in India the animals
population in the country has increased
by 200 or 6.7 percent in the past four
years the Indian Prime Minister has
termed the success of project tiger as a
matter of Pride not only for India but
for the whole world
the numbers come as a huge victory for
conservationists and their efforts to
revive the tiger population and also
bring hope for other countries that have
been trying to increase Wildlife numbers
Prime Minister Modi released the tiger
census while inaugurating the
international big cat Alliance in
karnataka's mysuru
which is the first of its kind in the
country to help in financial and
technical assistance for conservation
and protection of wildlife with a focus
on protection and conservation of seven
major big cats of the world tigers lions
leopards snow leopards Pumas Jaguars and
cheetahs nations with these animals are
part of the alliance and can share their
experience and help partner Nations the
alliance will work together for research
training and capacity building the
country's aim has been to sustain a
viable tiger population
while maintaining a balance between
development and wildlife conservation

in yet another extreme weather event
leading to loss of life a daily
Avalanche and the French Alps on Sunday
has resulted in the death of at least
four people and injured several others
who were later escorted to a hospital
the news was confirmed by the interior
minister of France Gerald dominin just
days earlier a Delhi Avalanche in the
North Eastern State of Sikkim in India a
deadly Avalanche rolled down the
ahmann's glacier which is southwest of
the resort town of shimoni the local
radio station put the size of the
Avalanche at 1000 meters two helicopters
were sent into help in the search the
station said French president Emmanuel
macron wrote on Twitter that Rescue
Services were continuing to search for
further casualties and that his thoughts
were with the victims and their families
now Beyond just lip service one would
hope that our governments make
significant efforts to understand that
extreme weather events will only become
more frequent as the planet becomes
warmer
is
let's go across to Brazil that is too
grappling with severe weather events
thousands of people were evacuated after
severe flooding and landslides were
experienced in the northern states of
the region at least six people have lost
their lives in the state of Mourinho and
three in the state of Sierra which is
one of the poorest regions in the
country the emergency service has been
declared in at least 53 cities and towns
the authorities in the state of Mourinho
declared a state of emergency in
response to the recent heavy rainfall
around 800 households were displaced and
Dam failures resulted in flooding in two
municipalities
so
[Music]
the municipalities in Para State declare
an emergency on March 21st due to Rising
levels in the rivers the local
authorities in maraba and more than 400
households were also displaced the two
rivers have been rising for some time in
the state but reached dangerous levels
over the last few days heavy rain caused
the landslide in Sierra State on March
16th at least three people had died and
15 homes were damaged on March 20 the
authorities also warned that at least 26
dams in the state were at a capacity to
assess the severity of the situation in
the regions the Brazilian president Lula
de Silva also visited the affected areas
on Sunday surrounded by officials Da
Silva visited a shelter where he talked
with people displaced by the flooding
that have submerged houses and streets
according to Mariano's military fire
brigade almost 36 000 families have been
affected by these floods and nearly 8
000 have been displaced or left without
a home
later this week Brazil Zula de Silva
will be in Beijing he will meet a
Chinese president Xi Jinping with the
hope that the two leaders of two of the
major Global economies also make serious
efforts to address the climate crisis
[Music]
and after Earth with this second hottest
March the temperature of the world's
ocean service has now hit an all-time
high causing heat waves in the oceans
across the globe according to initial
data from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration causing
Marine heat waves worldwide scientists
say that the average temperature at the
ocean service has been at a record
21.1 degrees Celsius since the beginning
of April the previous record was set at
21 degrees Celsius in the year 2016.
climate experts believe that the current
trajectory will head off the charts and
smash previous records however a counter
temperature wave is currently on the
rise as well following a historical
pattern in the tropical Pacific climate
the El Nino pattern expected to commence
later this year is set to fully reveal
the effects of increased greenhouse gas
emissions around the world scientists
further speculate the risk of extreme
weather conditions and a further
increase in global heat records the
previous record for the hottest service
ocean temperatures coincided with the El
Nino pattern that occurred between 2014
and 2016. this is according to the NOAA
data studies also show that more than 90
percent of the extra heat on planet
Earth is due to the consumption of
fossil fuels and deforestation warning
that the world could reach the 1.5
degrees of warming for the very first
time however experts consider 1.5
degrees of warming as a key Tipping
Point Beyond which the chances of
extreme flooding drought wildfires and
food shortages could increase
dramatically the world has already seen
around 1.2 degrees warming as humans
continue to burn fossil fuels and
produce Planet heating pollution
and despite three years of cooling La
Nina temperatures and they have soared
to dangerous levels now Europe saw its
hottest summer in 2022 with temperatures
over 40 degrees Celsius and Pakistan and
India have also been experiencing a
searing Heat Wave where parts of the
country reached more than 49 degrees
Celsius ultimately whether the 1.5
degree threshold is hit or not really
missed it doesn't really matter as it is
the first time in human history that the
value is Within Reach and that's really
the significant point right now whatever
the exact level of heating El Nino
brings some of its impacts as well
including extreme temperatures which are
very likely to be unprecedented
currently the moderate to strong Marine
heat waves have been observed in several
regions such as the southern Indian
Ocean the South Atlantic of northwest
Africa around New Zealand of the
northeast of Australia and the west of
Central America hot air oceans will
increase the energy of Storms and will
also put ice sheets at risk of melting
which would push up Global sea levels
the heat waves can also devastate Marine
wildlife and also destroy coral reefs in
the coming few months
from all this we're now being joined
live by Michael McFadden who is a senior
scientist with the U.S National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration he's
joining us live from Washington D.C
thank you so much for joining us from
Beyonce
now World oceans hit all-time high and
last month was recorded as the second
warmest March how do you think that the
future looks like in terms of the Paris
agreement of reaching 1.5 degrees
Celsius
we have just come out of a three-year La
Nina event in the tropical Pacific and
so for the last three years even though
greenhouse gas concentrations have risen
in the atmosphere the the rise in
atmospheric temperatures has been tamped
down by these very cold Waters in the
equatorial Pacific which is a huge part
of the world ocean
now this La Nina is over
the temperatures in the ocean have
returned to normal but we're beginning
to see the evidence of this increased
amount of greenhouse gas concentration
in the atmosphere that's why
temperatures are once again on the rise
right Michael also tell us that how do
you think that the warm ocean beds will
affect the marine life which sea animals
will be the most affected according to
you
the sensitivity to temperature is very
species dependent uh it depends on where
you are what time of year it is uh what
kind of animal or plant is involved but
generally rising ocean temperatures uh
push many species outside their uh their
comfort zone and we know with coral
bleaching for example if you
temperatures rise too high for too long
the one celled
animals that live in their tissues are
expelled which causes them to lose their
color and their food source and if those
uh if that bleaching goes on too long
corals will die so this is the threat of
rising global temperatures in the ocean
which we are seeing more and more of
because of the inexorable rise in
greenhouse gas concentrations in the
atmosphere absolutely Michael while
experts around the world are also
claiming that we might reach the 1.5
degree celsius agreement plan what do
you think can be done of the ocean
bodies to improve the situation a bit
more
well you know we're still somewhat uh
away from the 1.5 degrees Celsius
threshold so there's still time uh it's
um you know we have some ways to go so I
think the you know we have to keep
reminding policy makers and decision
makers and politicians that uh climate
change is a real threat humans are
causing it and there's something we can
do about it and that's to to decrease
the amount of fossil fuel combustion and
deforestation that's going on around the
world to bring our planet back into some
form of equilibrium
right Michael now while ill Nina periods
help suppress temperatures across the
vast tropical Pacific according to you
which areas or regions will be the most
affected at the moment
of course when we talk about the global
mean temperatures we're talking about an
average all over the world but some
places are affected more than others uh
the Arctic and the polar regions go
through what's called polar
amplification these areas are rising
faster than the global average land
surfaces rise faster in terms of
temperature than the ocean does because
the land has less of ability to store
Heat
so land and Arctic are the places we're
going to see the temperatures rise the
fastest
thank you Michael for joining us
tomorrow sharing your insights with us
in other global news that we are
tracking at this hour no longer
theoretical threat overfishing across
the globe has wiped out species from
areas where the ones thrived and one
result of this is that it's taken off
the table of the Beloved culturally
important dishes in the Bahamas the
government officials and
conservationists are working to save The
Conch which is a marine snail that's
Central to the island nation's diet
economy and identity our next report
tells you more take a look
conch the sea snail that is a staple
food for the people of the Bahamas is
being slowly wiped out by overfishing
and could cease to be commercially
viable in as little as six years
the overfishing challenges faced by
bahamians are mirrored in places like
Senegal
where overfishing has taken away White
grupa
a main ingredient in the national dish
of tibudian
and the Philippines where it has
depleted small fish such as sardines
that are used in kinilo a raw dish
similar to ceviche
the older I get I notice that Kongs are
now
you have to go more further and further
further counts bahamians are traveling
further and further from population
centers in pursuit of conch and they're
also turning to animals that have not
yet had the opportunity to reproduce
Queen conch is the main food species
according to government authorities and
conservation agencies its decline has
been drastic a 2011 survey of the Exuma
case a critical fishing area found that
the density of adult conch had declined
by nearly 91 percent on the Island's
shelf over a 20-year period and experts
warned that the Conch fishery could no
longer be commercially viable in as
little as six years
a scientist with Chicago's Shed Aquarium
who has researched conch in the Bahamian
Waters said one challenge the shellfish
face is the lack of enforcement of
existing laws which restrict fishing by
Foreign vessels
industrialized fishing fleets from other
nations have over exploited some areas
where conch grow he added
Bahamian conch Fishers points to such
nearby Nations as the Dominican Republic
and Jamaica which have stricter
restrictions on conch fishing than the
Bahamas the warmer climate makes things
worse
climate change has caused unpredictable
weather that has disrupted and damaged
conch habitats and fishing grounds the
scientists say seagrass beds where
conscious Gather in large grounds have
been severely damaged by storms such as
hurricane Maria in 2017 leading to
thinning herds
another problem is growing acidification
with the warming ocean which damages
conch shells and changing sea
temperatures have disrupted migration
patterns that is likely to disrupt the
reproductive season
in Senegal fish and seafood represent
more than 40 percent of animal protein
intake in the diet
in Dakar the capital and the largest
city a nutritionist said that the loss
of grupa means more than just the loss
of a national symbol it has led to the
loss of a key protein for the nation's
residents these people today don't have
the minimum to leave and they don't have
the minimum nutrients minimum protein
because they don't find fish they don't
have the means to buy fish the lack of
grouper has also made other fish more
expensive leaving residents making the
national dish of tibudian on a limited
basis with smaller fish
today we are preparing sea budien but
the market didn't have any of the fish
we prefer for it
there isn't any tea off it's only the
rich who can buy it now it's only the
small fish we can buy that's all we can
cook because there is none here
the government in the Bahamas is
exploring several ways to save conch
part of the solution is more aggressive
enforcement of existing laws and the
Bahamas National Trust a non-profit that
manages national parks is working to get
fishes tools to help them measure
conscious to ensure they are big enough
to harvest reducing the fishery by half
over the next three years as a new
proposal promises to do is one way to
potentially starve off the loss of conch
and pressure on conch could be reduced
from outside
the U.S the largest importer of conch
from the Bahamas is considering listing
conch Under The Endangered Species Act
which could halt Imports into the
country
meanwhile on Sunday India's prime
minister Narendra Modi launched the

now volcanoes and earthquakes may not be
connected to global warming their
natural disasters that are unpredictable
and yet they tell us so much about a
response to these disasters in Colombia
there is a serious threat of a volcano
eruption and families living on the
upper slopes of the Nevada Del Ruiz
volcano region are now being evacuated
Colombia's Geological Service has raised
the alert level from yellow to Orange
warning that an eruption bigger than any
in the past 10 years could occur in the
coming few days or even weeks the
authorities have warned of a probable
eruption that could take place within
days the Colombian Authority is now plan
to evacuate people living within 15
kilometers of the volcano the evacuation
measures are preventive the local
authorities say that area is nearest to
the volcano have poor communication and
infrastructure so at the moment it is
difficult to contact people like quickly
in the event of an eruption
Casas
familiar foreign
Province will be evacuated first and 500
additional families may eventually be
asked to do the same but some residents
including families who survived a
devastating 1985 eruption by the volcano
which straddles the border between

they will not go
okay
foreign
people live in the volcanoes area of
influence which is spread across parts
of six provinces the Nevada Del Ruiz
volcano straddles the border between
Colombia's tolema and kaldas provinces
the authorities are also monitoring
areas around rivers and those which
could be prone to landslides in case of
an eruption they're also Shoring up
roads that would be used for evacuations
the precautionary measures seem
justified given that the volcano caused
Colombia's biggest natural disaster till
date that is when it erupted in the year
1985 burying entire settlements around
it

unlike Donald Trump we all know that
global warming is a real thing and among
the biggest crisis that the humankind
currently faces also not to hide is the
fact that the transportation industry is
among the biggest polluters on the
planet
on this matter the EU or the European
Union proposed a complete ban on selling
new combustion engine cars by the year
2035 but a few major German
manufacturers sought an exception and
they want the sale of combustion engine
cars to continue albeit with a caviar
they are going to be powered only by
e-fuels
cars and vans are responsible for around
15 percent of the European Union's total
greenhouse gas emissions therefore the
EU has proposed a complete ban on
selling new combustion engine cars in
the block by 2035. the decision is in
line with the eu's legal mandate to
achieve climate neutrality by 2050. it
means achieving a net zero emissions
balance by reducing Greenhouse emissions
however just before the ban came into
effect Germany halted proceedings the
German transport Authority pressured by
the industry did not fully favor the ban
some major German car makers wanted an
exception to allow the sale of new
combustion engine cars that will only
run on e-fuels they argue that the
carbon neutral process of making e-fuels
would balance out the greenhouse
emissions emitted by e-fuel propelled
cars in a win for Germany they use
climate tree France timmermans confirmed
that the block had reached an agreement
with Germany on using e-fuels
Germany's transport Minister
volkervising also confirmed stating that
the new combustion engine cars that run
on e-fuels will not be banned in the EU
after 2035. the EU will now work on
drafting specific rules to implement
this agreement Paving the way for the
band to come into effect

weapons Tick Tock is seen as a national
security threat but there are other
Chinese apps too that could compromise
security and we bring you a full review
of a new Gadget that you may want to buy
let's get started
[Music]
drones have emerged as a new security
threat across the world therefore the
anti-drone Technologies are in higher
demand such systems are deployed to
protect areas like airports critical
infrastructure large public spaces and
military bases different countries are
betting back on such counter drone
Solutions and the latest to invest in
these high-tech Technologies is Japan
watch this story to know more
foreign
s are changing the face of warfare in
the 21st century
there are four countries around the
world are investing in anti-drone
Technologies
this time Japan has introduced such
counter-drone systems
two Japanese defense firms have unveiled
prototypes of their high energy laser
weapons
what do they do they can shoot down
sophisticated enemy drones
first company to have come up with a
counter-drone weapon is Mitsubishi heavy
Industries
according to a report its 10 kilowatt
fiber laser can hit unmanned devices
from a distance of 1.2 kilometers this
can be done in two to three seconds
the anti-drone system can be mounted on
ground Vehicles it can be used by the
country's ground self-defense Force
Naval and air units
another company that has teased a
similar technology is Kawasaki heavy
Industries
The Firm has showcased a more powerful
100 kilowatt counter drone system
the machine is designed to be mounted on
big trailers
as it would require a large power supply
to operate according to the company the
system can detect enemy drones using an
infrared camera it can track them and
fire a fiber laser
the company is expected to test it
sometime this month this Showcase of
Japan's defense systems comes as
tensions continue to soar in the
indo-pacific region is Japan updating
its Counter-Strike capabilities to
respond to Chinese attacks or is it just
growing its defense capabilities against
any potential threats that remains to be
seen
let's shift our Focus to China and its
popular apps Tech talk is not the only
Chinese app that you should be worried
about there are many other chinese-owned
apps that are gaining popularity and
could pose similar challenges as Tech
talk we get you more details in our next
story
talk is under Fire in many countries
there are fears that the popular Chinese
app Harvest vast amounts of user data
and shares the collected data with the
Chinese government
various lawmakers worldwide are calling
the app a national security threat as a
result several countries such as the
United States Australia Britain and New
Zealand have already banned the app from
official devices
by it such serious concerns the app
continues to grow in popularity in many
countries for instance Tick Tock now has
150 million monthly users in the US
almost half of the country's population
but there is something more alarming
Tick Tock is not the only Chinese app to
conquer Western markets there are others
too and we need to talk about them
before it gets too late
according to apptopia a company that
provides analytics around apps and
websites Chinese companies own three of
the top 10 free mobile apps in the US
two of them are also the most downloaded
in the UK cap cut is the best example
it is a video editing tool optimized for
mobile editing
cap cut helps people quickly create
online videos and memes the app is owned
by the same Chinese company that owns
tiktok
and it is bite dance the second app in
question is Shane which is a global fast
fashion brand
founded by Chinese billionaire Chris Shu
Sheen had over 200 million Global
downloads in 2022
another Chinese app that is acquiring
customers globally is Teemu
it's a shopping platform owned by
Chinese e-commerce heavyweight PDD
Holdings its USP is that the online
store allows consumers to bypass
warehouse stores and buy directly from
the Chinese manufacturer as a result the
products are priced at very low prices
the app was launched in September last
year not even a year has passed and it
has rapidly outpaced Amazon and Walmart
in the United States
[Applause]
[Music]
and now comes an obvious question what
has led to the sudden success of these
Chinese apps
one of the key reasons is that there is
a lot of competition in China's domestic
Market the fierce competition requires
these Chinese companies to keep making
their products better to take on Rivals
and now the same products have become as
good or better in some ways than
American apps secondly Chinese companies
are leading the race when it comes to
creating personalized recommendation
algorithms they can help cater to users
preferences
the world may be talking only about
security risks related to Tick Tock but
these apps could also be vulnerable to
data privacy breaches recently an
executive at the think tank founded by
former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said
these popular Chinese apps could post
similar challenges particularly with
respect to data harvesting and data
exploitation
on the other hand there are people who
feel that these concerns are exaggerated
what do you think
next on my list is nothing well I'm
talking about the london-based
technology company they have come up
with a new pair of wireless earbuds the
nothing here too it's the second
generation of their earphones before you
plan to buy this product we say watch a
review
the first thing that we notice is how a
product looks
to our surprise it doesn't look
different from its previous iteration
the earbuds are encased in a similar
see-through body which means you can see
all the tech and Engineering that goes
into it
including microphones magnets and
circuit board
they look cool and exude style but we
think it would have been better had the
company made major changes to the design
language
having said that the case is slightly
smaller and lighter than its predecessor
in fact the earbuds are also a bit
lighter than the previous version
but we expected more improvements on the
design front
well the design is a crucial Factor but
how does it perform
the earbuds fit well in the ear in fact
they are less likely to drop even when
you jog or jump
but you might have to struggle with
controls initially
you have to pinch the stem to answer or
decline a call and double pinch to
change the song you are listening to
[Applause]
and this can sometimes disturb the fit
of the earbuds but once you get used to
these controls managing them would not
be a problem
we think touch or tap is controls would
have been better
[Music]
now let's talk about the sound quality
the nothing Air 2 generates balanced and
refined audio
compared to its predecessor the Air 2
has improved base and better sound
quality this makes for an immersive
listening experience
[Music]
the quality of calls has improved as
well one of the cool things is that the
nothing Air 2 can be connected to two
devices at the same time
[Music]
let's say a phone and a laptop
what's even more interesting they can
seamlessly switch between two connected
devices
this is smooth and convenient
the earbuds come with enhanced noise
cancellation the personalization
features allow users to customize the
sound to their listening preferences
and the app offers other different
features to improve the user experience
talking about performance how can we
miss an important indicator and that's
the battery
the nothing Air 2 promises 8 hours of
music playback with only 10 minutes of
charging
well that is super quick
the downside here is that the earphones
only run for about 4 hours if the active
noise cancellation feature is on the
earbuds can deliver 36 hours of playback
when the case is fully charged and
active noise cancellation is off this is
fairly decent when compared to its
rivals now comes the most important
question how much does it cost the
nothing year 2 is being sold at
999 rupees in India and at 149 dollars
in other markets so should you buy it
well the wireless earphones come with an
attractive design and offer a great
sound experience at this price point we
say you can go for it but we also think
it would have been a better deal had it
been priced slightly lower
[Music]
on take it out we keep bringing you
updates from the world of Robotics up
next we introduce you to a bot that is
powered by the much talked about chat
GPT watch the story and see what it can
do
look at this robot
it may look like a regular bot
but there's something unique about it
this robot is powered by chat GPT an AI
driven chatbot that can respond to a
large range of questions and simplify
complex topics
high school students and their tutors in
Cyprus have developed this robot it's
called Einstein
their aim is to harness and improve
teaching experiences in the classroom
the squad robot stands roughly the size
of a small adult and looks like a
sculpted version of the Michelin Man it
has a screen in place of a face that
tries to mimic human features with
blinks and frowns
the first piece of touchscreen it was
designed basically to combine the
movement with the brain so it's a touch
screen and also we we was not gonna be
like a game so kids can interact with
him and see what Einstein was doing now
the second screen now is directly
connected to the brain with the Chachi
PT so you see actually here what the
robot is recognizing before it sends the
signal to the computer to change the
voice so the computer also has been used
to to change the voice of the of the of
the of the robot to sound like Einstein
now the question is what can this chat
GPT powered robot do it can tell jokes
and make you laugh why did the chicken
cross the playground to get to the other
side I was the math book sad because it
had too many problems
it makes an attempt at speaking Greek
and guides a listener on how Albert
Einstein's theory of relativity can be
taught in the class
the bot also enjoys reading science
books and spending Leisure Time with his
violin teachers say the ultimate purpose
of Einstein is to incorporate it into
lesson plans
the mission of the robot is to actually
incorporate into lesson plans so
teachers can actually visit Einstein and
incorporate like a lesson plan or a
curriculum to understand actually what
Einstein was doing and it's a very
interactive experience students can ask
him questions he can answer back or he
can even facilitate the teachers to
actually deliver a lesson more
effectively
Chad GPD is redefining existing
Technologies and we can't wait to see
how far this AI chatbot goes in making
existing Technologies better and smarter
mobile phone has turned 50. it was back
in April 1973 when the cell phone
inventor Martin Cooper made the first
mobile call since then it has come a
long way but what's the future of mobile
tech here is more
[Music]
I knew that someday everybody would have
a cell phone three jokes that someday
when you were born you would be assigned
a telephone number and if they didn't
answer the phone you had died
so it is gratified to see that a
prediction come to
fruition
the mobile phone has evolved
dramatically in the last 50 years
today we have large screen phones flip
phones foldable ones they're available
in different shapes Styles and sizes
what's even more interesting we can't
imagine life without the cell phone be
it work Leisure or entertainment it's
the first thing that most of us rush to
and we know mobile phones will continue
to get better and smarter but how
exactly will the mobile technology shape
up it seems cell phone inventor Martin
Cooper has an interesting Vision in the
future we could expect the cell phone to
revolutionize education
it will revolutionize Healthcare there
is the potential I know this sounds like
an exaggeration but I watch it go within
a generation or two we are going to
conquer disease eliminate disease
record to say that one day phones will
become devices integrated into our skin
he believes such devices won't need to
be charged as our body is the perfect
charger
his vision hints at a possible future
stage of humanity where our bodies would
be augmented with powerful microchips
and sensors
the cell phone is going to be
distributed on your body at some point
it's going to be measuring your health
at all times and looking for aberrations
in that health
and there's more he also thinks that AI
could manage our phones in the future
one of the things that A change is that
your food is going to be managed by a
personal artificial intelligence your
own personal artificial intelligence it
will whatever you need something it will
either create an app for you or find the
app for you just when we thought that
the smartphone industry has reached a
saturation Point Martin Cooper sets an
optimistic vision for the future
it suggests that mobile Technology's
best days are yet to come
soon allow you to lock individual chats
NASA has revealed four astronauts for
its next moon mission the week gone by

developments and we bring you the most
interesting ones in our Tech Lab

well
WhatsApp is working on a new feature
that will enable users to lock
individual chats how by either using a
fingerprint or a password it's reported
that users will be able to view the
locked chats in a separate section
the new feature will not only hide your
text messages but will also keep your
media files private
which means images and videos that you
send in locked chats won't be saved in
the phone's Gallery automatically this
feature will be available for both
personal and group chats it has not been
rolled out yet but it will be available
in a future version of the app

artificial intelligence has been a
buzzword in the tech industry for a few
years now its potential is immense some
tech enthusiasts including Elon Musk
fear that recent advancements in AI
could pose risks to society they have
even called for a six-month pause in
developing systems that are more
powerful than chat gbt
[Music]
but Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has

There are many other Chinese-owned apps that are gaining ...,2023-04-08T07:30:08Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KissN10RdVM/hqdefault.jpg,"let's shift our Focus to China and its
popular apps Tech talk is not the only
Chinese app that you should be worried
about there are many other Chinese owned
apps that are gaining popularity and
could pose similar challenges as Tech
talk we get you more details in our next
story
talk is under Fire in many countries
there are fears that the popular Chinese
app Harvest vast amounts of user data
and shares the collected data with the
Chinese government
various lawmakers worldwide are calling
the app a national security threat as a
result several countries such as the
United States Australia Britain and New
Zealand have already banned the app from
official devices
despite such serious concerns the app
continues to grow in popularity in many
countries for instance Tick Tock now has
150 million monthly users in the US
almost half of the country's population
there is something more alarming Tick
Tock is not the only Chinese app to
conquer Western markets there are others
too and we need to talk about them
before it gets too late
according to apptopia a company that
provides analytics around apps and
websites Chinese companies own three of
the top 10 free mobile apps in the US
two of them are also the most downloaded
in the UK cap cut is the best example
it is a video editing tool optimized for
mobile editing
cap cut helps people quickly create
online videos and memes the app is owned
by the same Chinese company that owns
tiktok
and it is bite dance the second app in
question is Shane which is a global fast
fashion brand
founded by Chinese billionaire Chris Shu
Sheen had over 200 million Global
downloads in 2022
another Chinese app that is acquiring
customers globally is Teemu
it's a shopping platform owned by
Chinese e-commerce heavyweight PDD
Holdings its USP is that the online
store allows consumers to bypass
warehouse stores and buy directly from
the Chinese manufacturer as a result the
products are priced at very low prices
the app was launched in September last
year not even a year has passed and it
has rapidly outpaced Amazon and Walmart
in the United States
[Applause]
[Music]
and now comes an obvious question what
has led to the sudden success of these
Chinese apps
one of the key reasons is that there is
a lot of competition in China's domestic
Market the fierce competition requires
these Chinese companies to keep making
their products better to take on rivals
and now the same products have become as
good or better in some ways than
American apps secondly Chinese companies
are leading the race when it comes to
creating personalized recommendation
algorithms they can help cater to users
preferences
the world may be talking only about
security risks related to Tick Tock but
these apps could also be vulnerable to
data privacy breaches recently an
executive at the think tank founded by
former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said
these popular Chinese apps could post
similar challenges particularly with
respect to data harvesting and data
exploitation
on the other hand there are people who
feel that these concerns are exaggerated

that is what Chinese president Xi
Jinping had to say at the first ever
Silk Road Summit held in May 2017 in
Beijing
she hosted leaders from 29 Nations for
showcasing his cherished one belt one
road initiative that he launched in
2013.
later it was rebranded simply as the
belt and Road initiative the modern
route under the Bri seeks to connect
Asia with Africa and Europe by a land
and Maritime networks it's inspired by
the concept of the Silk Road established
during the Han Dynasty two thousand
years ago an ancient network of trade
routes that connected China to the
Mediterranean via Eurasia for centuries
thank you
with this ambitious project China aims
to stabilize its Western peripheries and
rekindle its economy
China touted it as a project of the
century with an estimated cost of over
one trillion dollars experts predicted
that China's expenses over the life of
the Bri could even touch a staggering 8
trillion dollars shocking isn't it
the project aimed at constructing
highways Bridges hydroelectric dams and
other infrastructure but of late she's
grand plan seems to be losing its
footing
the Belt Road initiative is definitely
failing and I don't think it will
survive this decade
I've been years since China's Bri is
running into several issues in its
partner countries
last year in Pakistan protests sparked
against the china-pakistan economic
Corridor in the port city of guadar
demanding for the Chinese to leave
in Sri Lanka soaring crisis and
crippling International debts have been
stirring citizen protests since 2019.
China offers the Taliban economic
support and seeks to revive business
ventures inside Afghanistan but the
taliban's activities affect the
china-pakistan economic Corridor can
China truly rely on the Taliban
and then there is this the impact of the
ongoing Ukraine war has fallen hard on
the Bri project which has indeed put a
stopper in China's expansion plans into
Western Europe
as this war has slowed down economic uh
opportunities around the globe it's
creating some for China with the supply
of of non-lethal equipment and
potentially lifted equipment down the
road but it's also slowing and causing
supply chain disruptions in other parts
of the glove that make it harder for it
to continue to be our work so in a way
it's a combination of challenges for
China
it's Bri plants in Africa have also
taken a hit with increased U.S and
European spending in the region
according to a recent report from the
green finance and Development Center in
Shanghai China's investment in the
continent related to its Global
infrastructure development strategy
dropped by a whopping 55 to 7.5 billion
last year
last but not least the trade war between
the United States and China and mounting
tensions with the West at large have
added to its woes
the Chinese economy itself has been
battered by the tight pandemic
restrictions it had imposed over the
last three years at the same time it is
also struggling to recover the debt
assistance it had made to other nations
so where is China heading now with its
bold Bri plan let's explore the not so
promising route it might be on
[Music]
beijing's multi-billion Dollar Belt and
Road initiative has been called a
Chinese Marshall Plan it is said to be a
Chinese campaign for Global dominance
[Music]
from Southeast Asia to Eastern Europe
and Africa Bri includes 71 countries
that account for half the world's
population and a quarter of global GDP
Bri led the Chinese firms to engage in
construction work across the globe on an
unparalleled scale Chinese companies
have secured more than 340 billion
dollars in construction contracts
[Music]
thank you
Chinese money has gushed into South Asia
and especially Pakistan in the past
decade Pakistan enjoys a special
economic relationship with China and the
china-pakistan economic Corridor or cpec
is regarded as the Crown Jewel of the
Bri
it will offer China the shortest access
to the markets of Central Asia Africa
the Middle East and Europe through the
deep sea port of guadar which is the
linchpin of the initiative
[Music]
although cpec was launched in 2015 local
resistance affected its pace
Pakistan realized that China's
investment is primarily about its own
economic and geopolitical objectives as
it is Commercial and Military interests
in wadar
in 2021 protests erupted in Pakistan's
Port City guadar against a severe
shortage of water and electricity and
threats to livelihoods
demonstrators including Fishers and
local workers blocked the roads they
burned tires chanted slogans and shut
down the city
the protests were part of a growing
discontent with China's presence in
guadar in which China invested billions
in infrastructure projects in January
2023 protests continued to escalate
guadar Rights Movement leader issued a
warning to Chinese Nationals to leave
the gudar port area potentially
jeopardizing economic ties between China
and Pakistan the CPAC faces its own
challenges and it's a hugely expensive
project you know 62 billion dollars
alone but then there's you know another
you know there's another potential you
know huge amounts of Investments going
in on top of just the corridor itself
and and the connection the quad report
and the like
um and so we see some slowdown in these
projects well there's no doubt that
Pakistan's instability affects China's
ability to operate effectively there as
it would any country and as it affects
the Pakistani people themselves
um the one of the report obviously is a
huge uh investment for Pakistan and for
and for China and a key part of that
that economic Corridor that China is
seeking to build with Pakistan
um and so uh you know the investment
there is huge we've seen obviously work
stoppages we've seen uh challenge we've
seen the the concern in the Pakistani
government about the debt that's being
taken on to do this
um and of course any time you have
political instability of the kind that
Pakistan has uh protests and like that's
going to make it harder to engage in
these large large-scale long-term
Economic Development projects
foreign
has shelled out large loans to countries
like Afghanistan and Pakistan to secure
its Bri dream it is also considered
Afghanistan's membership and
participation in the Bri with the
delegation from Afghanistan
participating in its Forum in 2017.
let's not forget that even before the
fall of Kabul a Taliban delegation
headed by its senior leader Mulla Abdul
ghani baradar had visited China and held
talks with Chinese foreign minister Wang
Yi
the Taliban had declared that it seized
China as a friend of Afghanistan the
taliban's complete control of
Afghanistan and withdrawal of the U.S
troops China appears to be chalking out
plans to extend its Bri to Afghanistan
and invest in the country to exploit its
Rich minerals and rare earth mines
considering China's engagement with the
Taliban will it be able to reach its Bri
goals
China sees what a lot of Nations have
seen in Afghanistan which is a country
that that needs help that wants uh wants
assistance that needs political
stability uh to empower its people and
to take advantage of economic
opportunities you know Afghanistan sits
on one of the richest deposits of
critical and rare earth minerals in the
world and has never really been able to
develop those resources because of uh
the constant worrying warring between
various various groups ethnic and
otherwise uh the constant the constant
uh flow of corruption in that country if
it's anybody's guess as to whether the
Taliban can really consolidate power and
be successful uh dollar Bond leadership
that remains in Pakistan
um you know that does create instability
in that border region creates
instability in the Northern areas which
sometimes the Pakistan military you know
asserts itself in and sometimes doesn't
so all of that absolutely will have an
impact on both China's efforts to invest
um in that in this in that Corridor that
economic corridor but also any
Investments it may or may not make
enough

on the 1st of April 2022 Sri Lankan
president gotobaya rajapaksa declared a
nationwide public emergency following
violent protests over the country's
worst economic crisis in decades
[Music]
the economic disaster is blamed on
currency shortages caused by the travel
ban imposed during the kobit 19 pandemic
which led to Sri Lanka's inability to
purchase fuel resulting in an extreme
shortage of food and essential
commodities
Colombo battles the most significant
economic crisis analysts believe China's
debt trap diplomacy is behind Sri
Lanka's mounting debt woes
China lent billions over the past decade
for infrastructure projects like the
hambantoda port and a Coal Power Plant
in Sri Lanka Sri Lanka later asked China
to restructure debt payments of about
3.5 billion dollars has China turned a
blind eye after deluding the island
country in a financial trap
I think Sri Lanka was a a big black eye
for the for the for the Belt Road
initiative that would make other states
uh leery about accepting these large
loans uh that they can't repay and China
is not going to be uh working working
later on on adjusting the terms I think
it was a a major embarrassment for the
program and uh you know it certainly
hurt Chinese relationships with Sri
Lanka it's making the World Bank upset
because China's not being responsible in
addressing the dire debt situation of
these nations

on the 24th of February 2022 Russia
invaded and occupied parts of Ukraine
the war triggered a massive shock to the
global economy and trembled stability of
China's PRI plans in Russia
[Music]
China's Bri investments in Russia fell
to zero for the first time indicating
beijing's reluctance to incur sanctions
in the wake of the Russia Ukraine war it
was reported Beijing struck no deals
with Russian entities under the Bri
program in 2022 however a year earlier
in 2021 Russia and China signed deals
worth about 2 billion dollars
and not just Russia Bri's westward
expansion of China looks bleak amid the
Russia Ukraine war according to China
shenshin international a domestic credit
rating agency the Russia Ukraine
conflict has heavily impacted the
progress of the Bri China Europe Freight
rail Services through Ukraine have been
disrupted Chinese projects in Ukraine
are valued at 6.64 billion dollars their
progress has been stalled the Bri had
presented tremendous opportunities in
terms of trade and growth for Europe but
with the ongoing War several projects
under the Bri have been thrown into
disarray
I believe that China does not want to
see Russia lose the Ukraine war and
China is happy to blame the war on NATO
and the United States but I believe
China hates its War it's been bad for
its economic and political relationships
it threatens its trade relationships
with Western Europe
[Music]
and then in February on the occasion of
the first anniversary of Russia's
invasion of Ukraine China proposed a 12
point peace plan to end the war many
analysts see this move of Beijing as an
opportunity in disguise
there'd probably be a BRI effort in
Ukraine right now if there was not a war
and I think that perhaps an objective of
this China peace plan is that China
would like to rebuild Ukraine and Loan
in huge amounts of money that would give
China a foothold in this European power
[Music]
the Continental Africa China has lent
hundreds of billions of dollars as part
of the belt and Road initiative in
Zambia China commissioned over three
major infrastructure projects in
Ethiopia China Finance the Aisha wind
power project under the Bri scheme in
Ghana China's most significant
investment was the construction of the
400 megawatt buoy Dam in 2013.
these projects reflect China's
heightened activities in the region but
it came with risks
one of these is the Western interest in
the continent in June 2021 the U.S and
all G7 countries launched the build-back
better World better known as b3w to meet
the infrastructure needs of low and
middle-income countries particularly in
Africa b3w aims to invest 40 trillion
dollars in developing nations including
Africa by 2035. these developments may
have altered China's plans in recent
years Beijing is no longer funding big
projects in African countries Big Ticket
projects under the Belton Road
initiative have been shell according to
a report by an international law firm
Chinese Bank financing for
infrastructure projects in Africa under
Bri fell from 11 billion in 2017 to 3.3
billion in 2020. another report said
only 4.5 billion worth of investment was
attracted by the sub-Saharan countries
in 2022 compared with 8.1 billion in
2021 while no new funding was announced
by China last year for connectivity
projects Germany and other countries
secured large deals including an 8.7
billion dollar project in Egypt
problem of force with Chinese behavior
in Africa is as as the African nations
have learned is it's really about
resource extraction it's about going
there getting access to materials
bringing in Chinese labor not even using
African labor and then taking material
out so yes they're building roads
they're building Parliament buildings
and the light they're building ports but
those roads and those ports are being
used to extract resources and take them
to China right and make these nations
dependent on China for the money to
build those roads and to pay those debts
back and then depending on China for
that for that for that uh that supply
and that outflow of goods as well and so
in a lot of ways I think the African
nations are really waking up to the
reality of what China is and how China
is operating there they've invested
heavily in countries with that have
access to critical minerals since China
is trying to Corner the market on these
minerals China is extracting some of
these minerals from within China but
some of them are not available in China
and they have to be obtained from other
nations such as Africa
[Music]
the largest commercial conflict in
modern history the china-u.s trade War
started in 2018 the then president
Donald Trump accused China of unfair
trading practices while China claimed
the U.S was trying to restrict its rise
as a global economic power
the trade War caused economic pain on
both sides it also weighed heavily on
the global economy due to additional
import tariffs levied by both China and
the U.S the prolonged conflict reached a
turning point in January 2020 with the
signing of the phase one trade deal but
the damage was done
[Music]
think it's hurt the Chinese economy and
I think it's going to get worse there's
now a new Committee in the U.S House of
Representatives that is investigating
the threat from China there's another
subcommittee looking at China's
responsibility for the covid virus and
and this is going to lead to more
impediments on U.S China trade the by
Administration has put a a ban exporting
computer chips to China
foreign
19 pandemic caused a wave of economic
crises in China's belt and Road
initiative there has been a dramatic
drop in export revenues in China China's
strict zero code with policies weighed
down its economy and stalled Global
Supply chains several Bri countries
facing High external debt are also hit
hard by the pandemic
according to a report in 2022 under the
Bri China dumped over one trillion
dollars as loans to nearly 150
developing and least developed countries
at high rates of Interest becoming the
world's largest official creditor for
the first time
many of the projects have stalled and
beijing's Loans have gone sour Beijing
is poised to confront multiple debt
crises in countries where it is heavily
invested due to Bri China has loaned
about 105 billion dollars between uh
uh 2019 and 2021
and many much of that debt has been to
states that were bad debts and has
responded by just loaning more money and
refusing to restructuring the debt but
China is facing at least five trillion
dollars in debt needed by local
governments and cities because of
problems with investment
problems with property problems with the
banks

accusations that Belden Road as a dead
trap designed to take control of local
infrastructure have further tainted its

commercial interest rates that countries
have to pay within a fixed number of
years loans are far more secretive the
country does not disclose data on loans

climate agency reveals that the previous
eight years were the warmest on record
Copernicus reports said that the
temperatures were above average over
Southern and Central Europe while they
were below average for over most of
Northern Europe
the melting of ice is continuing due to
the rising temperatures which in turn is
Raising sea levels the climate agency
said that the sea levels are reaching
dangerous tipping points
the satellite images revealed that the
Antarctic sea ice extent was 28 percent
lower than the average and has touched a
45-year low the ice extent is
continuously shrinking a dangerous sign
for the world the situation in the
Arctic is also not very great with the
sea extend touching the fourth lowest
for March on record which was four
percent below average
in March a report from the United
Nations cautioned that despite a rapid
reduction in Planet warming emissions
global temperatures will continue to
rise causing the record-breaking
temperatures experienced to be
considered relatively mild in the next
three to four decades
build a report we on world is one
now at the end of the last ice age parts
of an enormous eye shade covering
Eurasia retreated to a startling 2000
feet per day more than the length of the
Empire State Building this is according
to a recent study that happens what
scientists previously thought were the
upper speed limits for ice sheet Retreat
the finding that may shed light on how
quickly ice in Greenland and Antarctica
could melt and Rise Global and raise
Global sea levels in today's warming
World scientists said that the finding
based on sea floor sediment formations
from the last ice age was a warning from
the past they said that the discovery
shows that some ice sheets in Antarctica
including the Doomsday through its
glacier
good stuff for periods of Rapid collapse
in the near future further accelerating
the rise of sea levels the rising oceans
are among the greatest long-term impacts
of global heating because hundreds of
major cities around the world are on
coastlines and are increasingly
vulnerable to storm surges and flooding
the Western Arctic ice sheet may already
have passed the point at which major
losses are unstoppable which could lead
eventually to several inches of sea
level rise they found melting speeds of
between 50 meters a day to us to 600
meters a day that is up 20 times faster
than the speediest retreat recorded
previously by satellites previous
previously the population in West
Antarctica had been recorded as
receiving up to 30 meters a day an
expert from the first time Institute of
climate impact research in Germany said
that faster Retreat rates than presently
observed are possible under specific
circumstances the implications of such
rapid Retreats are serious given the
irreversible nature of ice sheet retreat
moving on now Midwest tornadoes
typically occur later in Spring but this
year's early Spate of severe weather
continues a trend of severe storms
across the United States which is a
clear sign of climate change as seen
over the past few years as the Midwest
and Southern United States brace for
another wave of fair storms at least
five died and
others were injured in Southeast
Missouri after at least one tornado and
other storms tore through the area while
First Responders from multiple agencies
come through destroyed homes and
businesses in rural
Bollinger County Missouri governor said
that there is a long journey ahead on
the path of recovery
we started coordinating as the storms
are still rolling in because we knew
that there would be a need so what we've
been doing over the past couple of days
is preparing meals in our commercial
kitchen and then pushing them out into
the community so working with other
agencies like the Salvation Army like
Goodwill with the city and other
emergency management groups to get food
and resources out where they need to go
now apart from five deaths and other
five injuries were reported in over 87
structures faced damages with 12
buildings that were completely destroyed
reported the Missouri State Highway
Patrol trees were uprooted and homes
were turned into piles of splinters and
one building was flipped onto its side
Drone footage also showed emergency

before so I really didn't know what it
sounded like but I heard it sound like a
freight train that's exactly what it
sounds like and there's stuff hitting
the house my son come flying down the

screaming we got everybody down in the
lower bathroom and uh his stuff was just
hitting the house and I didn't know if
we were going to lose the house or not
it was it was a horrible experience we
were all scared
now the National Weather Service began
issuing tornado warnings Tuesday evening
in Iowa and Illinois it said a confirmed
twister was spotted southwest of Chicago
near Brian Illinois however no damage
was immediately reported the storms were
expected to hammer some areas already
hit by severe weather forecasts hinted
at dozens of tornadoes in areas that
killed at least 32 people last week
Arkansas over and Illinois States had
been worst hit dangerous my dreams were

moving on on unprecedented series of
atmospheric Rivers has replenished most
of California's reservoirs dumping
record amounts of rain and snow and
busting a severe three-year doubt some
reservoirs are so full that water is now
being released to make room for storm
runoff and melting snow that could cause
flooding this spring and summer here's a
report for more details
11 of California 17 major reservoirs are
now above their historic averages
following three years of drought that
drained them to dangerously low levels
Reservoir levels are now seven percent
above average according to the
California Department of Water Resources
Lake Oroville the state's second largest
Reservoir after Lake Shasta is about 16
above its historic average
this after period when water levels had
dropped so low that its hydroelectric
dams stopped generating power
managers are now releasing water from
the Oroville Dam Spillway which was
rebuilt after it broke apart during
heavy rain in February 2017 and forced
the evacuation of more than 180 000
people Downstream along the Feather
River
so a lot of reservoirs we had more
snowpack in the central and southern
part of the Sierra so all of those
reservoirs are releasing into the
streams they are full they are making
releases to accommodate additional
snowmelt that will be coming in even in
the northern part of the state Lake
Oroville which is a big Reservoir
started making releases to allow for
incoming inflows and snowmelt over time
so our reservoirs are looking really
good
last year nearly all of California was
in drought including at extreme and
exceptional levels Wells were running
dry farmers were following fields and
cities were restricting residential
water usage but the water picture has
changed dramatically since over the past
few months when California was battered
by a dozen atmospheric rivers that
caused widespread flooding damaged homes
infrastructure and dumped as much as 700
inches of snow in the Sierra Nevada
mountains
California went from the three driest
years on record to the three wettest
weeks on record when we were catapulted
into our rainy season in January of this
year so hydrologically California is no
longer in a drought except for very
small portions of the state near the
northern part of the state which just
really missed this long line of storms
the Abundant precipitation is prompted
California government to lift some of
the state's water restrictions and stop
asking people to voluntarily reduce
their water usage by 15 percent
however the government has not declared
the drought over because there are still
water shortages near the California
organ border and parts of Southern
California that rely on the struggling
Colorado River
cities and irrigation districts that
provide water to Farms will receive a
big boost in water supplies from the
Central Valley Project a network of
reservoirs and canals that Supply water
across California
some farmers are using the storm water
to replenish underground aquifiers that
had become depleted after years of
pumping and drought left Wells dry
the storms have created a record
snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains
according to State data the snowpack's
water content is 236 percent of its
normal average and nearly triple in the
southern Sierra
now as the weather warms up water
managers are preparing for that snowpack
to melt unleashing a torrent water
that's expected to cause flooding in the
Sierra Foothills and Central Valley
well we know there will be flooding as a
result of the snowmelt there's just too
much snowmelt to be accommodated in our
rivers and channels and keeping things
between levees
although the state officials
the current abundance of water LED them
revert to wasting water in the era of
climate change one extremely wet here
could be followed by several dryers
returning the state to drought

died in more than a million suffered
power outages after an ice storm hit
Canada's two most populated provinces
ahead of a holiday weekend bringing
freezing rain and strong winds that
topple trees and weighed down power
lines just under a million people did
not have power in Quebec in about 110

combined for both provinces had crossed
at least 1.3 million earlier in the day
the two provinces account for more than
half of Canada's total population of
about 39 million electricity providers
in both provinces were working to
restore power but repairs were expected
to continue for days meaning many
Canadians could spend Easter weekend in

uh the province and the City of Montreal
have a tremendous amount of great teams
on the ground doing work I had to look
at that because uh is on it uh but we
will be there to to support as necessary
I think the most important thing is to
see yet again what happens in times of
difficulty neighbors helping neighbors
are someone who's got power and the
other don't we see them helping out this
is going to be a time for us all to pull
together but to be safe and to uh and to
make it through as we always do
now Montreal is among the worsted areas
in Quebec accounting for about half of
the total outages in the largely
french-speaking province
it's a very difficult moment for uh for
much hours for people across the region
who've been hit by this ice storm
obviously the power
the power being down for so many folks
uh there's a trees coming down turning
buildings and cars and whatnot is of
course an ongoing concern

now growing numbers of loggerhead sea
turtles are nesting and laying eggs on
Western Mediterranean beaches scientists
say this could be a case of climate
change causing habitat expansion of a
threatened species climate change is
usually detrimental to Wildlife but the
warming Waters have apparently become
more suitable for the turtles another
Factor probably benefiting the world's
largest hard shell turtle are protection
programs in countries like Spain and
Cape Verde from 1990 to the year 2012
the nas average less than three a year
but now marine biologists from France
Italy Spain and Tunisia are discovering
far more Nets nests in the beaches of
their respective countries they say they
identified 80 phones in 2020.
one of the main causes to explain this
trend could be global warming climate
change
areas where Turtles never used to reach
because they were not advocate for
laying eggs are getting warmer and
perhaps now that these areas are warmer
they are now advocate
loggerhead turtles inhabit the warmer
parts of the world oceans and present
and are present in the Mediterranean Sea
pardon me historically they have mainly
inhabited in a handful of places such as
Florida Oman Mozambique and Western
Australia they tend to return to their
birthplace to lay eggs every few years
researchers say that the Mediterranean
has become 1.3 degrees Celsius warmer
between 1982 and 2019 and successful
Turtle protection programs launched
globally in the past decades have also
boosted the turtle population in many
areas this happened this helped lift
their status to above endangered a
mature specimen can measure 90
centimeters and weigh 150 kilograms

now as per the United States National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
methane in the atmosphere had its fourth
highest annual increase in 2022 carbon
dioxide typically gets more attention
for its role in climate change but
scientists are particularly concerned
about methane methane traps a lot more
heat about 87 times more than carbon
dioxide in a 20-year time scale methane
a gas emitted from sources including
landfills oil and natural gas systems
and livestock has increased particularly
quickly since 2020. it shows no signs of
slowing experts say the time is running
out to meet warming limits in Paris
agreement and avoid the most destructive
impacts of climate change scientists
continue to discover that methane
emissions from both the fossil fuels
industry and the environment are largely
underestimated the exact amounts of
methane that have come from human
activity versus natural environments
over the past few years not currently
known but scientists say that humans
have little control over ecosystems that
start in emitting more methane due to
warming scientists are also
investigating how stubborn three-year La
Nina pattern could have influenced
methane emissions due to higher levels
of rainfall in tropical Wetlands the
International Energy agency estimates
that over 70 percent of the 2022 methane
emissions could be reduced with existing
technology

and it is a bigger deal when it involves
something supremely confidential
confidential documents
and an even bigger deal when it is a
wartime leak
I am of course talking about the Russia
Ukraine war and this leak concerns a
spring offensive
this war plan was supposed to be a
secret but now it's all over the
internet all over social media
you heard that right top secret
documents have made their way to social
media the NATO's top secret plan has now
been leaked Russia knows all about the
next big move Ukraine spring offensive
is no longer under the wraps
who leaked the plan how did it manage to
make its way to social media how did the
confidential documents get leaked that's
our top Focus tonight
also on the show for you will there be a
military coup in Pakistan we tell you
what's brewing and why there are growing
concerns over things going out of hand
this time
amid the rising israel-palestine
intentions two killed in West Bank we
also tell you how the conflict has
filled over to Lebanon
an Indonesian Shaman has been accused of
killing 12 people
what's his story why did he kill his
clients
a probe into Airbnb customer experiences
has Unearthed horror stories we get you
a detailed report
[Music]
the word classified means confidential
it means secret it means something that
needs to be tightly guarded
and if we are talking about wartime then
any leak of secret plants is treason
but the Ukraine war is proving to be an
exception in all sorts of ways
I'm case in point being the NATO's War
plants
there's breaking news
they have been leaked
the plan mentions a secret spring
offensive by Ukraine against the
Russians this great secret plan is no
longer a secret it's out in fact it's
everywhere on social media
on telegram on Twitter
some of you may have even received it as
a WhatsApp forward message can you
believe that
you know Pages after Pages detailing how
Ukraine has planned to win back the Lost
Cities and how the NATO would be
assisting Kiev
and now Russia knows it all
Moscow must be laughing all the way to
the battlefield
after all it knows Ukraine's biggest
secret
but the question is who exactly goofed
up and how
how did something so sensitive get
leaked who was in charge of protecting
such a top secret
that is easily answered officials
sitting in the Pentagon
it appears that someone from within the
American establishment has leaked the
plan with details of Ukraine's next move
but is it an act of sabotage
you see one of the files was marked
secret another top secret
this one
let's just zoom in have a look at what
it says
status of the conflict as of the 1st of
March
on the right of the paper as you can see
you have details of combat effective
battalions
the Eastern grouping of troops the
central grouping of troops
so on and so forth you also have other
political or Supply related information
and on the left side this top secret
document mentioned something on the
lines of on the 28th of February Belgium
reported that it was unwilling to donate
aircraft to Ukraine but will consider
providing maintenance and logistic aid
for other countries deliveries
these are differences within the NATO
these are nitty-gritties regarding
NATO's operations and none of this
should be public knowledge
but now it is
go to see some Edward Snowden perhaps
sitting in the Pentagon
let me also quickly tell you what else
has been leaked
you have details of weapon deliveries
you know from NATO to to Ukraine from
NATO to Ukraine and then you have
details of Troops Battalion strengths as
well
sure the documents do not mention the
exact places Ukraine plans to Target or
how it plans to attack
but these documents give enough data
points for an expert to join the dots
and read between the lines
one of the documents for example
summarizes training schedules of the
Ukrainian Army you heard that right
so if Russia tomorrow wants to Stage an
ambush it knows exactly where to find
the Ukrainian troops
do you realize the extent of damage that
this leak actually has done
some documents for example offer clues
about military formation
so tomorrow if Ukraine still decides to
go ahead with this plan they will find
the Russian army waiting to welcome them
at the battlefield
you see the spring offensive was
supposed to be as early as next month
and now Ukraine and the NATO need to go
back to the drawing board and start from
scratch
so to call the league disastrous will be
an understatement of course
it's bizarre to see the least
it's so bizarre that it has led to
speculation about the motives
was this all on purpose
but then again why would America reveal
its own plan
but is there a secret mall sitting
within the Pentagon America's War
headquarters who wanted to Scupper this
military offensive and thereby help
Moscow
or is this a more calculated move from
within the Deep American state which has
concluded that Ukraine is burning
weapons at an Irreplaceable pace
and the U.S may not May no longer be
able to supply weapons in time
is there a section of the establishment
which is not fully supportive of Ukraine
in the absence of Hard Answers such
speculation is only inevitable
and here's what's not speculation
as I speak the Pentagon is scrambling to
plug the gaps you know to avoid further
leaks it is trying to delete images from
social media
as if anyone could ever do that
successfully
I think the officials have forgotten
something called the download feature
you know that 21st century technology
has blessed people with
and it goes without saying Russia is
having the last laugh
Russia after all is making the most of
this leak both in terms of gathering
Intel slash information also both the
bolstering its information Warfare
have a look at what the New York Times
is reporting
military analysts said the documents
appear to have been modified in certain
parts from their original format
overstating American estimates of
Ukrainian War dead
and understating the estimates of the
Russian troops killed
like I said Russia is having a field day
and the Wall Street Journal thing
Russian propaganda channels photoshopped
at least one of the documents
there is one fact which is indisputable
this leak at the cost of Ukraine will go
down in history
and also attract ridicule for ages
not just ridicule it will generate books
for nothing attracts the readers more
than conspiracy theories
welcome to the next Deluge of conspiracy
theories
and staying on with your Ukraine how
many of you have heard or read about the
Antonov
an225 Maria
it is or rather was the world's biggest
and heaviest plane
the plane was built in the year 1988 and
ever since it has gained a cult status
in the world of Aviation
Maria captured the imagination of
Aviation enthusiasts across the world
it was Ukraine's soft power after all
and its symbol of pride
but when the war broke out the plane
found itself being trapped in a hangar
in Ukraine's hostile Airport
it was caught in a crossfire between the
Russian and the Ukrainian forces and the
jumbo jet was destroyed
Ukraine is planning to rebuild it not
just that it is also punishing those
responsible for its destruction
our next report telling you more
Maria means dream and the Antonov an-225
Maria was nothing short of a dream
this jumbo jet turned heads every time
it took off and landed and it's not hard
to understand why
this is how spectacular the an-225 was
Maria's wingspan was the size of a
football field most aircraft have two
engines Mia had six turbofan engines
the plane could carry cargo weighing up
to 250 000 kilos
this Aviation Marvel was designed to
transport Soviet Union's space shuttle
bura
the an225 made its first flight during
the Soviet era on the 21st of December
1988.
and the plane was destroyed in February
2022 after it was caught in the
crossfire between two erstwhile Soviet
States Ukraine and Russia
this is what MIA looks like today
charred and destroyed like much of
Ukraine four days into the war Kiev
pledged to rebuild the plane today it is
going after those accountable for the
Jumbo's safety
this is Sergey bushkov he is the former
Chief of Antonov the now state-owned
Ukrainian company that had manufactured
the Maria Ukraine has arrested bushkov
he's being charged with negligence
leading to the destruction of the plane
but why you ask Ukraine alleges that
bishkov failed to approve an order that
would have flown the Maria to Leipzig
Germany in the lead-up to the battle he
is accused of failing to evacuate the
plane Ukraine's Security Service also
alleges that bishkov did not have the
jumbo jet correctly insured insurance or
not Ukraine says it will be rebuilding
the jet but can it really there's a lot
of money involved also there's
technology there was just one an-225
plane manufactured while its fuselage
and tail Unit were assembled at
antonov's facility in Kiev its wing
Center section and outer Wing panels
were assembled in Tashkent the plane
like we mentioned was a Soviet era
Marvel
will Ukraine be able to replicate the
dream alone also rebuilding it will need
anything between 500 million dollars to
800 million dollars will Ukraine have
that kind of money to spare in its
post-war years
our next story concerns a question that
is buzzing in Islamabad
will there be a military coup in
Pakistan
will the Pakistan Army return to power
and what is the basis for this question
you wonder
some recent statements by the Pakistan
government
the first one is from Sharif himself the
prime minister of Pakistan
the second is from Bilal puto sardari
the country's foreign minister
in recent days they have both hinted at
getting the Army involved to solve the
ongoing political mess in the country
let me break it down for you I'll start
with Shiva Sharif
earlier this week he rejected the
Pakistan Supreme Court's order to hold
elections in the Punjab Province by the
14th of May
in fact his cabinet overruled the top
Court's decision calling it biased and
unwarranted
and guess what he plans to do next
he says he will take the Pakistan Army's
support to create pressure on the
country's judiciary
you heard that right
and how exactly do we view this
is Sharif trying to pit the Army against
the Judiciary
well it certainly seems like that
earlier this evening he even held a
meeting of Pakistan's National Security
committee this meeting was in essence a
bit to seek the support of the army
but support to do what exactly
to make the Judiciary delay the
elections in Punjab province
and who all were present in this meeting
well besides Pakistan's Federal
ministers there was a general assemunir
the chief of Army staff
General sahir shamshad Mirza the
chairman joined Chiefs of Staff
committee
and the various heads of the Air Force
and the Navy
and what exactly did they discuss
the details are yet to be released but
like I said the focus was dealing the
elections and overriding the Supreme
Court's order
not just that reports also say that the
idea of imposing an emergency could also
have been raised at the meeting an
emergency you heard that right
it was fast floated by bilaval Bhutto
zadari
a few days back remember he said that if
the current crisis persists Pakistan May
face an emergency-like situation we told
you about this he also added that he is
apprehensive about the imposition of
Martial law in the country
and how should this be viewed
was this a hint
an indication of what's about to come
are the leaders of Pakistan really
mulling the imposition of martial law
here's another clue and this is what
Bilal said two days back that if the
political turmoil does not end neither
shaiba Sharif nor Imran Khan will be
able to rule
he added that in the end the people of
Pakistan will have to bear the brunt the
consequences
and what do we make of that
is there a behind the scenes effort to
get the military in power
has the Pakistan government sensed that
the PTI will not give up
has teamed up with the Army to battle
Imran Khan
Imran Khan certainly thinks so
this is what he posted on Twitter
recently let me quote from it
today we stand at a turning point in our
constitutional history
where we can be like turkey or become
another Myanmar
everyone must choose with whether they
stand as PTI does with the Constitution
rule of law and democracy or with a
corrupt Mafia law of the Jungle and
fascism
I repeat Pakistan has to choose whether
it wants to become turkey or Myanmar
turkey a country whose leader Richard
type erdogan is Imran Khan's role model
and Myanmar a country that is under the
rule of the Myanmar junta
what was he hinting at what is he
talking about
has he sensed the pmlm's intentions
does he also fear the imposition of
martial law
whatever be the case all is certainty
not well in Pakistan the Shabbat Sharif
government is unable to reign in the PTI
it knows it is sinking in this political
Quagmire
and it wants to take Imran Khan along
with it
we now have the latest updates coming in
from Israel
two women have been shot dead in the
occupied West Bank another one has

tensions have been flaring up between
Israel and Palestine

as well

Israel 25 were intercepted by the air
defense systems
and today Israel has retaliated
Israel's military targeted Hamas camps
in southern Lebanon residents around the
area of rashidir refugee camp reported
hearing three loud Bluffs it is the
second most populated Palestinian camp
in Lebanon
listening to what the residents had to
say
we are sleeping at night and we suddenly
heard a sound we woke up and the roof
started to fall on us my brothers were
sleeping here we ran outside and
sharpened soil and stone started flying
around us
have a look at these visuals now
houses and vehicles to destroy it walls
and windows were blasted by the powerful
explosions
there was dirt smashed glass windows in
people's homes
Israel said its Jets hit 10 targets
including tunnels and weapons
manufacturing sites of Hamas
but this victim had a different story to
tell
you if I was in the car I would have
died money in the car can be redeemed
but what does the citizen have to do in
all of this what are the children my
two-year-old sister my parents and
siblings have to do in all of this this
is a residential area there's nothing
here but a home crops a building and
some agricultural land
what exactly is happening
is the war expanding
two days ago the conflict flared up
between Israel and Palestine but now
Lebanon is also getting involved
the last night attack was the biggest
since 2006 when Israel fought a war with
the Hezbollah movement
is the whirlpool effect pulling in the
neighborhood as well
let's not forget how it all started two
days ago is relatively stormed into
Al-Aqsa mosque in the pre-dawn hours
in the holy month of ramzan when those
who fast eat the only meal of their day
what triggered this
well there were different sides to the
story Israel blames it on the worshipers
it says the Mast agitators locked
themselves inside the holy site that
They Carried fireworks sticks and stones
so the police was forced to enter the
compound but the worshipers tell
something else
that they were praying when the police
busted in
and started hurling stunned grenades at
them more than 350 people were arrested
and removed from the mosque
but the storm did not pass violence
erupted once again in the Al-Aqsa mosque
this time in the late evening hours
police entered the compound once again
and tried to evacuate the worshipers
they threw stunned grenades and fired
rubber bullets
why was this happening
well the Israeli police says worshipers
were hiding weapons
that they were carrying firearms
so my question is where are these
weapons
did the police recover any firearms from
the worshipers
no evidence has been found as per
reports
the police got hold of firecrackers at
the most
instead we have videos of the police
beating up the worshipers of people
being hit by stunned grenades of the
injured being carried away on stretchers
after all it is the Israeli police we
are talking about
the one that is controlled by a hard
liner like ethemar benguer
but it did not end there in response to
the raid Hamas fired Rockets into Israel
from the Gaza Strip seven to nine
Rockets were fired sirens on Israel's
border were blaring
the country's Iron Dome intercepted most
of these rockets and then the Lebanese
missiles came
The Exchange triggered a rebuke from the
Prime Minister beneman Netanyahu this is
what he said
recently I have made it clear that our
enemies should not misjudge us the
internal debate in Israel will not
prevent us from taking action against
them wherever and whenever necessary all
of us without exception are united on
this we have no intention of changing
the Status Quo on the Temple Mount we
want the situation to be calm and we
will take strong action against
extremists who use violence there
regarding the aggression against us on
other fronts we will strike our enemies
and they will pay the price for any Act
of aggression
Netanyahu Coalition is filled with
right-wingers and hardliners
they told you about Ben guerrer
but you see he is not the only one
there are hardliners on both the sides
are they provoking a third in the father
for those unrest an interfather is
basically a rebellion
a widespread resistance movement
Israel has seen at least two of them the
first one started in the year 1987.
it ended in 1993.
there were protests violent riots and
Rocket attacks thousands of Palestinians
and hundreds of Israeli troops lost
their lives
and the second one came in the year
2000.
this one ended in 2005.
are things headed towards a third in the
father
the Al-Aqsa mosque was raided twice in a
Day protests broke out rockets and
missiles rained down in multiple parts
and now Lebanon is also involved
will the tensions die down
or will there be another widespread
uprising
let's now take you to Indonesia
an arrest has sent shock waves across
the country whose arrests you ask
a village Shema
the police have arrested him he is
accused of killing people you heard that
right
now while that is hard to digest wait
till you hear more details the complete
story
and this is no ordinary one
the man has been accused of killing not
one not two not three but at least 12
people at least a dozen murders
he is now believed to be one of the most
prolific serial killers in the country
what really happened what are the police
saying where does the investigation
stand as of now
we break it down for you over the next
few minutes
Harry
is a 45 year old Willy shaman he has
been charged with the premeditated
murder of clients at his home
he has reportedly admitted to the police
that victims were buried on his land
but why would he do that why did he kill
his clients
well to put it simply it was all about
the money
according to the police
he promised to multiply money
how
magically that's right
he made the clients believe that through
the spells that he would be performing
their wealth their money could be
increased
and when that obviously did not happen
the clients naturally wanted him to
return their money
but instead of doing that
the shaman poisoned them
the victims were between the ages of 25
and 50 years
now just to tell you a little bit more
about this man he was previously jailed
in 2019 for counterfeit money crimes
police believe tohari had been killing
his victims since 2020.
in fact according to them he lured his
victims to his house for a ritual and
would then give them drinks that had
potassium Cyanide and a sedative
is believed to be quite popular
in Bandera nagara this is a part of the
country which has a large number of
black magic practitioners
in fact this is not the first such case
Indonesia's most prolific serial killer
is Ahmad suraji
he was also a Shema
the number of his victims 42
that's right he's strangled 42 people
this was between the years 1986 and
1997.
he was executed in 2008.
this year itself in January three
shamans were arrested
they were accused of murdering at least
nine people
and wait till you hear how the killings
were carried out
they were given pesticide list coffee
in fact what is all the more worrying is
that money multiplying scams are common
in the country there are also strong
Community beliefs in the occult
a lot of people in the country Believe
In Black Magic there is a lot of trust
that the people have in the spiritual
practitioners
and this makes the people who were
targeted vulnerable
do you own a Tesla
if yes is your Tesla spying on you
what if your activities in your own car
were to be recorded and then shared
that is exactly what's happening with
Tesla right now
our next report getting you the complete
story
owning a Tesla is one of the most
aspirational purchases for most Auto
enthusiasts
questions
the car maker spell heading Innovation
and leaving its competitors behind
that involves a whole set of gizmos that
allows the car to drive itself fully
among them are cameras used to collect
the car's surroundings and the cabin
that's exactly what's happening at Tesla
a Reuters report suggests that employees
at the EV maker accessed footage from
the dash cams of the car and posted
about it on their internal group many of
those pictures and videos included
intimate moments involving Tesla owners
we could see inside people's garages and
their private properties so let's say
that a Tesla customer had something in
their garage that was distinctive you
know people would post those kind of
things
but this is not just a Tesla problem
almost all modern cars now come with a
whole set of features that makes them
easy to track and Snoop on
Tesla claims the user could turn off
their dash cam and block access to Tesla
receiving information from the camp but
the problem is that the space is still
unregulated Tesla has flirted with data
privacy laws in several countries
including Germany China and the
Netherlands
consumer interest groups have expressed
concern that cameras used in cars should
be collecting data from public spaces
and recording passersby without their
knowledge
while Tesla has addressed issues as and
when they come up the leadership team
has failed to take preventive action
against any issues that could crop up
and until that happens the Auto industry
must understand that not everyone may be
willing to trade in their privacy for
the convenience when looking for a new
ride even if that is the aspirational

have you ever planned a vacation
what are the things that you definitely
look for while planning your vacation
I'm sure a good accommodation stops the
list of your priorities
but has this thought ever crossed your
mind that good accommodation may not
necessarily be safe
what if the place to stay at cancels
your booking at the last minute after
you've already traveled Halfway Around
the World
what if you are asked to do chores clean
up the place as well
what if there is a hidden camera
infringing upon your privacy
what if someone else has the key to your
room as well
sounds quite scary does it not
but unfortunately some of these horrific
scenarios these nightmares actually
turned out to be true
all of this happened in multiple airbnbs
around the world a report has compiled
these incidents it was recently released
and ever since
the shares of the hospitality giant nose
dived our next report telling you more
in the Year 2007 two young roommates in
San Francisco ran out of money to pay
their rent
a conference in the town saved the day
for them all hotels around were booked
and attendees were looking for a place
to stay
so the two broke roommates arranged for
three air bed mattresses in their
apartment
and accommodated three guests fast
forward 15 years the idea is now a 72
billion dollar company Airbnb or air bed
and breakfast is a giant Online
Marketplace it connects people in need
of accommodation with the people who are
willing to rent their place today it has
a presence across the world it has
served over 1 billion customers but the
company may have run out of its luck an
investigation by the bear cave has
compiled numerous scandals and horror
stories related to the platform many
guests have shared stories of miserable
experiences at some of the poorly
managed airbnbs the list begins with
people having their bookings canceled by
the host at the last minute and then
there are those who had to do chores
clean up the place and water the plants
in numerous cases guests have discovered
cameras in their rooms in at least one
case the host hit the camera inside an
adapter and Wi-Fi router the camera
remained hidden for at least a year and
captured at least 2 100 photos and
videos of the guests without their
consent there are reports of people
making copies of the keys to the bnbs in
one such case one of the previous guests
came back to the rented space to
sexually assault the person currently
staying there and what did Airbnb do it
paid seven million dollars to the lady
and evaded a lawsuit in some other
unfortunate cases guests have even died
from poisoning during their stay a group
of three lost their lives in a Mexico
City Airbnb late last year a 19 month
old child was killed in a Florida BNB
this was due to fentanyl poisoning the
parents have sued the company and the
host these stories of horror topped with
growing competition to Airbnb from the
market let the bear cave reports to
conclude that the company's future may
not be as good as its past
airbnb's shares have dropped as much as
by 4 percent after the report came out

moving on for now a rare speech or
species of canneries is under threat in
Britain
it's not what you're thinking it's not
because of climate change or habitat
destruction
it is because of a new law
the species may become a thing of past
courtesy brexit
before you start scratching your head
wondering what brexit's got to do with
these birds let me tell you what this is
all about
these calories are cute fluffy yellow
plumes
they are the smallest among all other
Cannery Birds
they were first bred in Scotland in the
mid 20th century because of their
delicate physical features and their
color
these birds are considered very fancy
they are often associated with Easter
and are very famous among European bird
enthusiasts
but thanks to a new law
the UK might not be able to see these
birds as much
and why is that
well under this new rule each bird now
needs to be tested and certified before
it can travel between the UK and the
European Union you heard that right
and not for one or two but for five
diseases
this new rule is Harsh on bird breeders
and exporters
they are losing sales to Northern
Ireland
in fact hobbyists will find it difficult
to participate in bird competitions
you see the birds need to test negative
for infections
and for that the wets need to carry out
a test
a swab test of their throat and went
which is an uphill task
experts say if you swab a cannery throat
it's quite likely that you kill it
you may not find any disease after a
test
but you might end up losing your bird
altogether
bird keeping is a hobby for britons who
have relatively low incomes
in fact tens of thousands of hobbyists
in the UK preserve important and
historic breeding lines of British Birds
this includes the Scots fancy Yorkshire
five
London Cannery as well
many of the breeds dating back to the
19th century
in fact they were exported to fellow
bird fanciers in Europe
to spread their bloodlines
and also to ensure Gene pools for all
bird lovers across the European Union
and now this new rule threatens this
Exchange
if the birds are not exchanged their
Gene pools will lose potency and vigor
and this can put many historic British
birds in peril
you see the bird trade is important for
introducing new Bloodlines
for conserving biodiversity
but what is even the point of this new
rule
to the UK and the European Union not
have better things to consider more
pressing problems to address

our cover story tonight is about the
British Monarchy
you see the countdown has started for
King Charles III's coronation
and before that big day Charles wants to
dig deep into history
in fact he has ordered a probe into the
monarchy's link to slavery
I know what you must be thinking what is
even the point of this probe what does
the king really hope to achieve
what triggered the move and why now
this and more coming up over the next
few minutes as a part of our cover story
also on the show for you tonight another
Hindu temple has been vandalized in
Canada adding to a growing list of
anti-india Acts of vandalism in the
country we get you a detailed Special

the brink of War we get to the latest
Japan has declared a war on Poland as it
tackles the hay fever Menace it is a
double whammy as the country also deals
with the worst bird flu outbreak and
runs out of land to bury chickens we get
you the complete story
on the 6th of May King Charles will
officially Ascend to the British throne
with a formal coronation
that he has already taken a decision
that could become the Hallmark of his
reign
he has ordered a probe into the links
that British royalty has had with the
slave trade
you heard that right
into whether British kings and queens
profited from the slave trade
we can give you some idea about how the
British kings and queens made money out
of slavery in one way or another by
looking at some facts now this is just a
glimpse but enough to reveal what the
establishment has kept well hidden
have you heard of the south sea bubble
well these are the details
the south sea company was formed in
1711.
what was its purpose
it aimed to consolidate the British
government's debt
you see back then Britain was engaged in
expensive Wars
and the government debt was at over 11
million dollars
so the country needed money funds the
bank of England was the sole lender to
the government
the south sea company took on and paid
off the debt
in return it was granted a monopoly on
trade between Britain and Spain in the
South Seas
particularly on the sale of slaves
but this idea had a major problem
Britain was at war with Spain it was in
no position to dictate the trade there
unless
favorable terms were reached in peace
talks which is exactly what happened
a series of treaties were signed between
1713 and 1715. they were called the
Peace of Utrecht
and as a result the south sea company
scored a monopoly in slave trade 4 800
slaves were transported to Latin America
annually
by 1718
politicians celebrities Nobles including
author Jonathan Swift and scientist
Isaac Newton had invested in the company
King George the first in fact became the
company as governor
he held a substantial shareholding
the company's share prices kept going up
but it did not last long and the market
collapsed
the company's shares plummeted to
154 dollars by the end of the year
the south sea bubble had burst
despite the collapse there was a clear
winner it was the royal family
King George the first and second made
huge profits from investments in the
company between 1714 and 1740
the south sea company took nearly 42 000
African captives on its ships more than
7 000 people died on the Voyages
let's just look at a little more history
here
you see Britain was built on the backs
and Souls of slaves
the royal family reaped much of its
wealths to investments in African
slavery for over 270 years 12 British
monarchs sponsored supported and
profited from slavery
it all began with Queen Elizabeth the
first
in 1564 she gave a large Royal ship to a
slave trader in return she demanded a
share in the profits of the voyage
on that particular trip several Africans
were captured and at least 600 of them
were seized from Portuguese ships
after Elizabeth the first King James the
first carried forward the Dark Legacy
in fact he granted Royal connected
Merchants a monopoly on trade with
Africa
in 1618 the guinea company was formed it
captured slaves for english-owned
tobacco plantations in Virginia
and the company continued to enjoy its
Monopoly under King Charles the first
rain
so you see while the English colonized
the world one country at a time
it was the slaves who helped Drive these
economies
in 1702 Queen Anne came to power and
under her rule the south sea company was
formed
slave trading expanded dramatically
and we have already told you the details
between 1640 and 1807 around 3.1 million
enslaved people were transported from
Africa
according to official figures some 2.7
million arrived the rest died or root
such were the atrocities of the Royals
in 1833 800
000 were working as slaves in Britain
even after their Liberation they were
forced to work 45 hours a week for their
former Masters
and of course without any compensation
now King Charles says he supports a
probe into the Royal Family's troubling
history but we ask what is even the
point of this why is he offering
research when he should be offering
apologies
when he should be acknowledging the
horrors inflicted by his predecessors
the cruelty the manslaughter
Millions suffered as a result of the
whims of British monarchs
our British Royals finally going to
accept responsibility
and if they do
will they give reparations out of their
massive private wealth
has King Charles in his desire to match
the spirit of liberalism put his fist in
a hornet's nest and released angry toxic
bees which will sting not just him but
his family and the lineage which has
made him monarch
will this contribute to the departure of
countries like Australia from the crowns
embrace
we don't know but what we do know is
that King Charles does not also fully
fully know the size of the conflagration
that will follow now that he has lit the
fuse of an explosive powder kick
and moving on to our other top Focus
yet another Hindu temple have been
desecrated in Canada
and this time the target was a temple in
the town of Windsor in Ontario
anti-india graffiti was spray painted on
the walls
India has condemned the act of
vandalization
our next report getting you the complete
story
shortly after midnight on Tuesday two
people vandalized the Hindu temple in
Canada's Windsor anti-india graffiti was
painted on the exterior walls
the incident was caught on camera one
person is seen drawing on the walls
while the other keeps a watch
the vandals painted anti-india slogans
on the walls
slogans against Indian Prime Minister
Narendra Modi were also painted Windsor
Police have launched a probe into the
incident
a hunt is on for the two suspects India
has condemned the incident New Delhi is
also taking up the matter with the
Canadian authorities this is a this is a
very unfortunate incident and we
can this issue has been taken up with
the Canadian authorities and you know
with the same request that we made
around locations please catch the
perpetrators please try to prevent
ensure that this does not happen again
and I hope that Canadian authorities are
able to take action on those lines but
this is not a one-off incident on
February 14th the target was the SRI Ram
temple in the town of Mississauga
the slogans spray painted included those
attacking India and prime minister
Narendra Modi one of the slogans even
described the founder of the separatist
kalistan movement jarnail Singh
bindravale
as a martyr
earlier on January 30th the gauri
Shankar temple in Brampton was similarly
desecrated
in September last year an episode of
such vandalization occurred at the front
entrance to the swaminarayan temple in
Toronto none of these incidents have so
far resulted in any arrests
but it's not just temples that are being
targeted
the incident on March 27 involved the
decapitation of a Mahatma Gandhi's
sculpture located on the campus of the
Simon Fraser University in British
Columbia's Burnaby
just four days before that a statue of
Mahatma Gandhi located at the city hall
in the town of Hamilton was defaced
and India and pro-kalistan graffiti was
spray painted near its base
in July last year a statue of Mahatma
Gandhi located at the Vishnu temple in
Richmond Hill was defaced
the 20-foot tall bronze statue was
situated in the temples peace Park these
incidents have continued with a marked
rise in their frequency racing a series
of questions that Canada must answer
let's now shift Focus to China what's
happening there
the Chinese president is waging a war on
China's financial industry cracking down
on one Chinese Bank after another why is
that
China's Banks and insurers have become
the latest Target of Xi Jinping sweeping
anti-corruption Crackdown
throughout the last three months in fact
China's top anti-graft agency the
central commission for discipline
inspection has investigated over a dozen
senior Executives officials running the
most important financial institutions in
the country
and the names of three of them stand out
Lee xiaopeng the former chairman of
China's ever bright group one of the
country's oldest and largest state-owned
financial conglomerates
Leo Liang the former chairman of the
state-owned Bank of China
the country's fourth largest lender
and Wong bin
the former head of the state-owned China
life insurance
let's start with Lee Xiaoping
on Wednesday he was put under
investigation why is that
for quote-unquote disciplinary
violations
what sort of violations
the commission did not disclose any
further details
but the fact that fact that it is
involved suggests that the accusations
against Lee are serious
you see six days back something similar
happened with Leo large
the former Chief of the Bank of China
in February the 62 year old was abruptly
removed from his post as chair chairman
and party Chief at the leading
state-owned lender
in March he was put under investigation
by China's top anti-corruption body what
for
well the 62 year old is suspected of
serious violations of discipline and law
the usual euphemism for corruption in
China and he is apparently undergoing
disciplinary review and supervisory
investigation
this by the way is according to a joint
statement by the national supervision
commission and the central commission
for discipline inspection
next we have Wong bin the former
chairman of China life insurance
in January this year he was officially
charged with taking bribes and
concealing overseas deposits
he was accused of taking advantage of
the various positions he have held as
vice president of the jianxi branch of
the Agricultural Development Bank of
China
as President and Vice President of the
Beijing branch of the bank of
communications
and as the chairman of China life
insurance
the 64 year old is also accused of
concealing large deposits he made into
overseas bank accounts
so in four months three top Executives
have been sacked and subjected to a
corruption probe
what does that tell you how should we
view this and what really is China up to
what's going on
we don't know but reports saying that in
the days ahead this Crackdown could
intensify
have a look at this report now
last week the ccdi announced that it
would be inspecting more than 30 major
state-owned firms 30 of them they
include Financial Giants such as China
investment Corp the nation's Sovereign
wealth fund
China Development Bank which provides
financing for key government projects
and agricultural Bank of China
another large state-controlled lender
now remember this Crackdown comes just
days after Xi Jinping secured a historic
third term
immediately after this
he stacked his top team with Communist
Party loyalists and then he moved on to
consolidate the party's hold over the
economy
now that said
this Crackdown raises some serious
questions
on the Integrity of Chinese Banks
how corrupt are they really
well Financial observers saying that
they are as corrupt As It Gets you heard
that right
you see most of the banks in China are
state-owned which means most of the
decisions are not taken by Financial
experts but politicians
and as a result they end up lending
money to financial institutions or
companies that have closed ties with the
government officials
and this does not necessarily mean that
these companies are equipped enough to
repay the money that they take
this leads to less scrutiny
less accountability
and more corruption
what does that tell you
that Beijing May snare some bad apples
in its latest rectification campaign
but you see the rot at the core of the
financial sector still needs a stronger
medicine
and our season being cracked down on
Chinese Banks thousands of miles away
one question is buzzing across Europe
has Xi Jinping launched the Golden Age
of Chinese diplomacy
is he now the Diplomatic emperor of
three-fourths of this world
I am not asking these questions to boost
XI jinping's ego
I asked them because of two recent
developments that indicate how China
till recently considered an outlier has
suddenly started to expand its influence
with startling momentum
take the two theaters of conflict one in
West Asia where two perennial Force Iran
and Saudi Arabia have agreed to a
breakthrough understanding in a deal
broken by Beijing
and the second of course is Europe where
the war in Ukraine has created nuclear
fissures China's peace plan on the
Ukraine war is becoming a platform for
discussion
and if you need more proof
then just have a look at who all are in
Beijing right now
the foreign minister of Iran Jose and
Amir Abdullah
the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia
Prince Faisal bin Farhan alsoth
I'm the president of the French Republic
Emmanuel macron
as I speak all three of them are meeting
CCP officials in Beijing trying to douse
the Flames of their respective
geopolitical flash points
let me start with West Asia
this afternoon the foreign Ministers of
Riyadh and Tehran met in Beijing and
what was this meeting all about
well the decision to restore bilateral
ties and reopen their respective
embassies
and guess who presided over this meeting
the Chinese foreign minister himself
and this was not a closed-door meeting
by the way it was a meeting filled with
Optics
just have a look at these visuals
they show the three leaders awkwardly
posing for the cameras
and soon the Chinese foreign minister
nudges them for a three-way handshake
the leaders comply and break into smiles
you have to watch this
thank you
China must be feeling really proud of
itself for having pulled this off
after all it's not every day that you
see the Saudis and the Iranians having a
laugh together
and the fact that this happened on
Chinese soil raises the country's
profile as a global diplomatic power
one that could match or even upstage the
United States of America
for the Saudis have clearly moved away
from America's zone of influence
and here's another reason why I say this
the presence of Emmanuel macron in
Beijing
on the same day when the Chinese foreign
minister sat down with the leaders from
West Asia
the Chinese president was holding talks
with his French counterpart
have a look at these visuals now
they are from a bilateral meeting
between officials from both countries
and if you go by what they said
it will seem as if they are not on two
opposing sides of the war
but allies
listen to this
the world today is undergoing profound
historical changes as permanent members
of the United Nations security Council
and major countries with the tradition
of Independence China and France as
promoters of the multipolarization of
the world and the democratization of
international relations have the ability
and responsibility to transcend
differences and restraints
the Russian aggression in Ukraine has
dealt a blow to this stability it ended
Decades of Peace in Europe I Know I Can
Count On You moreover under the two
principles I have just mentioned to
bring Russia to its senses and everyone
to the negotiating table
did you hear what macro told Xi Jinping
I know I can count on you to bring
Russia to the negotiating table
and what macron said next must have
surprised the European policy makers all
the more
at the joint press conference shortly
after the bilateral he congratulated
China for brokering peace in West Asia
a much-needed validation for Xi Jinping
and an indication that he expects Europe
to trust Xi Jinping to bring peace in
Ukraine as well
listen to this now
let's start talking about peace and
stability we will have the opportunity
to come back on many subjects in our
discussions tonight and tomorrow in
regards to the situation in the Middle
East the reapproachment between Saudi
Arabia and Iran I congratulate you on
this very important progress
upstate
across pushing European leaders to
engage with Xi Jinping
does he want them to consider China's 12
point peace plan
well it certainly seems like it
for guess who is in macron's entourage
on this visit
the president of the European commission
Ursula Wonderland
and here's what the leader said a day
before meeting Xi Jinping he warned
Europe about the risks of cutting off
China he said Europe must resist
reducing trade and diplomatic ties with
Beijing
let me quote the exact statement
there is that impression that decoupling
from the Chinese economy is already
underway and that the only remaining
question is over pace and intensity
I do not believe in any case I do not
want to believe in this scenario
and how should we view this
if China's diplomatic Blitz succeeding
after all
is China's charm offensive slowly
bearing results
again it certainly seems like it
in West Asia you have Saudi Arabia and
Iran they have put their trust in China
to broker peace in Europe the second
largest economy France has put its trust
in Beijing once again to end the Ukraine
war
and even Ukraine by the way
the country bearing the brunt of the
Russian aggression is backing China's
peace plan
the Ukrainian president himself is
asking Xi Jinping to visit Kiev
what is this if not a Vindication of the
Chinese president's efforts to cast
himself as a global Peacemaker
he is leveraging his country's economic
clout in third party negotiations
leveraging his influence to stabilize
volatile parts of the world
yes he might have ulterior motives yes
these mediations could secure important
diplomatic geopolitical and economic
benefits for Chinese interests
but it seems more and more countries
have calculated that the value of
Chinese diplomatic brokerage is worth
the price that China can extract
that it is worth the price of even
causing American displeasure
the return of China to Global diplomacy
does worry one country more than any
other and that of course is the United
States of America
for China is occupying the space which
Washington has commanded since the 1950s
and indeed which America expanded in the
1990s after the collapse of the Soviet
Union
and China have not hidden its ambition
to replace America as the world's
foremost and most effective diplomatic
Powerhouse
moving on for now a Saudi prince who
owes Credit Suisse millions of dollars
will have to cough up for his luxurious
lifestyle
investors often now fall in Swiss lender
have been losing money for the last few
months
but if there is a reason to cheer it is
the fact that a London court has ruled
in its favor now
here's more on that
this 82 meter super yacht has a gym a
movie theater and five decks to
entertain its owner and his super
wealthy guests
and its asking price is over 65 million
dollars as of October 2022 with a price
tag that big you're probably wondering
how many people can afford to pay for it
seems like none the serafsa is owned by
Saudi Prince Fahad bin Sultan bin Abdul
Aziz al-south
and now this yacht is at the center of a
storm a financial uproad that includes
the Saudi Prince and embattled lender
Credit Suisse
Credit Suisse recently won a 41 million
lawsuit against the Saudi Prince this
after trade Swiss issued a notice to the
prince to pay all its debt in September
of 2021. report suggests that the prince
had paid just 13 500 Euros in interest
for the super yacht
however the prince have reportedly
denied terms of the loan had been
breached when the Swiss bank went to
court for a settlement
now the London courts that was here in
the case has said there was no viable
defense against the bank's lawsuit which
means that Credit Suisse will receive
around 41 million dollars from the Saudi
Prince
his family's wealth has surged more than
any business person or royal family
thanks to high crude oil prices the
questions that emerge from the Credit
Suisse and the Saudi Prince Fiasco are
this
was Credit Suisse is forced to lend to
the prince because of Saudi investments
in the Swiss pack are there more
borrowers riding on Saudi investors
credit suisse's latest troubles began
when its biggest backer the Saudi
National Bank refused to infuse further
capital for now the Saudi Prince is
asked to repay the loans taken for a
luxurious lifestyle your report Beyond
world is one
on Wednesday we told you about the
rising tensions between Israel and
Palestine
how this region is one flare-up away
from a war
24 hours on the tensions persist
let's first take a look at the latest
images from northern Israel
have a look at how Rockets fired from
Lebanon left the trail of smoke in
Israeli Skies Israeli military saying at
least one rocket was intercepted by the
iron dorm air defense system
this after lebanon's iran-backed
Hezbollah wowed to back Palestinians
after the clashes at the Al-Aqsa mosque
and have a look at these visuals now
Al-Aqsa mosque being turned into a
battle Zone
Israeli forces stormed the compound for
the second time in a row last night
firing stun grenades tear gas and rubber
coated steel bullets on Palestinian
worshipers as the troops forcibly empty
the mosque
angry Palestinians reportedly heard
stones and firecrackers in retaliation
Israeli police say they used Force to
evacuate worshipers who were holed up at
the mosque with fireworks rocks and
sticks
they said they were compelled to restore
Law and Order after dozens of
Palestinian juveniles targeted the
officers
this latest round of violence coming
hours after Israeli forces stormed the
mosque arresting and removing more than
400 Palestinian worshipers from the holy
site triggering widespread condemnation
but let's talk about what happened in
May 2021
an Israeli raid triggered an 11-day
full-scale conflict between Israel and
Hamas
256 Palestinians lost their lives in the
conflict while over 1900 were injured
and the raffias that the latest reads
will fuel Another War
let's now take a closer look at the
border following the raids at the
Al-Aqsa mosque Hamas fired a barrage of
rockets over the last 24 hours
setting off Air Raids in southern Israel
the Israeli military in fact saying that
they intercepted a total of five rockets
releasing a video they showed how they
struck Hamas military posts weapon
storage and Manufacturing sites
in the midst of escalating tensions
how is the Israeli government responding
to this
it's already facing protests over
judicial reforms
and Netanyahu has an uphill task to
restore Peace during the Holy Week
the clashes come as Muslims observe
ramzan and Jews observed the Passover
according to reports the prime minister
is set to contain a high-level
ministerial meeting the security cabinet
meet is being convened after nearly two
months
but why has the Al-Aqsa mosque compound
become a flash point why is it so
important
Alexa Moss compound is Islam's third
most holy site it is situated in the old
part of Jerusalem it houses the alkibli
mosque and the Dome of the Rock
where Muslims believe Prophet Muhammad
ascended to heaven
and next to the Al-Aqsa mosque lies the
Jewish quarter which is also celebrating
the Passover
the staff reminder of the 2021 clashes
during ramzan and Passover coming to
mind as Israeli forces use brutal force
in the world's holiest of sites
the events unfolding in the last 24
hours have divided the opinion worldwide
while the U.S has called for restoring
car
and the United Nations also expressed
shock
Secretary General is shocked and
appalled by the images he saw this
morning of the violence and beating by
Israeli security forces inside the AL
qibli mosque in Jerusalem at a time of
the calendar which is holy to Jews
Christians and Muslims this should be a
Time For Peace and not violence places
of worship should only be used for
peaceful religious observances
we pray
Jordan and Egypt
for all forgotten the big question is
will West Asia see another war and as
tension simmer the world is watching the
moves of the UAE UAE along with China
urging the U.N security Council to
convene a meeting over the Israeli rapes
at Al-Aqsa
earlier the UAE and Israel signed a
comprehensive economic partnership
agreement which has come into force on
the 1st of April
even as Netanyahu and uae's president
have committed to strengthen ties over a
call yesterday
the underlying tension still remain and
it remains to be seen if the partnership
stands the test of time
incidentally this will be the fourth
meeting of the UNSC on israel-palestine
tensions since Netanyahu came to power
three months ago
so we ask these questions
will the Israeli raids at the Al-Aqsa
mosque trigger a 2021 repeat can it
trigger a full-scale attack by the
Israeli forces
and all to award that Japan is waging
the enemy is tiny but it is wreaking
havoc in the country
and the country's prime minister has
promised to fight back
are you confused
well I am talking about the war against
Poland that the country has declared
Fallen levels in Tokyo have risen to
their highest in a decade making hay
fever a huge cause of concern
first things first what is hay fever
hay fever is an allergic reaction to
Poland typically when it comes into
contact with your mouth nose eyes your
throat
symptoms of hay fever including sneezing
and coughing or runny or blocked nose
itchy red or watery eyes
and now in Japan as soon as the Cedar
and Cypress trees start shedding their
pollen around 40 percent of Japanese
have to deal with hay fever symptoms
like itchy watery eyes even sneezing
around 40 percent of them
no wonder then that hay fever has been
called a national disease
and the country's prime minister has
said that hay fever has become a
quote-unquote social problem
and he has promised action
including working with the ministers to
come up with a way to get results
in fact even though the Wuhan virus
guidelines were lifted in the country
and people no longer have to wear face
coverings to safeguard themselves
against covid-19 a lot of the people
continue to wear masks when they are
Outdoors because of the latest outbreak
of hay fever
in fact the Poland season this year has
also caused a spike in the demand for
nasal sprays even protective glasses
recently the country's environment
Ministry had some bad news to share it
said that Tokyo and 11 other prefectures
would witness their highest setup
wouldn't counts for 10 years
in a 2020 study of Japanese hay fever
sufferers about 80 percent had said the
symptoms made them less productive
and this by the way is not the only war
that Japan is waging
it is also dealing with the worst ever
bird flu outbreak
as a result egg prices are skyrocketing
poultry flocks of course are severely
impacted and now the country is running
out of space to bury dead chickens why
is that
because more than 17 million birds have
been killed across the country this
season more than 17 million of them
chickens are called to prevent the risk
of bird flu crossing over to other
animals and human beings
and it is extremely important to dispose
of the carcasses properly
you know so that the spread of the virus
can be prevented also so that the water
supplies do not get contaminated
some regions in fact are addressing this
issue by securing other plots of land or
by incinerating the carcasses
but not all of them have enough capacity
to incinerate so many carcasses
from The Jungle Books ferocious Sher
Khan to winning in the pool's joyful
tiger you might have even seen tigers
with different personalities in fiction
but what if I told you tigers have
different personalities in real life as
well
in fact researchers have identified two
personalities in Siberian tigers
the big cats sit on two scales dubbed
majesty and steadiness
our next report getting you the details
how would you describe a tiger
not based on its physical traits but
based on its personality its disposition
would you call it Fierce confident agile
Majestic perhaps just like humans are
described based on five dimensions of
personality
scientists have identified two such
dimensions for tigers
these scales are majesty and steadiness
what do these terms mean how do they
describe a tiger's personality here's
How Majestic tigers are dignified
imposing and agile these Tigers rank
higher on group status they are
healthier
they predate more on live animals eat
more and mate more in simple terms
tigers with Majestic personalities are
the alphas what about the other group
then the one described as steady these
tigers are loving obedient and quiet
they are gentler and more sincere
wild Majestic tigers are more dominating
steady tigers are more collaborative you
see all tigers are not wild and ruthless
Predators as we assume them to be
many of them are tame and gentle how did
we come to this conclusion
Chinese researchers observed the
behavior of 248 Siberian tigers their
feeders or veterinarians were given a
tiger personality questionnaire
they were asked to describe the
temperament of the big cats they used
words such as adaptive obstinate stupid
and Frank based on their responses the
scientists came up with the two
personality clusters we already
described
but we do need to take one thing into
account all the Tigers reviewed in the
study were semi-captive they have been
raised and handled by humans this makes
one wonder what would the results be for
wild tigers those who roam freely in
jungles would these personality
Dimensions apply to them would any of
them be described as gentle sincere or
steady Bureau report we on world is one

GahhrXSktG4,Chinese Government scientists claim infamous Wuhan market may NOT be source of Covid pandemic | WION,"In a fresh twist to the never-ending saga, Beijing-affiliated researchers ruled there was no proof to definitively say the virus jumped ...",2023-04-06T12:40:39Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GahhrXSktG4/hqdefault.jpg,"Chinese peer-reviewed research on the
origins of covid-19 was published in the
science journal Nature it says that
animal DNA was found in the original
samples from Wuhan from where the virus
originated but it also said that there
was no definitive proof that covet
originated from an animal and spilled
over to humans it's been over three
years since the world went into the
lockdown due to covet 19. still the
question as to how the virus emerged
remains shrouded in mystery
a team of scientists from the who flew
to Wuhan in early of 2021 to investigate
the source of the pandemic after about
12 days they said the theory that
covid-19 originated in a lab and spread
from there was quote unquote extremely
unlikely
the French theory that covet originated
in a lab in China's Wuhan province has
been dismissed many times before as well
the theory recently made a comeback in
February of 2023 when Christopher Ray
the director of the FBI said the bureau
believes covid-19 most likely originated
in a Chinese government controls lab
China's foreign Ministry spokesperson
accused United States intelligence
agencies of politicizing the probe into
the origins of the virus
less than a month after this U.S
President Joe Biden signed the bill
declassifying information related to the
origins of the coronavirus he said that
he shared the U.S congress's goal of
releasing as much information as
possible about the origin of covet 19.
within two weeks the Chinese
peer-reviewed research was published in
nature it suggested that it was possible
for an animal to have been an
intermediate host of a virus that
spilled over to infect humans but the
latest finding still does not prove that
kovid originated from an animal and then
spilled over to humans
now this means that the theory that
covid-19 originated in a lab is yet to
be completely disapproved

now our correspondent Alex isad gets us
more on this story
the recent Paul has suggested that Rishi
sinak has been rising in popularity
within his own party which can only be a
positive going forward as a lot of that
infighting and back benching were
against him from the beginning and
hopefully we'll see more of her uniforms
coming together conservative party which
can only be positive heading into the
local elections next month but whether
it's the conservative party who are
popular with the United Kingdom people
is another question we're going to see
whether or not that is the case when we
head into those local elections when
there are potentially thousands of seats
that may go towards labor or in fact the
liberal Democrats now kissed armor
versus Rishi sunak opposition member
versus prime minister that's what seems
to be the push at the moment but it
really is about the rest of the party a
lot of the people in the public really
just want the cost of living sorted they
want to see prices coming down they want
to see a change in economics and they
want to see it benefit them at the
moment there is constant talk about who
is the better Party conservatives have
been in power for so long but Labor's
promises don't seem to actually hold on
to anything or be strong in their own
sense I remember there doesn't really
seem to be a strong Contender or a
strong winner when it comes to the
potential of the general elections that
we're going to see in the next couple of
years but right now for for the Prime
Minister Richardson is really quite a
positive that he is doing well at least
with his in his own party

India's Financial Capital Mumbai has the
cheapest public transport in the world

global ticketing discount firm
this essentially means that citizens
living in Mumbai pay less for public
transport compared to other cities
across the world a study done in a total
of 45 cities across the world looked at
single ticket prices as well as monthly
passes which allow for unlimited travel
within the city limits public transport
fares were compared in all the cities
while doing the analysis
[Music]
you're a monthly pass can cost you
rupees 1250 approximately 15 dollars
which is only 2.4 percent of the average
net wage in Mumbai
the study says that Mumbai is among the
cheapest cities when it comes to monthly
passes here a monthly pass can cost you
rupees 1250 which is approximately 15
and only 2.5 percent of the average net
wage in Mumbai

transport pass also costs 2.3 percent
and 2.1 percent of the average net wage
respectively
the monthly passes include in this study

tickets the most expensive cities are
London Zurich and Oslo
the study also says that in 3 out of 45
cities public transport is completely
free for Citizens living in places like

on the show tonight
[Music]
alive
[Music]
[Music]
story tonight is about the Russia
Ukraine war
for the last one year the war has
dominated Global headlines
and over the last few weeks particularly
the battle for bakmut has dominated the
discourse
in the latest the Wagner Chief has
claimed that bakmuth has fallen and this
is a development which has far-reaching
implications
zelenski earlier remember talked about
how if bakmuth fell to Russian forces
the President
Vladimir Putin would sell the victory to
the west to his Society to China to Iran
and tonight on gravitas we tell you all
about why bakmut is so significant in
the Russia Ukraine war what is Ukraine
thing about Wagner's claim will Kiev be
able to recover the east of Ukraine or
is this a turning point in this war
this and more coming up in October story
tonight
also on the show for you inflation in
Pakistan has touched a 60-year High
we tell you all about the state of
Pakistan's economy
the bhutanese king's visit to India are
coming in the backdrop of the bhutanese
Prime Minister statements on doklam we
tell you about the expectations from
this visit
anti-drone laser weapon prototype
unveiled in Japan what triggered this
move and what can these weapons do and
why are they important
a raging controversy over a French
Minister's Playboy shoot we get you the
complete story
[Music]
there are two types of battles
the first adds to war casualty
and the second changes the very course
of the war like the Battle of Stalingrad
during the second world war which
shifted the course of the war for the
German army
now while the battle for bakmuth is not
of a scale as epic as talingrad
it is historic nonetheless
and its importance can be measured by
the ferocity of the Russian attack and
the intensity of Ukraine's defense
you see the fighting has been going on
for seven long and bloody months
both the sides have put in their all
bakmut has become a testing ground for
Russia's New Age weapons and Ukraine's
resistance
a stalemate contrary claims and seven
months later
one side appears to have moved the scale
in its favor listen in
it is April 2nd 11 sharp behind me is
Parkwood City administration building
this is a Russian flag it says on the
flag in good memory of ludlen tatersky
from a legal point of view we have taken
bhagmat and the commanders of the units
that took the administration building
and the whole Central District will
carry and put up those flags the flag of
PMC Wagner they were the guys who took
bhagmud from a legal point of view it is
us
chief if Jenny pergozin
he claimed to have captured bhakt most
of bakmut
and the immediate question is what is
Ukraine saying
not much actually
like we often tell you on gravitas
leaders don't really say what they mean
and they don't mean what they say
here is has been leaving you to fill in
the blanks between the vague words that
he has been using
so are we to believe that bakboth has
fallen
one thing is clear Ukraine will never
look the same
just look at where bakmut is located on
the map
the control of this city enables Russia
to cut Ukraine out of Donetsk
so is this the beginning of the end of
Ukraine as we know it
and let me tell you why I asked this
question one because of the domino
effect that weight that's waiting to
happen
and number two because chances are
Ukraine may not be able to win back
bakmud and the other strategic talents
we will tell you why let's start with
the domino effect
not too long ago Waldameer zelensky had
told a U.S media outlet that soon after
bakmud Russia code quote unquote go to
chromatosk
they could go to sylviansk
it would be an open road for the
Russians after bakmuth to other towns in
Ukraine in the donesque direction
and he is right
now that bhagmat has fallen it may not
be long before the Russian troops and
the Wagner men marched to sloviansk
followed by chromatosk
remember already
has solidar Mario Paul and melato Paul
and most of this region
so do you think Ukraine will be able to
win back any of these cities
of course Ukraine has had successful
counter-offensives in the past but that
is the past
a repeat in the future may seem over
ambitious
ask yourself this question
for how long can a country continue to
fight another while depending on a third
and a fourth country
my point is today Ukraine is 101
dependent on the west to fuel this war
for every war related resource the only
resource Ukraine has is human resource
and this human resource also has now
suffered a setback
you see it was not for nothing that
zielinski would refer to buckmut as
Ukraine's fort
and the country's emblem of resistance
the fall of bakmut has not only come
with a loss of prestige but also a deep
sense of moral loss
also Ukrainian troops are caught in a
supply chain crisis so much so that
Ukraine is running out of artillery
ammunition
we have been telling you for a while now
that Ukraine is exhausting weapons at an
alarming rate
more than the us or the NATO can produce
these weapons
Ukraine faces the high possibility of
running out of shells by the end of this
year unless the West miraculously ramps
up its production at warp speed
and just How likely is that
so far the West has sent Aid and
Equipment worth nearly 50 billion
dollars and a lot of the recent war
machines were promised keeping in mind
the volatile situation in bhagmuth
you see bakmuth allowed zelenski to ask
for more and more the leopards her
visits tanks aircraft
and now with the fall of bakmut how much
will the West be willing to or be able
to afford to send to Ukraine
so Ukraine is losing arms it's morale
it's personal it's cities
what's left
is it just buckmut or is Ukraine
starting to lose the war
have a look at this this is a recent
video of buckmouth
nothing is left there many Ukrainian
towns have been refused to Rubble
reduced to Rubble around 30 percent of
the country's population has been
displaced and the Russians are not done
thank you
you see the Kremlin knows its limits
knows how much is achievable
after all this is a country Russia has
been fighting since 2014 since Crimea
but Russia also knows how much more it
can push its luck
how much is Within Reach and currently
eastern Ukraine definitely is
so we are back to the question what's
next
some analysts we spoke to tell us that
we may want to consider the possibility
of Ukraine being divided into two along
the nipro river with Eastern and
Southern paths to Russia along with the
Black Sea and whatever remains of
Ukraine brought under the NATO
protection
what else
we are told it may be only a matter of
time and maybe a couple of more cities
before zelenski is forced to reach out
to the Chinese president Xi Jinping to
talk to Putin negotiate
and bring an end to this war
and we know for a fact that the Chinese
peace plan does not involve withdrawal
of Russian troops
it also does not involve returning of
cities nor does it guarantee a Ukraine a
Ukraine that once was
I know what some of you are thinking
can a single battle be so decisive
you see it is not for nothing that we
are calling bhagmud historic
meanwhile a certain Russian war blogger
has been making headlines around the
world posthumously
his name is vladland tatarsky
he was killed at a cafe in Saint
Petersburg over the weekend
and Russia is calling padarsky's killing
an act of Terror
who killed the Blogger that is yet to be
a certain what we know though is that
the targeted blast that killed tatarski
also injured over 20 others
who would Target a blogger
and what made this blogger so important
our next report telling you
bloodline takarski was a well-known name
in Russia
[Music]
its real name was Maxine fomen tatarsky
was 70 years old and he ran a military
blog
[Music]
tatarski became a blogger by chance also
Russian by chance tatarsky was born in
Ukraine in the donbass region to be
specific that's where he began his
career
foreign
as a coal mine worker this was before he
got into the furniture business before
running out of business robbing a bank
and going to prison but fate had
different things planned for this man in
2014 when Russia backed separatists
seized donbass tatarsky escaped prison
and went on to fight on the front lines
of the Crimean War in favor of Russia
when Russia invaded Ukraine last year
tatarsky began blogging giving a running
commentary on the war
peddling pro-war propaganda satarski
became famous his telegram account
attracted some 560 000 followers but
along with Fame tatarsky also courted
controversy
once he called on Russian troops to
attack the infrastructure that would
guarantee maximum Ukrainian casualty
Ukraine sanctioned tatarsky for his
extreme views
on Sunday tatarski was addressing his
followers at a cafe in Saint Petersburg
it was then that a woman handed over a
figure or mini sculpture to tatarsky
soon all that remained was blood and
glass the moment of the blast was caught
on camera
this is what remains of the cafe after
the blast the Kremlin is calling it an
act of terrorism
well this is a terrorist act there is
information indicating that the
Ukrainian special services may be
involved in the planning of this
terrorist act a thought the Wagner Chief
does not subscribe to yevgeny pregosian
says he would quote unquote not blame
the keep regime if not Ukraine then who
killed the Russian blogger this is Daria
tripova she is 26 years old and she has
been detained over tatarsky's killing in
a video released by the Russian interior
Ministry trepova is heard admitting
being responsible for the Bob Laden
figurine uh
uh
huh foreign
was this under duress there's no reason
to believe it wasn't Russian officials
continued to point the finger at Ukraine
they say the Ukrainian security service
collaborated with jailed Russian
opposition leader Alexi navalny's
anti-corruption Foundation over the
weekend many in Russia laid flowers and
lit candles at the scene of the blast
people were heard praising tatarsky and
expressing their shock at what had
happened
our next story is from Pakistan a
country on the brink of disaster
not just politically but also
economically
have a look at this report
last month inflation in Pakistan touched
a 60-year High 6-0
the rate of year-on-year inflation hit
35.37 in March this was the highest
level that the country has seen since
March 1965.
if I speak of the Forex reserves
specifically they have fallen yet again
last week they shrank by 354 million
dollars after being on the rise for six
weeks
and let's not even talk about the food
prices
last week's Pakistan's retail inflation
peaked to 47 percent
with the rates of essential Commodities
touching the skies
the price of flower searched by a
staggering
120.66 percent the price of onions
surged by 228 the price of tea by 94.6
percent price of eggs by
79.56 percent
now remember these figures come Justice
after eight women and three children
lost their lives in a stampede
this was during the distribution of food
Aid in the southern city of Karachi
that's the level of desperation that the
country is witnessing
overall 21 people have died in such
stampedes over food in recent days
do you think that's bad
then take a look at this report
the budget of Jammu and Kashmir is twice
the size of the bailout requested by
Pakistan from the international monetary
fund
that's right
last month the government announced a
14.5 billion dollar budget for the union
territory 14.5 billion dollars
this money will be used for the
development and infrastructure projects
do you know how much money Pakistan has
sought from the IMF
seven billion dollars only
so simply put the budget of Jammu and
Kashmir is way more than the money that
Pakistan needs for survival
and this is embarrassing to say the
least
you see for decades now Pakistan has
peddled lies on Kashmir pushed its
propaganda on diplomatic platforms and
look at where that has gotten the
country
as India invests in kashmir's
development
Pakistan is battling for survival every
day
the question is what is it doing to get
out of this mess
we know that the IMF is certainly not
helping it is imposing one condition
after another stalling the release of
the next bailout
the outer board is not helping either
last month remember Saudi Arabia said it
will no longer be willing to bail out
Islamabad it refused to provide any more
interest-free loans and why is that
because of Pakistan's inability to pay
its loans its inability to get the debt
down its inability to fix its economy
and this has irked the kingdom
so it has grabbed the Avenue of a
bailout
Kuwait by the way is doing something
similar
it is pushing Pakistan to pay its dues
insisting on immediate payment of diesel
purchase
it wants Islamabad to make the payment
right at the time of purchase of diesel
it also wants Pakistan to clear its
previous views as soon as possible
what about China
well it is passing the buck as well
it is pushing the U.S to help Islamabad
saying that it has already done its bit
and we thought China and Pakistan were
iron Brothers
so Pakistan's last bet now is the United
States of America
have a look at this report
later this month Pakistan's Finance
Minister will be leading a high-powered
delegation to Washington to seek
America's help and Reports say he will
reportedly ask American leaders to nudge
the IMF into releasing the next bailout
as soon as possible
but the question is will America help
Pakistan
you see just last month Islamabad had
skipped Biden's Summit for democracy
because it did not want to upset its
friend China
and now it expects the same America to
bail it out
will the Americans comply
they might just
but in return
they might drag Pakistan further into
their proxy war the one that's going on
in Ukraine
remember for months now Pakistan has
been discreetly sending weapons to
Ukraine and in return seeking financial
assistance from the NATO countries
so when the Pakistani delegation visits
Washington they must be aware that any
hell any help will come at a price
a price that may prove to be
diplomatically disastrous for Islamabad
and as the government of Pakistan
struggles so is the country's former
prime minister Imran Khan his legal
troubles just don't seem to end
and what's worse now even his wife is
being dragged into them
look at this report last month Imran
Khan's wife Bushra Bibi was summoned in
the doshkanakis a case involving the
sale of gifts from Pakistan's National
Treasure House
allegedly helped her husband in selling
those gifts to dubai-based businessmen
and now she is facing the Heat
and what is she doing about it
well last week she moved the Islamabad
high court to challenge the notices that
were issued to her she urged the court
to stop the authorities from converting
the case inquiry into an investigation
and guess what
the court has complied it has issued a
notice to Pakistan's National
accountability Bureau for summoning
Bushra Bibi without following the
standard operating procedures
it says that the notices do not reflect
compliance with the judicial orders
this may offer some temporary relief but
that does not mean the case is over
in fact the court also said that it will
not restrict the bureau from taking the
case forward which basically means that
both Bushra Bibi and Imran Khan will
have to face the law that is assuming
they don't have another trick up their
sleeves
shifting Focus for now to India
as I speak it is hosting a special guest
the king of Bhutan jigmi Wong chuk
this morning he arrived in New Delhi for
a three-day visit our visit aimed at
bolstering bilateral ties and opening
new avenues of cooperation
in fact has been here on the invitation
of the Indian president he was received
by the Indian external affairs minister
Dr Ashley Shankar
a move that reflected the importance
that New Delhi attaches to the visit
on Tuesday the bhutanese king will be
holding talks with president droppedi
mormu and the Indian Prime Minister
Narendra Narendra Modi
Reports say the talks will focus on
Reviving the entire gamut of bilateral
ties
and further Advance the partnership that
the two countries share with the
Economic and Development cooperation
now this visit has been in the works for
quite some time now and is likely to be
followed by the visit of another
neighboring leader
the prime minister of Nepal
and the timing of these visits is
intriguing
they come right after a statement made
by the prime minister of Bhutan Lotus
sharing
last month he gave an interview to a
Belgian daily where he said that China
has a say in the doklam issue much like
India and Bhutan
let me quote his exact statement
doklam is a junction point between India
China and Bhutan
it is not up to Bhutan alone to solve
the problem we are three
there is no big or small country
there are three equal countries each
counting for a thought
in other words what the bhutanese leader
meant was that China is an equal
stakeholder in the boundary issue as
much as India
and these comments sparked some huge
concerns that Bhutan could be tilting
towards China that it might be ready to
see territory to Beijing
and here's why this is concerning
doklam is the very same place where
India and China came near to a military
conflict
this happened in 2017.
China was trying to extend an illegally
constructed Road and stretched to areas
adjacent to the club
Indian troops halted the construction
the standoff lasted two months
some of these areas are in Bhutan While
others sit right on India's border with
Bhutan so basically doklam and its
adjacent regions Overlook parts of India
and a Chinese presence here poses a
grave security threat
for the longest time Bhutan was on
India's side its position was the same
as new delhi's
but that appears to be changing
gradually
the latest statement by the bhutanese
prime minister is proof
now the king of Bhutan is in New Delhi
and the Chinese shadow looms large over
his visit
remember India is bhutan's largest
trading partner India also trains put in
his diplomats not to mention provide
economic support
so with all that New Delhi does for
temple there is going to be every reason
for India to see Clarity from Bhutan on
its stance with China
especially in the backdrop of the
statement made by the bhutanese prime
minister
and now for China it's not just Bhutan
which it is trying to
off late Beijing has been on a
diplomatic overdrive of thoughts
especially its leader Xi Jinping he is
holding one meeting after another
two weeks back he went to Moscow he met
the Russian president a wizard that was
aimed at flaunting China's alliance with
Russia everyone thought he would sit
idle after this visit but that did not
happen on the 31st of March Xi Jinping
met three visiting world leaders three
of them the Spanish president Pedro
Sanchez the Singaporean prime minister
Lee sen long
and the Malaysian prime minister as well
three meetings that affirmed beijing's
interest in presenting itself as the new
force in international relations
all three leaders were in China for the
ball forum for Asia held annually in
Hanan and dubbed the world economic
Forum Conference of Asia
all these meetings along with the
bhutanese prime minister's statement
indicate that China is certainly trying
to up its game when it comes to
diplomacy that it has gotten rid of its
previous wolf warrior style of diplomacy
and is now trying to pull countries back
into its Ambit
our next story is from Japan where
defense firms have unwilled prototypes
of high energy anti-drawn laser weapons
they will be able to shoot down
sophisticated enemy drones
this showcasing of Japan's defense
systems coming as tensions continue to
soar in the indo-pacific region
our next report telling you more
foreign
at a time when anti-drone Jammers
anti-drone guns and anti-drone lasers
are increasingly making their presence
felt for the first time ever
Japanese defense firms Mitsubishi and
Kawasaki unveiled prototypes of their
laser systems capable of shooting down
incoming hostile unmanned aerial
Vehicles this was at the defense and
security equipment International Expo in
Tokyo what does Mitsubishi's weapon
offer it has what the brand calls a
counter unmanned aircraft system which
is capable of shooting a 10 kilowatt
laser which can shoot down a flying
drone from over one kilometer away and
the anti-drone system takes only two to
three seconds to do this it can also be
installed on ground vehicles Mitsubishi
plans on providing the weapon to the
Japanese ground self-defense force and
the maritime and air self-defense forces
next up is Kawasaki's anti-drone weapon
which has a 2 kilowatt laser power its
laser can cover a distance of 700 meters
and uses a one micrometer band fiber
laser so this is how it works the shoot
down system detects an aerial drone with
an infrared camera tracks it down locks
onto the Target and fires a laser
Japan has contributed its share in the
demonstration costs of these weapons
over 21 million dollars were put into
the research and development of the
laser systems Japan's advancement in
defense Tech is part of its focus on its
backyard an emergency over Taiwan is an
emergency for Japan is what late prime
minister shinsu Abe said so Japan's
interest in this latest technology comes
as no surprise in fact China has also
unveiled a naval version of its high
altitude long endurance drone so why
exactly are countries focusing on the
development of drones the Strategic
importance of the aerial weapons has
been highlighted in recent conflicts
such as the ongoing russia-ukraine War
drones are also being considered as
better weapons for a number of reasons
they can maneuver through areas that are
considered dangerous for humans they can
monitor and target areas without human
assistance this eliminates the margin of
error and boosts accuracy drones can
carry out operations for an extended
period of time increasing the accuracy
and performance of emission the aerial
weapons are cheaper to operate as
compared to other high-tech weapons

and our next story is from the United
States
where former president Donald Trump is
set to face criminal charges remember he
was indicted earlier for the hush money
case
meanwhile here is what's happening the
UAE and Qatar have reportedly invested
hundreds of millions in a private Equity
Firm which was launched by Trump's
son-in-law
our country is betting on Trump's return
to the top position
how are the Democrats reacting to these
developments
let's get to the details
the immediate question is
uh countries in West Asia their
investment in Jared kushner's firm who
is the former advisor also the
son-in-law of Donald Trump an indication
that they want to maintain warm ties
especially if Trump were to become the
president of the United States again
just how big of an investment did
Kushner really receive
according to report the two nations are
set to have poured in nearly 400 million
dollars nearly 400 million dollars in
kushner's farm
this is after Saudi Arabia invested more
than 2 billion dollars
this is an indication of kushner's close
contacts in this part of the world which
he developed while his time in during
his time in the White House
the scale of the Investments has drawn
heavy criticism from Democrats
as Kushner has wheeled in about 2.5
billion dollars
from some countries
so how exactly did Kushner manage to
build such ties
as the top White House advisor to Donald
Trump Kushner helped develop a regional
pact remember the Ibrahim Accords
during the final days of Trump's
presidency in fact the man held
discussions which helped lift an
economic and diplomatic blockade of
Qatar by its neighbors and this blockade
was imposed when kushna was building
ties with the Saudi Prince
but there were people in the
administration who could see through
kushner's strategy
how has the opposition reacted to this
Democrats are calling out Krishna
for the stealth and speed they say with
which he secured the Investments
only months after leaving the government
the former chair of the house committee
on oversight and reform had also opened
an investigation into whether Kushner
took in Investments while sitting in the
White House
Donald Trump in fact has also chased
deals with West Asian countries Trump
logged in a four billion dollar project
with a Saudi real estate company to
build a trump branded hotel in Oman
which was also backed by oman's
government
and it now seems that countries in West
Asia are rooting for Trump while he
becomes the first ex-president in
history to face criminal charges
and what has Donald Trump been up to
according to reports he was seen playing
golf in Florida
Trump and his advisers meanwhile have
been mulling over how to use his
indictment to boost his campaign
his team has shown off the harsh money
case as a political hoax a Witch Hunt
representing Trump as the one who has
been attacked while the former president
shows his rage on his social media
platform truth social
what exactly is the hashmani case all
about
it involves an adult film star Stormy
Daniels to whom to whom Trump
reportedly paid harsh money to keep
things under wraps before the 2016
presidential campaign
now Trump is expected to be present at
the Manhattan Courthouse his presence
will definitely be felt as all trials
and other courtroom activity will be
halted before he is slated to arrive
and will countries continue to support
Donald Trump after the Court's decision
or what the Court's decision benefit
Trump's game of gaining sympathy from
his supporters
All Eyes
on what happens in the court
and our next story is from Israel after
dealing the controversial judicial
overhaul the country's cabinet has taken
another contentious move
one that could ignite the same kind of
protest that we saw in the last three
months
have a look at this report
on Sunday the Israeli government
approved a decision to form a National
Guard that would function as a private
militia
private militia for whom
for this man itamar benguer the national
security minister of Israel
in fact he is the one who came up with
the idea for the unversed benguer is a
far-right politician
he entered the parliament in 2021
he leads a party called
otsma yehudit or Jewish power
in the past this 46 year old politician
has been labeled as Israel's minister of
Chaos
he has been convicted on at least eight
charges
including supporting a terrorist
organization and incitement of racism
and he has now proposed a National Guard
one that will deal with unrest in
Palestine and take orders directly from
him
the Israeli cabinet has given its nod
but reports a committee comprising of
Israel's existing security agencies
would determine this National Guards
authorities
this committee has 90 days to make its
recommendations
in the meantime here's what a statement
from when from Van gover's office has to
say about this Force let me quote
the National Guard would deal with
emergency scenarios nationalistic crime
Terror and strengthening sovereignty
it will comprise of 1800 members who
will bring back personal security to
Israelis
the statement further added that more
details about the God's goals and
Authority will be issued by the
committee in two months
the announcement have been met with
disdain by opposition leaders in Israel
leaders like Jai Lopez
he put out this tweet on Sunday calling
the government's decision and extremist
fantasy of delusional people exact words
used
he said this move would cut budgets at
other Ministries to fund benguer's
private militia
and by the way he's not the only one who
has condemned the plan so has Israel's
former police chief
have a look at this report
Israel's ex-police Chief Moshe karadi
says that Ben goes proposed National
Guard can be used to launch a coup in
the country
he says Netanyahu should learn a little
bit of history and see what happens in
countries in which politicians have
their own Armed Forces
and he has a point
take the case of Turkey
the president of Turkey uses the
services of a private security company a
company called Sadat International
in 2016 when there was a coup attempt in
Turkey this company is said to have
helped erdogan maintain his grip on
power
armed Personnel from this company were
involved in the suppression of the coup
attempt
and in return erdogan made the owner of
the company his chief military advisor
will Israel use the National Guard for
similar operations will it use them to
suppress anti-government demonstrations
we don't know
but recent developments in the country
add to our doubts
I'm of course talking about the protests
that gripped the country recently
thousands of Israelis from all walks of
life hit the streets protesting the
government's decision to curtail the
powers of the Judiciary
in face of the resistance the Netanyahu
government backtracked and delayed its
judicial overhaul
and now it has announced the formation
of a private militia
what exactly is it planning we don't
know the developments in the days ahead
might give us the answer
and our next story is about a minister
finding herself in the middle of a
controversy
that sounds quite ordinary does it not
but this is no ordinary story
it's one which has dominated Global
headlines over the last few hours
what am I talking about
meet French Minister Malin shiapa
she finds herself in the middle of a
raging row over what you ask
over a photo shoot
you see the minister appeared on the
cover of the Playboy magazine
the Magazine's French Edition will
feature marlen shiapa along with a
12-page interview
on issues like abortion women's rights
LGBT rights
first things first who is marlen shiapa
she is the current minister of social
economy and French associations
before entering the world of politics
she wrote about women's health issues
she is a feminist an author someone who
for long has advocated for women's
rights
in fact while she was the equalities
minister in 2018 she introduced
legislation outlawing cat calling and
Street harassment
her photoshoot for the Playboy magazine
has drawn sharp criticism from not just
her political opponents but also her
colleagues
according to the Prime Minister The
Minister's decision was not at all
appropriate
meanwhile has defended her decision and
this is what she said on Twitter
defending the right of women to do what
they want with their bodies everywhere
and all the time
in France women are free
whether it annoys the retrogrades and
hypocrites or not
quite a statement isn't it
and this by the way is not the first
time the minister finds herself tackling
a controversy in the year 2017 she was
accused of staging a visit to a
so-called no-go area for women in Paris
in the year 2010 her book which gave out
sex tips for those who are overweight
was criticized
according to critics the book reinforced
harmful cliches
and the latest controversy over her
shoot for the Playboy magazine is
showing no signs of dying down
her decision to be featured in the
magazine has received backlash from
multiple quarters
meanwhile the editor of the French
language edition of Playboy has called
the minister the most Playboy compatible
quote-unquote of the ministers in the
cabinet given her strong commitment
towards the fight for women's rights

decision write to us and share your

optimistic
so
for me I have my children back in Bombay
so it's very hard for me to be away from
them and it's been the biggest challenge
and the biggest sacrifice for me coming
to Goa has been having to
stay apart from my kids very
interestingly Goa as a government is
actually focusing a lot on Wellness
tourism they would like to change the
quality of tourists coming in and the
reason and purpose for which people
travel to Goa and wellness is one of the
biggest priorities I believe for this
government to cater to in tourism so I
seem to a be on the right path with
happy soul and therefore if that is the
intention of the government to bring in
more of that kind of tourist then I
think I'm going to be extraordinarily
busy in the coming in the years to come
I love the beaches here so every time I
have time out I tend to go to the Shacks
on the beach and eat their local food
and just you know lie on the beach and
you know pretend I'm like a sea turtle
and you know or a beach whale whichever
way like look at me now that I put on a
bit of weight so
and um my fiance builds both so I love
to spend time uh you know at sea or on
the river and um
I'm a nature girl so if you tell me you
know to go up to a Wilderness which is
about one and a half hours out and have
a lovely weekend in the wild I'd be very
happy to do that
um if you ask me to go on a on a on a
pub crawl Trail in fontanas and panjim
I'm very happy to do that as well and
this is the little Dives and go into all
these places and try a drink you know
these wonderful little spaces which have
come up in mushroom
um it goes so varied it brings so much
to the table there's so much I have
experienced in going so much I still
have to experience in Goa
the quality of my friendships that has
changed so dramatically since I've come
to Goa because no longer you're just
meeting them at a dinner or a party and
so having a half an hour conversation
with them when they're here you're
spending days with them you're they're
staying in your home
um you know you're interacting with them
completely differently and the nature of
those friendships has become so strong
and and beautiful and and and and
and grows from strength to strength so I
I just love everything that goes brought
into my life
the book that changed my life was who
Moved My Cheese
and I read that book and though it is a
book meant for marketing and it is a
book meant for uh used widely in
corporate circles
the fact that you move on when there is
no cheese and you go out there because
you're hungry and you're passionate and
needy of cheese and you go find cheese
it's symbolic or something that really
matters to you in your life and not
scared to go back into the maze again
and put on your running shoes and get
into the game of life again and you're
not deterred by the challenges of the
past which you're so focused on what you
need and want for yourself and you you
unapologetically go out there and get
what you want because it's time and you
want it I think that book just changed
my life I got divorced because of that
book
[Laughter]
and um and every time I I sit back and I

Hypersonic weapon systems have been in
the Limelight after Russia used them
against Ukraine
and now this weapon system is being
considered a game changer in Modern
Warfare
China Russia and the US are among the
few Nations that possess Hypersonic
missiles but there is one more nation
which is working in the shadow so on an
indigenously developed Hypersonic weapon
system why
India
is India already armed and ready with
these missiles I'm Shivan Jana welcome
to game plan let's get to the point
a Hypersonic missile travels at least
five times the speed of sound it is
highly maneuverable and is the next step
in the evolution of armed projectiles
the missile travels so fast in the
atmosphere that it forms a layer of
plasma cloud in front of its Warhead
that functions to block radio waves
protecting it from detection
these missiles can even cover continents
making them deadlier
apart from Russia U.S and China other
nations like France Germany Japan and
Australia are also in the process of
developing their own Hypersonic missiles
but India is working relentlessly and
conducting Hypersonic missile tests on a
regular basis and the West is taking a
key note of this
in India the brahmos 2 will be the
Hypersonic version of the missile
the trials have put its speed at almost
Mach 8 that means it's eight times the
speed of sound
India has been testing its indigenous
Hypersonic air breathing scramjet called
the hstdv or Hypersonic technology
demonstration vehicle
India has been conducting regular trials
in June 2019 and September of 2020
India's defense research and development
organization tested the hstdv off the
coast of odisha
then again in December of 2022 Indian
space research organization or ISRO
successfully conducted a joint
Hypersonic vehicle Drive
then again in January of 2023 India
tested its hstdv powered by a scramjet
engine from its East Coast
[Music]
conducted a night trial of its
nuclear-capable intercontinental
ballistic missile the Agni fight now it
may be too early to confirm but there
are reasons to believe that this was
indeed a Hypersonic Glide vehicle
reason number one the low velocity of
the missile indicated its
quasi-ballistic role which is usually
depicted by a Hypersonic Glide vehicle
reason number two the trajectory was
noted to be unusually lower within the
Earth's atmosphere
both reasons hinted that this was
perhaps a Hypersonic test
now us has been watching India's missile
advancements and as for a report by the
U.S Congress India has the most number
of testing facilities for Hypersonic
missiles compared to Australia France
Germany and Japan
of course these facilities in India are
heavily guarded by Elite Indian forces
and their whereabouts are shrouded in
secrecy
now while officials from brahmos have
said it will take India few more years
to get there
these reports suggest India is quietly
racing to develop Hypersonic missile
capability without making a lot of noise
about it so is India armed and ready
with hypersonic missiles what do you
think keep watching game plan for more

has been said and written about a
mother's love for her child
it's a bond that celebrated the world
over
but what happens when it's challenged or
perhaps misunderstood
this is Chatterjee versus Norway an
Indian legal drama was released across
the country on the 17th of March 2023.
the film stars Rani Mukherjee in the
lead and is based on the true story of
an immigrant Indian mother who battled
against an entire nation to win the
custody of her children
[Music]
while the film is running successfully
in theaters in India and across the
world it has also set a new Benchmark in
the country it is based on Norway
registering the highest ever weekend
collection in Norway for any Hindi
language film
however it has drawn a sharp response
from the Norway Embassy in India the
Norwegian ambassador to India has Jacob
friedenlund has criticized the film in
an opinion piece for the Indian Express
a newspaper he stated that the film
contains factual inaccuracies and
misrepresentations about Norway's
policies on family life it's not about
villainizing Norway or anything
it's a journey of a mother that is there
in the film it is an incident that
happened with South Africa it happened
in 2011 the Indian government was
involved the Indian government supported
her as you know and why would an entire
government support her if there was no
base to a story I condemned the false
statement by the Norwegian Ambassador in
the papers today he spoke about my case
without even having any decency to ask
me he should take this as an opportunity
to sensitize Norwegian or care workers
about the cultural prejudice even 10
years after I have single-handedly
brought up my children so well in full
View and full view of the world
when the whole world can see the
beautiful bond between my children and
me the Norwegian government continues to
spread lies against of me
a protection policy which is allegedly
being compared to State sanctioned child
abduction in this episode we dig deeper
into the issue to find out
what is the role of Norway's child
welfare services the real life story of
sagarika chakraborty whose book The
Journey of a mother inspired the film
Mrs Chatterjee vs Norway the legalities
involved in the case and the ongoing
custody dispute between an Indian family
and the German Authority
Norway is known for its social welfare
system which provides citizens with
Health Care education and other basic
needs
however the country has been the subject
of controversy due to its policy of
removing children from their biological
families
according to the website of the
government of Norway the primary duty of
the Child Welfare Services is to ensure
that children and young people living
under conditions that may harm their
health and development will receive the
necessary assistance when they need it
and to contribute to giving children and
young people safe conditions for growing
up the Norwegian Child Protection
Service also known as Barnabas is
responsible for protecting children from
abuse and neglect under Norwegian law
the state has a duty to intervene if a
child is in danger and in some cases
this may mean removing the child from
their home
according to a report published by the
Sunday Guardian in 2018 the Norwegian
child welfare agency born of Arnett
removes around 1500 children from their
parents every year this amounts to
around four children per day all year
round
it stems from the fact that the state
believes that the state is a guardian of
the minor children who are residing
within the jurisdiction of that
particular sort of you know country or
that particular
and they see that they have they have
the right to decide what is in the best
interest of the children
many immigrant families in Norway have
accused Barnabas of taking away their
children without proper justification
citing in some cases even cultural
differences as the reason
sagarika chakraborty was one such parent
who fought with the Norwegian
authorities for the custody of her
children weon spoke with sagarika and
this is her story
[Music]
in 2007 when sagarika chakraborty got
married she moved with her husband to
Norway and settled in the city of
Stavanger
[Music]
a few years later they became a family
of four sagarika says they were living
like a normal family with their two
children until one day their world
turned upside down
in 2011 child welfare authorities
knocked on their door
[Music]
[Music]
um
thank you
as with many aggrieved parents
chakraborty's troubles started at her
son's kindergarten it was a report of
concern from the nursery school that was
a red flag for the child welfare
services
and just like that born of Arnett
stepped in and whisked the two children
away questioning sagarika's ability to
raise them
but how can a state-run agency remove
children from their biological parents
on what grounds well
the procedure to understand the
legalities involved in the case we spoke
with suranya ir a new delhi-based lawyer
who has been working on a pro bono basis
with families facing child protection
proceedings abroad
they said about sagarika that
baby used to look at the care workers
when they walked in and therefore it
showed that she was not attached to the
mother
I mean it's the and this is written in
black and white in the documents you
know in similarly in the case of the Sun
so the care workers would say that you
know uh he throws that he bangs his head
on the floor whenever he his mom comes
to pick him up and uh he fears and
reject therefore he fears and rejects
that after the children were taken into
care they the authorities continued to
give reports about the children so head
banging is alleged to be the evidence of
sagarika's a bad mothering but when the
special educator two months after the
children have now been removed from the
parents says that the boy is still he's
head banging but we found ways if we let
him be uh it's just his way of playing
[Music]
the case led to a diplomatic row between
India and Norway the Indian authorities
put pressure on the Norwegian Embassy in
New Delhi as well as the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and the ministry of
children equality and social inclusion
in Oslo
in sagarika's case the reason why the
children were sent back was holy and
solely because the government of India
took this up as an issue and absolutely
insisted that Indian children have to be
sent back to India and if there's any uh
you know doubts about the parents then
they can be placed in the extended
family you know sagarika came back on
the understanding that the children
would be sent back to India and then uh
you know she could uh it would be the
matter would move from there uh but her
husband chose to stay on in Norway and
the in-laws refused access to the
children so now she had on her hands a
double procedure I mean she's going to
have to prove to the Indian Child
Welfare authorities that she's a fit
mother and she's also going to have to
fight this custody battle with her
in-laws family to get the babies back
the children came back in April of 2012
and she was only able to finally get
them back in January of the following
year
um
leaders
everybody came to the protest
um
[Music]
kidnapping here
it has been more than a decade since the
garika got custody of both of her
children but even today recounting the
painful memories of the past is
difficult for her and one can understand
why
because
[Music]
moved out of Kolkata to earn a
livelihood
day she works for an information
technology company in the national
capital region but she thinks about her
children day and night and manages to
speak to them every evening
it's all actually a huge trauma in my
life actually because uh
um
[Music]
[Music]
taking all the responsibilities of my
family

[Music]
faced criticism for its approach and
actions
in 2015 five children were removed from
a Romanian Norwegian family by the
Norwegian child welfare services
the case sparked widespread protests in
Norway and Romania hundreds of people
took to the streets to denounce
eventually in 2016 the family regained
custody of their children
in recent years Norway has been found
guilty of violating the human rights of
families at the European Court of Human
Rights Norway is facing the highest
number of legal complaints and most of
these pertain to the Grievances of
parents
foreign
Germany another European country came
into the Limelight due to the ongoing
case with an Indian family we own spoke
with the parents of ariha Shah to bring
you their story
in 2018 an Indian couple dhara and
bhavesh Shah moved to Germany babesh
started working as a software engineer
in Berlin on a work visa two years later
the couple was blessed with a girl child
Aria Shah was just seven months old when
she suffered an injury the parents took
her to a nearby hospital what happened
next was inexplicable as the parents
tell
somebody
um
they had noticed this bleeding in the
diaper and the hospital said there's an
injury in the private parts and so they
were placed under suspicion of abuse and
the hospital told them that it seems to
be fine and you can take the child back
five days later this was over the
weekend so after the weekend they're not
quite satisfied you know and so they
take the child back to the hospital this
time the hospital says that there's an
injury and instead of admitting its own
mistake it turns around and blames them
uh accuses them of having done it it was
not just a child protection case but
also police investigation into sexual
abuse
in September 2021 Dara and the vicious
life fell apart when arija was taken
into child care custody by German
authorities after all the police
investigation uh it took around like two
or three months uh on February 2022
um the sexual abuse charges were dropped
and uh the main sexual abuse charges
like the primary I can say was on her it
was totally me whom they were suspecting
that I have sexually abused my seven
month old daughter so this was like
unbelievable for me when this uh find
out this there was no sexual abuse of
the child then they tried to say
mother's mental health is not fine so
every time why they are focusing on
mother only because it's very difficult
for them to you know separate a child
from a mother
came to the notice of the Indian
government in December last year Indian
external affairs minister s Jai Shankar
raised the issue with his German
counterpart on Elena bareback
this relates to a child called
so we have concerns that the child
should be in her linguistic religious
cultural and social environment I think
it's a very delicate matter there are
privacy issues involved in it so I think
both garments are handling it with that
very much in mind as a mother of two
daughters I would like to say that for
me the well-being of aliyat Shah is very
important to me so I have received
detailed information about this case I
can assure you that the child is well
and for everybody in India and for
everybody in Germany and the German
authorities most particularly the
child's well-being is the first priority
as has been said by the my distinguished
colleague it is about privacy rights as
well so we cannot say more at this point
the case is still pending in court
in February 2022 the criminal
investigation against the parents was
closed without charges
however the couple is yet to get custody
of their child why has there been no
Headway in the case
Hospital which placed them under this
suspicion are also put
an evaluation by their forensics
you know agreed to go to even though
they hadn't been given any medical
records and that forensic psychologist
gave a report ruling out sexual abuse so
the same Hospital which placed them
under suspicion issues a report ruling
out sexual abuse still the child is in
return parents are told you have to go
undergo a psychological evaluation to
see your parenting capacity
this whole process takes a year you know
they are interviewed without a
translator in their language and uh the
the interactions with the with the baby
and the parents are observed at the end
of this in December last year this is a
court appointed psychologist says that
the child can go back to the parents but
the child services have filed enough
have again filed saying no they don't
want the child to be returned
at present hariha is growing up at a
foster care home in Berlin speaking
German and understanding the culture
Dara the mother has missed many of her
child's developmental milestones and
that
is her biggest regret

each day she prays to be reunited with
her child and she believes it will
happen soon
foreign
case is an ongoing battle between the
parents and the German authorities there
are thousands of similar cases in
Germany however there is the other side
cases of child deaths and abuse are
alarmingly high and widespread in
Germany according to German police crime
statistics 2021 every third day one
child dies as a result of abuse every
day 12 children are hospitalized because
they were ill-treated state intervention
becomes necessary in many cases where
child abuse is a reality in 2021 German
youth welfare officers called jugan
dumpt took 47 500 children and young
people into temporary care for their
protection so when does the State
intervene Germany sets out four
categories of child endangerment signs
of neglect and signs of physical
emotional and sexual abuse are the
reasons for taking children and young
people into foster care
particularly in Western Europe the
ability of the adult to talk to a child
and indeed genuinely openly listen to
the child's opinions their choices that
they make their point of view
I I think that they've um
uh they've developed it over a period
right and that is a part of the culture
children often are expected to leave
home and fend for themselves even if
they go to college by the time they're
18. and now that's a common practice in
the UK or I'm sure in Western Europe and
the reason why they can do it is also
because the state takes care they take
care of these kids so you know if they
go to a college if they go to a
particular place where there are you
know living quarters or hostels for
young people there's also safety and
other things that are look you know
taken care of but generally speaking if
we look at the the love and the child
care and the nurturing Etc I don't think
that it's a lot very different I think
they also love their children very much
and they really take care
for this reportage weon reached out to
Norwegian and German authorities for
their comments on the subject and
related cases we haven't received any
response till the broadcasting time of
the show
providing children with the safe and
nurturing environment is of Paramount
importance proponents of child
protection policy argue that the state
has a duty to intervene to protect
children from any harm
does it also imply separating children
from their biological parents the debate
continues

[Music]
this is our weekly show where we bring
you all the latest updates stories and
news from the most volatile region in
the world West Asia today our top
stories about the Israeli politics for
weeks now Israelis have been protesting
against netanyahu's judicial reforms in
the end cornered Netanyahu took a
decision to delay these reforms now what
will happen next will he read the room
or is it just a step to tone down the
public anger let's take a look
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
Israel is going through unprecedented
times its longest serving prime minister
who is leading the country's most
far-right Coalition stands against the
tide of a public opinion
last week Israel saw historic protests
the day of strikes that brought the
country to a standstill
pressure strong enough to push Netanyahu
into a corner forcing him to delay the
controversial judicial reforms
addressing the nation on a day suffused
with tensions prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu invoked a biblical story
he spoke of the Judgment of Solomon
where the king had to rule between two
women both claiming to be the mother of
a child Solomon ordered that the child
be cut in two and the woman who
protested the verdict was determined to
be the real mother
Israel
Israeli citizens I am not ready to tear
the people apart for three months I read
over and over again the conversations
and I also said that I would turn over
every stone to reach a solution because
I remember we remember that we are not
facing enemies we stand in front of
brothers and I say here and now there
must not be a civil war
Netanyahu spoke against a Civil War in
an attempt to divert people's attention
from the fact that it was his own
measures to clip the wings of the
Judiciary that brought Israel to the
brink of one
the Prime Minister has agreed to delay
the judicial reform but this is only
until the next Parliament session
reports are that Coalition partner
bengvir gave the green light for this
before concluding Netanyahu said that
the reform will be achieved through
dialogue next time
this is not the kind of delay expected
by the critics the speech which was
expected to calm the nation did not have
the desired effect while a Revolt within
the ranks of netanyahu's supporters
might have aborted the protesting public
remains on the streets
foreign
[Music]
[Applause]
for the unversed The Proposal made by
the Israeli government seeks to curb the
judiciary's role in the making of public
policy the bill seeks to limit the
Supreme Court's power to exercise the
judicial review and Grant the government
control over judicial appointments by
limiting the authority of legal advisors
in a nutshell if this judicial overhaul
or reform as it is called gets adopted
it would Grant the knesset the power to
override the Israeli Supreme Court's
decisions opposition to the judicial
overhaul is not only from within Israel
but from important world capitals the
new chief of Human Rights Watch has
accused the Netanyahu government of
being on a rampage against rights
right now with the current state of the
Israeli government and the attacks on
the Judiciary in particular we see that
this is not a human rights compliant
government this is a government that's
actually on this on a on a rampage
against human rights domestically
against its own people in Israel and
they are pushing back
on the international stage Israel's ties
with the United States its strongest
Ally was put to the test
Netanyahu tried to smooth over a very
public split with President Biden while
Washington quickly toned down its stance
on the Israeli crisis we obviously urge
Israeli leaders to come up with a
compromise as soon as possible and the
president's comments yesterday about
walking away from it are perfectly
consistent with with finding a
compromise that
um
that again preserves checks and balances
in Israel analysts and observers say
that Netanyahu has limited options he
can either side with Coalition and
aggravate The Divide within the country
or call off the reform and risk collapse
of his government
another option one that he might prefer
may be available if negotiators reached
a moderated judicial overhaul plan Bill
during the knesset's recess a reform
proposal that is acceptable to all
parties West Asia Bureau we own world is
one
we have a lot more lined up for you in
this special edition of the West Asia
post but first let's take a quick look

America is losing influence here

Saudi Arabia and Iran and as a result
these two countries restore ties now in
the latest it looks like Russia is
brokering something of such between
Syria and Saudi Arabia we tell you more

restored ties with Iran there are now

earlier this week Sony State television
reported that for the first time in the
last 10 years talks are underway for
reopening riyadh's Embassy in Damascus
the two governments are also reportedly
preparing to reopen embassies after
Ramadan
[Music]
Saudi Arabia which backed the Syrian
opposition in the country's War closed
its Embassy in Damascus and expelled the
Syrian Ambassador in 2012. the Wall
Street Journal reported that talks
between the two parties mediated by
Russia are going on
if the negotiations are successful then
it will mark an important step to
reintegrating Syria and its leader
Bashar al-assad back into the Arab
Community after a brutal Civil War
Saudi Arabia and Syria cut ties in 2012
after president Assad's Crackdown on
protesters it was the Saudis that helped
orchestrate serious ejection from the
Arab League and allegedly funded Rebels
to fight the government forces for years
in the last few years much of the Arab
world has set aside rivalries that came
up following the Arab Spring protests
that began in 2011.
the Syrian president himself has been in
talks with several West Asian Nations
hoping to end the years of isolation
foreign
the development comes shortly after
China helped broker a deal between Saudi
Arabia and Iran on resuming ties and if
these stocks also conclude positively it
will surely weaken the U.S as the
decisive presence in the region in spite
of its military occupation of a third of
Syria
China welcomes the agreement reached
between Syria and Saudi Arabia on
reopening embassies of the two countries
Syria has returned to the Arab family
will be conducive to the unity and
revitalization of Arab countries I would
also like to stress that China firmly
supports Arab countries in strengthening
their unity and cooperation
whereas for Russia mediating between
Saudi Arabia and Syria has bolstered
Russia's influence in the region
Putin had previously intervened in the
Syrian Civil War giving a big push to
Assad while he has also courted the
Saudis aligning oil-rich Russia with the
Riyadh LED OPEC grouping
but for the U.S it
that while it Remains the big military
and diplomatic Force its influence in
the region is under increasing
challenges
West Asia Bureau we own world of swan
our next story is a very interesting one
she's one of the most influential women
in the world before the world considered
her husband an international Pariah she
took Europe by storm when she visited
with him recently she went alongside her
husband the president to the United Arab
Emirates she met with the first lady of
the Emirates as well she came back home
and she met with other influential
Global women I'm talking about a cancer
survivor a first lady and the head of
the ngos in Syria what do we know about
Asma al-assad let's take a look
last week Syria's first lady visited the
United Arab Emirates along with her
husband president Bashar al-assad on the
visit a small Assad met with the mother
of the nation
Fatima bint Mubarak
the two leaders discussed the
empowerment of women along with issues
of mutual interest
on returning home Asma al-assad met with
the secretary of the United Nations
economic and social committee for West
Asia the focus of their meeting was
small and medium Enterprises across
Syria
she later hosted the deputy speaker of
the Russian Parliament and gave a
reception to welcome her
in recent years
asthma's presence has become difficult
to miss in the Syrian landscape
a female face leading these
conversations is rare in the region
thank you
analysts have called her the Assad
regime's PR machine an image booster but
there is no denying that she has emerged
as a force
representing an isolated Syria in West
Asia born as a smart fawaz akhras the
first lady was raised in London
she was about to begin her MBA at
Harvard when she started dating the
Second Son of the Syrian president
and the then-air apparent
after her marriage to Bashar al-assad in
2000
the first lady diverted all energy to
the Social and economic development of
Syria
she heads almost all major ngos
operating in the country
she also is the chief of the
government's charity departments
Regional experts have called her the
modernizing force of the Syrian
presidency
foreign
before the Civil War Assad was credited
with taking Progressive positions on
women's rights and education
she was named one of the most
influential Arab by a prominent West
Asian magazine
but things changed when Syria divulged
into a civil war she was soon called on
by most western leaders and Publications
to stop the government's Crackdown on
protesters
but the first lady stood by her
husband's side she is at present subject
to EU sanctions and facing a probe under
the Metropolitan police's war crimes
Department that is not all about the
women at the center of the Syrian
presidency
in 2018 it was announced that Asma
al-assad was suffering from cancer
she was on treatment
and the cancer cleared after a year
the Survivor later publicly stated that
she has fully recovered and is now
cancer-free
West Asia Bureau we on world is one
now to Lebanon the country I'm currently
standing in well Lebanon as a country is
around 100 years old the Dual lives of
these people is somehow the identity of
this Republic but never did the Lebanese
citizens expect to have two different
time zones and for this to be the point
of religious and sectarian differences
last week people in Lebanon some people
in Lebanon had their clocks at 6 a.m
While others had them at seven Banks
schools airports everything got really
confused are you also confused let's
explain in this report
most of us don't even realize but every
year about 70 countries change their
time zones
as spring approaches this season brings
a lot of changes
warmer weather longer days blooming
flowers and the beginning of daylight
saving time
the moment the clock strikes 2 am on the
second Sunday in March the clocks are
forwarded by one hour the idea is to add
an hour of sunlight to save power
you see with later sunsets people are
more likely to spend time outdoors and
less time indoors It is believed that
this leads to reduced electricity usage
whether that happens or not that's
debatable
part of this list is the West Asian
country of Lebanon
but the government here made a last
minute decision to delay the start of
daylight savings time it was suddenly
decided that it will be practiced from a
month later on April 21st
you see the Lebanese government is head
by a Sunni caretaker prime minister and
the Parliament speaker is Shia
it was seen as a Muslim biased decision
to score points among the waterways they
feel the move will allow those fasting
for Ramadan to break it an hour earlier
even though in reality fasting is not
really dependent on time it is supposed
to end at Sunset regardless of the time
zone
so obviously not everyone was happy with
this decision the debate quickly took on
a sectarian turn
Christian politicians and institutions
rejected the move including the largest
church the Maronite which is extremely
influential in the country for the
people this brought a wave of confusion
on March 12th the phones and watches
automatically changed the time to
Daylight Saving after which phone
networks were forced to put out a
statement they asked the customers to
manually change it back the house party
we were at a house party last night and
we looked at our phones one phone showed
the clock 1 20 am and the other 2 20 am
it was like what is happening and we
wondered if it was alcohol or not we
took a photo of them to double check
later I look at them now and confirm the
clock on each phone was different so it
wasn't the alcohol this is definitely a
weird historic moment that we will look
back at and laugh historic moment
they create problems to deepen the
division between Muslims and Christians
because those in power are the ones
benefiting from the people's dispute
now in theory public institutions are
bound by the government's decisions but
private institutions started picking
sites only adding to the confusion
seeing all of this the government
reversed its decision so now Lebanon is
complying with the daylight savings time
what kind of the classroom it was a calm
discussion in which every Minister

this

how

[Music]
our big story tonight is about a secret
Alliance in the Ukraine war let's begin
with the question
which country is supplying Ukraine with
critical Battlefield weapons at a time
when Ukraine is desperate for them
for crucial rockets and main battle
tanks
is it Poland the United States Britain
France Italy
you're not even close the answer is
Pakistan
Islamabad is providing not only arms but
also facilitating the supply of
terrorists to Ukraine engaged in a war
with Russia that has resulted in massive
casualties and destruction of military
hardware
Pakistan sent the weapons secretly
through the ports of Germany and Poland
and to the air bases of Romania
and over the next few minutes we blow
the lid off this Alliance it's secret
operations it's third party routes also
its hidden network of mercenaries
I'll start with this report
it came out on Tuesday
it says the Ukrainian Army has just
received Consignments of military
equipment from Pakistan
and what was in these Consignments you
ask
Pakistani Rockets the most lethal ones
I am talking about the yarmukh he frag
Rockets
these are unguided surface-to-surface
Rockets developed by the Pakistan
Ordnance factories
you see they can go to a maximum
distance of 20 kilometers with a maximum
flight time of 78 seconds and a muzzle
velocity of 400 meters per second
and these Rockets are now in Ukraine's
Arsenal
in fact they have already been sent to
the battlefield
have a look at these images on your
screen
these are Ukrainian soldiers unloading
the yarmuks they are using them in the
rocket launchers
and the question is how did these
weapons even reach Ukraine you because
officially Pakistan has not acknowledged
any military assistance to Kiev
well they were sent via third parties
like Romania Poland Germany
and if I speak of Romania specifically
it has reportedly built an air Bridge
with Pakistan
a secret aerial route meant for weapon
Supply
Britain apparently played a big role in
establishing this
if I speak of Poland and Germany
for months now their ports have been
buzzing with Consignments from Karachi
in fact in late February Pakistan
reportedly sent 10 000 Rockets to these
countries ten thousand
the Rockets were then secretly rooted to
Kiev
and it's not just rockets by the way
Pakistan is also giving Ukraine
mercenaries who can wield these Rockets
muscle men or guns for hire straight
from Battle hardened Afghanistan
in fact Reports say it is doing so at
the behest of its American overlords
I know these are not alternative
pro-russia media houses reporting this
these are mainstream American news
outlets and networks like the New York
Times
on the 25th of March it carried this
report it talked about groups of
volunteers that are currently fighting
in Ukraine
it said these groups are illegally
exporting mercenaries smuggling them
with fake passports from countries like
Pakistan and Afghanistan
and who exactly are these Mercenaries
well most of them are former Afghan
soldiers who once fought the Taliban and
today they have fled their Homeland and
are fighting the Russians in donbass
in fact the Ukrainian president has
created an international lesion a
separate division of foreign Fighters
that are fighting on behalf of Ukraine
there are at least 20 000 of them
they come from 52 countries Pakistan and
Afghanistan happen to be the biggest
contributors to this lesion
and what do they get in return
well the Afghan Fighters get a new lease
of life and lucrative loads of cash
and as for Pakistan in return for giving
mercenaries and weapons it gets what it
needs the most right now and that's
money
I don't need to tell you why
the country is Cash strapped to say the
least the economy is in the Dual drums
the rupee at the bottom of the barrel
so by secretly arming Ukraine Pakistan
is Raising its Forex reserves reserves
which it needs to survive
and there is suspicion that such
assistance to American strategic
interests also helps in getting American
assistance in the negotiations with the
IMF for loans that Pakistan is unlikely
to repay because the default on the
loans
is its standard operating practice
the question is is Moscow aware of this
it certainly is
but it is yet to directly call out
Islamabad
the two are in the middle of negotiating
a crude oil deal
but Reports say the delay in finalizing
this deal has started to irk the
Russians
the headline on your screen proving this
it says Moscow has expressed serious
concerns over Pakistan's failure in
setting up a company responsible for
importing crude to Pakistani refineries
and this failure has apparently highly
disappointed Moscow
is that the real reason or is Moscow
angry about the Pakistan Ukraine defense
access
and here's why I asked this
earlier today a security Conference was
held in New Delhi a conference of
National Security advisors from the SEO
countries chaired by Aji doval
in attendance was Nikolai patrochev he
is the secretary to Russia Security
Council and one of the few people
extremely close to Vladimir Putin
a report by the economic time says Patra
chef may have discussed Pakistan's
actions with Duval
the secret military Alliance which it
has established with Kiev
so the question is is Moscow about to
retaliate for islamabad's double dealing
we will find out soon enough
so on the Diplomatic front Pakistan is
indulging in deception
and on the domestic front it is
indulging in authoritarianism
I don't say this without reason
Pakistan has just approved a bill that
will curtail the powers of the country's
chief justice
why was such a bill needed what exactly
does it entail
our next report telling you
this is Umar Atta bandial the Chief
Justice of Pakistan the latest Target of
the Pakistan government
on Wednesday it approved a bill to
curtail his powers a decision that has
sparked a big debate a debate on whether
the government is overstepping its role
will get there in a bit first let's tell
you about the bill it's called the
Supreme Court act 2023 it was presented
by Pakistan's law Minister Azam Nazir
tarar here's what it entails
1. ending the chief Justice's power to
initiate proceedings in his individual
capacity
two empowering a committee of three
judges to take suamoto notice of cases
three granting the right to appeal
against sumoto verdicts within 30 days
of their passing 4. any case involving
interpretation of the Constitution to
have a five-judge bench in a nutshell
the aim of this bill is to remove the
cjp's discretionary powers and give them
to a committee of Judges why did
Pakistan need such a bill because
apparently the chief justice is favoring
Imran Khan we are not saying this
Pakistan's own leaders are in February
the Chief Justice trespassed in to the
executive's space and launched sumoto
proceedings over elections in Punjab no
one asked the top Court to do this it
took this action of its own accord
the pmln said he did so because he's
Imran Khan's friend a month on the pmln
is trying to clip his wings and as
expected Imran Khan is a mighty upset he
says this move is illegal it's aimed at
putting more pressure on the Judiciary
this is what he said in a tweet the
attack on the Supreme Court of Pakistan
by the gang of criminals the attempts to
reduce its powers and degrade it is
being strongly resisted by the people
and this resistance will continue so
where are things headed well the bill
has been passed in the National Assembly
it will now head to the senate for
approval where the ruling Alliance has a
majority if the bill is approved by the
Senate it will be sent to the president
who interestingly is from the PTI
to put it simply the coming days in
Pakistani politics could be filled with
fireworks
your report we on world is one
is the Chinese pressure on Bhutan
succeeding
have the Chinese been able to
successfully create a rift between India
and Bhutan
has Beijing pressure Temple into seeding
land
well it looks like the answer is yes
meet Lotus sharing he is the prime
minister of Bhutan and recently he gave
an interview to a Belgian daily where he
said that China has a say in the doklam
issue much like India and Bhutan
let me read out his exact statement
doklam is a junction point between India
China and Bhutan
it is not up to Bhutan alone to solve
the problem
we are three
there is no big or small country
there are three equal countries each
counting for a third
if you don't find the statement jarring
then allow me to add some context to it
was a place where six years ago India
and China came near to a military
conflict
in 2017 China was trying to extend an
illegally constructed Road and stretch
it towards Mount Kip Mochi and the
jumperi ridge which is adjacent to the
club and Indian troops prevented this
Construction
the standoff lasted two months
the jumperi ridge is in Bhutan and
gipmochi sits on the border between
India and Bhutan
why was the Indian army involved
because doklam overlooks parts of India
and for obvious security reasons India
does not want China to get access to the
club
but Beijing wants this military
advantage and that is why it has been
eyeing doklam and claiming all of the
club
let's pull out a map for you this is
batang La this is where the tri-junction
point between the three countries lies
on the west is India Sikkim on the north
is China's chungbi Valley
and on the south and east is Bhutan
this is the tri-junction point that is
internationally accepted China wants it
shifted by seven kilometers seven
kilometers south of batang LA
somewhere here
near the peak of Mount Kip mochi
moving this tri-junction point would
legally make the entire doklam Plateau a
part of China
and give it a sight of the Strategic
Siliguri corridor
something that is obviously not
acceptable to India
in fact back in 2017
bhutan's position was analogous with
India's
but that seems to have changed quickly
six years later the bhutanese Prime
Minister says there has been no
intrusion by the Chinese into Bhutan
again let me quote him
a lot of information is circulating in
the media about Chinese facilities in
Bhutan
we are not making a big deal about them
because they are not in Bhutan
we have said it categorically there is
no intrusion as mentioned in the media
this is an international border and we
know exactly what belongs to us
and how true is this claim
satellite images show Chinese
constructions along the amochu river
valley
there are Chinese Villages here not one
or two but several
the Chinese have also constructed a road
here and this road goes through Bhutan
so here's the bitter truth
China is salami slicing Bhutan and the
country's leadership is looking the
other way
even legitimizing the Chinese intrusion
and occupation by denying it all
together
sharing is also giving up ownership of
bhutiny's land on which the Chinese have
created settlements
you see he is telling the world that
China has a stake and a say in the club
whereas Beijing does not and should not
either
and as for New Delhi it is choosing to
remain silent but does that in any way
dial down the security challenge of
having China breathing down India's neck
sharing says that his country is ready
for discussion provided to provided the
other two countries are
but whatever does he plan to discuss
the status of dhokla
what happened to fighting for one's land
to protecting one's country
less than four years ago in 2019 sharing
had told an Indian daily that no country
should do anything near the tri-junction
point
unilaterally
and today he is publicly seeding land
you see the timing could not be more
interesting because this interview comes
months after a meeting in the Chinese
city of Kunming
who all were a part of this meeting
bhutanese and Chinese officials and
these officials met to discuss a
three-step roadmap to settle the Border
disputes
a joint statement was released soon
after
so we are back to the questions that we
started with
is the Chinese pressure on Bhutan
succeeding
have the Chinese been able to
successfully create a rift between India
and Bhutan
has Beijing pressure Tempo into seeding
land
I think you have the answers
you see that's the thing with China
it uses a mixture of pressure persuasion
and sophisticated diplomacy to expand
its diplomatic reach and to score some
impressive diplomatic points
like what China is doing in West Asia
you see it's trying to replace American
influence in this region
First China brokered peace between Saudi
Arabia and Iran
and now it could be pursuing Saudi
Arabia to pull out of the Yemen War you
heard that right the word is that Riyadh
could soon be pulling out
there is no official confirmation yet
but signs abound
number one being
Saudi Arabia is talking peace with Iran
the same Iran that backs the hoodie
rebels in Yemen who in turn are fighting
the saudi-back government
basically Iran and Saudi Arabia are
fighting each other in Yemen but now
that the two are looking to shake hands
chances of a direct impact on the Yemen
War are pretty high
because experts say it is unlikely that
the China broker deal did not have some
understanding that Iran would hold back
armed supply to the hudis in Yemen or
something on those lines
which brings us to single number two
let's just rewind nine days
on the 20th of March
the two sides in Yemen swapped prisoners
among them were 15 Saudis
reacting to this one expert said the
move quote unquote indicates the way
ahead for all parties
so what exactly is this way forward
is it a possible de-escalation
time for some quick background the
saudi-led military intervention in Yemen
began in 2015. why
because Riyadh feared the prospect of
hudi is taking control of Yemen and of
Yemen becoming a satellite of Iran
and this is where the two countries are
located
Yemen and Saudi Arabia share a border
so in March 2015 Saudi Arabia began air
campaigns in Yemen and ever since some
thousands of people have died in these
saudi-led airstrikes
this is according to un estimates
today Yemen has become the face of the
world's largest humanitarian crisis
at least
377 000 people have lost their lives 60
percent of these deaths were caused by
hunger unsafe water lack of Health Care
over 10 000 children have been killed or
injured
80 percent of the country's remaining
population needs aid needs protection
could the shifting Sands in this part of
the world give them some hope could it
open avenues for resolution could the
Thor between Saudi Arabia and Iran
create a landscape for a peace talk or a
peace deal in Yemen
you see here's one thing that the
Chinese president Xi Jinping is
absolutely clear about he wants to be a
peacemaker in Ukraine in West Asia
so he will leave any stone Aunt he will
not leave any stone unturned to broker
peace and to show to the world that
while the region was at War under
American influence China is here to
oversee peace
in fact just yesterday on the 28th of
March Xi Jinping and the Saudi Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman had a long
phone call
Chinese State media CCTV reported that
during the interaction Xi Jinping said
that China and Saudi Arabia will make
more contributions to promote peace
stability and development in West Asia
and a day later you have reports of a
possible intent to pull out of Yemen
could it be a mere coincidence or could
the long phone conversation have been
the basis of the decision regarding
Yemen
while Xi Jinping wants to score
diplomatic points pulling out of Yemen
also helped Saudi Arabia in more ways
than one
first it it gets the focus on Vision 20
on Vision 2030 which is a dream project
of the Crown Prince involving reduced
dependence on oil
diversification of the Saudi economy
also development of Health Care
education infrastructure Recreation
tourism
Saudi Arabia is looking at a new future
one where the war does not quite fit in
also the war in Yemen has not been doing
Saudi Arabia any good if anything the
hoodies have been hell-bent on
disrupting the Saudi oil industry
in the last couple of years
Saudi oil facilities have been struck
with drones there have been attacks
is this scenario sustainable
Riyadh can do without this headache and
focus on getting a facelift focus on
opening up on building a 500 billion
dollar futuristic city Neon
all that it needs in return is an
assurance that the Saudi border will be
safe
will China step in to get Iran to give
this a shortened story of
probably it already has
exiting the war also let Saudi Arabia
zoom out and focus beyond the immediate
region
look for partners beyond the existing
strategic Partnerships
and this is again where China comes in
Beijing is happy to tilt riyadh's axis
away from the United States
I don't know if you know this but China
has already invited Saudi Arabia to join
the SEO or the Shanghai cooperation
organization
have a look at this report
the approval was given during a cabinet
session during which the Saudi king
Salman also authorized the launch of
Technical and vocational training
between Riyadh and Beijing
he also thanked China for facilitating
good neighborly relations between Saudi
Arabia and Iran
so you see what's happening here
China is using its sophisticated
diplomacy to clear the Clutter from the
Saudi discourse and make enough space
for Chinese influence in the region
and guess what
it all seems to be working just
perfectly
so this is China
fresh out of the pandemic it walks the
world on its own terms
does that mean China is walking down the
path of peace without its Habit to
indulge in Wolf Warrior diplomacy wrong
there are some things that the dragon
cannot give up
things like bullying its belief in an
alternate reality or even its desire to
invade Taiwan
let me quickly tell you what's been
happening on that front
the timing is President Psy inguin is on
a 10-day trip to Belize and Guatemala
and during this trip the leader has two
stopovers
the first stopover is in New York the
second in Los Angeles
Society England is expected to make the
most of these stopovers including
meeting the U.S House speaker Kevin
McCarthy
while the meeting has not been formally
announced the chances of it happening
happening are quite High
it goes without saying China is seeing
red the Chinese leader Xi Jinping
believes that American support for
Taiwan amounts to nothing short of
interference in China's domestic affairs
and now Psy England meeting the speaker
who is only second in line to succeed
the president is being seen as nothing
short of a provocation
and as expected China has already issued
a warning
a Chinese spokesperson said that size
meeting with McCarthy would trigger a
response from China I'm quoting we
firmly oppose this and will definitely
take measures to resolutely fight back
what kind of measures
last year when then house Speaker Nancy
Pelosi visited Taiwan remember China
responded with large-scale military
exercises around Taiwan including firing
missiles close to taiwan's Coast
will the upcoming meeting trigger a
response even more charged
here's what Psy England has to say I'm
quoting external pressure will not
hinder our determination to advance
towards the world
we are calm and self-confident and will
not yield or provoke
which brings us to a question while
China is coding diplomatic points around
the world in Europe even West Asia is
Taiwan becoming China's sour grip
forcing it to look Beyond
our next story comes from the United
States where President Biden has
disobeyed the Israeli leader Benjamin
Netanyahu from moving forward with his
proposed judicial reforms Netanyahu has
fired back and escalated that dispute
with America
let's get to the details beneman
Netanyahu has responded to Joe Biden's
criticism of the controversial judicial
reforms saying that he will reject any
pressure from the White House
the statement from Netanyahu coming
after Biden said that he will not invite
Netanyahu to the White House in the near
term
he followed this up with a rebuke of
netanyahu's judicial reforms the same
reforms remember which sparked Mass
protests in Israel
Biden has shown great concern for the
people of Israel saying that Netanyahu
cannot continue down this road he also
urged the Israeli leader to work out a
genuine compromise and emphasize that he
should simply walk away listen in
like many strong Sports Israel I'm very
concerned
and I'm concerned that they get this
straight they cannot continue on this
road and I've sort of made that clear I
hope so hopefully the Prime Minister
will act in a way that he's going to try
to work out some genuine compromise but
that remains to be seen
Netanyahu has of course not taken that
criticism well he has Justified his
actions by saying that Israel is a
sovereign country which does not take
its decisions based on pressures from
abroad especially from its best friends
the Israeli Prime Minister has also
spoken about the pause taken regarding
the judicial reforms
I think that balance can be achieved and
that's why I've promoted a pause that
now enables both the opposition and the
coalition to sit down and try to achieve
a broad National consensus to achieve
both goals and I believe this is
possible we're now engaged in exactly
this conversation
so how exactly
exactly [ __ ] between the two sides
Israel's former Premiership has
explicitly said that netanyahu's moves
have ruined the relationship between the
two countries lapid has showed his
concern saying that netanyahu's extreme
government has ruined ties with America
in just three months
and let's remind you this is after
Israel remained America's closest Ally
for decades
Netanyahu netanyahu's government's
attempts meanwhile to weaken the power
of the country's courts has led to an
eruption of anger
and within some communities in the U.S
as well
it looks like netanyahu's delay as far
as the judicial reforms is concerned is
not enough for the protesters critics
saying Netanyahu is simply dealing the
judicial reforms because of the ongoing
corruption trial and Netanyahu on the
other hand has denied such claims
many Israelis might might be supporting
Biden's words at this moment as many
critics can see through netanyahu's
words they are calling the leaders moves
a fundamental threat to the country's
checks and balances
the reforms are capable of evaporating
minority protection Foster corruption
and damage the economy they see
but the leader is not backing down he
has announced
forming a national guard under
Vancouver's control critics say that
Netanyahu is going to create a militia
which will endanger Israeli citizens
particularly the protesters
but it looks like the demonstrators have
America's president on their side at
least for now but will Netanyahu still
go about wreaking havoc as far as the
country's democracy is concerned or will
he change his demeanor towards his own
country
I have a question for you when was the
last time you used cash
quite possible that it's been a while
after all most people prefer cashless
payments these days they are quick they
are easy there is no hassle of handling
bills or keeping the exact change
and now there has been an announcement
of an extra fee on some UPI transactions
in India
what does this mean for you when you
have to pay the surcharge the answer is
no at least not directly
let me just break it down for you
from the 1st of April Merchants will
have to pay up to 1.1 percent fee on UPI
transactions worth over 2000 rupees or
24.3 dollars
it is an interchange fee basically it's
charged by One bank to another for
processing a transaction
the amount will vary for different
sectors and Merchants here's what we
know
for fuel the cap is 0.5 percent
for Telecom post office education and
agriculture it is 0.7 percent
there would be a 0.9 fee for Supermarket
transactions and one percent fee for
government Railways mutual funds and
insurance
but here's a good part
individual users making personal
transactions will not be charged any
additional fees
so you can rest easy there will not be
any surcharge on Direct bank-to-back
transactions
the fee will only be levied on prepaid
payment instruments in simple terms on
your digital wallets like paytm phone
pay Google pay that allow you to store
money and make payments
so what is the fuss about
why has the national payments
cooperation of India announced this fee
in the first place and how does it
affect you
there is no denying that UPI
transactions are convenient
in fiscal year 2017 to 18 there were
20.7 billion digital transactions in
India
the figure jumped to 81.9 billion in the
fiscal year 21 to 22. as of June 2022
digital payments constituted about 40
percent of all the payments in India
since 2020 the number of UPR
transactions has been doubling year on
year
by 2026 two out of every three
transactions are projected to be digital
so long story short UPI payments have
skyrocketed
but Banks and payment service providers
have been struggling with the high cost
Let Me Explain how
according to the Reserve Bank of India
all stakeholders in a UPR transaction
bear a 0.25 cost by stakeholders I mean
the payer beneficiary Banks the third
party app and the npci
in 2020 India's Finance Minister
announced that the RBI and banks will
absorb the UPI costs the payer Merchant
and the app will not be charged anything
but to what extent
the value of all UPR transactions in the
financial year 21 to 22 was 10.2 billion
dollars
if we assume the overall cost for all
UPI payments to be 0.1 percent of the
transaction value the total figure would
still be over 1 billion dollars
and this far exceeds the government
incentives
that only cover payments under 2000
rupees
the new surcharge is meant to reduce
these costs for the banks it aims to
increase their revenue
as I told you the charges are to be paid
by the merchants
but what if the merchants direct them
towards you
would you like to pay extra fee for
simply avoiding cash
doesn't sound fair does it
so what can you do if it comes down to
that
there are some loopholes first off you
can break down your bill you are under
no obligation to pay the entire amount
in one go if the check is over 2000
rupees split it into multiple payments
under that amount
secondly you can simply go for bank to
bank transactions use your digital
wallets for paying smaller amounts and
use UPI for the bigger sums
but what if the merchants discourage you
from digital transactions what if they
start demanding cash what happens then
this is something that the npci needs to
tackle
the world is facing another major Public
Health crisis
I'm not talking about another virus or
flu it's something much more prevalent
I'm talking about obesity
the World Health Organization is trying
to deal with it
it is considering including obesity
combating drugs in its essential
medicines list
a panel will be coming up with a
decision next month
so what exactly are these drugs and how
do they work
one of them is called saxender it is a
once daily injection
it helps people reduce five percent to
ten percent of their body weight
it costs 450 dollars per month in the US
and 150 dollars per month in the UK
another one is wigovi it is a weekly
injection it costs one thousand and
three hundred dollars a month in the US
users have reported losing up to 15
percent of their body weight
you see these medicines come with
exorbitant price tags
third world countries cannot afford them
so what happens when these drugs make it
to the World Health organization's list
they would become more accessible to the
low and middle income countries more
governments would Source them and more
people would be able to consume them
while the who's decision could be a
small win we cannot ignore the fact that
prevention is better than cure
what the who is aiming to do would cure
this problem but it cannot by far reduce
it
have a look at these numbers globally
more than 2.8 million people die due to
obesity every year around 1.3 billion
adults are overweight
650 million of them are obese 39 million
children under the age of five were
overweight to overweight or obese in the
year 2020.
over half of obese people live in just
10 countries
they are the U.S China India Russia
Brazil Mexico Egypt Germany Pakistan and
Indonesia
did you notice something
most of these countries are low or
middle-income countries
it shows that poverty is one of the
biggest drivers when it comes to obesity
and why is that
because people with meager incomes
cannot buy healthy food
so they may do with cheap fast food
if you visit these countries you will
find cheap stands in every nook and
cranny
offering inexpensive food with no
nutritional value
how can providing obesity medicines be
enough then
the who's move does not quite cut it and
the scary part is the rates of obesity
are continuously Rising they are
particularly bad among children and in
the third world countries
the world obesity Federation predicts
that more than 4 billion people will be
obese or overweight within the next 12
years can you imagine that
that is more than half of the world's
total population
these people will be at risk of
hypertension high cholesterol type 2
diabetes stroke coronary heart diseases
gallbladder diseases
sleep apnea breathing issues you name it
the list goes on
obesity is not only a health care issue
it is also an economic problem
studies after all show that obese people
are more likely to be less productive at
work they also take more sick leaves as
compared to non-obese employees
if 51 of the world's population is on
the path to being obese there would be a
dip in productivity
what would that mean for the economy
while the Whos move could help tackle
the problem it is a far cry from a
long-term solution
instead of focusing on drugs maybe it
should focus on ways to prevent obesity
the issue needs to be addressed at the
grassroot level
yesterday we told you how the Wuhan
border seems to be on the prowl once
again in the country the number of
covid-19 cases is gradually on the rise
and India has already witnessed the
highest number of cases in the past five
months
should you be worried
and what is causing this spike in
infections is another wave of the deadly
virus on the horizon
our next report getting you the big
picture
India is yet again witnessing a surge in
the number of covid-19 cases
the country has logged in 2151 new cases
while the number of present Active cases
increased to almost 12 000. with a rise
in number of infections these parts of
the country are in Focus the state of
Maharashtra has 450 new cases Delhi
reported 214 fresh cases the southern
state of Kerala has 215 covid-19 cases
while Karnataka and Tamil Nadu hold
similar numbers of 135 and 105 newly
detected covid-19 cases
the fresh number of cases has stretched
the total tally to over four and a half
million cases since the first outbreak
the good news is that the National
Recovery rate has been recorded at over
98 the high recovery rate may come as a
ray of hope that the country might just
break free from the curvickers
what has triggered this rise in
infections
epidemiologists are saying that the new
variant xbb 0.1.16 could be the reason
we earlier spoke to a health expert who
said that countries are witnessing new
variants as the virus mutates over time
xbb 0.1.16 being the newest strain in
the ring the variants come from the
Omicron Family which has a higher
infectivity rate but a lower virulence
which means that it has lesser
capability to severely harm the host
according to the health expert India is
witnessing a seasonal version of the
Wuhan virus in fact the Indian
government has been busy undertaking
efforts on various fronts
the country is said to undertake drills
at Health Facilities which would ensure
the operational Readiness of hospitals
but Health officials are aiming to take
stock of the availability of medicines
hospital beds medical equipment and most
importantly the supply of adequate
medical oxygen
similar exercises were seen in countries
like China Japan Brazil and South Korea
when they were fighting the surge in
cases
Health experts say that most Indians
have antibodies to fight the infection
and even if there is a rise in number of
cases the total number of cases will
remain low the covid-19 virus might stay
with us for the Long Haul which could
cause mild fever and the cold so even as
the number of cases slowly rises in the
country doctors say a serious wave of
infections is not probable in the near
future
given that people take precautions and
get vaccinated at the right time
and last night was an eventful one
thanks to a Celestial treat
five planets came together to deliver a
stellar performance
it was quite a show and if you manage to
be a spectator you know what I'm talking
about
it was a memorable night for stargazers
as five planets Mercury Jupiter Venus
Mars and Uranus were aligned near the
Moon
looks spectacular does it not
Among The Spectators was Indian
Superstar Amitabh Bachchan who shared a
video of the celestial show
this Cosmic spectacle is often called a
planetary parade
clear skies were of course a must to be
able to witness it it was difficult to
view this spectacle unless you were in a
location with an unobstructed view of
the horizon
Jupiter appeared brighter than Mercury
Venus was the brightest planet of the
group and was visible through the naked
eye
it was brighter to the upper left of
Jupiter and Mercury
Uranus was the most difficult to find
without visual assistance
it appeared near Venus but very faintly
Mars appeared very high in the sky
while the planets appear to be coming
together in the sky it does not mean
that they are actually closer to each
other
this sort of alignment happens when the
orbits of the planets align them on one
side of the Sun from Earth's perspective
looking like a String of Pearls
such alignment happens from time to time
with different combinations of planets
and different number of planets
this latest planetary show happened just
days after Jupiter and Venus came
together in the evening sky
and there was a five planet alignment
last summer Mercury Venus Mars Jupiter
and Saturn participated in that

there are signs of stabilization and the
root issue is lack of trust and

interest rates are the only way they can
secure a loan
but with inflation at elevated levels
and cost of living still on the rise
households are likely to put off their
dream purchases
when demand and high consumer interest
sectors like real estate and Automobiles
go down the prices of Commodities go
down demand for employees and industries
goes down and so do growth projections
of major economies that makes recession
almost a certainty while banks have been
warning the fed and other central banks
that their monetary policies could lead
to a recession the fall of the biggest
banks globally poses a bigger issue
a credit crunch that could deny an
entire generation the ability to own a

Rishi sunak has defended his
government's plans to detain children
arriving in the United Kingdom in small
boats further claiming that excluding
them from the legislation would
incentivize criminal gangs to bring them
to the UK the illegal migration bill is
currently being debated in the Commons
and includes measures to detain and
swiftly remove migrants and Asylum
Seekers who enter the country illegally
by the dangerous Channel Crossings
the intention of this part of the policy
you know the policy objective here is is
not to detain children but it is
important that we don't inadvertently
create a policy that incentivizes people
to bring children who wouldn't otherwise
come here and that's why it's important
that it applies equally to families
because otherwise you increase the
likelihood that people bring children
here they make very dangerous Crossings
I don't think anyone would want to see
that that's not good for children
um so the policy should and most applied
families
now the UK prime minister said that the
children would not be separated from
their families when detained rather they
would be housed together in an
appropriate facility the members of the
committee which question the Prime
Minister about the various policies

WhatsApp has rolled out a new feature to

developments and we bring you the most
interesting ones in a Tech Lab
[Music]
if you are a Twitter user we say be
careful because scammers are duping
users on the social media platform
let's understand how cyber criminals are
misusing Twitter and its new features
businesses have well-maintained Twitter
pages to not just Market their products
but also to address customer issues
annoyed customers often turn to Twitter
to share their grievances this is where
scammers come into play to trick
customers
it's been discovered that if a customer
posts a complaint with a bank and tags
it in a tweet scammers try to exploit
this opportunity they impersonate the
bank's Twitter account and reach out to
customers as Bank Representatives they
share a number with the customer and ask
them to make a call to share their
complaint if the customer commits the
mistake of calling on that number
scammers try to collect all the login
credentials and essential information
required to access the user account
what's even worse these bogus accounts
come with a blue tick as we understand
today anyone can get their Twitter
account verified by spending a few
dollars so hackers are misusing this
feature to mislead people
Twitter's Blue Tick service which was
earlier reserved for active notable and
authentic accounts of public interest
has now opened doors to criminals and
it's not just about one social media
platform other social platforms are also
full of scammers and hackers therefore
we advise you to address such sensitive
issues directly with the bank
China has its own way to deal with
issues the country is concerned about
the falling marriage rate why because
the falling marriage rate has led to a
sharp drop in the birth rate in China
and China's shrinking population has
become a growing concern in a rapidly
aging Chinese Society so the country
keeps coming up with new policies to
encourage people to marry and have
children and now the country is pinning
its Hope on matchmaking apps
China has now come up with a
state-sponsored matchmaking app the
mobile app has been introduced in a city
in Junction which is a province in
Eastern China the app uses data on
single residents to build a matchmaking
platform it even organizes blind dates
for single men and women the app is part
of a province-wide initiative to boost
the marriage rate
which has been falling Nationwide for
the past decade in 2021 China had a rate
of 5.4 marriages per 1000 people the
figures highlight a worrying Trend this
is not the first time a Chinese city has
come up with a novel way to improve the
declining marriage rate some Chinese
cities have introduced various
incentives to address the issue such as
extra vacation for newlyweds and better
maternity leave and protection for
working mothers

failure
a strategic failure one which led to the
collapse of the Afghan government and it
happened within days of a hasty U.S exit
in 2021.
but now a U.S report examining the
reasons for the collapse has mentioned
India's name
it suggests that India funded Afghan
Warlords instead of the Afghan
government in the lead-up to the
taliban's Takeover of Afghanistan
what exactly is U.S employee is the West
once again shrugging off the blame for
its own failures I'm Shivan jarna
welcome to game plan let's get to the
point
[Music]
the U.S report titled why the Afghan
Security Forces collapsed by special
Inspector General for Afghanistan
reconstruction focuses on the Fateful
days when the Taliban took control of
the beleaguered country in the backdrop
of a weak resistance by Afghan
government forces
foreign
the U.S report quoted former Afghan Army
generalizai as saying Atta Muhammad Noor
and Abdul Rasheed went to India and got
money to create a resistance in the
north that money should have been
directed to the central government of
Afghanistan to be distributed lawfully
Atta Muhammad noon former governor of
bulk Province and Abdul Rashid dostu
former Afghan vice president visited
India in October of 2020 as
representatives of the Afghan government
to request India for help
mind you in 2020 U.S was still on Afghan
soil
yet Afghanistan's top diplomats were
visiting India requesting for help in
facilitating peace talks between the
Taliban and Kabul
it was clear they had no hopes from the
U.S to offer any help to the Afghan
people
on 11 August 2021 during the taliban's
Nationwide offensive in Afghanistan
along with Adam Muhammad Noor led the
government's defense but eventually fled
to Uzbekistan
claimed that they were forced to flee
due to a conspiracy
an investigative report revealed that it
was Qatar the same Nation where the Doha
agreement was signed between the U.S and
Taliban that had paid then Afghan
president ashrafgani 110 million dollars
Marshall dostum was paid 51 million
dollars and Adam Muhammad Noor received
61 million dollars to not fight Taliban
fighters as they took over Afghanistan
and yes all three fled Afghanistan while
the conspiracy may or may not be
believed but the Qatari foreign minister
ironically during a press conference
urged the Taliban to combat terrorism we
encourage other countries
to keep the engagement with Taliban
[Music]
no weapons are being left behind
throughout the drawdown a few hundred
small arms and ammunition were
transferred to the andsf no weapons left
behind
well according to the U.S Department of
Defense U.S left behind at least 78
aircraft
9524 air to ground Munitions over 40 000
Vehicles more than 300 000 weapons and
nearly all night vision
equipment worth 7.2 billion US Dollars
was left behind by the withdrawing U.S
forces from Afghanistan
and no points for guessing who found
those weapons it was definitely not the
Afghan forces
who these weapons were left behind for
is anyone's guess did Qatar buy out the
leaders who could have resisted the
Taliban from taking over Afghanistan
well reports certainly suggest so when
U.S hints India's name as a reason for
Afghanistan's collapse do you feel it is
Justified

tonight we get you unbiased and
comprehensive coverage of this big story
we also tell you whether countries
around the world also have similar
grounds that allow a sitting member of
the parliament to be disqualified
overnight
also the show for you North Korea says
it has tested an underwater drone that
can unleash a radioactive tsunami is it
the world's most dangerous nuclear
weapon will the weapon lead to a nuclear
tsunami how much contamination are we
looking at we get you the full report

how come the world's happiest countries

we discuss
thank you
let me now ask you a question have you
heard of the term tsunami bomb
well it's a concept that dates back to
World War II
it was coined by the U.S and New Zealand
they tried developing a tectonic weapon
that could create destructive tsunamis
the concept was deemed feasible but it
never saw the light of day
because such a bomb could never be
invented
but what if I tell you it finally has
been
that there is now a weapon somewhere
that can trigger a nuclear tsunami
have a look at these images they are
from an unidentified location in North
Korea they show the country's leader Kim
Jong-un sitting and smiling at his new
weapon
what exactly is this thing all about
well fyonyang says it is an underwater
attack drone that can generate a
radioactive tsunami
another set of visuals showing a drill
where the Drone cruises underwater at a
depth of about 80 to 150 meters
North Korea says it remained there for
59 hours and detonated off its East
Coast
and they are calling this weapon
h-a-e-i-l in Korean it translates to
tsunami this weapon is intended to make
sneak attacks in enemy Waters
in fact it can destroy Naval Striker
groups and major operational ports how
exactly by making a super scale
radioactive wave through an explosion
this is where this weapon was tested in
the waters of South hamyong province
just a few hundred miles away from the
coast of Japan
the entire exercise was supervised by
Kim Jong-un himself who said that it
should serve as a warning for the U.S
and South Korea to realize his country's
unlimited nuclear war detergents
the question is who is North Korea going
to use this weapon against
is it South Korea Japan Taiwan
also just how much contamination will
this weapon cause
after all we are talking about an
underground nuclear explosion one that
could turn the waters around North Korea
highly nauseous
and these are questions that have no
definite answer thanks to the state of
secrecy that prevails in Pyongyang
but what we can tell you is that this
weapon is the first of its kind
it seems to be emulating Russia's
Poseidon Torpedoes these are nuclear
bombs that are so powerful that they can
cause radioactive ocean swells and a
huge nuclear tsunami
in five just this month a Russian
general threatened to use this bomb to
sink the UK If the NATO sets foot in
Ukraine he said Moscow has the ability
to destroy Britain with a 1 000 foot
high radioactive wave
and now North Korea also has such a
weapon Reports say it had been in
development since 2012 and had undergone
50 tests in the last two years but this
week's test verified its reliability and
its safety along with confirming its
lethal strike capability
and interestingly this development comes
right after another big test
just last Thursday pioneon test fired
intercontinental ballistic missiles this
happened just hours before the leaders
of South Korea and Japan met
a week on it is testifying an underwater
nuclear drone and this has sent alarm
bells ringing in the region
have a look at these images
immediately after this test the
militaries of the US and South South
Korea held air bombing drills this was
in response to pyongyang's actions they
say these drills are on are necessary
that these drills are necessary
and analysts agree a number of them are
concerned by not uh the development of
this underwater drone they say the fact
that North Korea has unveiled it after
11 years means that the weapon system is
pretty solid listening to a few voices
it's conventional but it is very hard to
detect also it is highly likely not to
make big noises North Korea had planned
this 11 years ago and conducted secret
tests about 50 times over two years and
then they finally unveiled in the
presence of supreme leader Kim Jong-un I
would say the weapon system should be
pretty solid
when you watch the video of the cruise
missiles flying unveiled by North Korea
you can see the missiles having perfect
terrain avoidance capability in the
video the missile was flying up the
mountain as if it was brushing it which
shows the north is very confident in its
cruise missile technology
so the broad consensus is that this
weapon may not be ready for deployment
yet but it could still prove to be
lethal in the long run
the question is what is the world going
to do about this
or should I ask can the world do
anything about it
you see for the last one year North
Korea has been on a weapon testing spree
it has test-fired weapons of all kinds
and forms the U.S has conducted drills
Japan has issued warnings
South Korea has stepped up its security
yet all of this have failed to deter Kim
Jong-un
he clearly seems to be a man on a
mission
and what could that mission possibly be
is he preparing for a war
well only time will tell
just yesterday I told you about China's
Crackdown on billionaires about the
ccp's campaign against the country's
Super Rich to present a clean image of
itself
the story continues
and football is Apparently one of XI
jinping's favorite sports
and even then it could not survive his
Crackdown
football pitchers had just started to
open up after the strict lockdowns and
now the fourth stands threatened by a
corruption scandal
it started in November 2022
Lee Tai one of China's most famous
football figures disappeared
Lee had coached the Men's National Team
the Chinese authorities said he was
being investigated and why is that
four suspected serious violations of the
law
it then started a domino effect Sports
administrators and professional players
were placed under investigation one
after another
this includes Chen Shu Yuan the
president of the Chinese Football
Association or CFA
cfa's former Secretary General
Shen Yong Liang
cfa's executive deputy secretary General
and the Chinese International player Jin
Jing Dao among others
now two more officials are facing
similar investigations Huang song the
head of the cfa's competition Department
and we are van Wang Xiao pink Wang
Xiaoping the chief of its disciplinary
committee
meanwhile six high-ranking members of
China's biggest football training school
have also been slapped with live bands
over match fixing
it's almost like history is repeating
itself
you see in 2013 33 Chinese football
players and officials were banned for
life again for match fixing
this is not what China expected
the country had big Ambitions for its
football industry
in 2016 the CFA unveiled a plan to build
70 000 football pitches it aspired to
get 50 million people playing the game
both Milestones were to be achieved by
2020.
also wanted China to host the World Cup
but all those dreams went down the dream
by 2021 just shy of 27 000 pictures were
built and this was less than even half
of the official Target
the interest around football is now
waning in China and why is that
because of China's poor performance in
the sport
The Men's National Team languishes at
80th Place in the global rankings
it has not qualified for the World Cup
for over two decades now
and the last time this happened was in
2002
or is it because of its heavy
commercialization
you'll see the game is considered super
rich as compared to other sports
and as we have been telling you China
has a problem with the super rich
CAF officials have been booked for
corruption and this is the most sweeping
Crackdown on football since Xi Jinping
came to power
have a look at these figures according
to FIFA Chinese clubs spent 1.7 billion
dollars on International transfers
between 2011 and 2020.
the spending in fact peaked in 2016 the
Chinese Super League spent 450 million
dollars on incoming transfers
the Chinese authorities were concerned
why were clubs spending all this money
on foreigners
they came up with a solution in 2017 a
hundred percent transfer tax was
introduced on foreign players bought for
over 6.5 million dollars and this money
was meant to go on uh towards Grassroots
development but experts say it has gone
missing and some worry that the money
has disappeared into the pockets of the
corrupt officials
and this is what has motivated the
Crackdown on the football Administration
but is that really all
are the detentions politically motivated
well the details are scarce the alleged
offenses against the CFA administrators
have not been officially revealed but it
is certain that the top brass of the
game does not enjoy the same political
support that they once did
and our next story comes from the United
States where a former president is
trying to be as theatrical as possible
in order to get the attention of the
people
I am talking about Donald Trump he has
made his way back into the news our next
report getting you the complete story
take a look at these images pictures
claiming to show Trump getting tackled
by the riot gear clad New York City
Police the images show him getting
dragged on the streets while a bunch of
officers and Men handle him but are
these Sensational images real although
the pictures are highly realistic and
well detailed they are not real this is
what happens when artificial
intelligence is at play the images were
littered across Twitter
and especially on Trump's social media
platform truth social why is Trump
allowing such misinformation to spread
on the internet
well it seems like the man has a plan
critics can see through his action and
saying that the Real Estate Mogul turned
politician is trying to portray himself
as a martyr
such false news on the internet can get
him considerable sympathy from the
Republicans and potentially boost his
electoral chances in the next
presidential election so how else is
Trump trying to play the sympathy card
the former president has urged that he
wants to remain in handcuffs when he is
presented in court for the Stormy
Daniels case
a court trial which is being followed
closely by the media but why would he
try to sensationalize the court trial
Reports say that Trump is trying to turn
the court appearance into a spectacle
and is aiming for drama it seems that
the Republican wants to show his
supporters that he is defiant as he
believes that he is being unfairly
treated and what does his legal team
have to say about this his advisers have
said that the Republican should not go
in person in front of the grand jury
the former president was advised to turn
himself in quietly and schedule a remote
appearance but did Trump pay heed to
this advice no he said he does not care
if he gets shot
Trump clearly has his priorities
straight but could this end badly for
him his advisors believe so the
officials are concerned about the
gravity of the hush money case and the
criminal charges that Trump might face
and what is the Republican doing amid
these concerns he has held meetings on
how he can appear even more defiant in
front of the prosecution rather than
pondering on the risk of being proven
guilty but there is also worry on the
other side law enforcement officials are
bracing for major unrest if Trump is
proven guilty and faces charges so
Trump's advisors and the law enforcement
are tense about what might unfold but
Trump seems to be floating on a cloud
while he makes gaining sympathy the name
of the game
our next story comes from India where a
multinational conglomerate is pushing
its app to challenge the big players in
the world
we are focusing on India's data Group
which is planning a massive 2 billion
dollar investment into its super app
Tata new
let's get to the details the group's
digital division Tata digital says that
the fresh 2 billion dollar Capital could
help Tata new strengthen its digital
offerings fixed technical glitches and

so what exactly is this so-called super
app all about
Tata new provides users with groceries
and lets the customers buy a variety of
gadgets and it does not stop there the
app also lets people Reserve airplane
tickets and restaurant tables
Tata new also comes with membership
services and offers on financial
products like bill payments loans and
insurance
Tartan you entered the league of super
apps when it was released last year
although it is still reviewing its
strategy the super app is in
head-to-head competition
with Rivals like Amazon and Flipkart
and what might come as a surprise is
that the super app was modeled on the
Chinese applications
alipay and WeChat
this approach did not go well for the
company after Tata new ran into glitches
and tons of customer complaints came
rushing in
apart from the apps array of services
Tata new has a unique in-house digital
magazine called stories
the magazine showcases lifestyle focused
articles and videos
the digital magazine puts focus on
themes of Technology fashion food travel
although the app has faced its share of
hard times the company is planning to
receive additional funding over the next
two years
the conglomerate has also been expanding
its e-commerce portfolio
Tata acquired companies like Indian
e-growser big basket and e-pharmacy 1mg
after investing more than two billion
dollars in the past three years
although the Tata group is thriving in
the e-commerce Market it is facing
competition from Brands like Reliance
Industries Amazon Walmart owned Flipkart
and myntra
the players are engaged in a pricing war
in a bid to capture the maximum market
share
and this might be one of the major
reasons the Tata group is pushing for
more investments in its super app
but the Tata new app is just the tip of
the iceberg
the Tata group has not stopped advancing
not on one but multiple not in one but
multiple fields
Tata Motors which is India's biggest
retailer of electric vehicles will Now
launch special exclusive showrooms just
for EVS
this is only one of the many Feats that
Tata has achieved
data is also working towards a Greener
tomorrow the conglomerate has set a goal
to achieve net zero emissions by 2045.
it is promoting zero carbon emission
travel by giving its customers a range
of choices in electric vehicles
although Tata is progressing its way to
the top of the ladder the Tata new app
is still in its struggling phase the
super app is projected to report sales
of up to 4 billion dollars but this is
nearly half as compared to the 8 billion
dollar Target
the multinational conglomerate now
stands among the world's largest
companies spanning from the eve standing
from the EV Market to e-commerce
platforms
and one can only imagine what it will
conquer next
and our next story is about Jack Dorsey
the former Twitter boss
a report by Hindenburg has hit a company
he owns like a thunderbolt
the name of this company is block
the report accuses block of widely
overstating its user base
and indulging in fraudulent practices
and this report has made block stocks
stumble by 15 percent
while Dorsey has lost 523 million
dollars from his fortune
our next report telling you more
it was something no one expected a
company owned by Jack Dorsey widely
overstating its user base
this stinging Revelation is part of a
new publication by Hindenburg
the American short seller whose last
report caused the adani group to lose
over 12 lakh crores it has launched yet
another Salvo this time at Jack Dorsey
the former Twitter boss in 2009 he
founded a company called Square which in
2021 was renamed to block this company
owns the mobile app cash app and has
been growing at a Breakneck speed
in 2021 it surpassed 100 billion dollars
in market value hindenburg's report has
inflicted heavy damage to its reputation
let's break down the allegations for you
1. the company knew many of its accounts
were fraudulent but failed to account
for this in its Financial disclosure
2. Dorsey profiteered by dumping stocks
worth billions of dollars from this
company during the pandemic
3. Dorsey used this company to build an
Empire and amassed over 5 billion in
personal Fortune 4. Dorsey himself has
multiple accounts including some that
are apparently aimed at scamming cash
app users
these allegations are striking their
impact even more so immediately after
this report Block's stock dropped by
nearly 15 percent of the New York Stock
Exchange
Dorsey lost
526 million dollars from his personal
Fortune this is the worst single day
decline since May 2022 he's now worth
4.4 billion dollars only
next question how is he dealing with
these allegations well block has
threatened to take legal action against
the group
it says hindenburg's report is factually
inaccurate and misleading
the response has done little to calm
investors
last we checked blocks shares tumbled
another two percent immediately after
the company's response all said and done
this entire episode highlights the
growing clout of Hindenburg with just
nine employees this firm is taking on
the who's who of the business and Tech
world first it was Gautam adani now it's
Jack Dorsey we wonder who's next
foreign
a few days ago we got to the story of
the world's happiest countries
we told you how Finland has been crowned
the world's happiest nation and this has
happened for the sixth year in a row
but are these so-called happiest
countries truly happy
what then explains the fact that the
happiest countries also see the highest
consumption of antidepressants
let me break it all down for you first
things first how do we know which are
the world's happiest countries you
wonder
well the UN publishes the happiness
report every year it ranks the countries
on their happiness based on six factors
this includes social support
income health Freedom generosity and
absence of corruption
and Finland came out on top
now it may not be the biggest or the
most powerful nation in the world but it
has plenty to offer that other countries
do not
you see the country has a
well-functioning democracy and low
levels of corruption
and by the way Finland is not the only
happy Nordic country
Denmark came in at number two followed
by Iceland at number three Israel bombs
Switzerland out of the number four Sport
and the Netherlands once again came in
at number five
but you know what's really interesting
the happiest countries are also some of
the biggest consumers of antidepressants
according to the organization for
economic cooperation and development
between 2000 and 2020 the consumption of
antidepressants increased nearly two and
a half times across Europe
Iceland was at the top spot
Sweden and Norway were next Finland and
Denmark were among the top ten
Iceland by the way was the second
happiest country in the world in 2020
and it has the highest antidepressant
consumption in Europe
which brings me to my bigger Point here
are the parameters to gauge how happy
your country is good enough
are the sufficient
then what explains the fact that the
happiest countries also consume the most
antidepressants
isn't this at the end of the day all
about safeguarding Mental Health
is that the secret sauce to happiness
because clearly the data does not
indicate that the happier people are the
less they consume antidepressants
in fact The Finnish people themselves
have talked about how the measures to
judge how happy a country really is do
not account for aspects like loneliness
and after all is it happiness subjective
is it really fair to gauge it on the
basis of such broad parameters which
might not take into account the ground
reality
you see happiness means different things
to different people and the covid-19
pandemic has taught us about the
importance of safeguarding our mental
well-being
and the growing need to raise awareness
about mental health related issues

faced hours of Relentless questioning
from combative U.S lawmakers on both
sides of the political aisle lawmakers
quiz issue over tick tock's alleged ties
to China and its possible danger to
teens Republicans and Democrats they
fear Beijing could subvert the site for
spying data harvesting and advancing a
Chinese Communist Party agenda Tick Tock
is facing an existential threat the app
is seeking to survive a White House
ultimatum that it either splits from its
Chinese ownership or be banned in the
United States lawmakers from the house
Energy and Commerce Committee had a
series of questions
so who is Harvard educated former Banker
was frequently denied opportunities to
expand on his answers or tat decides
huge Global popularity with the youth
referring to tick tock's china-based
parent company the 40 year old said that
by dance is not owned or controlled by
the Chinese government and is a private
firm
in one particularly heated exchange shoe
was forced to acknowledge that some
personal data of Americans was still
subject to Chinese law but he insisted
that that would soon change the U.S
representatives also confronted shoe
with dire examples of young users
promoting suicide or dangerous stunts
all um U.S user data is stored by
default in the Oracle Cloud
infrastructure and access to that
there's control any American companies
employees in China including Engineers
currently have access to U.S data uh
Congressman I would appreciate this is a
complex uh topic today all data yeah
it's not that complex yes or no do they
have access to user data we have after
project Texas is the aren't done the
answer is no today there's still
something
now ban would be a non-precedented act
on a media company by the US government
it would cut off the country's 150
million monthly users from an app that
has become cultural Powerhouse
especially for young people a group of
conservative internet celebrities
influencers and activists held a ban
Tick-Tock event outside the U.S Capitol
however supporters of tick tock and Free
Speech activists criticize the hearing
as political theater and urged against
an outright ban
okay our first amendment
guys the next phase of teen despair of
children's despair is here and it's
delivered by a Chinese algorithm we have
to ban it today I think gen Z would sort
of in their way Riot around this I don't
find people going back to other
platforms like Instagram or Twitter I
think but
like Tick Tock would find a way to stay
or some Corporation another would try
and buy them
Now The Tick Tock CEO responded to many
point
to complex he did not announce any new
efforts to safeguard privacy falling
back on explanations of ongoing efforts
which are fair to peace critics
so if I have a tick tock app on my phone
and my phone is on my home Wi-Fi network
does tick tock access that Network
it will have to to access the network to
get connections to the internet if
that's the question is it possible then
that it could access other devices on
that home Wi-Fi network
Congressman we do not do anything that
is beyond any industry Norms I believe
the answer to your customers no it could
be technical let me get back to you
now ahead of the hearing the Commerce
Ministry in Beijing said that it would
firmly oppose a false sail Beijing
underlined that any deal or any spin-off
of tick tock would require approval by
the Chinese authorities
last month Canada banned Tick-Tock on
government devices the UK Parliament has
banned Chinese own social media optic
talk from its network over security
concerns and it follows a decision by
the UK government to ban ministers from
using the app on their work phones
recently the European Union's two
biggest policy-making institutions
banned Tick Tock from staff forms for
cyber security reasons remember India
said the precedent by Banning Tick Tock
in 2020 during the questioning of tick
tock CEO U.S lawmaker Debbie let's go
cited a recent Forbes article the
article claimed that Tick Tock still has
access to years of Indian's data The
Tick Tock CEO said his team is looking
into the article and cited rigorous data
access protocols
now for more on this our corresponds
Susan therania sent us this report
listen in
the body Administration recently told
Tick Tock that it wants the apps Chinese
owners to sell their steak or face a ban
here in the United States however that
plan faced a roadblock on a Thursday
when the Chinese government said that it
would oppose a sale the White House
could ban the app here in the United
States possibly by cutting access from
Apple and Google the administration
could also allow the app to continue
operating however the app would store
its data of U.S users on Oracle servers
here in the United States an option that
has already been met with skepticism
while some notably influencers on many
social media platforms have called the
Banning of tick-tock government

proar there are these controversial
reforms or rather they've been called as
judicial reforms by the Netanyahu
government but what is being attempted
is to try and make the Israeli Judiciary
subservient to its executive at a time
like this the Israeli Parliament is
quietly passed the first of its many
laws the new legislation will protect
the Prime Minister from being deemed as
unfit to rule because of his corruption
trial which is presently also underway
the law passed in an early morning vote
with a majority of 61 against 49 this is
exactly what the critics have been
accusing him of that this is a Judicial
change that is tailor-made for Benjamin
Netanyahu to escape the judicial Rhythm
and this encourages corruption and it
also makes the judicial system a bit of
a showpiece
people have remained defined they've
stayed another day of demonstrations and
have raised an alarm over what they see
is the country's descent into autocracy
there are thousands of people in fact
took to the streets they blocked traffic
on the main highways and they also got
into scaffolds with the police
that they also to be at least about half
a million people who are presently out
on the streets for a country that is
home to only about nine million people
this is well more than five percent of
the country's entire population
Jerusalem students call for a day of
shutdown protests they chanted slogans
and they also banged drums nearly about
2 000 protesters blocked the roadway
near the Israeli president's residence
now the legal changes have in fact split
the nation right down the middle
now there are two squads that have been
formed one that sees the new policies as
stripping Israel of its democratic
ideals by the second those who think
that the country is in fact been overrun
by a very liberal judiciary
the plan is planted nearly 75 year old
nation into one of its worst domestic
crises ever
there's a proposal that's been made by
the Israeli government in fact seeks to
curb the judiciary's influence or public
policy it seeks to limit the Supreme
Court's powers to exercise the judicial
review and Grant government control over
judicial appointments by limiting the
authority of legal advisors in and not
chill if this reform were to be adopted
what it would do is it would Grant the
knesset the power to override the
Israeli Supreme Court's decisions
has been tracking the story very closely
for us and it sent us this report
listening
so Thursday was built as a day of
paralysis across Israel and we've
certainly seen some roadblocking here
some in coordination with the police
where it was done not in coordination
with the police we have seen some use of
water cannons here in Tel Aviv and also
for the first time in Haifa the minister
and former head of the Shin Bet
avidiktor was reportedly hit on the
heads by one protester who has been
arrested we've seen protests at the
homes of Coalition ministers the
protests are taking place at the airport
for the third week in the row as prime
minister Netanyahu is set to travel to
the UK for meetings with the Prime
Minister there we're also expected to
see Marchers go to benebra now that's a
sensitive area that's a largely
ultra-orthodox Community there's a lot
of support there for the judicial reform
plans because the communities there feel
that the Supreme Court has been
anti-religious for a number of years the
government has urged the rabbis and the
community leaders to speak to their
congregants and ask them not to confront
the protesters in the meantime
opposition MP's Chilli tropper has been
trying to get an agreement ahead of the
Memorial Day for the Fall Fallen
Soldiers of Israel that's coming up to
ask for a day free of protests there
then he gets the former Defense Minister
has agreed near barcats the trade
Minister from the liquid party has
agreed head of the opposition hasn't yet
signed on this is Jody Curran for we on
world is one

on the show tonight
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
thank you
[Music]
our cover story tonight is about the
Dalai Lama successor
it is a story of succession that the
Chinese president Xi Jinping holds very
close to his heart
has the Dalai Lama chosen his successor
we tell you tonight about a delegation
of Mongolian monks a ceremony in
dharamshala and the seven-year-old boy
will he be the next Dalai Lama has the
Dalai Lama chosen his successor
we discuss what we know so far and look
at why the answers to these questions
matter so much to Beijing
why is China so worked up about the
latest developments
this and more coming up on our cover
story tonight
also the show for you another
development has left China worried
China's billionaire population has come
down we tell you what lies behind this
latest setback for the country
Israel's new law aims to save beneman
Netanyahu while in a way destroying the
country people say the clock is ticking
to save the country's democracy we tell
you what's happening
immigration has been fueling Canada's
population growth we get to the latest
numbers and look at the bigger picture
are you an employee influencer what are
they and are you a part of a growing
debate over whether this is the next
challenge after Moonlighting we discuss
[Music]
ion his successor
this question is buzzing in the city of
dharamshala the virtual capital of The
Dalai Lama and tibet's government in
Exile
it is the official residence of The
Dalai Lama the supreme leader of Tibetan
Buddhism who dominates the City Escape
he has been living in Exile here since
1960.
and all of a sudden this peaceful Heaven
is a stir as observers ponder over
whether one of the great decisions in
the history of Tibetan Buddhism has been
made
named his successor
have a look at this report it was
carried by the times UK
it says on the 8th of March a delegation
of 600 Mongolian monks attended a
ceremony in dharamshala
and present among them was a
seven-year-old boy
in fact in one image from the ceremony
he is being felicitated by the Dalai
Lama
in another image the Dalai Lama is seen
assisting him in playing the Tibetan
singing bowl
and these images have led to speculation
speculation over who this boy really is
now here's what we know so far
the boy's formal title is the 10th kalka
jetsun Danbury
in the hierarchy of Tibetan Buddhism he
is supposed to be the third most senior
llama and the head of the Buddhist faith
in Mongolia
he was reportedly born in 2015 in the
United States and possesses dual
nationality
he is one of a pair of twin boys
named agudai and ashutai
there is no Clarity on which one came to
dharamshala
the boy's father is a mathematics
professor at the National University of
Mongolia
his mother is a businesswoman
his grandmother is a former member of
mongolia's Parliament
this family is apparently a
long-standing patron of one of
mongolia's biggest monasteries
in 2016 when the Dalai Lama visited
Mongolia
he had made a crucial announcement
addressing our gathering he had said
that the Jetson Tampa have been
reincarnated and that the search was on
to find him
turns out this is the boy he was talking
about
the question is could he be the next
Dalai Lama could he be the next
spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism
well here's what we can tell you
back in Mongolia this ceremony has
provoked a lot of excitement Mongolians
are celebrating the anointment of one of
their own as the third senior most Lama
they say this sets the stage for the boy
to succeed the Dalai Lama
but last we checked that is not how
Tibetan Buddhism works
Tibetan Buddhists from the geluk
tradition believe that the Dalai Lama
can reincarnate that he has control over
his rebirth and can even choose the body
in which he will be reincarnated
so the anointment of this boy could just
be a kind of rehearsal for The
Reincarnation of The Dalai Lama
it does not have to mean that he is the
next successor
also there has been a growing demand
that the Dalai Lama named his successor
to preempt the chinese-controlled monks
to name one after the Dalai Lama's death
creating
the history and functioning of Tibetan
Buddhism offering a more complex picture
as well
I'll start from
1933. that's when the previous Dalai
Lama died
but instead of exiting the circle of
life and depth he is said to have been
Reborn
reborn into a new body
as
tencento the 14th Dalai Lama
he came from a family of peasants
was born a year after the 13th died and
was ordained at the age of three
that is four years after the 13th Dalai
Lama passed away
eight decades since this coronation the
Dalai Lama's age is advancing he will
turn 88 in July this year
he is still in good health yes but the
question of who will succeed him has
become one which is more pressing than
ever
so how will this succession happen
really
well a key person responsible for
finding the child who will be the Dalai
Lama is known as the pension llama the
second most important figure in Tibetan
Buddhism
and interestingly it is the Dalai Lama
who appoints the panchan Lama
the current Dalai Lama chose this
six-year-old boy gerdoon Nema as the
panchan Llama this was in May 1995 and
this is where things turn murky because
this boy has not been seen for the last
26 years
what happened to him
well he was kidnapped by the Chinese
regime that's right
China kidnapped a six-year-old
it rejected his appointment took the boy
into custody and appointed its own punch
and Lama through a lottery
just look at how bizarre this is
China counterfeated a religious figure
and they want to do the same with the
next Dalai Lama
they want to appoint a candidate
who noticed to Beijing and the Communist
Party
the present Dalai Lama says he will not
let that happen
the final Authority
is myself
no one else
and obviously not Chinese Communists the
final Authority
is myself
no one else
and obviously not Chinese communist
so who is it going to be
well the Dalai Lama has floated a number
of options a number of scenarios for his
reincarnation
number one
picking a new successor in India where
he has lived all his life he has often
stated it himself that he should be
reincarnated in India
the second option is the idea of a woman
taking over the role
the Dalai Lama once said that if the
circumstances require a female Dalai
Lama a female Dalai Lama it will be
but he also said that she should be
attractive a statement that he later
apologized for calling it a joke Lost in
Translation
and the third and final scenario is that
he will not reincarnate at all he
believes the tradition should cease
because there is no guarantee that and
I'm quoting
some stupid Dalai Lama will not come
next who will disgrace himself or
herself
those were the exact words spoken
now whatever happens
the broad consensus is that China should
have no role to play in the Dalai Lama's
reincarnation succession
and this has become an international
political issue now the U.S Congress has
even passed an act
the Tibetan policy and support act which
reaffirms the right of Tibetans to
choose the next Dalai Lama
but at the same time the question is why
should China respect an American law
but does China respect any law
does China respect the president Dalai
Lama the answer is no
in fact it spokesperson's routinely then
agreed the present Dalai Lama
for them Tibet and its Buddhism is a
political game not a holy religion
the Communists after all are atheists
who dismiss religion as the Opium of the
people
China conquered Tibet through force and
for seven decades has suppressed the
Tibetan people and their religion
China wants a puppet
not a spiritual leader of Tibetan
Buddhists
on the other hand there is India
India has protected Tibetan Buddhists it
has offered a sanctuary where Tibetan
culture has thrived
a country the Dalai Lama calls home
so has the Dalai Lama brought the
Mongolian child to India to pave the way
for a different kind of succession
that is what the buzz is all about
in India this child will be safe
and ready for the moment when it comes
it is both a religious conundrum and a
geopolitical battle
the question is who will ultimately win
this battle
well if only there was a prophecy that
could tell us the outcome
and speaking of prophecies here's one
that no one could have ever made
the Islamic world's abandonment of
Pakistan
you heard that right
after Saudi Arabia's refusal to bail out
Pakistan another Islamic country has
snubbed Islam about
I am talking about Kuwait
another dear friend of Pakistan
well guess what
this dear friend is pushing Pakistan to
pay its dues insisting on immediate
payment of diesel purchase
let me break this down for you since
2000 Pakistan and Kuwait signed a
contract a contract for credit line
facility for the supply of diesel to
Pakistan
and under this contract Pakistan has
imported Diesel worth millions in the
last 20 years
most of these payments were made in
installments from time to time
and Kuwait wants to change that
it wants Islamabad to make the payment
right at the time of purchase
also clear its previous dues as soon as
possible
and how much are the deals really
well last we checked
payment of an amount of 55 million
dollars is due for an import made on the
10th of February
and another 10 million is due for an
import made on the 20th of February
and yet another 55 million dollars due
for an import made on the 15th of March
now Kuwait wants this money immediately
the request was made back in January
Pakistan tried working on a war footing
to fulfill the request
but given the financial mess that it is
in it was unable to do the default
and now it has been forced to take
desperate steps like these
have a look at this headline on Tuesday
the economic Coordination Committee of
Pakistan's cabinet approved the
supplementary Grant of 27 billion rupees
to avert the looming default on diesel
purchase
this move may solve problems in the
short term
but you see in the long term it might
create problems for Pakistan
problems in keeping the overall expenses
within the limits agreed by the IMF
but that's not the only Point here the
point here is how one after the other
Islamic countries countries that
Pakistan calls its friend
are not helping it when it needs help
the most
we told you earlier about Saudi Arabia
on Tuesday this report was released it
said Saudi Arabia is no longer willing
to bail out Islamabad
it has refused to provide any more
interest-free loans
the country's Finance Minister said that
it does not want to give grants without
any strings attached
that Saudi Arabia is taxing its people
and it expects Pakistan to do the same
to fix its mess on its own
so first it was Saudi Arabia and now
it's Kuwait
how should we be viewing these
developments what exactly do they
indicate what is the messaging here
is the Islamic World disassociating
itself from Pakistan
has it come to realize that Pakistan is
indeed what others say it is a lost
cause
whatever be the case this is highly
embarrassing once again for Pakistan
you see two years back it was trying to
portray itself as the biggest activist
of the Islamic world
it's then prime minister Imran Khan was
going to one Islamic country after
another
beating the drum of unity Brotherhood
and just two years on the same Pakistan
is being ignored by Islamic countries
this is a major blow to Pakistan's
diplomacy
that is assuming there is any diplomacy
left
if Islamic countries are not helping
Pakistan why would the rest of the world
do that
this is the argument many analysts are
making
and that by the way is not the only
aspect of our Pakistan story tonight as
the country faces diplomatic
embarrassments on the world stage
back at home high ranking Pakistani
officials are losing their lives
and in the latest instance a Pakistani
intelligence official has been killed in
Northwestern Pakistan
his name was Brigadier Mustafa Kamal he
used to work for Pakistan's Rogue spy
agency the inter Services intelligence
or the isi
Reports say he died in an encounter in
South waziristan
his team was ambushed by a group of
terrorists from Pakistan's point of view
that is a big loss because this man was
a key player when it comes to Intel
operations
he was apparently involved in
neutralizing the terror Network behind
the 2016 attack on the army public
school in Peshawar
and the immediate question is who was
behind his killing
was it the tarike Taliban or some other
terror group
well there is no Clarity on that front
yet no group has claimed responsibility
as of now but this episode is very
striking
it tells you how the Resurgence of
Terror in Pakistan is not just claiming
the lives of civilians
but also of Pakistan's officials
and we have been telling you this for a
while now
China has been cracking down on its
billionaires
a faltering economy sliding stocks and a
depreciating Yuan have hit the country's
Super Rich harder than ever
and the results are out in the open now
the Heron Global rich list for 2023 is
out
take a look it says
the world is down
269 billionaires and this has happened
only twice in the last 10 years
but China has suffered the biggest blow
it has lost
229 of its billionaires
which means 51 percent of Chinese Elite
are no longer in the billionaire club
their net worth has plummeted by 15
percent
Alibaba group founder Jack ma dropped to
the 52nd Place in the rich list he was
ranked 34 the previous year the
countries Yuan lost about eight percent
of its value against a surging dollar
this was the biggest annual drop since
1994.
and for China's richest billionaires
last year was the worst in decades
and why is that
because president Xi Jinping is his
country's own enemy
the number one reason was his stringent
covid-19 restriction the zero covet
policy it throttled China's economy
and as if that wasn't enough
the CCP tightened scrutiny on private
Enterprises
it launched a common Prosperity campaign
Tech Moguls were urged to donate
billions of dollars to philanthropy
and China began its clam down on the
tech sector in the year 2020.
you see internet companies found
themselves in regulatory crosshairs
ant groups high-profile public offering
in Shanghai and Hong Kong were suspended
Alibaba was handed a 3.7 billion dollar
fine for monopolistic practices
Didi a leading ride healing company in
China had its app banned why was that
for suspected violation of cyber
security laws it lost more than 80
percent of its IPO value
methuan a major food delivery platform
was targeted with an Anti-Trust probe it
was fined more than 530 million dollars
China used several reasons to restrict
its Tech Giants activities to impose the
fines
but why did China crack down on its
homegrown successful Tech firms
well to push for what it calls common
prosperity
do you remember this
Xi Jinping vowed to adjust excessive
incomes of the super rich
his move was supposed to reduce income
disparity
to narrow down the gap between the rich
and the poor
but it seems more about concentrating
political power and ideological control
while blaming the rich and famous for
the country's ills
because Xi Jinping has targeted the
entertainment sector as well
entertainers and entrepreneurs have
cult-like followings in the country and
over the last few decades their wealth
has grown exponentially
celebrity fan clubs became networks of
mass mobilization millions of members
support their Idols online with clicks
and money
and of course it came under the ccp's
radar
in fact China's broadcast regulator
limited Entertainer salaries
cracked down on fandom culture
and banned film stars with different
political ideologies
several actors were fined others were
banned
and some disappeared altogether
and China also appended one of its most
lucrative sectors in the year 2021 it
announced a sweeping ban on profit-based
after-school tutoring
it accused tutoring Institutes of
causing unnecessary stress to young
children
but was that the real reason
the industry was worth over 150 billion
dollars and Regulators slammed it for
being hijacked by the capital
you see Western countries try to promote
growth
they create an environment in which the
rich can flourish
but that is not the case in China
the country targets its own riches even
at the expense of its economy
China's GDP expanded only three percent
in 2022 it was one of its lowest growth
in decades
it fell far below China's official
Target of 5.5 percent
XI jinping's anti-capitalist remarks
have spooked billionaires
their disappearances have become a
common feat many are actively seeking to
move out of the country altogether
what would it spell for China's economy
and from that we want to focus on a
leader who is related to a family of
billionaires
Britain's prime minister Rishi sanak
he has revealed his personal tax details
and questions are being raised over what
took the leaders so long to reveal these
details
to what extent do they really get us the
full picture
and what about his wife's tax details
our next report getting you the complete
story
after months of promising to release his
tax returns prime minister Rishi sunak
decided to publish the details just when
Boris Johnson's party gate Rao grilling
has kept the world distracted so what do
his tax returns show well I published my
tax returns because I said I would in
the interest of transparency and I'm
glad to have done that now I think well
ultimately what people are interested in
is what I'm going to do for them and you
know you talk about the cost of living
of course that's the number one priority
that I've got that I'm grappling with
the ukpm has made nearly 6 million
dollars in the past three years most of
this is through gains from his U.S
investment fund such massive gains might
come as a shock because the prime
minister's salary is only about 500 000
dollars
the rest of the earnings come simply
from interest dividends and capital
gains from his U.S based Investments but
what are these U.S investment funds
sunox accountants say the Investments
are held under a blind management
Arrangement the income this Arrangement
generates comes from only a single
us-based investment fund this has come
under intense scrutiny as the tax
statement offers no details of the
fund's contents and sunak is known to
have been party to several highly Market
sensitive discussions the tax system
which was designed by successive Tory
governments allows the PM to pay a lower
tax rate than the ordinary working class
the tax system which was designed by
successive Tory governments allows the
prime minister to pay a lower tax rate
than the ordinary working class which is
facing the highest tax burden in 70
years
while families are struggling to keep
the lights on in their homes sonak's
Revelations have triggered a series of
questions
although his tax details came after
months of delay his wife's tax returns
are still not out this after his wife
akshata Murthy was criticized over her
non-domicile status as a non-domicile
resident she is not required to pay UK
taxes on her overseas income Reports say
she would have dodged over 2.4 million
dollars in taxes in the year through her
non-domicile status but who can claim a
non-domicile status a person who lives
in the UK but declares their permanent
residence in another country can opt for
such a status it has also emerged that
Murthy pays nearly 36 000 a year to
maintain her non-domicile status
after marrying into one of India's
richest families sonak's personal wealth
has been a sensitive issue he's built an
Empire out of his multiple homes
he has a Mainer house with a private
Lake and heated pool worth over 1.8
million dollars a five-bedroom townhouse
in South Kensington bought for over 5.5
million dollars the millionaire also has
a couple of flats and penthouses in
parts of the UK
came out with the tax details after
questions were raised over his and his
family's tax Affairs but will these
Revelations make matters worse for him
we'll have to wait and see
and our next story comes from Israel
before I tell you more about it I want
you to take a look at these images
[Music]
[Applause]
that was a symbolic hourglass that was
put up by the protesters in Tel Aviv
why is that
to deliver a strong message
they say that time is running out for
Israeli democracy
Nationwide protests marked a day of
paralysis
in fact demonstrations have rocked the
country for weeks now judicial reforms
planned by beneman Netanyahu and amid
this unrest the Israeli Parliament has
passed a law which will save Netanyahu
from the chaos and might just destroy
Israel
what exactly is this new law all about
as part of the controversial judicial
overhaul the parliament has majorly
limited the ways in which a prime
minister can be deemed unfit for office
which means only the prime minister or
the cabinet with a two-thirds majority
can declare a leader unfit
the law also states that the government
will only unseat a prime minister when
they face a physical or mental
incapacity
but what if the people file a request
for the prime minister to step down
that will also not be entertained
as it prevents the Supreme Court from
considering such requests
and this new move is part of a broader
set of changes which include giving the
government control over the appointment
of judges and limiting the top Court's
ability to strike down laws
it has been pretty clear to the
opposition parties for a while now that
this new move the new law aims to
protect Netanyahu as he faces an ongoing
corruption trial
the Israeli Prime Minister remember is
on trial for charges of fraud breach of
trust and bribery he has dismissed the
charges calling them a politically
motivated Witch Hunt
so what is the opposition doing
it has announced plans to challenge the
law in the top Court
in fact former prime minister Yar lapith
has called it a disgraceful and corrupt
personalized law
highlighting the fact that Netanyahu is
just looking out for himself while the
cost of living soars and people are out
on the streets protesting for months now
and the protesters have had it up to the
brim they are not only expressing their
anger against Netanyahu but also his
wife
remember earlier this month
Sarah Netanyahu was also in the eye of
the storm
you know where she was when Israel was
witnessing protests on what was being
called a day of disruption
at a salon in Tel Aviv getting her hair
done
according to reports a client at the
salon posted a selfie with Sarah
Netanyahu and within minutes hundreds of
protesters laid Siege to The Parlor
the anger was palpable
demonstrators outside the salon chanted
Shame Shame and the country is burning
and Sarah is getting a haircut that's
what they said
and in an attempt to convince the people
government officials have said that the
new changes are what the country needs
but critics can see right through the
government's words they call netanyahu's
moves a fundamental threat to the
country's checks and balances
the reforms are capable of evaporating
minority protection
fostering corruption and damaging the
country's economy
it's been three months since the protest
started and now Netanyahu virtually has
a ticket to stay as prime minister for
life
where do things go from here
we will be keeping a close eye
let's now talk about what's happening in
Canada the country's population grew at
a record base in 2022.
there was an increase of over a million
new people and this was almost
completely because of immigration into
the country
our next report getting you the complete
story
for the first time ever Canada's
population has grown by more than one
million people in a year Canada's
population growth rate of 2.7 percent in
2022 puts it among the top 20 in the
world
almost all countries with a higher pace
of population growth were in Africa
Canada is leading the G7 countries as
far as population growth is concerned
you know what this means for the country
in the longer run
if the current Trend continues the
growth rate will mean Canada will double
in size by the middle of this Century so
what's behind this jump in population
numbers immigration is a major reason
according to the data by statistics
Canada this is happening largely due to
the increase in immigration
basically the government's efforts to
recruit migrants to ease labor shortages
in 2022 Canada welcomed 437
180 immigrants it had a net rise of 607
782 non-permanent residents according to
the report both of these numbers
represent the highest levels on record
reflecting higher immigration targets
and a record-breaking year for the
processing of immigration applications
international migration accounted for
nearly 96 of the population growth since
coming to power in 2015 prime minister
Justin Trudeau has been trying to
attract more immigrants to the country
just last year the government announced
a plan to welcome half a million
immigrants a year by 2025. the country
has been looking at immigration as a way
out of the crisis Left Behind as a
result of the Aging Baby Boomers leaving
the workforce the 2.7 annual population
growth rate is Canada's highest since
1957. the earlier record was the result
of the post-war baby boom
along with the high immigration of
refugees because of the Hungarian
revolution of 1956.
if Canada maintains current trends that
is the 2.7 percent increase each year
its population would double in 26 years
but this also comes with challenges the
rise in number of permanent and
temporary immigrants could mean
additional hurdles for some parts of the
country in the areas of infrastructure
housing and transportation
earlier a poll indicated that a vast
majority of Canadians are concerned
about how the government's plan to
increase immigration levels will impact
housing and government services like a
lot of countries in the west Canada has
an aging population with a lower birth
rate which means it has to bring in
immigrants in order to grow what makes
it stand out is its focus on economic
immigration
around 50 percent of its permanent
residents are shown the red carpet not
under family reunification but as a
result of their skills
that's all shift of focused to India the
Jammu and Kashmir police saying that for
the first time in three decades the
number of terrorists in the valley have
been brought down to 28.
the security forces said that just 28
local terrorists are active in the
Kashmir Valley our next report by our
correspondent Idris loan getting you
more details
yeah
Jammu and Kashmir police along with
other security agencies claim to have
successfully managed to bring down the
terrorist numbers drastically across the
Kashmir region
the Insurgency started in the early
1990s and since then the number has
always been in the hundreds
now the JMK police claim that the number
of active terrorists has been brought
down to 28.
I feel happy to inform you that the
number of local active terrorists has
come down to an all-time low at 28 and
we will bring it further down in coming
days all those who have given shelter or
support to terrorists in the past action
will be taken against them according to
law
um
the police national investigation agency
and state investigation agency have
intensified anti-terror operations
across Kashmir Valley to break the
terror ecosystems
in the last few weeks hundreds of
properties of alleged terrorists and
those allegedly harboring terrorists
have been seized by security agencies
the houses which according to officials
give shelter to terrorists have also
been seized in hundreds in the past few
months
the ecosystem of terrorists is being
destroyed at every level if an encounter
took place in any residential house and
the house owners or found harboring
terrorists we would arrest and book them
in uapa at the same time we would seize
those properties the number of such
properties are going up as we initiate
action in those encounter cases too
which happened in the last five years
a few months ago the police said that
the number of terrorists had come down
to two digits that is 90. now after
joint action by Jammu and Kashmir police
army paramilitary forces and Central and
state agencies like Nia number of
terrorists active are only 28.
the authorities claim that besides
neutralizing and arresting allegedly
active terrorists the security forces
have also succeeded in curbing the new
recruitment to their ranks which has
helped to bring down the numbers
according to Jammu and Kashmir police
the anti-militant operations across the
Kashmir region have been intensified
leading to an all-time lowest number of
active militants in the region the
number stands at 28 and now Jammu and
Kashmir police says their focus this
year will not only be militants but also
the militant sympathizers with video

let me now ask you
equal performs
how do you spend your time over the
weekends
trying to click the perfect pictures
filming videos perhaps editing them with
trending audio notes devising and
effective marketing strategy perhaps
hopping onto every Tick-Tock Trend
waiting for that one reel to go viral to
become an internet sensation overnight
it might be a guilty pleasure for you
but for some it might be an alternate
career plan
let me tell you what I'm talking about
during the Wuhan virus pandemic when
everyone was stuck inside their homes a
lot of new social media accounts popped
up a lot of people made something out of
their Hobbies
you know posting their art on Instagram
book reviews glitzy outfits even makeup
tutorials recipes of course
and how can we forget the Algona coffee
people found a creative Outlet at a time
when most were working from home Saving
Time on commute enjoying flexible
working hours
and since people had so much time in
their hands Moonlighting became all the
rage
the debate over Moonlighting took Center
Stage
but what about those who made social
media their side Hustle
you know people who were resiliently
growing their handles on social media
platforms gaining followers and
engagement
with hopes to be able to monetize it one
day
such employees are gaining attention now
the rise of social media influencing has
opened up avenues for employees they see
it as a way to earn quick bucks while
maintaining their normal job routines
in fact many see their jobs as a
launching PAD as a way to put food on
the table as they hustle for a social
media presence on the site
could this be the next big challenge for
India Inc
the influencer marketing industry seems
promising the influencer marketing
report 2022 in fact
the industry is estimated to grow at an
annual rate of 25 over the next five
years
currently it is valued at 16.4 billion
dollars and it is set to reach
21.1 billion dollars by the end of this
fiscal year
earlier influencers only received free
products for promoting items but it has
become a growing business over the years
42 influencers now get paid instead of
great getting freebies
and their income varies depending on the
country the sponsors and the followers
users with less than 10 000 followers
make around 88 dollars per post those
with a larger following earn much more
up to 200 dollars for every post
you see this is why this sector seems so
enticing
you get to work ask for your own
convenience
only a few hours every day you are your
own boss you create the content that you
like and you get paid handsomely for it
there is no denying that the work
requires a lot of effort but many are
willing to choose that over dead-end
jobs
building a social media presence takes
time earnings are meager initially
a majority of people pursue it with
their stable jobs
and here comes the tricky part
if employees are earning money outside
their full-time jobs they need to
disclose this to their employer as it
may lead to a conflict of interest
however employees turned influencers are
technically not employed by any other
organization so in a way they are not
really obligated to disclose this
employment contracts don't include any
such Clause specifically
so is it about time that they do
employees are obviously going to spend
hours creating content but what if it
affects their work ethics their
attention their productivity could be
taking a hit
damaging brand reputation could be
another risk
what if as an influencer they promote a
competitors product
so where do we go from here
should employees disclose their
influencing projects during hiring
should their brand be aligned with their
employers value and reputation
they do represent the company after all
or is this too much to ask for
time now to tell you what else made news

haVK1eCqcNw,Key Takeaways from Xi- Jinping&#39;s Russia visit | Latest English News | WION,The three-day meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping ended Wednesday. The two ...,2023-03-22T18:44:37Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/haVK1eCqcNw/hqdefault.jpg,"we are now witnessing changes that have
not been seen for more than a century
and we are pushing them together bidding
favorable to Russia's Vladimir Putin
Chinese president Xi Jinping concluded
his two-day Moscow visit with these
words it was his first Russia visit
since the War Began and also since his
re-election but those awaiting a
breakthrough for peace were let high and
dry
here is all that happened in the past
two days just on Monday Xi Jinping
received a grand voice welcome in Moscow
the two leaders held extensive
conversations over the course of two
days the talks railed from the
russia-ukraine war to criticize in the
west and to the china-russia No Limits
partnership
the West on its part was watching The
Summit closely hoping that China will
not announce any military supports to
Russia well Xi Jinping did not rather on
the Ukraine Russia this is what he had
to say
I would like to point out that in the
Ukrainian settlement to be consistently
follow the principles of the U.N Charter
and stand on an objective and unbiased
position we do actively promote
reconciliation and Assumption of dogs
our stance is based on the very essence
of the matter and on the truth we are
always for peace and dialogue we are
firmly standing on the two side of
History
but what is this true side of history on
which China says it is firmly standing
you may think that the right side is
peace but is China really standing for
it or is it just a lip service well
China did release a peace plan for
Russia Ukraine war its 12 point plan is
problematic on multiple levels we will
get to that in a moment but first listen
into what Putin had to say about the
plan
we believe that many of the provisions
of the peace plan put forward by China
are consonant with Russian approaches
and can be taken as the basis for a
peaceful settlement when they are ready
for that in the west and in Kiev however
so far we see no such Readiness from
their side
we are ready but the West is not
isn't it convenient for Putin to say
this right now his forces are already in
control of thousands of kilometers of
Ukrainian soil
at such a Time the Chinese plan does not
even mandate Russia to pull back in fact
it binds no one to do anything the
vaguely worded plan does call for peace
it also calls to end hostilities and
resolve humanitarian crisis but it does
not lay any precondition to peace talks
if anything it calls to reject double
standards right at its outset and urges
to abandon Cold War mentality
now much of this was already the
backbone of the Chinese narrative even
before the war broke out in Ukraine SRI
and Putin in a joint statement
underlined that the security of any one
state cannot come at the expense of the
security of the another state
the attack was on the U.S led so-called
Western Bloc and it continues to be so
for the new peace plan document which
Putin has welcomed basically advances
China's own narrative and has little to
do with achieving peace in Ukraine
then you may ask what is the point of
all of this well China is a rising power
and no one doubts that the economic
Powerhouse has in the past decade come
in direct competition with the United
States
now the U.S naturally has reservations
of its own with the rise of China in
recent years U.S and the West have been
somewhat successful in calling out
China's potential wrong Deeds be the
issue of Human Rights abuses in xinjiang
security and privacy issues with Chinese
firms or the question around the origins
of the covid-19 virus
so China began looking for means to make
a credible comeback on the world stage
just earlier this month Beijing has led
a diplomatic coup in West Asia by
brokering a historic peace deal between
Iran and Saudi Arabia and Ukraine was
the obvious next stop
so the message of she's Moscow visit is
clear peace or no peace China is back at
the world stage and now Beijing wants
its say in important decisions United
States and
can no more dictate the world on their
own terms
there is a new sheriff in town China
wants the world to acknowledge it

so far the focus this week was on all
that's happening in Moscow the Chinese
leader Xi Jinping was in the city
meeting and greeting the Russian
President Vladimir Putin
the two held multiple rounds of talks
they held a joint press conference
issued a joint statement
the world watched their bonomy in the
backdrop of the Ukraine war
but Xi Jinping has now left Moscow and
with him the spotlight also has moved
away from the city
you see all eyes are now on Japan which
will soon be hosting a summit of the G7
leaders
and will this Summit be the platform
that provides an alternative position on
the war
after all Moscow was all about she Putin
bonami
will the G7 be all about Putin bashing
the world was astonished to see innocent
civilians in butcher killed one year ago
as I step on the ground of pucha today I
really feel great anger for all the
atrocious Acts
many were taken by surprise when the
Japanese prime minister fomio kishida
decided to travel to Ukraine earlier
this week
one moment he was holding talks with his
Indian counterpart prime minister
Narendra Modi
and the next moment kashida is on a
flight
followed by a train to Kiev
was the trip as impromptu as Japan would
have you believe
or was it pre-planned after all
if so why did kashida decide to go via
India
are there some dots we are supposed to
connect here
you know India and Japan are Court
Partners Japan is this year's G7
president
and India is the sitting president of
the group of 20.
so when the leaders of these two
countries India and Japan met in New
Delhi earlier this week
did they happen to discuss Ukraine and
what it means for the G7 and G20
and how the two groupings can try to
have solution oriented discussions
during the upcoming summits
prime minister Narendra Modi will be
attending the G7 Summit this year
so will Australia the other court
partner also Vietnam and Indonesia
countries that have territorial disputes
with China my point is while she and
Putin were grabbing headlines in Moscow
was there a strategic play in New Delhi
that most headlines failed to pick
because what else explains kashida's
interestingly time to visit to Kiev
following his State visit to India what
explains the Delhi Factor
is it a coincidence or is there more to
this
because a few months from now when
Canada France Germany Italy Japan the UK
and the US meet for the G7 Summit the
club of Western allies will be looking
for an opportunity to bash Vladimir
Putin perhaps China as well for coming
up with a peace plan
whose Clauses the West finds
unacceptable the Western allies will
make it a point to use the G7 Podium to
tell the world that aggression will not
be accepted and cannot be rewarded
these G7 leaders will be joined by the
Ukrainian president Walid misalinski
of course we discussed our cooperation
within the framework of Japan being
chair of the G7 prime minister kishida
invited me today to take part in the G7
Summit that is planned for May in
Hiroshima I accepted the invitation to

here's a look at what's lined up for you
on the show tonight
[Music]
this is
foreign
[Music]
if you live in India or Pakistan or
Afghanistan last night must have been
quite a scary one to say the least
we were right here in The Newsroom when
the earthquake struck
the 6.5 magnitude earthquake hit
Afghanistan Tremors were felt as far as
New Delhi
tonight on gravitas
we get you the bigger picture
we tell you about the warnings that have
been issued for the Himalayan region
is a great Himalayan earthquake route
right around the corner
how prone are the Himalayas really to
earthquakes how much is the Indian plate
shifting each year
also on the show for you tonight
Pakistan's hope to emerge from its
unprecedented economic crisis continues
to fade as its friend Saudi Arabia now
refuses to give an interest-free loan to
the country we tell you why
a deadly Ebola right virus is on the
prowl in Tanzania Kenya is on high alert
we tell you why there is growing concern
over the spread of this virus
we focus on what's happening in Somalia
as the famine gets worse the country
Witnesses suffering because of the
drought and the world seems to look the
other way
the New Zealand government wants to give
support to those who are going through a
breakup we tell you all about this plan
and what triggered it
the 6.5 magnitude earthquake that tore
across three Frontiers on the evening of
Tuesday hit around 10 10 17 PM Indian
time 9 47 PM Pakistan time 9 17 p.m
Afghanistan time
the casualties are still being counted
but it resurrected a dread that lies
just below the surface of the north of
the Indian subcontinent
when will the long predicted big
earthquake hit popular cities like Delhi
Lahore and Rawalpindi
the epicenter this time was in
Afghanistan near the town of German some
400 kilometers from Kabul
the Tremors were felt in Pakistan
Uzbekistan Tajikistan Kazakhstan
Kyrgyzstan Pakistan and India
and here in India's national capital
region people ran out of the trembling
buildings
soon videos surfaced on social media of
people recalling the moment of horror of
fans shaking chandeliers swinging
some of these visuals are born chilling
and this video from kashmir's anantanag
went viral where doctors are seen
delivering a baby as the earthquake
shakes the operation theater
foreign
[Music]
and in Pakistan the situation was much
worse given its proximity to the
epicenter
some nine people are believed to have
died in the swath Valley alone a 10 year
old girl died when the wall of her house
fell on her
some hundred others were rushed to
hospitals
local Reports say it leaves 20 houses
have been damaged in this region
elsewhere in Pakistan as well there were
reports of injuries

it may be too early to answer that
question for the very reason that those
in positions of power in Afghanistan do
not have much control or idea about
what's really happening in the remote
parts of the country
at no point for guessing I'm talking
about the Taliban initial Reports say as
many as 50 people have lost their lives
in Afghanistan a Taliban official in
fact took to Twitter last night to say
that at least 20 injured people were
brought into hospitals across the
country following the earthquake
but I'll tell you what
you should not be surprised if these
numbers go up multi-fold
the visuals from turkey and Syria were
too fresh in Our Minds when the
earthquake struck last night
the Tremors definitely came with a deja
vu
but more importantly
they brought along a harsh reminder of
the imminence of a great Himalayan
earthquake
and also this question
Are We Now inching closer to that
dreaded earthquake
the great Himalayan quick is something
that has been a part of the discourse
for a while now seismologists in fact
believe it is only a matter of time
before an earthquake of eight magnitude
or more
strikes the Himalayan region
this region home to the mighty Himalayas
the world's highest mountain range that
spreads its wings along India Nepal
Bhutan Tibet Pakistan
what makes this beautiful region prone
to earthquakes
to answer that we will have to revisit
High School geography and look at why
earthquakes occur in the first place
you see earthquakes happen when a
tectonic plate fractures or breaks
and why does that happen
because of tension
and there is tension building up along
the Himalayas why is that
because the Indian plate is Shifting
five centimeters every year risking the
lives of the billions who live in this
region in houses that are not built to
be earthquake resistant
there were multiple mild earthquakes in
this region this morning one in
Tajikistan one in India's Himachal
Pradesh also an earthquake in
Afghanistan
between the 18th of March and now there
have been at least 43 medium and Mild
earthquakes in this region
I repeat
43 earthquakes in four days
and many of these earthquakes have been
in India
and I'm not making this up I'm simply
telling you what's in the database of
the national center for seismology the
question now is whether these repeated
earthquakes are setting the ground for a
major Himalayan earthquake
and if so what does it mean for those
living in this part of the world
I don't know if you know this but 59 of
India's land mass is prone to
earthquakes
this is according to the National Center
for seismology 11 cities and several
Indian States and union territories fall
within zone five that's the highest risk
Zone
and which are these states and union
territories
Kashmir Himachal Pradesh Gujarat Bihar
Manipur Assam nagaland Andaman and
nicobar Islands Bihar
in fact India's capital New Delhi is
located near three active fault lines
gurugram around seven active fault lines
which makes it the riskiest City in the
national capital region
and earlier this evening parts of the
MCR were hit by another earthquake this
one was 2.7 magnitude on the Richter
scale
but there is no guarantee that the next
earthquake will be as mild
so the immediate question is what do you
do if you live in the Himalayan region
how should you be preparing for the
great Himalayan earthquake
see if your building has earthquake
resistant Construction
if it doesn't you may want to upgrade be
ready for an emergency in many parts of
the world every household has a grab and
run bag
you know with the essentials like dry
fruit dry food
few pairs of clothing essential
medicines a torch few batteries some
bottles of water
so that when the Tremors strike and your
nightmares come true then you have
enough to sustain yourself before help
can reach you
and if there is something that we have
learned from turkey and Syria it is that
the world is not the most prompt when it
comes to disaster relief
so it's always better to be prepared
than be sorry
and here's something else that you
should do
ask your housing society and your office
to conduct MOG drills so that you and
everyone around you is familiar with the
basic protocols that will help in
appropriately responding to an
earthquake it will limit panic
and hopefully also help save lives
and now let me ask you some questions
do you know which was the first country
the Pakistan prime minister Shahbaz
Sharif visited after coming to power
it was Saudi Arabia
do you know which is the first country
every Pakistani prime minister visits
after being elected
again it's Saudi Arabia
this is a short summary of the close
ties between these two countries
ties that are rooted in history Faith
security economics
you see for the longest time this
relationship was immune to changes in
leadership
it was immune to domestic and
geopolitical compulsions
but that does not seem to be the case
anymore
have a look at this headline
the Middle East I carried it
says Saudi Arabia is no longer willing
to bail out Islamabad it has refused to
provide any more interest-free loans to
the country
and the question is why
the answer is Pakistan itself
it's failure to mend its ways its
Financial negligence its political
ignorance it's diplomatic ineptitude
whatever be the case this development is
striking
it has left Pakistan in shock
because for the longest time in fact
throughout Pakistan's existence
Riyadh has always been there for the
country on multiple locations it has
stepped up to bail Islamabad out of its
Financial mess
it has provided zero interest loans
without any questions asked
in fact just a mere phone call by the
Pakistani prime minister or a state
visit by Pakistan's Army Chief were
enough to secure the funding
but things are not the same anymore
Pakistan's inability to pay its loans
its inability to get the debt down its
inability to fix its economy has irked
the kingdom
so what does it do
it shuts the money Taps and scraps the a
venue of a bailout
I have a statement with me
it's from Muhammad al-jadan he is the
Finance Minister of Saudi Arabia
he says and I'm quoting
we used to give direct grants and
deposits without strings attached and we
are changing that
we are working with multilateral
institutions to actually say we need to
see reforms we are taxing our people we
are expecting also others to do the same
to do their efforts
we want to help but we want you also to
do your part
and this is embarrassing to say the
least Pakistan is in dire need of money
the IMF is not willing to help China
says it has done enough
and now you have Saudi Arabia Pakistan's
so-called Islamic brother refusing to
extend a helping hand anymore
you see this sets a new precedent
previously State visits by Pakistani
leaders or by the country's Army Chiefs
have been a source of assurance
they usually end up with riyadhs giving
Islamabad bags full of money but not
anymore
and with this decision the Saudis seem
to be telling Pakistan that they have
had enough of the civilian authorities
cornering away handouts
this is a major shift
you see for decades the Kingdom's number
one partner in South Asia was Pakistan
they exchanged troops they traded
weapons
it was a broad military cooperation
and it continued as recently as 2017.
you see Pakistan's then Army Chief rahil
Sharif was appointed to lead an Islamic
anti-terror coalition
this group had 39 Nations and was
headquartered in Saudi Arabia
and then in 2019
Crown Prince bin Salman offered his
private jet to former prime minister
Imran Khan
he said his guest cannot leave on a
commercial flight
Imran Khan was headed to New York for
the U.N General Assembly you may
remember his hysterical performance
there
turns out even bin Salman was not
impressed
and while returning from the U.N the
Crown Prince ordered his plane back to
New York Imran Khan ended up flying
commercial after all
and things went down the hill downhill
from there
in 2020 Pakistan's then foreign minister
threatened that they would quit the OIC
if Saudi Arabia does not convene a
meeting on Kashmir and the kingdom
responded by asking Islamabad to return
two billion dollars from a loan that it
had granted
Pakistan had to borrow money from China
to repay the Saudis
and that's not even all Riyadh further
recognized India's right to make
decisions on Kashmir and joined New
Delhi in condemning Global terrorism
the new Saudi Arabia was looking for
Reliable and trustworthy partners that
led them from Pakistan to India
in 2020 a new government came to power
but the ties remained tense mostly
because of Pakistan's Financial Wars it
kept asking Islam it kept asking for
money it kept making requests for loans
it assumed that the Saudis would comply
and guess what not anymore
that is riyadh's message a message that
Pakistan may find a bit hard to
comprehend
Alice now talk about the war in Ukraine
so far the focus this week was on all

one moment he was holding talks with his
Indian counterpart prime minister
Narendra Modi
and the next moment kashida is on a
flight
followed by a train to Kiev
was the trip as impromptu as Japan would
have you believe
or was it pre-planned after all
if so why did kashida decide to go via
India
are there some Dots here that we are
supposed to be connecting
you know India and Japan are core
Partners Japan is this year's G7
president and India is the sitting
president of the group of 20.
so when the leaders of these two
countries India and Japan met in New
Delhi earlier this week
did they happen to discuss Ukraine
and what does this mean for G7 and G20
how do the two groupings
can how can they try to have solution
oriented discussions during the upcoming
summits
prime minister Narendra Modi will be
attending the G7 Summit this year
so will Australia the other court
partner also Vietnam and Indonesia are
countries that have territorial disputes
with China my point is while she and
Putin were grabbing headlines in Moscow
was there a strategic play in New Delhi
that most headlines failed to pick
because what else explains kashida's
interestingly time to visit to Kiev
following his State visit to India what
explains the Delhi Factor
is it a coincidence or is there more to
this
because a few months from now when
Canada France Germany Italy Japan the UK
and the US meet for the G7 Summit the
club of Western allies will be looking
for an opportunity to bash Vladimir
Putin perhaps China as well for coming
up with a peace plan
whose Clauses the West finds
unacceptable the Western allies will
make it a point to use the G7 Podium to
tell the world that aggression will not
be accepted and cannot be rewarded
these G7 leaders will be joined by the
Ukrainian president Walid misalinski
of course we discussed our cooperation
within the framework of Japan being
chair of the G7 prime minister kishida
invited me today to take part in the G7
Summit that is planned for May in
Hiroshima I accepted the invitation to
take part virtually
so if you thought what happened in
Moscow was a defining moment in the war
keshida's visit to Kiev set in motion a
trailer for the next big event in what's
becoming a never-ending Ukraine war
and here's a question who is responsible
for the safety of diplomatic missions
abroad
who is responsible for ensuring that
these missions are not threatened
well if we go by the Vienna convention
it is the responsibility of the state
these missions are based in on your
screen in fact is a copy of this
convention let me quote what it says
it says the Vienna conventions on the
protection of diplomatic facilities
state that all states have a
responsibility to use every means to
protect the Consular properties within
their territories
all violations of those conventions must
be investigated and prosecuted by the
states
and why am I telling you all of this
because one country has failed to live
up to this pledge
the United Kingdom
just look at what happened on Sunday
a group of kalistan sympathizers entered
the Indian High Commission in London and
tried to replace the Indian flag with
their own
how did such a thing happen
what was the security doing how could
such elements even enter a diplomatic
office
these are questions New Delhi is asking
the British government
but upon failure to find a clear answer
it has been forced to take a major step
a tit-for-tat move
have a look at these images
India has started to reduce security
outside the British High commission also
outside the residence of its Envoy Alex
Ellis
Reports say barricades outside the UK
Mission and the high Commissioners
residents have been removed
however there has been no reduction in
security Personnel posted at the mission
this by and large is a retaliatory move
a move aimed at making the UK understand
its failure in protecting the Indian
mission
the question is has the message has the
message reached London
well it has
within hours of the move the Indian
mission in London was placed under heavy
security Reports say the Metropolitan
Police deployed more than 20 buses in
front of the mission it also deployed
mounted troops to patrol the nearby
streets
did it really have to be this way
how did things reach this point
like I said the answer is the UK's
failure to safeguard the premises of the
Indian mission in London
in recent years we've seen several
violent demonstrations by kalistanis
outside the Indian commission they come
they raise anti-india slogans they wave
their flags and indulge in vandalism
as the British authorities watch in
silence
this time India says it has had enough
if the UK cannot ensure the security of
the Indian Mission why should India this
is the argument the question is what
could come next
Tit for Tat moves result in downgrading
off the ties
could they affect the many bilateral
deals between the two countries
especially the free trade deal
there are voices who want to freeze this
deal
I know the demand is a bit far-fetched
but then again in diplomacy nothing is
certain
for the unversed this Free Trade
Agreement is in a sense a pact that aims
to reduce custom tariff on substantial
trade between the two countries this
agreement covers both trade in goods and
trade and services
and this deal is a win-win for both
sides
it will ensure smoother trade not to
mention boost business for certain
products as well especially especially
scotch and whiskey brands
you see the UK is a competitive supplier
of whiskey to India it exported whiskey
worth 110 million euros in 2019.
but India imposes a 150 percent tariff
on Spirit Imports
once the FDA is finalized this tariff
could be reduced or even abolished
and this would open up the Indian market
to many luxury brands
but last we checked the developments in
London the attack on the Indian Mission
cast its dark shadow on the FDA some are
of the opinion that unless the UK
guarantees the security of the Indian
mission
this deal should not be taken forward
until now the authority is concerned
have said no such thing
but if these attacks persist if these
episodes of vandalism persist
there is no saying to what extent
will India be willing to go
let me take you back in time
the year was 2016.
planes and drones hovered over the city
of mosul
multiple airstrikes were carried out
they were targeted at the Islamic State
militants of Iraq but they ended up
killing civilians
the dense streets of mosul were filled
with ordinary people
some were prevented from leaving others
were too frightened to cross the front
lines and Escape
do you know who was behind this massacre
the United Kingdom
the UK military claimed to have fought a
perfect war in Iraq that British weapons
did not harm a single civilian
but the survivors have a different story
to tell
have a look at this report by Guardian
it tells the stories of the victims that
have surfaced now One Survivor lost her
eldest daughter when a missile exploded
near them
she had she had to have both her legs
amputated
our second daughter still has sharpener
in her skull
Hassan just a toddler at the time lost
parts of her foot and hand
another woman lost her mother father two
siblings and two nephews as a missile
destroyed their home
what do the UK and the U.S have to say
for themselves
the U.S led Coalition accepted civilian
casualties from airstrikes but it did
not say which country fired the weapons
in total across the six strikes
identified as British attacks the
Coalition accepts killing only 26
civilians
isn't this what the West does
it treats third world countries as its
playground it stations its troops posing
as saviors butchers people left right
and center and then never takes
accountability for this
the atrocities began in 2003 on the 20th
of March the U.S and Allied Forces
invaded Iraq
the topple Saddam Hussein's regime the
U.S had claimed Iraq had weapons of mass
destruction that it was a threat to
International Peace
most countries refused to support
military action against it
they waited for the U.N and
International Energy Authority to find
evidence
but the U.S refused to wait for the
inspections
it assembled a coalition of the Willing
against Iraq of the 30 countries in the
Coalition the UK Australia and Poland
participated in the invasion
it was a war built on life
on imagination instead of facts it was
driven by fear and not hard intelligence
and it was waged by two men
George Bush and Tony Blair
before ordering The Invasion Bush said
that he could not wait for the final
proof Tony Blair said it was beyond
doubt that Saddam Hussein was producing
weapons of mass destruction
he dismissed anti-war demonstrations
saying history would be his judge
and yet Iraq had no nuclear program no
poison gases no shells filled with
deadly viruses
U.N inspectors had scarred the country
for months
but what was it all about
the UK began bombing Iraq again in 2014.
it targeted highest Fighters strikes in
Syria began a year later
between 2014 and 2020 it dropped over 4
000 Munitions in the two countries
the British military claims those
strikes killed over 3 000 militants in
Syria over a thousand militants were
killed and only one civilian died
the U.S led Coalition killed
1437 civilians during that period
how is it possible that the UK killed
only one of them and why does it
continue to lie
this month we marked the 20th
anniversary of the Iraq War a war that
cost nearly 3 trillion dollars that took
nearly 584
000 lives
and these figures are only for direct
depths many more died due to diseases
displacement and starvation
the UK and the US have moved on but Iraq
is still in shambles
have a look at this video
Christian elections are rigged
political opponents are imprisoned or
otherwise eliminated from participating
in the electoral process
the result is an absence of checks and
balances in Russia
and the decision of one man
to launch a wholly unjustified and
brutal invasion of Iraq I mean of
Ukraine
all right anyway
75. uh
did you hear that
George Bush accidentally said Iraq
instead of Ukraine and the audience
laughed
he made a joke out of his slip up some
called it a Freudian slip
he blamed it on his age
this is how trivial the Iraq War has
become for the Americans for the man who
gave the orders for the invasion himself
but in Iraq people still struggle with
the trauma of that war
listen to this now
in the beginning they said oh it's about
removing this threat to world and
weapons of mass destruction
and then they didn't find any and
couldn't even manufacture so then they
shifted and said oh it's about democracy
but
if you go now and ask Iraqis do we have
a democracy network no we have an
oligarchy we have one of the most
corrupt systems in the world
the UK and the US launched an illegal
war of aggression
they committed war crimes
today they cried sanctions against
Russia
but what about what they did in Iraq
20 years on the leaders have never faced
criminal charges the U.S troops are
still stationed in Iraq
when will the West be held accountable
the Wuhan virus pandemic has subsided
normalcy has returned the masks are off
but the threat is not over
I'm talking about the Marburg virus it's
making its presence felt in Tanzania
with the government issuing High alerts
flights getting canceled and quarantine
zones in the making
what is the story of this virus what is
the situation looking like at this point
our next report getting you all the
details
the Marburg virus has an 88 fatality
rate
the deadly ebola-like virus has now
attacked Tanzania
it has already claimed five lives in the
country Tanzania has fired up its Health
security measures and confirmed the
outbreak of the virus
Kenya is on high alert Health officials
are on their toes
to ensure all travelers are screened
before entering the country but Kenya is
not the first one to restrict travelers
Canada has also restricted travel to
specific regions in Africa especially
Equatorial Guinea
which is also witnessing an outbreak of
the Infectious virus
the Central African country has placed
over 200 people in quarantine and
restricted movement in parts of the
nation the Marburg virus originates from
bats fruit bats to be specific
it causes severe headache high fever and
gradually gives the host a feeling of
being unwell the virus spreads through
human to human transmission
the virus has an incubation period of 21
days which means a person may not even
know that they have caught the infection
until multiple days have gone by
there are no vaccines or antiviral
treatments approved for the Marburg
virus
the who has given a glimmer of hope it
says that rehydration and treatment of
specific symptoms can improve a person's
chances of survival
experts say the lack of treatment is due
to the small number of cases in the
world but can we afford to remain
complacent Health experts say this virus
could be deadlier than the covid-19
virus
the symptoms include more than just
Fever The Infected individual Witnesses
bleeding in different parts of the body
which can also result in liver failure
the who has found out that Marburg lies
in the same family as Ebola the Marburg
virus is not something Nations should be
taking lightly
[Music]
realizing this the who has launched an
in-depth investigation national teams
have been deployed to the affected areas
for providing Medical Care and
scientists are trying to formulate a
vaccine is this the beginning of another
pandemic or will Nations and
international organizations act faster
this time to save people from one of the
deadliest viruses in the world
our next story comes from Somalia
where people are dying of hunger
while the rest of the media focuses on
other issues we want to put the
spotlight on what the Somalians are
going through at this point
let's give you a basic reality check
the East African country is witnessing
severe drought and a major famine crisis
experts say that over 34 000 will die
due to hunger in the first six months of
this year
the number of fatalities has always been
on the rise Somalia suffered the death
of 43 000 people last year as it went
through the sixth consecutive field
rainy season
the worst part is that more children
died as compared to adults
most of them under the age of five
more than 213 000 people are at high
risk of famine and over 7.8 million
people which is half of the population
is now affected by the drought
this news of famines and droughts
affecting Somalia is nothing new the
country has been witnessing the crises
since 1992 when more than 300 when more
than 300 000 people lost their lives
this has been the trend for more than
two decades now
but this is where a major question comes
up
why have countries ignored the history
of famines and droughts in Somalia
you see politics is a major reason
Nations have always always been worried
to send Aid to Somalia as it was
believed to be controlled by Terror
groups
the governments were concerned about
what if the Medical Aid falls in the
hands of terrorists this contributed to
the significant decline in Aid to the
country
while Western donors continue to
prioritize geopolitical relations over
the urgent need to avoid famine
al-shabaab the terror group dominating
the country paid little heat to the
crisis there they restricted
humanitarian access and rejected
emergency aid
and now the U.N says that a large number
of people have been pushed into Reliance
on humanitarian assistance
but is humanitarian assistance the
solution
Somali officials say that such
assistance can only be a stop Gap
measure when crises occur
dependence on food Aid can be a brutal
cycle where a country will become
dependent on other countries for Aid
every time a crisis occurs
and the other major problem with
humanitarian Aid is that once funds are
earmarked for a certain purpose
it cannot be used for any other
requirement even if it's connected to
the current crisis
so what can be the solution for Somalia
officials say resilience schemes can be
the answer in which organizations can
help build projects like water
reservoirs irrigation fodder create
alternative clean energy sources like
solar energy
the tragedy in Somalia is more saddening
as people are suffering from a
climate-related crisis a country which
hardly contributes to the global
emissions the country is in need of a
green energy transition that would allow
it to adapt to the changing climate
reality
breakups hurt don't they
it takes time to move on from someone
you loved
it can get to the best of us
in that fragile time many of us end up
making mistakes messing up good
opportunities
the hurt can be especially unbearable
for teenagers of age groups who are just
learning to Foster relationships outside
of their families
after a breakup youngsters often feel
lost directionless
some discuss their rules with their
fears some talk to their therapists
but not everyone has a healthy Outlet
and that is what the government of New
Zealand is trying to change
it has launched a campaign to deal with
breakups and heartbreaks
it's called love better and it is for
people of all age groups
have a look at this advertisement
so
I'm doing it I'm officially
deleting my ex from all my socials
I'm moving on
a young woman shares her experience of
removing her ex from her social media
she says that she is moving on
and here's another one
I'm gonna have to do it honestly this is
getting ridiculous it's getting so out
of hand I need to sleep at night I need
to get over here get over this hurdle
it's the leader unblock no not on block
block
another young man is working up to block
their ex get over this hurdle just
delete it he says
these videos were released as a part of
the love better campaign
they feature actual people who have just
suffered a heartbreak you can see them
trying to move on
these Snippets were released on social
media platforms famous among the youths
why to help the youngsters cope with
emotional distress
not through scripted videos not through
motivational lectures by life coaches
but by real people
through raw and unfiltered stories of
those who are in the same boat as them
this is a one-of-a-kind campaign
launched by the New Zealand's Ministry
of Social Development
it aims to help people Foster safe
positive and equal relationships
nearly 80 percent of 16 to 24 year olds
in New Zealand have been in a
relationship 87 percent of them
experienced harm beyond the normal hurt
of breaking up
most of the heart reported was emotional
but one in six young people faced
physical arguments in their
relationships
and this not only puts the youth at risk
but it can also hamper the way they look
at relationships or form connections
later in their lives
you see breakups come with a lot of
consequences and this includes self-harm
depression substance abuse risky sexual
behavior violence blackmailing stalking
most of the time Guardians have no clue
what their kids are going through
adolescents are left in an abyss
if they don't receive proper guidance a
failed relationship can drive them to
extremes
simply asking them to get over it or
find some distraction is not enough
how many times have you heard the same
piece of advice
does it ever really work
instead of getting over it the love
better campaign asks those with a broken
heart to own their emotions
it affirms that feeling heart is a
normal part of Being Human
the campaign supports young people to
acknowledge their pain to channel it
into something positive for themselves
and this includes normalizing asking for
help when needed
and this by the way is just the first
phase of this campaign
the coming phases will depend on the
findings of this one
and the love better campaign will cost
around four million dollars over the
next three years
you see the New Zealand government is
willing to spend this kind of money for
its heart-broken youths
the question is will other countries
follow suit
and as I end the show tonight I want to
talk about a particular word
in fact it's no ordinary word it is
known as the most overused word
so there is a high chance that you have
already heard of it the word is vibe
and if in case you haven't heard of it
here's a quick crash course
in the earlier times if you mentioned
the word Vibe it was probably to refer
to a vibraphone the percussion
instrument
and from then to now the word has come a
long way
it has made its presence felt in more
ways than one
it has made its way to headlines
it has been used to describe the
economic downturn as well
it is increasingly used to describe the
mood of the area that you're in as well
even Google swears by it this piece
about its Maps feature mentions how you
can get a quote-unquote wipe check about
a particular area
basically there is no escaping this word
it's all around us it can be used to
describe the atmosphere of a place the
weather the mood the energy of an area
even an outfit
so the word Dawns many hats
and to put it simply it could mean
vibrations
do you just sense it when the energy of
a place is not quite right or you don't
get the energy that you want from a
particular person
basically something just feels off
so what's the white check then
well the wipe is off
and that brings me to my next point that
this obsession with intangible
vibrations is as old as time
you have probably heard of the Chinese
concept of chi
or the life force of living things
there is also something called negative
Chi it is similar to what we call bad
whites
ancient Greek philosopher scientists had
come up with the idea of a so-called
fifth element that made the world work
the auras the fields of energy around
people
you know what I mean
but I do want to wrap this show by
sending you good whites a lot of good
energy
since it is the most overused word
already no harm in using it one more
time
on that note it's a wrap on this edition
of Gravitas tonight we're leaving you
with gravitas images thanks very much
for watching

During this period, the community ...",2023-03-22T08:00:32Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W0iFIXHbdDM/hqdefault.jpg,"[Music]
dusk has arrived the sharbat is being
cooled with one more plank of ice the
soft kebabs are getting one more shade
of Sizzle this is iftar time in India's
capital New Delhi
this is beyond special ramzan episode of
world of food and this episode we gave
you some of the signature dishes from
the old Lanes of delhi's drama Masjid
area also known as a very own purani
Delhi and if you're wondering what makes
ramzan food so very special is the
evening meal called iftar at this time
we have got you covered
ramzan is one of the holiest months in
the Islamic calendar when Muslims fast
as a way to commemorate the revelation
of the Quran
meals are opportunities for Muslims to
gather with others in the community and
break their fast together
pre-dawn breakfast known as suhur or
saheri usually occurs at 4am that is
before the first prayer of the day Fajr
the evening meal iftar can begin once
the sunset prayer Maghrib is finished
normally around 7 30 pm
[Music]
water and that is why Muslims eat dates
both at suhur and iftar
a staple of the West Asia dates are rich
in nutrients easy to digest and provide
the body with sugar after a long day of
fasting
normally along with dates people also
consume shut birth or squash
for a lot of people that's ruavsa a
glass of chill rubs are milk sharbat is
a staple of Ramadan
this shop in Matia Mahal has been
selling shalbas for Generations
this refreshing drink which is called
mohabbat kasharbat is prepared by mixing
milk water and rufza and topped with
chunks of watermelon
[Music]
one type of this flavored drink and you
exactly know why it's called mohabbat
squash of love
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
since iftar and suhur help sustain the
fast of the following day consuming the
right food is important
since the fruits are rich in fiber and
contain lots of fluid they are an
essential part of the meal after long
hours of fasting
now we come to kebabs one of the regular
items in iftar food
there are a lot of Kebab shops in Old
Delhi that serve more than six different
varieties of Kebabs
the best way to eat this is to bite
straight into the
cupboard juiciness of the kebabs in your
mouth
melt and mouth mutton kebabs owe their
softness to hours of pounding by hand
and the right kind of marinating
Fried Chicken is one of the very few
non-vegetarian items which locals serves
from restaurants
like many other food joints in this part
of the city the kitchen spills out on
the road
for the main course it could be anything
from mutton stew to kaliji guruda to
Karai chicken mutton korma and also the
irresistible biryani
and if you want to find all these
Delicacies at one place then this is the
restaurant for you
interestingly this restaurant was
inaugurated by the first prime minister
of India
and that is why this restaurant has been
named after him
and once you've had the savories and
snacks it's time for some sweets
firni ice cream almond milk the sweet
shops in this area offer centuries-old
recipes of delectable sweets
after the last day of Ramadan Muslims
Mark its end with Eid UL fitra the
Festival of breaking the first
food is something that brings all of us
together so this ramzan enjoy fasting
and feasting with your loved ones

YouTube a video platform that most of us

we say beware of what you watch on

hackers are using YouTube videos to
steal user information
miscreants are using artificial
intelligence to create videos that
appear to offer legitimate tutorials the
videos have good voice overs and
professional looking graphics
they feature humans which make them
appear more familiar and trustworthy but
here's something to worry about these
videos have information that's too
tempting to ignore for instance
sometimes users are made to believe that
they can download premium and expensive
software for free
the purpose of these videos is to trick
viewers into clicking malicious links
these videos redirect people to fake
websites to download certain software
and believe it or not users are falling
for it once the malicious software is
installed on the system hackers get
access to the user's personal
information and other sensitive data
such as passwords credit card
information bank account number and
other confidential data

intelligence company cloudsec since
November 2022 there has been 300 percent

NX-YaizFniw,Indian startups have deposits worth $1 bn in SVB | Tech It Out,The US-based Silicon Valley Bank was known for funding technology startups around the world and its meltdown has left tech ...,2023-03-18T05:30:04Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NX-YaizFniw/hqdefault.jpg,"the us-based Silicon Valley Bank was
known for funding technology startups
around the world and its meltdown has
left Tech entrepreneurs worried even
several Indian startups are affected by
this crisis we get you more details in
our next story
over the weekend two Banks fail
[Music]
you know it's just scary for the world I
guess but I I anticipate there'll be a
lot of moving money into the bigger
Banks
be worried sir
everyone should be worried
the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank
America's 16th largest Commercial Bank
has rattled the technology industry the
dramatic failure of the bank which
focuses on startups is the biggest since
the 2008 financial crisis
note that Silicon Valley Bank dealt with
high growth and high-risk businesses
such as technology startups therefore it
was a popular bank among Tech startups
the event has left a host of global
technology startups in a tight spot
including the ones in India
let's understand how Silicon Valley
Bank's demise has affected the Indian
startups
India has one of the world's biggest
startup markets many startups are
clocking multi-billion dollar valuations
they are getting the backing of foreign
investors who have made bold bets on
digital and other Tech businesses what's
important to note here is that Silicon
Valley Bank was the preferred place for
many Indian startups to park their funds
it's common that many Indian startups
choose to be incorporated in the United
States
this makes it easier for them to access
capital from Global Venture Capital
firms and now svb's failure is
unsettling Indian entrepreneurs
for many early stage startups their svb
accounts are holding the investment
raised by them India's state Minister
for technology Rajiv chandrasekhar says
Indian startups have deposits worth
about 1 billion dollars with embattled
Silicon Valley Bank
the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has
also put the focus on why
combinator-backed Indian startups why
combinator is a us-based technology
startup accelerator it has invested in
thousands of startups 200 of them are
Indian
they are feeling the heat of the Silicon
Valley Bank collapse they have a reason
to worry about the availability of
liquidity for their immediate needs VCS
are cautious about divulging the names
of the impacted startups
they fear that it might impede the young
firm's prospects of racing capital in
the future there is more some Indian
firms couldn't timely pull their
deposits from Silicon Valley Bank
because they didn't have another U.S
bank account readily available to hold
that Capital most people assume I think
that if they put money into a bank that
money is going to be there especially
for a business I mean as depositors you
know there should be better mechanisms
to ensure that our deposits are safe and
to be clear like I'm not an expert in
this field but it just seems like this
is not a great way to do like having to
divide your money among four or five
banks just so it doesn't disappear one
day
crazy I mean how do you like that should
not be something we have to think about
like there should be better ways foreign
The Fallout of svb's collapse could be
far-reaching some startups have only
limited money in their Indian bank
accounts they could only run operations
for two to three months with that money
as a result they might find it hard to
pay their employees in the coming months
Venture Capital firms may not be able to
raise funds which means a lot of venture
capital investment coming into India
would also slow down
lending to startups would get severely
restricted as a result they will have to
delay processes downsize or shut down
the entire episode could force startups
to adopt severe cost-cutting measures
such as job Cuts or hiring freezes
we will continue to track how the
situation unfolds in the coming weeks
but there is a pertinent question that
we need to ask is the Silicon Valley
Bank collapse a wake-up call for
startups to domicile in India

people are good with technology after
all they have grown up in a digital
world but that's not entirely true it's
been found that young people are
struggling with various Technologies at
their workplace sounds strange we will
tell you more about it in our next story
[Music]
many youngsters simply shot the laptop's
lid when they are done with their work
but at times the tech friendly gen Z has
no idea about how to switch on a desktop
computer some of them even struggle to
find the power button
isn't it a little surprising after all
this generation is expected to be quite
tech savvy in a world where technology
is an intrinsic part of our Lives the
Gen Z is largely app friendly but they
struggle with the basic office tools
like office scanner printer webcam or
even audio settings of a PC and that can
be embarrassing there's even a term for
this Tech shame it's described as the
feeling of embarrassment inadequacy and
being judged for a lack of knowledge
when encountering technical issues the
term Tech shame was coined by the
computer giant HP to define the
difficulties faced by the younger
generation in using basic office tools
according to a survey conducted by HP
when it comes to handling the tech
related issues at work young people are
10 times more likely to feel shame than
their older colleagues one in five Young
office workers report that they feel
judged for having Tech issues this makes
them less likely to ask for help
according to another survey conducted by
Dell 56 of the people in the age group
of 18 to 26 feel that they lack the
necessary digital skills required to
prepare their careers what they know
comes from the apps they use when they
have time
clearly gen Z is facing workplace Tech
shame especially when they have certain
types of technological New Hope and when
they can navigate the depths of the
internet
but here's an important question how
would they know how to operate certain
devices when they have never been taught
to do so it's true that they can edit
photos and produce videos in their
mobile applications in a minute because
it's easy to learn how to use apps like
Instagram or Tick Tock you don't need an
instruction book to run an app like
you'd require for operating a printer
the Gen Z is used to Printing and
scanning documents with the touch of a
button after all quick to use functions
have been designed to speed up the
process on the contrary many workplace
systems still rely on Old gadgets
shaming your colleagues around Tech
difficulties is not cool as it has a
sense of public humiliation that leaves
employees feeling judged by their peers
so it becomes important to bridge the
generation gap with technology at the
workplace and this is where training
comes in
employers should show all employees not
just the young ones how to efficiently
collaborate and use the in-house devices
and software understand that younger
people seem more willing to learn they
can quickly adapt to new skills even if
it takes a few rounds of the scanner to
fully Master the art of scanning also
open communication is important so check
in with employees regularly to ensure
that they are getting the tech support
they need it's wrong to assume that just
because younger workers are in their 20s
they would know how every technology
used in office works it's at the
diversity of experiences is a strength
and approaching each other with
generosity is the key to a harmonious
and Equitable workplace

the concept has dragged on for over a

significant part both strategically as
well as symbolically
and we tell you why the claims and
counter claims over bhagmud are a

concerned we also tell you how Russia is
now deploying its most deadly weapons
as it strikes the Ukrainian Capital with

also on the show for you tonight
who blew up the north stream pipelines
we tell you more about the sabotage that

fingers are being pointed at a

with a focus on India we tell you what
that is all about
also coming up for you a former Pakistan
spy Chief is now under the scanner he is
being investigated for alleged
corruption we get to the complete story
along with the heated war of words
triggered by the developments in the
country
what time is it on the moon you heard me
right the moon could soon get its own
time zone we tell you what's brewing as
the Space Race heats up
also coming up scientists have created
motherless mice in a major breakthrough
that could change the way we look at
human reproduction will motherless
humans be next we tell you
the Ukraine war has reached yet another
Do or Die stage the fall of bakmuth
could change the script
Revitalize the stalled Russian offensive
and deliver what Moscow hopes will be a
knockout blow
Russia is deploying its most deadly
weapons
the deadliest is the Hypersonic missile
Next Generation arms are now being used
earlier today Kiev was hit by Hypersonic
missiles not one not two but at least
six of them
the missile attacks took place across a
period of almost seven hours
the missiles also hit kharkave and
Odessa at least nine people lost their
lives
now this is the first time Russia has
used so many of these Hypersonic
missiles in Ukraine
they are called daggers hyper lethal
daggers and what do we know about them
they can travel at an astonishing 8 000
miles per hour
I'm talking about 10 times the speed of
sound these missiles are normally
carried by
mig-31k Fighters and they can hit
targets as far away as
1250 miles
in fact these missiles are hard to track
using on ground radar and that is partly
because of their exceptionally high
speeds
Ukraine does not have the capability to
intercept these missiles
and you know what
they can carry nuclear warheads Russia
has previously admitted firing these
missiles into Ukraine but the numbers
have gone up
and not everybody is surprised
let me answer that with a question
your opposition becomes powerful your
army loses the upper hand and your
people become more vulnerable
Ukraine never really had the claim to an
upper hand in the war
but Ukraine's strongholds are crumbling
now it's Fortress City Bak moth appears
to be falling
this is not my assessment
why don't you listen in to the NATO's
Secretary General
who is Ukraine's closest Ally
we can not rule out that
um
may eventually fall in the coming days
has this emboldened Russia
after all the fall of bakmud is expected
to trigger a domino effect and no one
knows this better than Ukraine's
president zelensky
in fact zelenski was recently speaking
to an American Media Outlet he said and
I'm quoting we understand that after
bakmud they could go further they could
go to chromatosk they could go to
sloviansk it would open the road for the
Russians after bhagmud to other towns in
Ukraine in the donesque direction
and zelenski's assessment is bang on
let's just mark it out on a map
the places he just mentioned and this is
where bakmut is located a city of
immense strategic importance
the control of bakmuth gives Russia the
road to 40 into the entire region after
bhagmud can Kiev be far behind
the road as zelensky says will open up
and it is a rather uncomfortable
question one that the West will try to
dodge at all counts
why don't we play out stortenberg's
remaining sound bite
we can not rule out that uh
may eventually fall in the coming days
and therefore it is also important to
highlight that this does
not necessarily
reflect any turning point of the war and
and
it just highlights that we should not
underestimate Russia
well too late I would say because the
Russian private Army the Wagner group
already claims control of Eastern Box
moves
if Wagner is to be believed a part of
the fort is already in Russia's control
group resumes have taken the whole of
Eastern bhagmud everything east of
bhagmatka river is fully controlled by
Wagner group this can be reported
but you see Ukraine is clinging on to
the rest
the battle for bakmut has been going on
for seven months now
this is an industrial town with salt
factories and a population of around 70
000 people
today bakbooth looks nothing like it
used to
today it is a ghost town
and those who have stayed back are
living in underground shelters
zelenski says Ukraine will fight till
the end to keep buckmouth
Direction the situation is constantly
becoming more difficult the enemy is
constantly destroying everything that
can be used to protect our positions for
fortification and defense our soldiers
defending in the Baku direction are
reared Heroes
now could this have a connect to the
Hypersonic missile strikes
some analysts believe Russia dipping
into its stock of next-gen weapons is a
sign of desperation
the Russian President Vladimir Putin
could be using Hypersonic missiles to
terrorize the population and to force
Ukraine to withdraw troops from bakmut
in fact yesterday Ukraine's Army
commander of the ground forces visited
Mahmud he awarded military honors to the
soldiers for holding the fort
all enemies will be destroyed and the
Victory will be achieved glory to you
and to Buck Moon because they are now in
the hottest spot there is no hotter side
today
that's why I will award you today we
will award you crosses for bravery
courage and heroism
the battle for bakmuth is
n't changed the fate of this war
in the meanwhile the use of next gen
arms could become The New Normal Paving
the way for weapons even more deadly
you see that is the logic of War
deaths multiplied
and as the battle for buck boots rages a
question is buzzing across Europe
a question that concerns the continent's
energy security
who blew up the north stream Pipelines
was it the Russians or the Americans
this have been an ongoing debate for
quite some time now we have been telling
you about this both the sides accusing
each other of sabotage Washington saying
the Russians did it Moscow says the
Americans did it
five months and countless probes later
the mystery remains unresolved
and now a new report has surfaced it has
added another twist to this Saga
it says the pipelines were damaged by a
pro-ukrainian group
a pro-ukrainian group this assessment is
based on intelligence received by U.S
officials
and what is the source of this
intelligence and which group does it
really refer to
this the Americans did not answer
all they see is that the perpetrators
were opponents of the Russian president
I'll get there in a bit
first let me show you what I'm talking
about
this pair of underwater gas pipelines
they run under the Baltic Sea connecting
Russia to Germany
these are the north stream Pipelines
in September last year they were damaged
in a mysterious explosion the blast
released vast quantities of gas into the
Baltic Sea and rendered three of the
four lines inoperable
and five months on the North stream
project has in a sense come to a
standstill as the blame game continues
Now American officials have intensified
it further with the help of some media
networks in Europe
let me break down their claims for you
they are based on what U.S officials are
seeing and some reports published in the
German media
to start with the Intel says that the
perpetrators were probably Ukrainian or
Russian Nationals
it further adds that none of them were
from the United States or Britain
the group was apparently made up of five
men and a woman they were using
professionally falsified passports and
other documents
German officials have identified the
yacht suspected to have been used in the
attack and this yacht was apparently
rented out by a company based in Poland
the group launched their operation from
the north German port of rostock they
then returned the vessel back to its
owner uncleaned because of this the
investigators were able to find traces
of explosives inside it
let me repeat here these are claims made
by U.S officials and some German media
organizations
so you've got to view them with caution
for all you know America could be trying
to shift blame for its own wrongdoing
again I am not the one saying this
Western media reports are some of you
may remember this one it was released by
semor Hirsch a Pulitzer prize-winning
American journalist
in this report Hesh claimed that America
hatched The Plot to Bomb the energy
Pipelines
he said the entire operation was led by
Jake Sullivan Biden's National Security
advisor
besides him there were also officials
from the CIA U.S state Department
officials and The Joint Chiefs of Staff
it was a highly secretive mission
the U.S refuted these allegations but
its response right after the blast only
adds to our doubts about its role and I
say this because the U.S reaction was
celebratory
here's what the U.S state Secretary
Anthony blinken had said back then let
me quote it is a tremendous opportunity
to once and for all remove the
dependence on Russian energy
and thus to take away from Vladimir
Putin the weaponization of energy as a
means of advancing his Imperial designs
why would he say such a thing why would
he celebrate the destruction of Europe's
lifeline
did Lincoln indirectly confessed to
America's role in this sabotage
well it only gets murkier
the deeper you dig
and now all of a sudden America tries to
shift the blame to Ukraine itself but
offers no firm conclusions about its
claims
what does Kiev have to say about this
has it responded to this assessment made
by its Ally
yes it has
a look at this tweet it's from makailo
for the luck
he is Ukraine's presidential advisor he
has called the report an amusing
conspiracy theory
strongly rejecting the claim that
Ukraine had anything to do with it even
the chief of NATO has echoed these
remarks saying it would be wrong to
speculate anything in this case before
the investigation is completed
and besides them authorities in Germany
Sweden and Denmark have also made
similar statements they say they will
not comment until the ongoing
investigations are concluded
why then is America in such a hurry
why are American officials so worried
and if they are making such wild
allegations why can't they offer
evidence to back them up
like who is providing them with such
Intel which group was behind the
sabotage what were their intentions who
were they working for these are
questions America must answer the next
time it decides to pass the blame onto
others
on to some good news for India's tech
industry
Apple plans to focus more on India
it has decided to redesignate the
country as an individual Market
and what does that mean
let me break it down according to a
report by Bloomberg India is becoming
its own sales region at Apple
earlier it was clubbed with West Asia
Mediterranean east Europe and Africa
This spells good news for India
it's a first such change for the country
in Apple's hierarchy and why not
after all India has emerged as a really
bright spot for Apple
the tech giant reported record Revenue
last quarter
let's look at some figures here in the
financial year
2021-22 its country Revenue Rose 45 to
nearly 4.69 billion dollars it's net
profit Rose three percent to around 150
million dollars
on top of the Indian club Apple breaks
out four other regions they are the
America's greater China Japan and the
rest of Asia Pacific
and this is how Apple's Revenue breakup
looked like last fiscal year The company
generated
169.7 billion dollars in Americas
95.1 billion dollars in India West Asia
Mediterranean east Europe and Africa
74.2 billion dollars in Greater China
26 billion dollars in Japan
and 29.4 billion dollars in the rest of
Asia Pacific
you see apple Executives have been
impressed with India's performance they
have lauded India's double-digit
year-over-year growth
demand for Apple products searched now
the company plans to reshuffle the
Global Management teams
the Vice President in charge of the
Indian region recently retired his shoes
will be filled by Ashish Chaudhary the
head of India after promotion Chaudhary
will report directly to Apple's head of
product sales Michael finger
let's look at Apple's hierarchy for more
clarity here Apple's sales and
International Teams are split between
vice president Fenger and another vice
president Doug Beck
Fenger overseas Hardware services and
Enterprise sales globally while Beck is
in charge of the health education and
government segments
both the executives report to Chief Tim
Cook
but recently there has been a search in
Executives leaving Apple asaman's
departure being the latest
vice president in charge of subscription
Services stepped down earlier this year
the cloud Chief planning to leave next
month last year top Executives in charge
of industrial design procurement parts
of software and Hardware engineering
Privacy Information Systems and the
online store all announced their exits
apart from being a sales engine for
Apple India is also becoming vital to
the company's product development
key suppliers are relocating to the
region
Horn high Precision industry company
also known as Foxconn is a key example
it is a major manufacturer of iPhone
components
Foxconn will reportedly invest around
700 million dollars it plans to build a
new 300 acre plant in India's Tech Hub
Bengaluru
this comes as Apple suppliers race to
exit China
the investment is one of foxconn's
biggest single outlays in India to date
and will this put china at risk could
China lose its status as the world's
largest producer of consumer electronics
Apple Chief Tim Cook compared Apple's
performance in India to its yearly to
its early years in China
in fact China currently generates
roughly 75 billion dollars annually for
Apple it is the company's biggest sales
region after the Americas and Europe
in January India cleared more than a
dozen of Apple's Chinese suppliers to
expand in the country
the government made it abundantly clear
the Chinese firms would not be allowed
to set up completely owned entities they
will have to form joint ventures with
the Indian companies to set up their
facilities
and this could boost India's local value
Edition in iPhone manufacturing it is a
measure of enhancing and imported goods
value
according to experts it is currently
around 18 for iPhones in India
but with the partners coming in it could
likely go up to 50 percent
meanwhile a landmark defense agreement
is on the cards
ask for an exclusive by Reuters
Australia plans to buy up to five U.S
virginia-class nuclear-powered
submarines Under The orcus Pact at least
one of them will visit Australian ports
in the coming years
the rest are expected in the 2030s
the question is if this deal is nub to
the UK
because Australia was expected to buy
British astute-class submarines and now
it has gone forward with the American
Rivals
let me first tell you more about the
Virginia class submarines
they are Advanced stealth multi-mission
models they are designed for deep ocean
anti-submarine Warfare they can also
carry out shallow water operations
the submarines are fitted with 12
vertical launch system tubes they can
launch 16 Tomahawk cruise missiles these
missiles have a range of 1 and 700
kilometers
but most importantly they can carry
nuclear-armed cruise missiles
which means the conventionally armed
boats now have a nuclear deterrence role
they can be used for Special Operations
and intelligence gathering
it is the first U.S submarine to employ
a built-in Navy SEAL staging area which
means a team of nine men can enter and
leave the submarine at one time
the Australian prime minister Anthony
albanizi is due to meet the U.S
President Joe Biden and the UK prime
minister Rishi sanak this meeting will
be taking place in San Diego on Monday
the leaders are expected to reveal
August's next steps
but what is interesting is the timing of
this meeting
Albanese is currently on a four day trip
to India this is his first visit to the
court partner in his current role
earlier today he attended a cricket test
match between Australia and India with
Narendra Modi he also participated in
the Holy celebrations
listening to what he had to say
whatever the future holds I know that
Australia's Indian origin Community is
and will continue to be a crucial
partner in the way that our two
countries can move forward together move
forward together with stronger economic
ties move forward with stronger cultural
ties move forward together with our
common need for security in the
indo-pacific region
but what really does albanese's trip to
India really mean
is it simply a consolation for the
upcoming August meeting
you see India Australia and the US are
core Partners while court is not a
military partnership it is seen as a
block to counter Chinese hostilities
but in 2021 Australia and the US went
ahead and formed August
and now an August meet is on the cards
Albanese is in India just ahead of the
meeting is Australia trying to be on
India's good side before it signs up for
American submarines
is the cause relevance under question
and what about Australia's orcas partner
the UK
both American and British
nuclear-powered submarines were on the
table Australia seems to have taken its
pick but Reports say it is expected to
strike a deal with the UK that the U.S
submarines are simply a stop Gap that
Australia and the UK are actually
designing Next Generation submarines
from the existing astute class vessel
however they face two hurdles number one
being the expected delivery time the
British submarines will not be ready
till the 2040s number two being quality
have a look at this article from the
times it highlights former Minister of
Defense Peter duton's claims duton said
that the astute design had faults and
the project would likely run over its
budget
he also said that it was obvious that
the U.S submarines were a better choice
just how accurate were duton's claims
not much according to Downing Street
the UK prime minister's office asserted
that British submarines are the world's
finest
so how will it react to the U.S getting
the first order
and what does this mean for August
next week's meeting will provide more
clarity perhaps
our next story is from Pakistan and it
concerns lesson General FES hamids
the former Chief of inter-services
intelligence the isi
is he about to get caught marshaled
I asked this question because the
Pakistan government is tightening the
news around him
probing his actions as the spices
I'll begin with this report pmln's
senior vice president Maryam Nawaz has
called for the court martial office
Hamid accusing him of conspiring to
topple her father's government and
backing Imran Khan's government for four
years
she said this in an interview to a
Pakistani news channel
let me quote
I knocked on the Court's door against
General Fair Summit when he was the head
of the isi I submitted the entire
evidence along with the petition in the
court the major evidence was the former
General's visit to the house of
Islamabad High courts former judge
Aziz and asked him to punish Nawaz
Sharif and Maryam Nawaz and not approve
their bill
and immediately after these remarks
another statement was issued This Time
by Rana sanola the interior minister of
Pakistan
after recent press conference he
apparently told reporters that a probe
was underway against the former isi boss
and his brother over alleged corruption
sanola mentioned only the brother
but Dawn says that even fairs Hamid is
being proved
so what sort of corruption was he
talking about
well besides trying to influence the
judges they have also been accused of
accumulating assets beyond means and
this has triggered a huge debate
opponents of the current government
saying that such probes into assets are
the domain of the fia the federal
investigation agency of Pakistan Rana
sanola does not agree
as for the court marshall it is the
domain of the General headquarters of
the Pakistan Army
it does not even fall within the
jurisdiction of the Civil Authorities
so how can a political leader get a
former Army official court-martialed
well the interior Minister says
politicians are free to express their
point of view and leave it to the Army
to decide
now remember Fair Summit was said to be
close to Imran Khan in fact there was a
time when Imran Khan fought to make him
stay on the post of the isi chief
so in a way the pmln is trying to Target
Imran Khan by getting fairs Hamid in the
dock the question is what is Imran Khan
doing about all of this
well he too is Seeking a court martial
not of fair Summit but of Kamar bajwa
the former Army chief of Pakistan
in a recent interview he called for an
internal military inquiry against bajwa
for his alleged admission about being
involved in the PTI government's ouster
let me go to his exact statement the
pmln PDM and the establishment are all
standing on one side the altogether
removed our government and general bajwa
has admitted to the regime change since
he has given his statement to a
journalist
about for what reasons the government
was removed
and what exactly was he talking about
General bajwa's remarks in a recent
column where he apparently called the
PTI dangerous for Pakistan Imran Khan
says this is an admission of culpability
and this is why he is pushing for an
inquiry against bajwa
so at the end of the day it has become a
battle of Court martial versus quote
Marshall on one hand you have Maryam
Nawaz pushing for a court martial
Affairs Hamid a friend of Imran Khan on
the other you have Imran Khan pushing
for the court martial of General bajwa a
man he says helped the pmln
my question is do they have nothing else
to worry about
Pakistan's economy is on the death bed
the people do not have money to buy food
but the politicians are busy settling
political scores
we can only sympathize with the people
of Pakistan
shifting Focus for now protests continue
in the capital of Georgia for the Second
Street day
hundreds of thousands took the streets
against the controversial foreign agents
law
holding EU and Georgian Flags
demonstrators gathered in front of the
parliament which has approved the draft
law on foreign agents protesters say the
draft law is reminiscent of Russian
legislation used to Silence the Critics
there was violence and arson on the
streets of the capital the police had to
use water cannon and tear gas to
disperse the demonstrators around the
Parliament building police and
protesters clashed over 70 demonstrators
have now been detained
our next report getting you the complete
story
for the second straight day thousands of
people staged large-scale protests into
Blissey Georgia on Wednesday
some protests were violent their
rallying against pending legislation
dubbed the foreign agents law which
critics say signals an authoritarian
shift that harms Georgia's chances of
closer ties with Europe Georgia's
Parliament on Tuesday passed a first
reading of the legislation it requires
any organizations receiving more than 20
percent of their funding from overseas
to register as foreign agents will face
substantial fines the ruling Georgian
Dream party says it's modeled on U.S
legislation dating back from the 1930s
critics say it's reminiscent of a
Russian law that the Kremlin has used to
crack down on descent
noticing the Russian love I call it
Russian law I cannot call it any uh else
because it's completely rushing love
trolled imposed Upon Us by Russia we are
protesting against the Russian wallet
[Music]
in clashes on Tuesday evening protested
through Molotov cocktails and stones of
police who use tear gas and water cannon
to dispel the crowds the interior
Ministry said 66 people had been
detained protests continued on Wednesday
afternoon with a march to Mark
International women's day which is a
public holiday in Georgia or position
parties called for a second night of
mass protests outside Parliament the
issue has deepened a rift between George
and dream which leads the government and
has a majority in Parliament and the
country's president Salome zurabich
Villi a pro-european who's moved away
from the party since being elected with
its support in 2018. she's back the
protesters saying on Tuesday that
lawmakers who voted for the draft law
had violated the Constitution
let me now ask you a question what time
is it on the moon
have you ever imagined a clock on the
big white satellite
well space agencies are working to make
that dream come true
with tons of lunar missions headed for
the launch pad scientists will soon
create a lunar time zone of what we can
call Moon time
what is this all about our next report
tells you
Space Age lunar missions have operated
as per Earth's time zone
well because that's the only one that
exists but with several lunar
Explorations heading to the Moon space
agencies have deemed the current time
system unsustainable
why is that the answer in one word is
coordination
with several lunar missions heading out
from different countries it is crucial
to maintain streamlined contact among
different nations that is why agencies
have called for a universal timekeeping
system
which will also make it easier for
public and private entities to
coordinate trips to and around the Moon
you see under the present system the
spacecraft operator's time is used by
astronauts to determine what time it is
so will time on the moon be synchronized
with Earth's time
this is a tricky one because time on
Earth is tracked by atomic clocks but
clocks will run faster on the moon due
to its weaker gravitational pull
time will run 58 microseconds faster
each day
up until now Moon time is calculated on
a time scale exported from Earth deep
space antennas are used to keep
chronometers synchronized with
terrestrial time
although having the same time as on
Earth wouldn't be possible scientists
are working on a lunar time zone
which will suit the moon's atmosphere so
why is this even required just how much
traffic is the moon expecting just to
name a few
India is planning to launch the
chandrayana 3 mission which will carry a
landing module and a robotic Rover
next comes Russia which plans to launch
a mission that plans to put a probe and
gather samples from the moon's Southern
polar region
joining the league is U.S SpaceX which
plans to take nine passengers on the
deer Moon Voyage this will be the first
mission for the Starship vehicle
news of the Moon getting its own time
zone comes at a time when the space race
is only heating up especially the race
between Russia and the West Russia has
already threatened to end its Space
Program cooperation with the West over
sanctions imposed on Moscow
the US has also called space a war
fighting domain as strains in the U.S
China relationship make potential
conflict in space more probable
NASA has never given up on planning its
lunar missions so that it gets first
dibs on the precious Moon Metals but
China continues to plan its own share of
New Missions amid the space race and the
ongoing war in Ukraine
three two
companies such as SpaceX are
relentlessly trying to give people a
view of space
a live view of space
so what time is it on the moon right now
we shall find out soon enough
let me now ask you can you imagine
babies being born without mothers
it might sound like a silly question I
mean how is that even possible you might
wonder
well what I am about to say next sounds
like the plot of a sci-fi movie but it
is playing out in real life
it is Stranger Than Fiction but it's for
real
there has been a major breakthrough
scientists have created mice with two
fathers
you heard that right they are motherless
mice that have two fathers
how did that even happen what does it
mean like let me just break it down for
you one by one first things first this
breakthrough was presented at a
conference in London
katsuhiko Hayashi from Kyushu University
in Japan spoke about it at the third
international Summit on human genome
editing
it is a significant development
because the earlier attempts have not
been completely successful
you see five years ago 12 Mouse pups
were created after fertilizing eggs that
were derived from male cells
but they could not breathe properly and
they did not survive
but the mice created Now by scientists
are healthy
how exactly were they created
by converting male cells into eggs
basically a skin cell from a male mouse
was reprogrammed to convert it into a
stem cell
and as we learned in biology lessons
back at school
male cells have X Y chromosomes female
eggs have XX chromosomes
but this breakthrough involved devising
a method to do away with the Y
chromosome
and then replace it with an X chromosome
so that it could become an egg
and this is a huge milestone
you know what this means
let me just tell you about the possible
implications
gay men could have biological children
in the future
basically babies related to both the
parents
it also means that a kind of infertility
in women could now be cured
the Turner syndrome for example it
happens due to abnormalities related to
chromosomes
and this breakthrough could change the
way we look at human reproduction
mice as of now and will humans be next
is the immediate question
after motherless mice will we soon see
motherless children
you see human cells need more time to
generate a mature egg
which also means that there is a greater
risk of the cells having unwanted
genetic changes
in fact according to a report kasuhiko
Hayashi has said that they now want to
look into using this technique for human
cells
but as of now there are hurdles on that
path even if it was proved to be safe
and was considered ethical when it comes
to application in humans
Hayashi in fact said that this is not a
question just for the scientific program
but also for the society what do you
think about this let us know
let us now tell you what else made news
around the world time for gravitas

of colors in some cases the celebrations
went beyond the Hindu community
I'm A working woman so I went to the

of coming to brindavan for Holy whoa
what makes the celebrations here even
more special Is the participation of
revelers from all over the world it was
quite a sight seeing them soaking
themselves in the festive Spirit we are
outside of the monkey bihari temple in
Brenda van on the main day of the Holy
celebrations in the area in other areas
of India whole is also celebrated but
not with the same fervor as in the brush
area of uttar Pradesh where holy
celebrations can stretch for many more
days than anywhere else in the country
in mathura is certainly an experience
for a lifetime not just because of the
riot of colors but also the bond it
shows between people we feel blessed to
have experienced it viewer report we on
wireless one
how did it all start
and why do people around the world play
Holy our next report gets you the story
of the Festival of Colors
[Music]
in India Holi marks the end of winter
and the onset of spring
it has been celebrated in the Indian
subcontinent for centuries
poems and epics documented dating back
to the 4th Century A.D
today Holi is celebrated with colors
water balloons and water guns popularly
known as pichkaris
the two day long Festival has a rich
history
on the first day devotees worship prahar
an incarnation of Hindu god Brahma
they participate in Holika Dahan and
gather around a huge bonfire
why do they do that to Mark the victory
of good over evil to celebrate the
defeat of demons Holika let's understand
the story behind this
according to the lore there was a demon
king named hiranyakashim he was granted
five Magical Wishes by Hindu god Shiva
the demon let it get the best of him he
ordered everyone to worship him but his
own son prahlad denied that
he continued to worship Lord Vishnu
hiranyakashev's ego was hurt he got
Furious and ordered his demon sister
Holika to kill prahad
but how the demoness was immune to fire
a fire was lit and polica sat on it
tricked prahlad into sitting on her lap
but to everyone's surprise Holika was
burnt down to ashes while prahad came
out of the fire unscathed
it are his father hiranyakashyap also
got slayed by Lord Vishnu
to this day devotees burn a fire on holy
marking the victory of good over evil
festivities extend to the next day it's
called the rangwali Holi or dulendi
Indians shower each other with vibrant
colored powders called gulal and water
the day also marks Lord krishna's
eternal love for Radha
in Hindu mythology Krishna is believed
to have a dark complexion
self-conscious about his skin Little
Krishna confided in her mother asking
for advice
his mother yashoda said Radha would like
him as he is she suggested that he color
himself and Radha in whatever Hue he
wanted
Krishna playfully colored radha's skin
as his own and professed his love for
her
since then the color fight is celebrated
to commemorate Radha and krishna's
eternal love
the festivities are especially joyous in
the mathura city of uttar Pradesh which
is Lord krishna's birthplace
holy celebrated across the world
Festival is all about spreading love and
happiness
people dance to upbeat music they eat
Indian Delicacies such as kujia and Bhai
bhalas
with beverages like tandai becoming a
staple
Bureau report world is one
and from the past let's now turn to the
present
the Festival of holy does not just unite
India it also adds color to India's soft
power
be it the surge in tourism around this
festival or the celebrations at
diplomatic missions in India or the
festivities that are held around the
world year after year
Holi has played a huge role in shaping
brand India
so much so that for many the word India
has become synonymous with colors here's
a special report
can you imagine America without hot dogs
or France without Louis Vuitton or
Chanel
it's the same with India and Holi
[Music]
a festival that conveys India's values
both domestically and globally
[Music]
the festival that has played a huge role
in shaping brand India
Holi has given India a kind of
Romanticism which other nations lack
this has helped not just in boosting
tourism but also transforming India's
Global image
look around you every year around this
time foreign tourists throng Indian
cities soaking in the festive spirit
dancing to the tunes of traditional
music
[Music]
capturing the memories on their cameras
in the national capital there are
celebrations at embassies with diplomats
reveling in the festive spirit this year
the U.S Commerce Secretary is in New
Delhi she celebrated the festival with
India's defense minister rajnath Singh
they smeared each other with colors
dancing to the tunes of drums
happy Holi to everyone it's a great
honor for me to be here I want to thank
the minister for hosting me
and this is my first time and I'm very
excited to be part of it
there were also celebrations at the
American Embassy in India
[Music]
The Nepalese Embassy in India joined in
two
[Music]
as did the Swedish Embassy the Korean
Embassy and the embassy of Colombia
[Music]
along with various Indian diplomatic
missions abroad our point is simple
thanks to Holy Indian culture has
reached different parts of the world
it's not just the food the Taj or Indian
films people also associate India with
vibrant colors this has helped create a
national brand a brand that helps India
stand out in the international sphere
a brand that will play an important role
in helping India achieve its mission
[Music]
and today marks one more occasion
it is international women's day the day
is celebrated on the 8th of March every
year and while I wish you a very happy
women's day I also want to take a few
minutes to reflect on the very purpose
of this day
it is a day dedicated to celebrating
women raising awareness around women's
issues talking about the achievements
looking at how far we have come but also
looking at the hurdles that lie ahead
the destination is gender equity in fact
Embrace Equity is the theme for this
year's International women's day
the need for inclusivity how equal
opportunities are not enough you see
equality means people are given the same
resources or opportunities Equity
recognizes that each person has
different circumstances
it is about giving the resources and
opportunities needed to reach an equal
outcome
but these terms sound like a cruel joke
for many women around the world
take the women in Afghanistan for
example what's there to celebrate
the snatching away of basic rights the
Taliban series of dictats
let me ask you what does the word
freedom mean to you
to be able to do what you feel like when
you feel like to go where you want to to
make independent decisions
well it could mean different things to
different people but for Afghan women
the world is no longer a part of their
dictionary they have forgotten what it's
like to be free to be able to study to
be able to take a walk in a park they
used to be able to do that once upon a
time
can you imagine these are women of
Afghanistan
but these are now only hazy memories
Taliban 2.0 has taken Afghan women back
in time not to the Glorious times but to
the Afghanistan under the previous
Taliban rule
Taliban 2.2 is no different from the
earlier Taliban the promises that were
made sounded great
but they have all been broken one by one
women have been banned from educational
institutions they can no longer go to
the gyms or amusement parks they have
been barred from working in ngos the
list goes on
in Iran women have been taken to the
streets against the regime even the
country's youngest schoolgirls have been
taking on the countries on the country's
mightiest
but why just Afghanistan and Iran in the
United States women have been fighting
for the basic right to their own bodies
it is the 21st century why should women
still have to fight for basic abortion
rights
while there is a lot to celebrate and we
have come a long way there is also a lot
more that needs to be done and here's
hoping for a time in the near future
when we don't need a women's day at all
when we don't have to imagine a world
with a Level Playing Field and actually
get to live in one
when every day is truly women's day
[Music]
and with that it's a wrap thank you very
much for watching this special holy
edition of Gravitas we're leaving you
with gravitas images and here's wishing
you all once again a very happy Holi
[Music]

entering the UK as well speaking at the
House of Commons Home Secretary Suella
brevilleman meant no words when she
announced the illegal immigration Bill
and said I'm quoting here you will be
detained and swiftly removed before
talking about the new law let's just
listen into her remarks first
thank you
they will not stop coming here until the
world knows that if you enter Britain
illegally you will be detained and

to stop the UK from being quote unquote
taken for a ride and said that the needs
stop for reform is urgent it is to be
noted that Britain receives fewer Asylum
Seekers than some European nations such
as Italy Germany or France
the boats
Mr Speaker this bill enables Detention
of illegal arrivals without bail or
judicial review within the first 28 days
of detention until they can be removed
it puts a duty on the Home Secretary to
remove illegal entrance and will
radically narrow the number of
challenges and appeals that can suspend
removal
only those under 18 medically unfit to
fly or at a real risk of serious and
irreversible harm and exceedingly High
bar in the country we are removing them
to will be able to delay their removal
any other claims will be heard remotely

what the country needs a serious action
to stop dangerous Boat Crossings which

admitted Rwanda is failing and even if
it gets going it will only take a few
hundred people so what will happen to
the other 99 of people under this bill

how many detention centers they will
need and how much that will cost

thank you
what does a country take pride in
honoring its founder celebrating its
Armed Forces
but what if your mismanagement does not
let you do that what if your country is
worsening Crisis makes you insult your
founder
that is what's happening in Pakistan the
country is neck deep in an economic mess
that it is unable to get out of plus the
political instability is not helping
you know what these crises have forced
the country to do
it has canceled its military parade
which was to be held on its national day
as it continues to face Rising political
instability and a worsening economic
crisis
the Pakistan Visa reads the efforts of
the country's founder Muhammad Ali
Jinnah it commemorates the 1940 Lahore
resolution is Pakistan insulting its
founder Jinnah is it insulting the
father of the nation has jinnah's dream
turned into a nightmare
that is our top Focus tonight on

the backstory

one we look at the challenges and the
opportunities that lie ahead
a cat killer is on the prowl in Japan we
tell you what the story is all about
[Music]
Every Day brings another startling story
from Pakistan
but this one is beyond belief
the military parade which is the
centerpiece of the Pakistan Day
Celebrations each year
is being canceled
Pakistani is the symbol of Pakistan's
National ethos
it's like France canceling Bastille Day
on the 14th of July
or India canceling the Republic day on
the 26th of January this is an insult to
both the country and to its founder
Muhammad Ali Jinnah
Pakistan celebrates its National Day on
the 23rd of March because this is the
day on which jinnah's Muslim League
passed the two Nation resolution at its
session in Lahore in 1940
jinnah's ideology created partition and
shaped Pakistan's identity
some pakistanis call him
or the great leader
others called him Baba ekom
or the father of the nation
but for all these lofty titles that they
have given Jinnah
today is Pakistan cannot even respect
jinnah's Legacy
and here's why I say this
Pakistan has canceled a military parade
which has held every year on its
national day
a day meant to commemorate the passage
of the 1940 Lahore resolution
I'll tell you why in just a bit
first you must know what's really
happening
for the first time since 1956 there will
not be a celebration or national day
apart from pompous features by
politicians of course
but there will be no showcasing of
weapons and no air show
the government of Pakistan has canceled
them all and why is that
well there are a host of reasons number
one being the economic condition the
government says it is doing so because
it has run out of money
or is it because Pakistan has run out of
a government
the Coalition between Nawaz sharif's
party and the PPP is in as big a
shambles as the country's economy
the only news is about instability and
near bankruptcy
the official reason number two is
political instability we have been
reporting on this for weeks now the
government is on its knees political
parties are on the streets in major
cities it is dharna versus dharna arrest
warrants are being issued against Imran
Khan whose only mission is to smash the
government even if it destroys the
country
to support it very bluntly even the
national day cannot bring the nation's
parties together around the flag it does
not make for good Optics at all
reason number three being Terror attacks
they have become a pandemic
in February Pakistan witnessed 58 Terror
attacks in 28 days six days into March
it has already seen one more attack we
told you about that
one that claimed the lives of nine
policemen in Balochistan
and at a time like this is the
government saying that it cannot provide
security for its own military parade if
it's saying that all political leaders
who attend will be at risk from
terrorist gunmen
well for all you know terrorists are
perhaps waiting for an event like this
to strike
the reasons point to a failed State a
state without a government a state which
insults its own founder
let me take you back in time
the year was 1940 on the 23rd of March
that year
Jinnah made a seminal speech
a speech that set out the idea of a
separate Homeland for Muslims on the
subcontinent
addressing the Lahore conference he said
and I'm quoting
it is a dream
that the Hindus and Muslims can ever
evolve a common nationality
Hindus and Muslims belong to two
different religious philosophies social
customs and literary traditions
they neither intermarry nor eat together
and indeed they belong to two different
civilizations which are based mainly on
conflicting ideas and conceptions
the majority of Indians did not believe
this to be true they wanted one United
Country from the khabar path to the
Burmese border with people of all faiths
living in harmony
but Jinnah had the support of the
colonial British and Pakistan was born
March 23rd came to be commemorated as
Pakistan resolution day
it was fast celebrated in 1956
we are in 2023 now and Pakistan created
as a dream has turned into a nightmare
my point is simple
forget Hindus and India Pakistan is at
war with itself bleeding from
self-inflicted cuts
and if I speak of politics we see a new
Game of Thrones every year in fact no
Pakistani prime minister has been able
to complete a full term in office
Sharif will meet the same fate since he
is unlikely to retain office after the
next general election
if we speak of Terror it has all but
engulfed the country from Below
there are Terror attacks almost every
week in almost every part of the country
and let's not even talk about the
society it has become more polarized
than the politics the discourse has
fallen into the pit
just this morning in fact a group of
Hindu students were stopped from
celebrating Holi at a university in
Lahore
and that is our next story
this story is from the Punjab University
the oldest public university in Pakistan
and apparently one of the most
prestigious
do you know what happens inside this
prestigious Institute
let me show you
have a look at these visuals they are
from Monday morning what you see is a
brawl between minority students and
islamist Goons
what was this brawl All About
the Festival of Holi
you see a council of Sindhi students at
this University had arranged holy
celebrations for the Hindu students
but the event was attacked by goons from
Islamic talaba
the largest student organization in
Pakistan
we'll tell you about it in just a bit
first have a look at this video
[Laughter]
of this incident have gone viral on
social media
Reports say after the attack when
victims protested on the campus they
were apparently thrashed with batons by
the University's own Gods
foreign
this entire episode is tragic
it just shows you the kind of bigotry
that prevails in Pakistan
not just in the country's politics but
also on University campuses where goons
can freely enter the premises of an
educational institute and thrash
students at whim
the question is who exactly were these
Goons
like I said they belong to the islami
jamiyat A taliba this is a radical
student organization its mission is to
preach Islam to students of modern
institutions and eliminate non-islamic
elements from their curriculum
this body is said to have links with the
Islamic brotherhood
a transnational Sunni islamist
organization founded in Egypt
the question is do the authorities in
Lahore plan to take action against this
outfit
well a complaint has been filed but we
doubt if it will achieve much because
this outfit is on the payroll of a
number of Pakistani politicians
they use it for political purposes like
securing their vote Bank
so besides featuring in a few headlines
we don't expect this incident to cause
much of a stir in Pakistan
and in any case when has Pakistan ever
heard the plight of minorities
from the destruction of temples to
forced conversion of Hindu girls to
targeted attacks against the Hindu
community
the lives of minorities in Pakistan has
become a living hell
let me show you some reports
in January 2020 a mob vandalized temple
in Pakistan's synth province
they also set fire to Hindu scriptures
and then in July 2020 an Under
Construction Temple was vandalized in
Islamabad
a mob of vandals raised down the
Temple's walls demanding the
construction be stopped
in August 2020 a pre-partisan temple was
demolished in Pakistan's laadi the
temple was reduced to a pile of Bricks
by the locals on the 16th of August
just study after India's Independence
Day
in December 2020 hundreds of Pakistani
extremists burnt and demolished a temple
in Cabela they raised it down with
hammers and crude weapons a case was
filed all the accused were later
acquitted
in March 2021 and uh and in March this
year a hundred year old temple in
Rawalpindi was attacked by a group of
vandals ahead of a planned operation to
clean the area of all encroachments in
August 2021 a temple was desecrated in
the Punjab Province sacred Idols of
Hindu gods were smashed religious
posters were burnt in broad daylight and
the entire incident was telecast live on
Facebook without any intervention from
the police or the local authorities
and then we have false conversions this
is another solo deal
have a look at this report it was
published by a Pakistani body itself it
says over 1 000 minority girls between
the ages 12 to 25 are forcibly converted
to Islam in Pakistan every year
and what's worse after conversion they
are married to the very abductors
I could go on but you get the point
Pakistan calls itself the land of the
pure
but what's happening within the country
is the exact opposite
I want to now show you a photo
and I want you to look at it closely
this is Kemal kadarulu
remember this face because he may be the
next Turkish president
he is taking on erdogan in the upcoming
elections
the polls are scheduled for the 14th of
May
and cardolu has been able to secure the
opposition's backing he has to support
of six Turkish parties
[Music]
[Applause]
I consider it a duty to announce the
decision we have taken following our
meetings we name Mr kimal it is our
presidential candidate
as the heads of the political parties
that make up the National Alliance we
have agreed on the roadmap for the
transition to the strengthened
parliamentary system
[Music]
the decision was not as spontaneous as
it looks far from it
the six parties engaged in weeks of
discussions and political drama before
putting their weight behind the man
a man people outside turkey don't really
know much about
so who really is he he is the head of
turkey's main opposition party the
Republican people's party or the CHP
is from turkey's Eastern tonkele
Province it he belongs to a minority
group called The alivi this group
follows a faith drawing from Shiite
Muslim Sufi and Anatolian folk
Traditions which often puts them at odds
with the Sunni Muslims who make up the
majority of the Turkish population
a levies on the other hand make up 15 to
20 percent of the population
but this is an association
does not really like to talk about
the Turkish media calls him
Gandhi Kamal
apparently he resembles Gandhi
also tries to Abe Gandhi consciously or
subconsciously
in 2017 for example cardolu launched a
450 kilometer March for justice asking
supporters to walk from Ankara to
Istanbul
he is 74 he studied economics in college
and was a civil servant before joining
politics he climbed the ranks as a
corruption fighter and today he is
offering to roll back unorthodox
economic policies while also making a
major shift in foreign policy including
working to quote unquote complete the
accession process for the full
membership in the European Union
while erdogan tried to woo the Muslim
countries and present turkey as the
leader of the Muslim world
is campaigning on stirring turkey
towards Europe
here's the big question though what are
the chances that he will win
honestly it is hard to say
while his party did defeat erdogan's
ruling party in the election for mayor
seats in Ankara Istanbul and some other
Turkish cities it is hard to see how
much of this Victory can be replicated
at a national level
and here's something one cannot afford
to forget
erdogan has this sort of cult
personality in Turkey he is after all to
give longest serving leader
erdogan has been in power for 20 years
and that said his position does look
shaky
and why do I say that
one people are unhappy with the
inflation two there is the cost of
living crisis and those struggling to
make ends meet can be unsparing at the
ballot
and number three the monster quick it
jolted people's confidence in the
government of the country in erdogan
over 45 000 people lost their lives
after the 7.8 magnitude earthquake
struck turkey on the 6th of February
some 264
000 departments were destroyed
as I speak turkey is in a state of
despair
and there is no doubt that the Tremors
of the earthquake will be felt this
election
will it be strong enough to throw out
erdogan from office
the public opinion is that erdogan did
not do enough to ensure that Turkish
homes could withstand the earthquakes
while he did make tall promises erdogan
did not follow them up with delivery
with action
his government's response to the crisis
also has been criticized
what works is the is that he studied
economy and now he gets to leverage that
and promised turkey a way out of the
economic crisis
also anti-incumbency always works in
times of disaster
and erdogan knows this do well
but he appears to be confident about
winning the upcoming election which is
the explanation one can possibly have
for the fact that the Turkish president
ruled out postponing the polls
so what are the chances that erdogan
will win
this question also is hard to answer
analysts predict a tight race there are
some who have serious doubts about
credulous ability to take on erdogan
there are others who are betting on
erdogan's ability to withstand the
political aftermath of the monster
earthquake but there are some analysts
who will tell you that a United
opposition cannot and should not be
taken lightly
but here's one thing that can turn
things around for erdogan and what is
that
story
chances are pro Kurdish party hdp May
extend its support to him hdp party
leader method Sankar has said and I'm
quoting a clear expectation is a
transition for a strong democracy
if we can agree on fundamental
principles we may support him in the
presidential election
the HTTP emerged as turkey's third
biggest party in the 2018 election and
it is currently not a part of the
opposition Alliance
so what happens if it joins the alliance
expands his net yes but erdogan gets an
opportunity to turn around and point at
hdps alleged ties to the pkk or the
Kurdistan Workers Party which happens to
be an armed Kurdish group and weapon
narrative around how kedalu has an
endorsement from the terrorists
and when that happens
remember we told you
and our next story is from India the
country is witnessing a new Rush it's
for luxury housing
the ultra Rich are queuing up to buy
high-priced Apartments
on their wish lists are high ceilings
multi-level parking Spas among other
high-end months
and this comes as good news for the real
estate industry
whose profits plummeted in recent years
there was an economic slowdown in 2019
when the pandemic came it further
dampened the sentiment in 2020
developers were forced to put the brakes
on new project launches
but the figures are now hinting at a
Revival
real estate giant dlf put an upmarket
residential project on sale
it was worth one billion dollars it was
sold within 72 hours
godrej properties is offering three
million dollars Apartments clients are
being selected by invitation
you see these properties are made for
the Richie Rich
they cater to the needs of millionaires
and billionaires
and despite that there is a mad rush
High net worth individuals are racing
against time to claim the properties
luxury homes are getting sold out in
hours
glf launched its Arbor project near the
national capital
1137 Apartments were up for grabs each
was priced at 869 thousand dollars
this is an extremely high cost for the
area
yet the houses attracted over 3 000
applications the booking sector Center
was besieged by the people
meanwhile godrej is playing a smart game
it is pushing for exclusivity when it
comes to house sales a factor which is
of Paramount importance to the Elite
Class
for people who demand exclusivity and
restricted access
this is what godrej sales manager yuvraj
manchanda said we don't want to only
sell this property but create a society
of the most influential Millionaires and
billionaires will buy this
godrej set up space in new delhi's
colonial era Imperial Hotel around 160
guests were invited they were shown 3D
models of the project along with videos
highlighting the amenities and by
amenities I mean the luxury ones
this includes heated Pools Spas
and Nanny on-call services
17 or 46 Flats were sold in the eight
story project
in Mumbai
suji developers last week published
front page advertisements they are
offering Sea View residences starting at
1.7 million dollars the development will
have an Amphitheater landscape Gardens
and a Sky Deck lobby as well luxury
homes have been all the rage since 2022.
let me just back that up with some
figures
in all a record 65 700 luxury units were
sold with Mumbai New Delhi and Hyderabad
at the spearhead this was three times
the sales in 2021.
luxury condemoniums accounted for 17 of
all housing launches in 2022. they are
priced above One Eighty three thousand
dollars
the sales at least touched a five-year
High
meanwhile in 2020 only 8 and 500 luxury
homes were sold
before the pandemic 18
150 units were sold this was in 2019.
according to sotheby 61 percent of
surveyed High net worth Indians plan to
buy luxury real estate this year
and what is causing such a sudden boom
are people done hiding away their riches
are they ready to splurge on such
luxurious living
the change comes at A peculiar time
one third of the world is expected to
dip into recession
the international monetary fund has said
this at the beginning of this year
so is it the right time for such
extravagant spending
there are 1.4 billion people in India
the country has a poor capital income of
two thousand and three hundred dollars
but the wealth disparity is apparent
around 800 000 Indians are millionaires
the number is expected to grow by 77 in
the next three years meaning by 2026 the
country will have 1.4 million
Millionaires and this is according to
the Knight Frank wealth sizing model
with a growing number of the Richie
riches the demand for luxury living is
bound to increase
founders of listed firms entrepreneurs
lawyers the elites are looking for
larger apartments and better lifestyle
you see many were confined to their
homes during the pandemic work from home
and hybrid work structures became a
thing these factors along with Rising
incomes and India's growing number of
the Richie Rich have created a hype
around luxury living and it's not only
limited to houses
the fever is spreading to the garages as
well
machete sales were at a record high last
year the luxury car maker sold 15
822 units
BMW sold 11
268. luxury goods are in high demand as
well
Knight Frank data for 2022 shows 53
percent of ultra wealthy individuals
splurged on both luxury watches and
Handbags the estimates were 41 for
watches and nine percent for handbags in
2020.
clearly the elite are spending money
like anything
for the time being while it spells good
news for property dealers car makers and
luxury good producers what does it
really mean ahead of a possible
recession are Indian millionaires going
rogue on spending
women's day is observed on the 8th of
March every year the day is celebrated
as a focal point in the women's rights
movement to create awareness among the
people bring attention to issues like
gender equality effects of gender bias
abuse against women the list goes on and
on
but a day before the international
women's day the U.N Secretary General
Antonio guterres made a shocking
Revolution it is regarding the rising
gender inequality in the world
but is gender equality the only thing
that women deserve at this hour
or is there something more
our next report gets you the complete
story
we're living in the 21st century by now
the world was supposed to be a better
place to live in one where everyone gets
equal chance and opportunity to grow
but not much has changed in the way
Society thinks
equality is still a myth and
discrimination is still prevalent
historically across the globe women have
suffered huge ill treatment to be at par
with their opposite gender although with
the passage of time the situation was
improving for women with people voicing
and fighting for their rights creating
awareness among citizens
but despite such efforts according to
the United Nations Chief Antonio
Gutierrez Decades of advances on women's
rights are being wound back the world is
now hundreds of years away from
achieving gender equality speaking to
the United Nations Commission on the
status of women Antonio Gutierrez said
gender equality is Vanishing before our
eyes he said we are three centuries away
from achieving gender equality citing
High rates of maternal mortality girls
being forced into early marriage and
girls being kidnapped and assaulted for
attending school as evidence the UN
Chief believes the hope of achieving
gender equality is growing more distant
if we look around the world we can see
various recent instances where women
have been robbed of their rights and
deserved opportunities
ruled Afghanistan women and girls have
been erased from public life the regime
has barred women and girls from
universities in some schools invalidated
thousands of divorces forcing women to
go back and live with their abusive
partners
while in Iran there was a brutal
Crackdown on protests that broke out in
mid-september following the death of 22
year old Masa amini who was in police
custody after she allegedly violated the
country's conservative dress code for
women
or even in the most developed country of
the world the United States of America
where women sexual and Reproductive
Rights are being rolled back since the
overturning of the landmark 1973 Roe
versus Wade ruling where women have the
constitutional right to choose whether
to have an abortion or not
so now the question arises what can you
and I do to tackle the centuries-long
battle well to achieve gender equality
the most important thing which we can do
as a society is ensure equal access to
education Empower women in the workplace
as in most workplaces there are more men
than women in high level positions the
gender pay Gap also persists in many
places where men are generally paid more
than their female counterparts for the
same job profile while another thing
which needs to be done is to ensure the
strengthening of legal rights domestic
violence is still prevalent in many
parts of the world the World Health
Organization estimates one in three of
all women are subject to domestic
violence at some point in their life
meanwhile many women have also
experienced sexual harassment at some
point in their lives
but gender equality is not an end in
itself it is an outcome of multiple
forces working in unison one of the
prerequisites is gender equity in other
words if gender equality is the end
gender Equity is the means to it but
what does gender Equity exactly mean it
is the fairness of treatment for women
and men according to their respective
needs
this may include equal treatment or
treatment that is different but is
considered equivalent in terms of Rights
benefits obligations and opportunities
when we talk about opportunity we're
talking about ensuring opportunity is
not limited simply on the basis of
gender we're talking about correcting
for gender biases so that economic
outcomes improve for all
basically it strives to bring all the
genders to an equal playing field to
facilitate equal opportunities for all
genders to overcome their historical and
social disadvantages by ensuring
fairness and Justice in the distribution
of resources to all genders
now if irony had a faith it would look
something like this
meet Greg tomb
he is rather he was until recently the
president of Zoom
you know the video conferencing platform
tomb was its president
they fired him terminated his employment
without cause
and why am I calling him the face of
irony
because ever since the Wuhan virus
pandemic started we've heard about so
many stories of people being fired over
Zoom calls
this man Vishal Garg is the poster boy
of Zoom layoffs he managed to fire 900
employees over an Infamous Zoom meeting
all 900 of those employees were invited
to a zoo meeting and God told them if
you are on this call you are part of the
Unlucky group being laid off
adding your employment here is
terminated effective immediately
Garg is the CEO of Unicom mortgage
lender startup better.com
it's a Pity he could not come up with a
better more polite way to deliver this
news to the employees
and there are many like garlic who have
fired people over Zoom calls
in 2022 British Shipping Company p and O
ferries probably got inspired by Garg
and let go of 800 employees over a video
call 800 of them
the pandemic made virtual layoffs The
New Normal unfortunately and it's hardly
a surprise
you would agree with me that it is
easier to have difficult conversations
over the phone or with a screen in
between than in person
but does that make virtual layoffs the
right thing to do
well that's a debate for another day
the fact today is that Zoom has become a
medium of choice for cutting cutting
jobs and it becomes an irony when the
platform's president suddenly finds
himself on the receiving end of the job
cuts
Reports say tomb was fired abruptly he
was hired only in June 2022
everything seemed nice and Rosy
tomb attended the world economic Forum
in Davos in January he expressed
confidence in zoom's growth despite
people going back
so what happened between January and now
no one really knows
the sense of cluelessness is pretty
similar to what the thousands felt who
were fired over Zoom no space for a
one-on-one in-person interaction little
space for questions
just a cold turkey termination of
employment these layoffs virtual and
otherwise continue as I speak
and I don't know how many of you saw the
headlines today meta is firing thousands
of employees this week the parent
company of Instagram Facebook and
WhatsApp has already let go of many of
its workers I'm talking as many as 11
000 workers
in the first seven days of this month
alone several well-known companies have
let go of their workers Flipkart fitter
an upgrad in India Loft Aaron B which by
the way has let go of 30 percent of its
recruiting staff
irony March
and then you have Master Class CNET
truckstop.com
thoughtworks iFood which also laid off
workers since
a while now when these companies are
just few of the many
how many you are asking
have a look at this particular website
it tracks layoffs and it already has 27
entries for the month of March
what date is it again just the 7th of
March
and as I speak bodies are piling up in
the tech Battlefield with more and more
people suddenly finding themselves
without a job
without a source of income and without
means to support themselves and their
families
why is this happening
let's just come back to zoom the company
recently fired 1300 employees that's 15
percent of its Workforce zoom's CEO
short a company-wide email in it
Johann took responsibility for the mass
firing
but what exactly forced the company to
take that step
Zoom became a household name at the
start of the pandemic because people
needed to work remotely attend classes
attend social events online course
needed to hold hearings remotely as well
and zoom responded to this rise in
demand and tripled its employee
strengths
but then the World opened up again
people went back to the offices students
went back to in-person learning and
social Gatherings went back to normal
it's not like Zoom has been forgotten
altogether
meetings still happen there so do
catch-ups but it's fair to say it's
nothing like before
the demand has fallen what's the result
Mass layoffs
this seems to be the story across much
of the tech sector
it hired or Mars in the beginning of the
pandemic and now it is firing or Mars
whatever happened to sustainable hiring
let me now ask you a question
are you a cat person
and if yes you will find the story
particularly disturbing
a Serial cat killer is on the loose in
Greater Tokyo
several mutilated cat carcasses have
been found
residents are Disturbed and scared local
authorities have bolstered security
measures
suffice with cats
could humans be next on The Hit List
well let's see the cat killings have
been gruesome
on Sunday a partially buried cat was
found its paws and head were missing
its guts were found hours later on a
nearby Road
earlier in February police found a
severe cat jaw in a schoolyard it was
found hanging from the playground from
the playground bars with a string
police are currently investigating the
cat murders as violation of Japan's
Animal Protection Law
killing or harming an animals is
punishable in the country the culprit
could be sentenced to five years in
prison
or find up to 36 600 dollars
but the murderer does not seem to be
scared
these cat killings have shocked
residents
animal rights activists are alarmed
this is not the first time saitama city
has witnessed such murders by the way
six years ago
a man notoriously killed and tortured
more than a dozen cats
and as if that was not enough
he posted the gruesome videos online
he was later sentenced to 22 months in
prison
another such incident happened in 1997 a
14 year old boy in Kobe prefecture
dismembered cats bodies
but he did not stop there he went on to
kill an 11 year old boy and a 10 year
old girl
you see the country has relatively low
violent crime rates
children routinely ride Subways alone
according to statista only 874 homicides
were recorded in Japan in 2021
the figure just for the sake of
comparison was close to 23 000 for the
United States
the Gory murders have left Japan uneasy
and what is happening now
seems like a stark reminder of the
incident
now another killer is playing cats not
just killing but mutilating their bodies
and leaving them out in the open
in children's playgrounds in areas that
are under CCTV surveillance
experts have labeled this a purely evil
Act
the cat murders have sent alarm bells
ringing
Could children be the next targets
educational board have come under stress
local officials have increased
patrolling in areas where the dead cats
were found
they are escorting students home
children have been asked to walk in
large groups
animal activists are calling for better
background checks for potential pet
owners as well
they say animals should not be treated
as toys
animal abuse has been on the rise in
Japan in 2021 police made 170 arrests
for suspected animal abuse and that's
the highest figure since records started
in 2010.
the situation is concerning
it seems cats don't have nine lives in
Japan

these men are leaders of some of the
world's deadliest Terror groups and they
roam free in Pakistan where militant
attacks are searching according to
Pakistan Institute of conflict and

attacks in February 2023 alone
targeting civilians and security

harboring one monster after another that

does Pakistan need a game plan or is
this Pakistan's end game I'm Shivan Jana
let's get to the point
after four long years the terror
financing and money laundering Watchdog
Financial action task force fatf removed
Pakistan from its gray list in October
of 2022. now the gray list consists of
countries that are under increased
monitoring of fatf due to Terror funding
and related activity
in order to get out the gray list
Pakistan did some lip service and put
some Terror leaders in jail or under
house arrest
but when a man designated by the U.S
state Department as a global terrorist
surfaces on Pakistani soil it means that
Pakistan has just played with fetf

the 1.1 billion dollar IMF bailout

free on Pakistani soil
if not for the world for its own sake
one would expect Pakistan to avoid
harboring terrorists

Solutions prasanna is credited for
developing three apps at such a young
age one of them is the covet help
application
was designed to Aid those in need of
immediate medical assistance and
ambulance services in Bengaluru
the other two apps that he has made are
the IQ Test app for kids and the app
called countries of the world
yes I love the code I have created many
applications in which the three major
applications are CHP for covert helping
Google IQ test staff and cutting folder
cfp is an application in which you can

remember the days when you would have to
wait for hours for your phone to fully
charge eventually phone companies
understood this pain point and they came
up with fast Chargers it's been observed
that over the years the fast charging
technology has made huge strides with
each upgrade and the technology
continues to move in the right direction
here is more
imagine you have to rush and your phone
is low on battery
a good feeling right
sometimes it's even annoying
that's why phone companies have designed
fast chargers for smartphones
with fast charging you can give your
phone a quick shot of juice in no time
in most cases you can charge half of the
battery in less than 30 minutes as we
know Technologies continue to advance
[Music]
phone makers are now trying to make the
fast charging technology even better
we now have what is called the world's
fastest charging smartphone meat the
realme GT3
the phone packs of 4600 milliamp hour
battery with support for 240 watt fast
charging
in other words it's monstrous battery
can be charged to full in less than 10
minutes
according to realme the GT3 smartphones
battery can go to 20 in 80 Seconds
about 50 percent of the battery can be
charged in four minutes
a mere 30 second charge can give it
enough power for a two hour 5G phone
call the company also advertises a
30-second charge of the GT3 can last for
three hours of music listening or 40
minutes of video streaming
the smartphone charging Tech is evolving
at a rapid Pace rail means Arch arrival
xiaomi has also announced that it's
working on a similar technology the
company is experimenting with a 300 watt
charging technology
which means a 4100 milliamp hour battery
can be charged to full in under 5
minutes you heard that right it's been
reported that redmi's 300 watt wired
charger takes only 43 seconds to charge
the phone from one percent to 10 percent
interestingly it can go from one percent
to 50 in 2 minutes and 13 seconds
clearly Chinese smartphone makers are
experimenting with the next generation
of fast charging technology now it
remains to be seen when other phone
makers jump on the bandwagon
next we show you some futuristic

Innovations by Leading technology
companies at the event
and on check it out we get you the
biggest Trend that dominated the mega
show
Lenovo showcase rollable devices at the
annual mobile Trade Fair
look at this the Lenovo rollable PC
right now
with the push off a button it's 12.7
inch screen rolls out to become a 15.3
inch screen it gives users more space
for document editing content creation
and for performing other tasks
the Motorola rollable device was another
futuristic gadget on display at the show
with a double press on its side the
handset screen rolls out from 5 inches
to 6.5 inches
the Chinese Tech firm says the Creations

smartphone charging
its transparent glass case and
multi-layered structure let users see
the cooling micro liquid flow through
its back
xiaomi is also in the smartphone race
the company is attempting to take on
Samsung with its latest range of
smartphones
and if you take a look at pricing not
only are they going head-to-head with
the s23 ultra in terms of specs and
features but also in terms of pricing so
now they're they're a little bit more
expensive they did announce a cheaper
variant today the the me13 light which I
think is the phone that most users are
going to go out and buy
the Chinese electronics company has
unveiled three new devices with the new

application and make it appear directly
on the vehicle's infotainment system as
a safety precaution users can only use
audio when the vehicle is moving but
they can use all features when it is
parked such as video meetings and
automatic transcription
new mobile Trends are here to make our
lives easier and better but it remains
to be seen when these new trends go
mainstream
[Music]
moving on our next story is about a new
innovation that can help bridge the
digital divide the new technology aims
to provide affordable and reliable
internet access to people even in remote
areas here is how
[Music]
several companies around the world are
focusing on providing internet to people
in remote areas
one such is the blockchain-based mobile
network operator World mobile
it's aiming to provide affordable
internet access to unconnected people
around the world
how with the help of aerostatic balloons
blimp like aerostats are called air
noodles they're tethered in a particular
location according to the company they
provide the same coverage as 12
traditional Telecom Towers
it means fewer telecommunications sites
have to be built and maintained and
fewer cables need to be laid
there's around 2.5 billion people on the
planet that aren't connected and right
now there's no plausible Solutions
connected we use aerostats and a ground
Network in order to be able to connect
people
[Music]
here's how the technology works the
balloon acts as a telecommunications
Tower in the sky the company uses a
hybrid mobile network of aerial and
ground assets to connect people
customers can directly connect the
balloon's payload using their smartphone
in the same way they would to a
traditional cell tower so the aerostats
the balloons as people call them there's
been quite some good coverage of that
recently they provide ubiquitous
coverage for huge amounts of distances
around 130 kilometers similar to 300 to
500 meter altitudes but of course you
may be able to see two or three million
people but you need ground assets
traditional towers that will take the
the capacity of all of these people but
it's not a one for all solution you in
some cases Wi-Fi is a perfect solution
where people will come to the device in
an African village for example in other
cases you use TV white space and analyze
inspections in other cases it's you run
a 4G and 5G Network where the devices
are compatible so it's not a One Federal
solution and what we're really smart
doing is being able to adapt to what is
needed on the ground very quickly and
provide a solution right now
after launching in Zanzibar the company
is now expanding rapidly to provide
low-cost internet access to people in
remote areas who lack access to
traditional internet service providers
the need for connectivity is all around
the world it does is the Emerging
Markets Africa the continent as example
is the least unconnected place on the
planet this is where we've started we
started in Zanzibar as a proof of
concept we spent the last two years
there fine-tuning our sharing economy
and now we're moving into Nigeria Kenya
Mozambique and we have a whole waiting
list of countries there but we're also
in the United States of America also in
the UK and also in Asia and Pakistan
according to the international
telecommunication Union one-third of the
world's population remained unconnected
to the internet in 2022 the majority of
those people were from developing
countries
World mobile aims to address this issue
by providing a low-cost decentralized
internet service that can reach remote
areas where traditional providers have
not been able to operate

speaking of new technologies many female
scientists engineers and leaders have
made major breakthroughs let me tell you
some of the key technologies that you
use on a daily basis have been invented
by women
here is a reminder of the many
contributions women have made over the
years
[Music]
there are many women who have made
significant contributions to the field
of Technology
[Music]
they have invented various important
technologies that we rely on today
but sadly women are still
underrepresented in text
look at the statistics women hold 26.7
percent of Technology jobs
the percentage of women in All Tech
related careers has actually decreased
over the last two years
despite equal access the percentage of
women pursuing stem subjects in higher
education is on the decline and women
achieve just 18 percent of new computer
science degrees
as women's day is approaching we tell
you about some interesting inventions
created by women over the years
there are a few surprises as well
can you do without a heater in your car
during winter
you know that you can't and for that you
can thank mechanical engineer Margaret
Wilcox who invented the first ever car
heater
in 1893 Margaret Wilcox patented the
design for the very first car heater
what's even more interesting she did it
in an era where being a mechanical
engineer was a rarity and it was even
more difficult for a woman
and it's not just the heater in your car
the wiper to clear off the windshield
was also the brainchild of a woman
it was at the beginning of the 20th
century when Mary Anderson discovered
that people had to stop their cars and
get out of them to clear snow and ice
off windshields
American inventor Mary Anderson is
popularly known for devising the first
operational windscreen wiper in 1903
this innovation has an interesting
history
Josephine Gareth Cochran was not pleased
after her servants carelessly chipped
some of the dishes she decided to have a
machine that could do the dishes faster
than her servants and two without
damaging them when she couldn't find one
she built one herself
Josephine Cochran invented the first
practical dishwasher and formed the
Garrus Cochrane dishwashing company to
manufacture and Market it
home security devices come in really
handy when you are away they let you
remotely monitor your house but did you
know that the first home security system
was developed by a woman
[Music]
African-American inventor Marie Van
Britain Brown realized that law
enforcement officers in her neighborhood
were slow in responding to calls so she
found her own way to ensure safety her
invention paved the way for modern home
security systems that we use today
Wi-Fi is one thing that most of us can't
live without be it airports or cafes the
first thing that many of us look for is
access to Wi-Fi but who invented it
meet Hedy Lamar she invented what
eventually became the precursor to many
Wireless Technologies such as Wi-Fi
Bluetooth and GPS
these popular Wireless Technologies are
now used by billions of people around
the world
women inventors have played a vital role
in the world of innovation
truly we need more women leaders in Tech
[Music]
well that's all we have for you in this
episode of take it out we will continue
to bring you exciting inventions and
updates on the latest gadgets I will be

earnings season there has been a 77
percent increase in the use of AI during
investor calls compared to the previous
year
but many of the businesses that use the
term AI are just trying to cash in on
the trend
we'll leave you this report thank you
very much for watching this edition of
we on wild is one and stay with us
as the world is still catching up on the
hype over AI companies are using the bus
surrounding Ai and tap into the boom of
this industry
this earnings season the usage of the
term AI has risen around 77 from last
year the hype becomes evident as
companies like Nvidia which manufactures
chips for complex Computing used for AI
have become the best performing stock
this year
stocks of businesses with even a small
connection to AI have jumped
but what has made AI so useful and why
is everyone talking about it
a large number of companies are taking
advantage of the hype globally with
investors favoring the booming
technology throwing in artificial
intelligence jargon is proving
beneficial for various businesses
however that being said AI is not just
about the hype since chat gpt's Grand
arrival in the market late last year big
business corporations recognize the
utility AI holds in various echolons of
the society
many Tech Giants depend more and more on
AI to improve their search engines and
add businesses in the field of
advertising Philip Schindler Google's
Chief business officer stated that AI
has been foundational to the company's
ads business for the last decade meta
platforms reported that conversions from
ads increased by 20 in the previous
quarter thanks to their investment in AI
the company is also using AI to develop
privacy tools and serve more relevant
ads
wpp the world's largest advertising
group based on Revenue sees AI as
essential to finding relevant audiences
AI is being used in internet search
models to give boiled down information
quickly AI models are also proving
useful in new features like translation
video captioning and Analysis for sales
however its most relevant contribution
happens to be in the medical research
and testing industry
GE Healthcare Technologies recently
hired Taha Cas hope former VP of machine
learning at Amazon to lead growth in
machine learning and Digital Services
their algorithm for producing sharper
images has reduced scan times for 5.5
million patients and their cardiac

AI in drug discovery
and Quest Diagnostics automated

similarly and customer service Wells
Fargo is introducing Fargo an ai-powered
virtual assistant to personalize and
simplify banking experience
the CME Group has partnered with Google
Cloud for a decade to use the company's
machine learning Solutions and data
analytics these strides in the direction
of development do put the technology in
high regard however some sectors such as
the financial industry including
Citigroup Deutsche Bank and Goldman
Sachs favor a ban on AI
it's likely because of the higher risks
that come with automated investing which
could cause a huge panic in the
financial markets however only time will
tell if AI will prove useful or not for
now ai is writing its success and AI
remains in the now
Corporate America is riding that hype
and describing itself as the next big

heard that right Pakistan has reportedly

won't be surprised this is just the tip
of the iceberg this has been going on
for a while now what's brewing between
Ukraine and Pakistan I'm Shivan John now
let's get to the point
[Music]
Pakistan and Ukraine's defense ties
started way back in 1991 just as the
Soviet Union was dissolved and Ukraine
Got Its Own identity
from 1991 to 2020 the two Nations have
had arms deals worth 1.6 billion dollars
Pakistan has purchased 320 Ukrainian
tatuds which are main battle tanks and
there is a further deal worth 85.6
million dollars between the two Nations
to repair Pakistan's tat tank Fleet

recently shipped 10 000 Rockets to
Ukraine meant for use in grad
multi-barrel rocket launchers
in January a Karachi based shipping firm
named project shipping sent 146
containers from Pakistan's weapon
factories another shipment of 50 000
defense supplies was sent recently
defense firms in Eastern Europe are
reaching out to Islamabad based armed
suppliers
122 mm Howitzer hed30 artillery being
used by Ukrainian forces are actually
produced in Pakistan and there are clear
signs indicating this the regular usage
of British style steel boxes the Liu
four type fuses were clear giveaways of
the soviet-style 122mm artillery made in
Pakistan ordinal species
the shipments are being sent through two
one is via the Karachi port in
Pakistan's synth Province the shipments
first read Germany via the emden port
from here the shipment enters Poland
before finally reaching Ukraine
the other route is to enter Poland
directly through the dank's port and
then over to Ukraine

return Pakistan is expected to receive
Ukraine's assistance to upgrade its May
17 helicopters
Pakistan's Aid to Ukraine is also being
seen as a way of standing alongside U.S
during the ukraine-russia conflict
remember that Pakistan recently received
a hefty maintenance package from U.S
worth 450 million dollars for its f-16s
another bonding factor for the two
Nations is their sentiment towards India
Ukraine's senior lawmaker recently urged
the U.S to impose sanctions on India if
it doesn't stop buying Russian oil but
U.S knows very well India is not going
to listen so it dismissed Ukraine's plea
straight away saying India is their
partner
even in the past
part in condemned India at the UNSC when
in 1998 India conducted nuclear tests in
Pokemon so like a double agent inspired
Thrillers Pakistan is avoiding taking
sides in the Russia Ukraine conflict but
quietly arming Ukraine and parallely
attempting to purchase oil from Russia
that also had discounted rates do you
think Russia will provide discounted oil
to Pakistan while Pakistan sends Rockets
to Ukraine to use against Russia let me
know in the comments

and of course the American PR machinery
but what if I tell you that things are
changing
that America's Global Empire is
crumbling the hegemony of Western
Nations is dying
and a new alliance is looking to replace
it an alliance led by three countries
Russia China and Iran
the three most sanctioned countries in
the world
they seem to have formed a rather
informal Alliance of convenience a loose
Alliance of sorts which the West is
calling a Troika of tyranny and a Triad
of bullies
what have they done to deserve such
titles and can they really reshape the
prevailing World Order
or will they instead push the world into
further disorder and above everything
else where does India fit in this new
axis does it have any reason to worry
we'll find out over the next few minutes
hello and welcome to gravitas plus my
name is Priyanka Sharma a new Global
Alliance is now in the making and
alliance between China Iran and Moscow
they're forging their Strategic Defense
and economic ties it doesn't take a
genius to notice the pattern just look
at some recent developments ever since
Russia invaded Ukraine the three
countries have come closer yes China is
uncomfortable with the war but it still
provides Russia with a diplomatic
umbrella it is also helping Moscow
economically by rejecting the g7's price
caps on oil
the same case with Iran it is still
buying Russian oil and sending weapons
in return Yes for the last one here the
Haram has sent countless Kamikaze drones
and the reports are to be believed it
might just send ballistic missiles by
this October
these deals are being accompanied by
state visits leaders and officials from
all three countries have been frequently
flying to each other's capitals
in July last year the Russian president
went to Tehran
he met his counterpart Ibrahim raisi and
discussed strengthening bilateral ties
contrary to expectations Iran didn't
downplay this visit
in fact it rolled out a red carpet for
Vladimir Putin the Iranian oil Minister
personally went to greet Putin
and then in November a group of Russian
security officials visited Iran their
aim was to find ways to counter Western
pressure on both countries
Syria is another good example
another good example of the Iranian and
Russian interests coming together for
years now both sides have been trying to
keep Bashar al-assad in power their only
aim is to counter American interests in
Syria
just last week the U.S shot down
iranian-made spy drones in Syria
and if we speak of Russia despite being
militarily involved in Ukraine Russia
still maintains a military presence in
Syria an indication that it's not
leaving the country anytime soon
and if we speak of Russian and Iranian
cooperation in Syria it's a tale that
gets murkier the deeper you dig Russia
continues to provide a decisive cover to
Syrian and iranian-backed ground forces
in Syria
and then of course we have China Chinese
president Xi Jinping and Russia's Putin
recently caught up over a phone call
this was around New Year's Eve the two
sides released statements saying the
ties are at their historic best
what's more Putin said he's expecting a
state visit from Xi Jinping soon
we are expecting you dear friend was the
message from Moscow we are hardly
surprised the entire world knows about
China's bonhummy with Russia and will
focus on China's love affair with Iran
an affair getting intense by the day
you see in 2021 China and Iran signed a
25-year comprehensive strategic
partnership deal a deal that has given
China its deepest ever foothold in Iran
with many Iranians even saying that the
deal has literally sold Iran to China
but the Islamic Republic's leadership
doesn't see it that way why
because in return Iran was made a
permanent member of the sco the Shanghai
cooperation organization a body led by
China it's the largest regional
organization in terms of world
population Global GDP and Geographic
scope Iran's membership in this body
does little for the region it represents
but more for the powers that run it
Russia and China
with Iran on their side their Ambitions
of countering the West get greater
legitimacy and support
for Iran this membership helps it battle
the economic isolation from the West
so it's a win-win deal of sorts in
December last year China's Vice Premier
who shun Hua flew down to the Iran and
more recently Iran's president visited
China Ibrahim racy he was in Beijing
from the 14th of February to the 16th
the Chinese president gave him a red
carpet welcome followed by a god of
Honor by the Chinese military
the arrangements were Grand to say the
least they had to be after all this was
the first state visit by an Iranian
leader to China in almost two decades
and racy didn't go to Beijing alone
he took along a huge Entourage of
ministers
the biggest Iranian delegation to
Beijing ever this included six members
of racy's cabinet
in an editorial about the visit China's
mouthpiece the global times said that
the visit was proof that an anti-western
front is growing
allow me to quote the most telling
excerpt from the report it said
China's deepening cooperation with Iran
also has an anti-hedgemony and
anti-bullying feature
both China and Iran uphold independent
foreign policies firmly defend the
principle of non-interference in
Internal Affairs on International
occasions if anyone feels targeted in
this process then they should first
reflect on whether they are too selfish
so how do we perceive such statements
and developments do they indicate the
consolidation of an anti-western axis do
they indicate the rise of a new world
order it certainly seems like it and the
American Media can't stop talking about
it
for the last two months there have been
endless reports of how China Iran and
Moscow had joined hands against the West
how Washington will have to take on all
three at the same time and not just
these three Reports say the Triad also
has a posse of sorcerer's apprentices
what do I mean by that smaller Nations
that agree with their Vision namely
Venezuela Nicaragua Cambodia Myanmar
and the most important of them all North
Korea
a country which of late has been flexing
its ballistic muscles way too much so to
put it simply China Russia and Iran want
to unite all like-minded countries
behind them and use them as a solid
front to counter Western hegemony this
seems like a page straight from the
Western Alliance building Playbook
in the days ahead you can expect these
countries to go all guns blazing on the
west
you can expect to see them blaming the
West for their ills on global forums and
using their vote at the UNSC or the unga
to thwart the multilateral system the
big question where will all this leave
India will India be collateral damage in
this game plan well we wouldn't go so
far as to say that you see India has
historic ties with Russia India and Iran
also share a cordial relationship
China is obviously an exception it never
fails to provoke India yet New Delhi and
Beijing have managed to not let the
tensions flare up dramatically so should
India worry about this Alliance we don't
think so this trial just has one rotten
apple as far as India is concerned China
I don't think the other members of this
Alliance both present and future would
square off against India especially
Russia and Iran one can't imagine these
two joining in anti-india Alliance in
fact this Alliance isn't even about
India
it's about the West it's Monopoly it's
dominance its Brazen lectures and its
selfish Wars
my point is simple Russia China and Iran
may have their own ulterior motives they
may have their own differences with the
west but their plan might find takers
simply because way too many countries
are fed up with the West treating the
world like their playground waging Wars
at whim imposing sanctions at women
preaching to others at whim their
superpower status may have crumbled but
their sense of entitlement clearly has
not and this sense of entitlement is
exactly what's uniting others against
them think about it

dark clouds of conflict are again
beginning to hover over the Middle East
just a week after the state of Israel
used its heaviest drone Ethan to bomb a
military installation over Isfahan Iran
has now showed off its underground
fighter jets
with the backing of the Americans the
state of Israel Over many decades has
behaved as the nuclear policeman of the
Middle East
but Iran is trying to change the status
quo of the power violence in one of the
most turbulent regions of the world
so what role will Iran's newly acquired
arsenal of underground fighter jets
drones and missiles play unexport gets
you the details
this is an underground fighter jet base
unlike any that you might have seen
before
called The Eagle 44 this underground
base can accommodate all types of
fighter jets and bombers
and according to Iran this top secret
facility whose location has not been
revealed can even withstand strikes by
U.S bunker busting bombs the objective
of these fighter jets according to Iran
is to thwart possible Maneuvers as were
practiced by the United States and
Israel in their recent military drills
if a country or a place from surrounding
countries or anywhere in the world is
being used as a base to attack Iran
other than the Zionist regime which we
are already prepared for that base will
come under our heavy attack
so what reason does Iran have to prepare
for a possible assault
on the 29th of January Israel used its
heaviest drone intern
to Target an Iranian military facility
in Israel and just days before that the
United States and Israel conducted the
Juniper Oak 23 the biggest ever joint
military Drillers in Israel and Eastern
Mediterranean Sea
the Pentagon stated that the drills
involved U.S and Israeli fifth
generation fighter assets including 140
aircraft
6400 U.S troops along with 1500 Israeli
troops
in July and August 2022 Israel
repeatedly violated Iranian airspace
using its F-35 fighter jets simulating a
possible strike on Iran's nuclear
facilities
in September 2022 the Israeli Air Force
has shared this tweet the incident dates
back exactly 16 years on the 5th of
September in 2007 the Israeli F-15 and
F-16 fighter jets had swooped down in
the dead of the night on Syria's de
resor and bombed a cube-like structure
that was tucked away in a desert Valley
[Applause]
the operation was called out of the box
or operation Orchard and according to
reports the Israeli airstrike destroyed
a nuclear reactor that was just months
away from completion
41 years ago on the 7th of June in 1981
Israeli fighter jets Bond and unfinished
Iraqi nuclear reactor 17 kilometers
outside of the Iraqi capital
codename various lia's operation Babylon
or operation Opera
so Iran has good reason to be wary of
Israeli designs
at the moment there are a minimum of six
nuclear facilities in Iran
at Natan sanfordo centrifuges have been
moved deep under the ground in a complex
Maze of tunnels
it is to Target these facilities that
Israel seems to be preparing for but an
attack on Iran won't be a cakewalk the
underground fighter jets that Iran
presently has May lack the teeth but
Tehran is expecting a delivery of 24
Sequoia su-35 fighter jets from the 21st
of March
and if this deal does materialize then
the balance of air power will shift in
the Middle East
besides this Iran has also built up a
formidable arsenal of top-notch drones
that have been used by the Russians in
the Ukraine war
s are enemies who usually have wrong
intelligence should sometimes see what
we are capable of this will have
maintained peace in the world and the
region
Israel is the only country in the Middle
East that has nuclear weapons for its
part Iran insists that its nuclear
program is meant only for peaceful
generation of electricity but Israel has
never made a secret of its distrust of
Iran's nuclear program the acquisition
of a nuclear weapon by Tehran will
change the power dynamics in the Middle
East and Tel Aviv appears to be on the
cusp of another major operation to
strike at Iran's nuclear capabilities
foreign
North Korea has crossed a crucial
nuclear threshold for the very first
time Pyongyang has paraded its biggest
number of nuclear intercontinental
ballistic missiles which analysts say
would be enough to overwhelm America's
air defenses along the west coast
now all of through last year president
Barton had adopted a policy of using
only sanctions to engage with Pyongyang
as that carried a spree of missile tests
and it cemented its position as a
nuclear power
but now Kim Jong-un has asked his
military to strengthen its War
preparedness
but who does North Korea think it would
get into a conflict with
and what does it mean for the region at
large unexport gets you the details
in a nighttime parade Pyongyang has just
exhibited its biggest array of nuclear
weapons
including tactical Nuclear devices
intercontinental ballistic missiles
among other weapon systems the North
Korean State media described its nuclear
Arsenal as powerful enough to match
against North Korea's adversaries nuke
for a nuke
the parade organized to Mark the 75th
anniversary of North Korea's Army was
presided by Kim Jong-un accompanied by
his wife and young daughter and
underlining the event was North Korea's
message that its status as a nuclear
power is irrevocable
they are going to prioritize developing
the ICBM and then the slbm to guarantee
the North Korean regime which can be
practical threat to the U.S Mainland
that's why they showed that they are
producing Hua song 17 to put pressure
the highlight of the knights parade were
the 11th Hua song 17 intercontinental
ballistic missiles first tested in 2022
Pyongyang calls them the monster
missiles with an estimated range of 15
000 kilometers these icbms which are 26
meters tall can strike mainland United
States
they are nuclear capable and can carry a
warhead that can weigh as much as 3500
kilogram
but what has got the most attention is a
prototype of solid fuel icbms in
canister launchers tensions on the
Korean Peninsula have been at a boiling
point for more than a year now in 2022
Pyongyang tested more than 90 ballistic
Crews and Hypersonic missiles
while the United States and South Korea
have conducted repeated military drills
which Pyongyang has slammed as
provocation on the 1st of February the
US Air Force flew its b-1b strategic
bomba along with F-22 and f-35b stealth
fighter planes North Korea dubs these
military drills as a rehearsal for a
possible invasion
but for the Common People the build-up
of these deadly weapons on the Korean
Peninsula points full looming tragedy
as a South Korean I just cannot tolerate
the fact that North Korea despite being
One race and people tested missiles and
aggravated confrontation between the two
koreas when we are in a period of
mourning for the Taiwan tragedy
the last time North Korea had tested a
nuclear weapon was in 2017. the
explosion at the pange site had resulted
in a yield of about 370 kilotons but
subsequently in 2018 North Korea had
shut down its fungiri testing site by
blowing it up in the presence of some
foreign journalists the high-profile
Summits which Kim Jong-un had held with
Donald Trump aren't forthcoming under
Joe Biden instead the American policy
has been all about sanctions and silence
while Pyongyang has gone on an
exhibitionist mode with missile test

Ukrainian
presidentialenski who hopped through the
European capitals this week lobbying for
Western fighter jets is hopeful that his
wish could be granted soon visit London
the visit to London was effective we got
closer to the decision about long-range
weapons and the training of our Pilots
this is really some step to providing
Ukraine with fighter jets which we need
there are certain agreements which are
not public but which are positive when
it gets to our country our country will
know about it I don't want to prepare
the Russian Federation which is
constantly threatening us with new
aggressions and with a vengeful mood on
the battlefield but Russia has slammed
this possibility stating that it would
be the ukrainians who would suffer if
they used NATO fighter jets in the war
meanwhile the Doomsday Clock has started
to tick dangerously close to midnight
with every passing week what has been
witnessed is a dangerous escalation in
the fighting in Ukraine
and no one at this moment can predict
how this grueling war in Ukraine will
end
the West African nation of Mali is
bracing itself for a renewed push
against the islamist insurgents and to
this end bamako has now purchased some
top-notch Russian fighter jets
International Airport the Malian Hunter
which grandmother in May 2021 received
at least about eight planes and two
helicopters
but experts say that the increased
Reliance on Russian weapons and Russian
mercenaries has hardly made an impact on
the ground our next report gets you the
details
Mali has never officially confirmed this
but for more than a year Russia's Wagner
mercenaries have been active in the
sahil region battling the alcoholic
terrorists besides the Islamic State in
Greater Sahara in a grand ceremony
attended by the Russian Ambassador the
Malian Army took possession of Russian
warplings which will be used against the
islamist insurgents and bandits who have
reached Harvard in Mali
the desire to modernize and equip our
army is not only linked to the security
crisis of course this crisis has shown
the urgency of it but above all it
responds to a fundamental need without
which no undertaking initiated by Mali
can claim success ensuring the security
of its population is not a luxury but a
necessity
since 2012 the Sahel part of Mali has
witnessed one attack after another
the year 2022 has been one of the
bloodiest years in over a decade on the
3rd of June 2022 33 civilians were
killed by the use of improvised
explosive devices that were planted on
roadways
on the 8th of August 50 ethnic songghai
were massacred in an attack on several
villages on the 3rd of December 31
traders in a bus were killed in a mass
firing incident near the bandyagara
market
the number of internally displaced has
been conservatively pegged at over 385
000.
for more than a decade France a former
colonial power in the region had been
helping Mali fight the islamists
but France's inability to crush the
Insurgent violence meant that the French
forces were no longer welcome in the
country and Russia with its growing
geopolitical clout has been only too
happy to fill the void
the fight against terrorism is of course
an issue for the other countries in the
region we are going to provide our
assistance to them to overcome these
difficulties This concerns
and even the coastal States
according to the United Nations the
Malian authorities are in complete
control of just 15 percent of the
country
what is unfolding in Mali at the moment
has been described as a contest between
an army and a clandestine Army for more
than a decade Mali has been the
epicenter of islamist violence in the
sahil region which has since spilled
over into neighboring Burkina Faso and
Niger
oftentimes the civilians killed by the
Malian forces belong to the Fulani
ethnic group which bamaku regards as the
key social base from which the islamist
recruits their Fighters
so will the attack fighter jets from
Russia help the Malian Hunter to crack
down more efficiently on the Insurgency
not even the worst affected communities
in Mali are hoping that things would
change for the better Bureau report

El Salvador has just unveiled the
biggest prison in Latin America
a country that has been at war with
criminal gangs is now upping the ante
an estimated 100 000 people in El
Salvador are already Behind Bars for
context this is almost about two percent
of the total El Salvadoran population
but how far has this Iron Fist policy of
tackling criminal gang violence
succeeded in the Central American Nation
unexport gets you the details
Salvador has some of the most deadly
criminal gangs in the world
from the 1980s the Barrio 18 and the
MS-13 the two most traded criminal gangs
have dominated the streets of El
Salvador
and now the 41 year old president Naya
burkelly wants to lock up every single
criminal gang member
the biggest prison facility that he has
just constructed
with the capacity to hold 40 000
Prisoners the terrorism confinement
Center is built in an expansive 23
hectare complex
the prison has been designed to hold
gang leaders prisoners will have no
contact with the outside world and they
will be escorted out only to appear for
a hearing in the court
we are going to guarantee that all these
people who for decades have caused harm
and murdered Salvadoran families will be
in a place where they will not be able
to leave every single cell has been
built according to International
standards the entire prison has been
built in compliance with International
standards and guarantees security
with seven God Towers the possibility of
a jailbreak is almost impossible the
closest human habitation is about 74
kilometers away
in 2015 El Salvador surpassed Honduras
as the most violent country in the world
with a murder rate of more than a
hundred for every 100 000 inhabitants
but ever since the state of exception
was imposed in March 2022 after a Spate
of murders by the criminal gangs the
police and the Army have gone on
overdrive rounding up suspected gang
members and their collaborators some
constitutional rights have been
suspended arrests have been made without
warrants resulting in El Salvador having
the highest incarceration rate in the
world
but president Naya bukele insists that
things have improved there was a
moderate here of 73 homicides by a
hundred thousand inhabitants the
moderate in 2022 was just three
homicides by a hundred thousand
inhabitants last year the moderate in
soyapongo was similar to the moderate in
Canada
now have the freedom to be what they
