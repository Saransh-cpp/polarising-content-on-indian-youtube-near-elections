button just exactly 48 hours before
general elections 2019 in Chhattisgarh
Maoist have targeted BJP convoy in Tata
vara where the BJP MLA was killed and at
least three cops three crpf Jevons have
been martyred now BJP MLA Bhima Mondavi
convoy was earlier attacked after an ie
blast we are in the burning question
going to ask the Congress party who in
the 2009 manifesto and manifestos after
manifesto also in 2018 assembly polls
manifesto talked about talking to Maoist
and then recently they are talking about
winning them over in the burning
question tonight we asked pre-poll
attack in dante vada is this not the
right time to wipe out entire Maoist or
Nats Elkader also in the burning
question those who have been
vociferously talking about engaging a
dialogue with Naxals we asked will
Congress still promise to win over
Maoist Scudder and also will Congress
still call MAOIs revolutionaries and to
discuss that we have the shovin live

my panelists from the show sean is going
to join ourselves with the Quickfire
inputs as far as the latest information
is considered shall one over to you
what's the latest that you are picking
up the combing operations are underway
anything more
well it would now purely be the on the
investigation site to look into whether
it old there has been any failure as
part of the security apparatus is
concerned given the fact that
politicians have been on the target list
and this is something that has been a
huge cause of concern for the security
forces in fact what I've given given to
understand is that the area where this
particularly incident actually took
place
my sources within crpf say that this is
considered to be a sensitive area
important to point out is that they have
been certain reports that the route
perhaps taken by the legislature was
also changed last moment these are
certain aspects that we'll figure in the
preliminary investigation that would be
carried out by the State Police as well
as the intelligence unit of the CRPF
and perhaps you would get a better idea
as to what really transpired given the
fact that there have been certain
changes that took place as far as the
route is concerned important to point
out is that there have been at least
three ID attacks in the bastard region
in the run-up to the first phase of the
elections in that area and that is the
reason why I see our right shovel taking
all precautionary measures yes in fact
we have seen that route alone axle
attack on Diddy's team that were there
to in fact cover elections just ratchet

point that's very important look it was
Manmohan Singh
it was Chidambaram and more importantly
it was the Home Secretary of chambra
either Manmohan Singh government they
all three in the unison had said that
Maoist are the biggest threat to the
internal security of the country and
that is why the launched operation green

piece together this information from
various sources within the cv dt and
also now at the note that has been
accessed by my colleague aishwarya which
only goes on to indicate that this was
this was something that was going on for
some time and that is the reason why the
income tax departments intelligence unit
picked up certain information the fiu
was actually I got a tip-off say that
money movement actually was taking place
from Mother Pradesh to the national
capital in fact
hawala operators in charlie truck were
questioned by the income tax department
and there afterwards information came in
that unaccounted cash was basically
flowing from Bonta pradesh and it went

going on to indicate that they have
visual evidence to basically suggest how
the body entered that very place now as
far as the the note is concerned there
are important to point out how the money
was being siphoned off to ensure that
this this goes into the hawala route to
a political party and that is exactly
what has been indicated by the income
tax department in fact there have been
electronic evidences that the income tax
department has at this point in time
which also includes the diary entries in
the diary entries you're looking at the
number of people who are actually
beneficiaries of this particular
unaccounted cash but you're looking at
and that is the reason why you have
several people who have already been
called in for questioning by the income
tax department one such person happens
to be a submarine who is a certainly
crucial in this entire you know in this
entire important you know development
that is actually taking place where s

the note detail brief as on 27th of
March 2019 27th of March 2019 and I have

three days there have been raids across
Bhopal raids in New Delhi and the dots

the Transport Department transport
department five thousand four hundred
and forty five lakh rupees of fifty four
crores fifty four crore rupees
from transport department excise
department in MP three thousand six
hundred twenty two lakhs or thirty six
crore rupees from the excise department
and in brackets it says gog gog or
gujarat we don't know but it says 197
lakhs or 1.9 7 crore and from the mining
department five hundred and fifty lakhs
of five hundred 50 crore this is the
congress Havanna know that we are
showing you and from the PWD department
520 lakhs of 5.2 crore rupees now all of
this combined from Urban Development
another 430 lat apiece now this money is
collected by a man close to the Chief
Minister's OSD the account keeper of
camel nuts
OSD had this with him and
the big talking point if we can go back
to the PowerPoint there is a mention of
por hora por la 1200 lakh rupees or 12
crore 12 crore rupees stolen from a
scheme portion of Eon portion a peon is
a government scheme meant for
malnourished children meant for
malnourished children for pregnant
mothers for lactating mothers a
government scheme to ensure that they
get nutrition they get the right amount
of nutrition and this money sent to
States so that they spend by the way
multiple - is a state where you have the
most number of malnourished children in
India will pull out the stats as well
and we have the entire details of how
this money amounting to two hundred and
eighty crore rupees was found with
somebody linked to the Congress part you
know all of this money was collected all
of this is in lakhs was collected was
sent to Delhi and the recipient was
somewhere um to Gluck road to clear out
a lot of people staying two o'clock road
but the money was sent there the money
was sent to candidates as well
someone take us through the official
details as we know it so far shava
well you have about unaccounted cash of
our 281 crore that's what the income tax
department states as of now the seizure
that has been made is about fourteen
point six crore
now this particular document that has
been accessed by my colleague Aishwarya
clearly goes on to indicate how you have
government schemes that were basically
utilized the money from the government
schemes were basically utilized for the
Congress campaign in fact there have
been Congress candidates whose names
have also been there in this particular
hawala note what we have picked up from
our sources within the financial
intelligence unit of the income tax
department essentially is that over the
last couple of months we have seen and
there have been some amount of money
movement that took place from Mother
Pradesh all the way to the national
capital this was being done over a
period of time when the income tax
department actually got a tip off that
this money was actually a making the
round through the hawala route
now after proper questioning of the
chatter of hawala operators in Chandni
Chowk area when we give it to understand
that one fine day with the income tax
department laid a trap they basically
saw money movement actually taking place
in two-block area the very area that you
were pointing out in origin where the
entry of the money actually took place
in that in that area that has now been
captured in camera and this is an
evidence that the income tax department
has going back to this particular
document where you've seen certain
amount of noting that a bid made which
is a clear reflection of the fact how
government schemes were basically being
miss utilized in a mother Pradesh itself
how funds were basically were being
siphoned off and all of that allegedly
been used for Congress parties
campaigning now that's extremely
important in fact the income tax
department is saying that this is a
large-scale operation that has been
carried out over 50 places where these
raids have been carried out on in the
last couple of days and they say there
is enough electronic evidence to
basically suggest that yes there was bid
money movement that poker so Aishwarya
are these John let me just quickly go
close to Aishwarya as we as we quickly
play out play play that entire graphic
once again Aishwarya take us to this
document and what this document proves
this evening
Niranjan 280 crore rupees ledger and
this ledger has been accessed from the
closest of the closest aide of Nana de
but MP Chief Minister Kamala and these
are government documents this has been
recovered by the income tax in the
income tax rates and if you see this
ledger total of 280 crores that is there
those saucy 280 crores right there on
the screens and now if you see maximum
12 crores coming from portion a
Harlingen portion aha reza scheme which
is run by the state government of Madhya
Pradesh through which through which they
pay for the for the food and nutrition
of children aging from 6 months to 6
years so the money has been taken out -
so the plate the food has been taken
away from the poor for the election
campaigning of the Congress party and
that's not it you see others mining you
see PWD you see Urban Development and so
on so forth this is a Congress hawala
cash not a complete ledger and according
to the ID documents 2703 2019 by 11:50
p.m. that's how massive this is this is
Asma gets any tournament there are 60
Tula xp1 kronite tip lakhs 3wt 520 lat
and so on so forth open development
portal 30 lakhs and then John Foster and
AHA this is massive 1200 rupees manager
this is equivalent of taking their food
from the poor torrent of taking away
food from the poor to run your election
campaign and this money then goes this
money then goes to the ICC according to
this note this money goes to the to
those candidates who are contesting from
the Congress Party's ticket in this
state according to this ledger according
to this document and this is not only
startling this is something which the
Congress party rather how can they do it
this is shameful in the dungeon taking
away food away from these poor to
run your election campaign this is
something which is never utter this is
completely unheard of and we are basing
all of this on these IT documents which
have been recovered from the closest of
the closest aide of the MP Chief
Minister Kamala and the shows that how
money is coming in and going out both it
has the movement of money coming in and
money going out both ways niranjan it's
a complete ledger in and out credit and
debit if you could call it so because
that's how synchronized that's our
systematic this whole system was in the
state of Madhya Pradesh their engine
well doesn't mention there's a clear
mention of PCC AICC we don't know what
dimensions are we won't stick our neck
out and say it but if I can just play
out the expenses expenses portion on
this wall there is there are two
portions one a received of all the money
that they have collected and where all
of this money is going in the received
part from where the money is coming from
dimensioned transport department
dimension excise department dimension
mining department dimension PWD
Department the mansion urban department
and the most shocking aspect dimension
poha or the portion AHA or the portion
are beyond now where was all of this
money going here is where it was going
expenses in the cash register
check PCC PCC we are not guessing what
PCC is but PCC was given one zero eight
two lakh rupees or 10.8 crore rupees
next cash to PCC 1000 lakhs or ten crore
apiece
next there was a mention of Delhi - a
ICC what is Delhi a ICC what is Delhi a
ICC Delhi a ICC receives 17,000 1,700
1,700 lakh or 17 crore rupees next
election bond a ICC election bond a ICC
200 lakhs or two crore apiece next
where was this money going leaders who
are these leaders 95 95 lakh rupees next
MLAs received four hundred forty point
five lakh that
for 4.4 crore candidates were given 430
lat appease a 4.3 crore rupees next
other expenses went 450 5 lakhs of 4.5
crore rupees now you have collected
money in all 140 1.5 crore that's 1 4 1
5 8 all of that in lakhs 141 crore 140
1.5 crore total receipts of 281 crore in
the raids that have been ongoing 281
crore rupees have been seized 281 crore
rupees of which 141 crore they were
planning to give candidates to AICC to
PCC different people in aicc Delhi AICC
and then Delhi PCC what was going on
Aishwarya most shocking aspect where was
the money coming from the money was
coming from government schemes than the
most shocking aspect is that one of the
schemes meant for start-up poorest of
the poor or unheard of yes poorest of
the poor unheard of money routing on
hard money wrongly talk about that
scheme from which money was routed hard
money routing this is unhard money
routing taking away the platter of the
poor taking away the food of the poor
taking away out of this is that's what
the poor are poor Shahar scheme this is
something which is for the downtrodden
dungeon and you take 12 crore rupees out
of it how can you know elected
government has the right to take away in
every single penny this is lost to a
checker direct if this IT node is to be
completely believed so this is something
which the state Chief Minister needs to
explain say how under which rule how can
he forget one forget mining there are 10
different schemes 10 different
ministries niranjan from where money is
coming out
how can he he's not allowed under the
Constitution under the law of the land
thus the law of the land needs to follow
now if the sightly note and as you said
what a ICC means everyone knows we don't
need to say what PCC means we don't need
to say
certain ml is how more brazen they are
going to be so it's a complete ledger of
in and out total money comes in two to
two hundred and eighty lakhs total
expenditure 141 crores so this is
something which is as massive that when
you are siphoning off money from
government for your private work this is
a scam this is nothing less than a scam
from 10 different divisions of the
common dungeon the MP come take a short
break was really what we'll do at this
point
I swear and shaman I shouldn't shower I
shouldn't stay with me so we've been
breaking since yesterday details of the
raids and how a senior leader of the
Congress party went in sat at a house
where one of these raids was taking
place in all two hundred and eighty-one

number of course hundred ten politicians

couple of days back when they just the
other tried to meet him and Archie

[Music]
good evening and welcome railgun they
ran from our cameras and ahem earth
Patel has started a music and the
Congress Party which swears by the
Enforcement Directorate when I exposed
allocate a few years back now calls it
Edie stands for election the Khosla or
election fraud but despite him one thing
is clear that they who said chalky that
chore head have three days after being
exposed of their links with 2g and NSEL
scam stirs Sanjay Chandra and Jignesh
Shah remember I told you about Rahul
Gandhi's scam Stirling's and now with
the whole world being told that
Christian Michele was in touch the red
touch with mrs. Gandhi these people
don't say chalk it out to her anymore
and in fact when Rahul Gandhi was
shouted down by Modi supporters at an
event in Pune unbelievably Rahul Gandhi
on the retreat when he was surrounded
everywhere by people chanting Modi
started saying I also love body short of
chanting modey modey modey himself he
said I also love Modi now that's a long
shot from shouting chalk it out your
hair a few weeks back with
uncontrollable frenzy so yes it seems to
me that things are changing it seems to
me that the elections are turning but
one thing that would never turn and one
thing that is shameless and one thing
that will never change even after
radhiya even after the Agusta expose
ladies and gentlemen you guessed it
right is the Luo Tian's media they are
shameless they have now come together to
defend journalists whose names appeared
in the August a chargesheet
unbelievable this is their problem this
conspiracy of mutual self-help is what
weakens
they almost destroyed stature of the
nutrients media in the eyes of the
people of this country
you see when some editors buy farmhouses
and lived like debauched and shameless
Roman emperors on salaries that would
not allow 1% of the riches they garishly
display and they are not even ashamed of
it and when exposed use secularism as a
card to defend their acts of moral
impropriety than ladies and gentlemen it
does not surprise me that none of them
open their mouths when the Vadra family
promises in its manifesto that when the
vodka family comes back to power it will
end the independence of the Indian media
they don't even talk about it but
tonight on the debate I will talk about
it - yes I have a packed show for you

[Music]
if you
in Delhi said in Delhi one one okay okay
I'll speak now I want to tell you about
yesterday much Patel I want to tell you
about mr. Patel and just before I speak
about mr. emmett but then let me tell
you let me say one thing have you ever
heard any reporter in Delhi ever take
the name of a mud patel you was let me
tell you a few truths about how delhi
media operates these people say you
can't talk about Narendra Modi which is
the damn lie you can talk about Narendra
Modi you can attack him abuse him as
much as you want which happens every day
every single day but you know whether it
is the fake Scrolls or the lying wires
or the unprintable prints who don't even
have the decency to report or do some
genuine self disclosure when it comes to
their own matters you know one thing he
was the one person you are told when
you're a reporter in Delhi you are told
this on video just kindly and I'm adding
gracefully be quiet for 20 minutes
otherwise I left to zip your lips I'm
saying something important viewers
in Delhi were told never report on him
out put him in Delhi you are told never
report on a hospital it's one of those
unwritten truths second thing is told
anything to do with money and the Gandhi
Vadra family Vadra Gandhi family has to
go through a mud Patel the third thing
it is told that how is it in this shift
between Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi
which I don't think is the shift at all
because the the Vadra family is in focus
all the time the one person who remained
important in both dispensations has been
Emeth patel because they say that he's
the mr. moneybags of the Congress party
even now
viewers you will find the Agusta story
under played you will find oblique
references you will not find it making
front pages the Luo Tian's media is
treating you every minute they will try
and report on everything they will not
yesterday also last night is Koran I am
Telling You they did not honor I'll tell
you one thing melancholy everyone they
did not take a mat Patel's name till
Republic TV ran it for tours it was an
in short they are so scared of Ahmad
Patel ki KI much Patel will get after us
because I think the media has a lot I
want to tell you the gutter politics yes
a village capodanno so I never thinks of
a village Pathan yeah there was this
scared of a mud but he said I don't
respect his face how villagers singing
that he is on the other
I want to know I don't I don't think
he's you know when I look at anybody
I was I want to ask the weak knees I
want to ask the weak much because it's a
question will come via the scale of a
math button to Dartmouth Patel's if I
call a mug Patel why bonus why that the
scale of some connection so many poor
does he know something about them why
this kind of a model its current
Bhandari why do why do they all get
scared when they comes to a mug Patel
why are they not reporting on the Emmett
Patel truth why they not yes sir range
wrote and let me speak the truth tonight
the factions in this country fact is
this fam which a few days ago was being
called the first family of India is the
first family of corruption in India
Korea to G which I was on your debate
couple of days ago be at Unitec with
Gandhi bought property strong but
they're not disclosed in his 2014
affidavit be it AgustaWestland scam
every scam in India has its roots in the
first family there is no scam which
happens in UPA without it going to the
first family it's like the Italian
Godfather novels let me wet my beak
every deer in India the first family has
to wet its beak they have to bring the
Italian mafia laws in India where no
Dean happens without their wetting their
beak and their beak is a huge
magnificent sized bite of India's money
of India's GDP that is what is happening
with the first family they are a Mafia
family who does not let any deal go
through without a cut coming to them you
know I tell you one thing
no I asked you one can I share a
headline with you I want to share I want
to send some information okay now now
let me share something with you
melancholy Nollan to only one met one
day we are going to be
okay one sec one sec one nulling Kony's
on the debate right now it's surrender
Chauhan Nalin Kohli and surrender on who
have not spoken should be allowed into
the debate I will just make one
observation before I start and surrender
John first and then Alan will respond
let's be civil to each other yes
Surendra Chauhan I haven't I have
noticed something can I share with you
what I have noticed viewers have you
noticed have you noticed what I have
noticed what is that I'm just asking the
viewers have you noticed music or have
no say can you guess what I have noticed
okay let me share it you notice let me
share with you what I've noticed please
I have noticed yeah that the 50 year old
adolescent of your party no longer goes
around saying chalky touch your hair
after his name got exposed in Unitec 2g
Christian Michele have you noticed that
country is saying now have you noticed
finally kindly go to the contains of
that
have you noticed have you noticed that
and when he tried to say chalky that
aura and poner today the entire crowd
went modey modey modey and then he says
no no I also love moody did you notice
that also did you hear him say I love
moody did you hear and say I love moody
surrender John you can't hear me or
you're stunned
no I'm hearing I'm hearing you I'm
listening to you you see he has never
said I love is this a movie because all
clouds started going both the movie
movies like joannesharpe stop shouting
roach four of you on the debate the
whole clouds were in both the multi mode
liking this like that is that I also
love
now you are losing the plot here what
the pole tempo you know what losing the
plot you'd side with us in spokesmen out
whatever five volts the charge by home
ministry
and he goes into the country what is
your compulsion you see you you know you
know I'll tell you one thing I want to
say one but I would I want to say one
thing I'd say one thing before Darlene
Foley comes I'll say one thing before
narleen Coley comes today one second
Rahul Gandhi in January 2019 I met him
okay I want to meet him again instead of
calling a radio jockey to interview him
I'll say something I'm not being rude as
Quran now rahul gandhi's only gets
interviewed by radio jockeys I also like
radio jockeys but if he thinks radio
jockeys are the best people to interview
him that's his problem
why didn't Raul then they call me to
Cooney I would have interviewed him
before the entire audience
on a serious note I bring back to the
issue of corruption I asked you I asked
to Nollan Poli
on the issue of corruption my question
is who's on the front foot now
corruption Nalin Kohli was sent to
render Chauhan who's on the front foot
now on the issue of corruption is where
the debate is now poised Nollan Kony
know why why the between the BJP and the
Congress as follows under the BJP it is
action against the corrupt under the
Congress it is lip service it's four
decades of lip service if you look at
very be at our everything they don't
implement so what has become clear is
that now there is a comment and the
Prime Minister Modi that is moving on
its commitments following up following
up everything on due process of law
nothing is happening which is outside
your process of law whether it's the
extradition treaty between India and UAE
that finally got Christian misciagna and
that to incumbent of India put up a
robust defense aggressively in UAE way
he was trying to resist it now what's
happening is asn't one we are having
these middlemen who are the gatekeepers
to the deals in a very oil this system
if I may use that word and then they are
the ones who control the system to get
sort of hold on and of course hefty
amounts are exchanged now in India what
I find amazing is all the people on the
panel but robust standing for the
contrast not one has said we would like
to know who took the bribe in India not
other shots
I mean corruption is your money my money
everyone's money
behind anybody that they forget about
they can support the Gandhi family they
can oppose the fight against your
government couldn't Phil pull a single
promise right now said the youth
Enforcement Directorate mr. Coley you
don't trust your Enforcement Directorate
did you read the charge as well as the
main enforcement field is an agency
under a statute by the government for
investigation of crime it doesn't belong
to you me doesn't run on money that woke
up chicks and give it to me now you must
at least understand the scheme or
something before you make an argument I
mean if you don't do your homework sir
then your argument is not going to hold
what do you mean mine force Rendlesham
there's no such thing is my enforcement
direction it's the enforcement the clip
when the radio jock try to protect when
the radio job tried to protect when the
radio in the radio jock tried to protect
Rahul Gandhi from being from that
situation this is what happened in Pune
today back in 30 seconds viewers that
exactly
cannot be devoid of love and affection
for family and for people around you and
also my family yeah
so people around you flocks and look
more I love mr. Narendra Modi I
genuinely I genuinely I genuinely have
no hatred toward the man at all
no anger
I have no end
I have no anger towards or hatred
towards mr. Nimmo he has he has he has
anger towards me it's fine it's fine no
problem you see this kind of
stage-managed event will go out of
control
you see and what happens is this kind of
stupid step or grandstanding I love Modi
you know this is does he think he's in
kindergarten talking to class one
students no yeah there's a problem the
problem is with comprehension I think
there are four again I don't know what
he was talking
[Laughter]
anakata
what else is this if not abused when you
say that the Prime Minister is given
30,000 clothes - Anil Ambani
okay so here's I have a question for you
one second one second one second one
just just saw just one me just why would
he keep judgment just fair thing just
one minute so you know what's the first
you know in any shot they shot the
question for you they shot the question
for you please listen to me decide the
question for you
Nishant the question for you Nishant the
question for you a question for you
nisshin's before that an observation of
mine I genuinely believe Rahul Gandhi
u.s. tradition at this stage of the
campaign should finally meet me instead
of trying to do some you know funny
appearances before students being
interviewed by radio jocks did the radio
jock ask him that mr. Gandhi what role
will emerge Patel have in your future
party and government given his links
with Agosta
mr. Gandhi did you are you the son of
the Italian like him a volume down what
are you the son of the Italian who met
Christian Michelle's not some mr. Gandhi
volume-down don't distract me serious
mr. Gandhi mr. Gandhi radio talk to the
radio talk ask him mr. Gandhi why did
you have separate deals with 2g scam -
Sanjay Chandra and NSEL scam stir
janeshia I doubt if the radio joke would
have heard of the NSEL scam did the
radio talk ask him that mr. Gandhi how
does you how is it that you and your
sister get the entire land value of your
farmhouse in one and a half months of
rent and how is it that your poor both
paid four hundred and three percent the
market value of the farmhouse in simply
rent a rental deposit these are the kind
of questions which are all Gandhi should
be us not stupid question like do you
love your family do you love the country
I mean what is this rubbish going on
it's infantile beyond measure
now only Luo Tian's media will allow it
and tolerate it
it makes one
now here's a here's a point my question
is this no no no I'll be at the ready
straight now I've had taken enough
rubbish listen to me now you you dare
Modi to act on August ah he did and now
you are in panic mode you demanded
answers on in action by IDI on 17th May
2016 the Congress party on its website
said only noise now when the universe
was suffering a personality award
[Applause]
which takes all the I have a question
for you you know first of all I want to
say this what a sock I have a question
for you
in my view findings in my view result as
a cracker question here observation and
a question in my view Rahul Gandhi is
the only one who has a false sense of
who he is he keeps saying I'm tolerant
I'm loving I love I tolerate it I love I
tolerate I think he's got a limited
vocabulary not just a limited
intelligence what my question is because
when I met Eli only spoke about women's
empowerment now he only speaks about
love and accommodation and tolerance
if I want to tell you Rahul Gandhi if
Rahul Gandhi has so much love why does
he not have love for the public TV and
allow the Republic TV reporters allow me
to allow me to please listen if he has
tolerance and love I have a question why
does he why does he why does he beat up
the Republic TV cameras and not allow
the Republic TV reporter to ask him a
question he goes into panic I'm told I'm
told rocky goes into a cold sweat when
he sees the logo I am willing to go
one-on-one with Rahul Gandhi on earth I
want to go one-on-one with Rawls only 10
minutes he will be my onion for the day
I want to ask you now on a serious note
on a serious note on a few minutes
listen to me listen to me please listen
to me the Congress Party welcomed the
CBI investigation into the via pom scam
which means that when the investigating
agencies do your bidding you like it
they welcomed that they demanded a probe
by the Enforcement Directorate in the
veda when the Vedanta controversy broke
out in December 2010 when there was
alleged monetary benefit by some mla's
in Orissa Congress party says only the
Enforcement Directorate must investigate
it today that same enforcement
directorate you says election the cause
laughs you demanded an enforcement
directorate probe into the ad diaries
case they were full faith in the IDI
therefore now the ideas exposed mrs.
Gandhi
and I promise you I promise you you I
was one family wrote your lucky day you
know I know in the Congress media sell
you know the Congress media sell Randeep
Surjewala who goes around telling people
that I will allow you will if you do
positive stories for us which won't work
so devala listen to me
now mr. Surjewala listen stop protecting
Rahul Gandhi Soulja wala thinks he's
wrong on this media nanny he's not there
is a fellow called Surjewala he believes
his Rahul Gandhi's media nanny he has to
protect Rahul Gandhi was
entire collection he has made his entire
job protecting law or Gandhi from
Republic TV I'm asking you Rahul Gandhi
grew up do you need a you need a media
nanny do you need a media and I need all
Gandhi do you need a media nanny role
anyway if you do then it's your choice
I'm asking one question of that so that
was on a lighter note
now I'm going direct now I'm going
direct I wonder I would like to as Rahul
Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi countries
directly for the day if they can't reach
me directly our onion under them willing
to offer a concession I'm willing to
interview Rahul Gandhi with his media
and Annie Randeep Surjewala sitting next
to him
if he feels more comfortable and
protected you know but I will ask them
only one question I will ask them was
one family bribe was one family bribe
was one family bribed Roach what do you
think when I look at the way Rahul
Gandhi ran away Oregon side Ronnie on
one side because bound sides and on the
other side and on the other side amuck
Patel's breaking into I want to show

we watch watch this I said I'm breaking
away from the commercial break know what
too much okay once a few an innocent
nation okay
he was he was well he was one reveals
one request what I am going to do you
now is a live demonstration of the cheap
and dirty way in which Congress party
tries to threaten journalists
continually okay in case in June 2019
you had to go away for an interview with
permissions of mr. Surjewala and in June
2009 he happens to be the Minister of
Information and Broadcasting yes how
would you address him this I will call
him rahul gandhi's media insane I will

festival is gonna take place to see the
arrangements out there so every day is
different I should say it's even because
the festival but you will see the
preparations for what goes to do making
the festival success so now so if mr.
Conrad Sangma is coming outside of his
residence and he will be meeting the
public that has gathered here you can
see a lot of people come here on a daily
basis wherever he is here because
students to be the bastion of the Sangha
family and the people out have a lot of
aspirations and have a lot of hope on
family to do a garden owner is
given to him and his residence here in
[Music]
Tehran check in Meghalaya please buckle
in car it in ESI window ghetto tomorrow
someone got poor how do you hate
children ermengarde we're just filming
dirt be fair
now we are heading towards judaculla
cray where the simple is to have a set
you'll program and as you can see after
meeting more than 200 people at his
residence and also having a meeting for
the by-election of cell-cell a
constituency the same Minister is now
living for a colloquy and from there
yeah after visiting the
wangala Dance Festival crown he will be
today living for so long so easy to
general practice everyday to meet so
many people here yes it is and as I said
that to Raisa has been you know a place
which has been represented by my late
father and obviously my sister and
myself for a very long time and so we we
are very connected with the people here
and people are very free I should say
when they come to our house the people
will come into my bedroom also sometimes
you saw there were people waiting
outside this is how it is and as we
always say with day you know we are here
to connect and then when people expect
so therefore it happens everyday almost
yes and sometimes it's even more than
what it is today but for me all the
entire state is important and our
endeavor has been in fact to balance the
kind of development that we're giving
but yes garriga's has specific you know
issues that need to be looked into
infrastructure has to be improved a lot
and obviously people are lot into
farming out here but we're not seeing so
much of support and not so much of value
being added to the farming that is being
done out here so I think there's a lot
of scope that we can work and improve
the livelihood and the overall economic
condition of the people throughout the
state and for that you know it is
important overall as I said to improve
the governance and the delivery
mechanism in the state as a whole and
that has been one of my main concerns
since we took over is to ensure that
every rupee that we spent must have the
maximum output and effect with the
grassroot level my my family that is my
wife and my two daughters they
they live in Delhi because my eldest
elder daughter is studying there so when
I'm in Shillong actually there's nobody
I'm alone in the house so which is a
from a family point of view yes it's you
know difficult sometimes but if you look
at it from the point of view of work I
you know I really I can give more than
14 15 hours a day so that's the good
part so I I mean this I don't need to
come home early you know as such so
that's why we we do go early to office
and we stay there quite late but yes
whenever we get a chance or when I'm in
Delhi or something I obviously I spend
some time with my family my daughter and
my wife we go for movies games yes we
play some games because last time we we
had a match with Bachchan booty esteem
and now our cabinet colleagues are so
excited about it that you know there we
are proposing in fact that we should
have a match with the Press Club match
with the opposition football match with
the officers and in fact last time and I
had gone to to money pour I just came
back from money pool so I'm even
proposing that I should say maybe on
your channel I'll challenge the
Arunachala and money put another North
East Chief Minister's cabinet for a
friendly match with with my cabinet so
so that would be something that will be
interesting also one thing about Megan I
have most of the politicians here
anyone for that matter had a very close
association of which in music yes and
the zips along is always called the rock
capital of Mahalaya now of the India so
you have been also into music yes
absolutely and as I said I'm still in
touch with my band so this was the
1995-96 the band was called saga as a ga
so it's like a you know
in the story mostly into I was a the
lead guitarist in there so I so play
lead guitar and so we had a band James
used to be the the vocalist lead singer
and then we had some friends from school
and they were together so we should go
into a bit into hard rock in rock music
I use too many times I've done that so
let's let's leave it for another
interview
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
Oh
[Music]
yay
[Music]
[Music]
dudu recollect Lee is still in the
construction and if you come now then a
bumpy ride is a master and you can see
save Minister Conrad Sangma also taking
a complete right to do rock ala crate
and it is on the foothills we are now on
the foothills of no crate not cret peak
which happens to be the highest peak in
girls at 14:40 meters and it's almost
equivalent or you can say somewhat
taller than salon if I'm not wrong so
how far is the village from here not too
far
we should be getting there quite soon
but more importantly this entire region
and this particular area is actually the
you know one of the bio reserves in the
country so that's one very important
aspect and number two for Garo Hills
this is the actual catchment area of two
major rivers there is a song river and
the canal river so after traveling for
more than two and a half hours and
covering a distance of only around 40
kilometers we are now here in the record
era and
you can see here the people are already
here to welcome the SIP Minister among
them
[Music]
[Music]
well it is also an outreach program but
as I said this is the catchment area for
you know the two major rivers for
huggles and most of the water supply
that comes to the major towns is from
here
so therefore the catchment area for even
the torah' River the canal river which
supplies is in this area so basically we
as I said it's all community owned in
one way and therefore the community
participation and in one way the
permission is also very necessary so we
need to carry the people along so it's a
meeting to really discuss with them on
the necessity of you know allowing the
water to be taken for thourough and in
the process how we could work towards
giving more development in this region
so it's really to look at both angles
and to serve the people or gargles in
general whether it's here in this
village in this area or to
[Music]
we have to connect with the grassroot
and so therefore this is most probably a
very very disconnected part you saw the
roads so therefore I you know it
appealed to me more that I should go for
this meeting I didn't need to be here in
this meeting it's just a signing of an
MoU between the villages and the PhD
department to actually take the water
supply from here to for Torah because
this is as I said the catchment area but
the important part was that since the
people from here are agreeing to give to
the people of Turin you know thinking
about garages and megaliths state in
general I think government should also
show that importance and connect with
them and try to do something for them
also so the idea was that we have come
to thank them at the same time ask them
of what we can do for them so they have
demanded that the road connectivity is
bad which you yourself saw so that's
going to be a major issue though they
have got all the water here they don't
have storage facility for the water and
distribution so they're demanded for
that they don't have any kind of medical
facility out here so that is something
important for us and they're saying that
since we're giving the water to tuturro
town so they can be some kind of
employment opportunity for the boys and
youth sorry boys and girls from this
part so those are kind of issues that
they were discussing about office yes I
would be I would think so yes is the
first time it's below so where we're now
heading towards Mouse nation now I think
it's it's 4 p.m. and I think I can see
you also slightly getting weaker and
weaker so I think we'll go and have
lunch now definitely so let's join same
Minister Conrad Sangma
the table for lunch
[Music]
in the villages if you go there it'll be
the rice will be wrapped in banana
leaves and this is uh actually the best
plate that you can have normally these
plates are also not there it's just a
banana leaf
it's very biodegradable you know and
it's very clean way of actually getting
so it was done you know by our
forefathers but it really makes a lot of
sense and it's you know there's no
messing cleaning up the dishes this and
that yeah absolutely
absolutely this is a maybe most probably
my favorite dish with all of this this
is pumpkin and pork so so in fact this
is that gone viral you know when I had
mentioned one set what is my favorite
dish so everywhere I go
this is cook now so these are all this
is all again the fish it's smoked fish
again very nice so this is a was boiled
chicken this courses I'm guessing that
the squash here is grown locally and
this area in fact produces a large
amount of squash I think almost close to
the last numbers I got was almost close
to 50 metric tons 50 metric tons of
squash is grown here without any kind of
support from the government help so we
really are looking at and it is this
organic it's all can absolutely organic
I think you can keep talking I'll keep
eating yeah sure so as you enjoyed is so
let's proceed and have the lunch with
SIP Minister Conrad Sangha
[Music]
I have known that this area is to be a
highly militant infested area but how
the problem was solved and what
initiative you are taking so that the
future ridiculous ition can be
controlled well it was actually a very
strong effort from the police department
and of course many operations took place
and it was a mixture of all talks
operations you know and involvement of
society in volume of church leaders
involvement of the headman's so it was a
really you know kind of a society
movement that took place and everybody
realized the difficulty that everybody
is facing because of this and so
therefore there was some of course tough
situations where in the militants also
work feel quite well you know organized
so the police department did a
tremendous job public was involved
heavily in it and as a society in
general was involved so that's how
things happened and for the future it's
very important that whatever commitments
have been given now they must be kept
that's very important that the energy of
these youths must be channelized in the
right direction there must be
it's a socio-economic you know problem
so we really new focus on socio-economic
issues and I think that's what's going
to be the crux of how to ensure that
this doesn't come out again I have been
in politics probably a long time in fact
I've been campaigning with my that time
is my late father mister PS son-in-law
so it is something that has been kind of
something that's been in our system for
a very long time seeing the public
working for the public so it become it
became more of a natural thing at that
point and obviously you know after
seeing what he has done the kind of
visions we had and the kind of things he
wanted to do that inspired us a lot and
that's why you find my brother also and
my sister also in it and we are all here
to really take his dream and his ideas
forward and really work for our people
so that is what it was and we're happy
that we're getting this opportunity and
really this is something that we really
want to ensure that we can do as much
good for the people and for the state as
possible but it's today's been a hectic
day because we've been really
we'll come to this interior location and
what is good is that I just got to know
that the people from the village have
agreed to our requests of allowing the
water source to be taken from here and
similarly the government is agreed to
give them the development schemes that
they deserve together so it's been a
good day so and I think they are a good
lunch also yes of course and this was
Conrad well I think obviously it is very
important for us to take the state
forward from economic point of view and
really in order to ensure that there is
good governance we need to ensure that
there is transparency there is
monitoring there's accountability so we
really want to really stress on these
aspects you know we want to make the
system work and I hope that in the
coming years we will have good and
strong infrastructure in the region and
in the state specifically I'm hoping
that will be opened up to more trade in
the future with not only our neighboring
countries but also export oriented we
are hoping that we'll be working more
towards value addition I'm hoping that
the young generation will become more
enterprising and we'll have more
entrepreneurship specially local
entrepreneurship coming up I'm hoping
the tourism sector will really develop
out here and we'll get more high-end
tourism coming in here so that real
value for tourism comes in so there are
many ideas and dreams and I hope that
that'll happen and but most important I
think it's the young generation that I
really hope that will start
participating in the whole whole process
of economic development of the state and
it's only then can we see a real change
that will take place and government will
do its part we'll create the
infrastructure the policies but it is
the younger generation that has to take
the lead and so what message would you
like to give to the younger generations
well I think if our country and as the
dream of the Prime Minister is to become
a new India you know it is the young
generation that has to take as leader
and as I said it again and again a
government will do its part in creating
the inference the policy of the
ecosystem but until unless the youth do
not become more enterprise and do not
start you know getting some self
involved in entrepreneurship and really
sometimes taking a calculated risk also
I think the nation would not be able to
move forward
the line so I urge the youth that be
part of the nation-building be part of
the economic development of the state of
the country and that's how we'll be able
to create a new India thank you so much
it was a great day spent with you thank
you so much",True,en,53294,18,636

all right what we are breaking right now
viewers is the biggest and the most
sensational story to hit your television
screens this election season watch it
very closely Republic has been able to
accept the full August a chargesheet my
colleague Ethel has been able to do that
for us he joins us in our studios in
just a moment
but some very very important details
coming in the point number one the
Enforcement Directorate actually tells
you a P is equal to Emma Patil this is
what Christian Michele actually has told
the Enforcement Directorate Christian
Michele again the middlemen who you see
that on your screens who was extradited
by the Narendra Modi government and the
full August a chargesheet has been
accessed by Republic TV f a.m. again is
a one diary entry that you had seen
everyone was talking about it what is f
AM F a.m. is family we are putting our
accepts of that chart sheet again on
your screens where the Enforcement
Directorate now says that they have been
able to crack the entire case what has
also been revealed is that there was a
reference to mrs. Gandhi Christian
Michele actually spilling the beans he
is not mincing his words unequivocally
the story is becoming bigger in fact he
also tells the agency since when was he
aware about the linkages to Sonia Gandhi
ap again means Ahmad Patel is the
confirmation that has come in F a.m. is
family will try to get it all our
colleagues reporting on that story as
Christian Michele now is exposing the
family and again when the opposition say
that this is political vendetta because
this is a man who was allowed to escape
this is a man was not brought to the
books but now the Enforcement
Directorate remember has been telling us
that they have certain questions to him
the reason why the interrogation again
became very very important now one by
one he is telling you that what was the
modus operandi how did the money
exchanged hands is everything that
Christian Michele now has told the
agencies Michelle confirms AP was no one
but Ahmad Patel FA
was actually the family the family here
is a clear reference to the Gandhis the
full August a chargesheet now has been
accessed by Republic al-khaliq Nalini
and Aishwarya will both join us with
more details on that story and I will
again reiterate a colleague Ethel has
been able to access an entire chart
sheet for you viewers a story again that
will have huge ramifications this
election season Aishwarya the biggest
story is breaking here on Republic ap
was mr patan√® F a.m. was family well
absolutely but this is the biggest
single handed expose which Republic is
doing and our colleague at all has got
this detail these documents this
plethora of evidence which shows that
what exactly was happening
Edie is naming Emma Patel we have the
complete documents in opposition and as
you can see it's not only one litre but
then son of the Italian lady we leave it
to the people to decide that who is the
son of the Italian lady who exactly is
the man who could have been the next
Prime Minister of India at that point of
time and influence such a massive deal
it's as big as it's get deeply that is
what we are saying that who could be the
son of the Italian lady who could have
been that son of the Italian lady who
could have been the Prime Minister
that's what's being mentioned in this
yes Emma Patel as you can see in those
graphics on your screens is mentioned
but then son of the Italian lady who
could be the Prime Minister and then if
you see very very minutely the inner
ring of the Empress was compromised
these so this is something which was
being looked into
so these documents are very very
sensitive and they are going to give you
and we are going to get more and more
information
every minut information we are going to
get it out today we have the evidence in
opposition and I have with us with me
our executive editor Abhishek Kapoor
who's also
joining a bee shake right so as we were
saying knew her since 1986-87 Christian
Michele has spilled the beans christian
michele has spoken under pressure of the
agencies the truth has ultimately come
out it has been revealed and you are
seeing all of this only and only on
Republic Media Network this is what oh
this is what everyone was trying to hide
this is what everyone the complete that
then political dispensation was trying
to hide yes you know aishwarya i'm not
sure whether you do have that chart
sheet or not but i'm also totally
cathode is on way to the studios he will
just join us here in a moment remember
the story is actually breaking in
real-time the story to be very fast
you know aishwarya because at a point
where Nalini was telling us more about
ratanpur you stilling is being
interrogated by the Enforcement
Directorate is there more evidence
are there more revelations tell us more
about what you've been able to see
through as you've produced through that
entire charge sheet for a search for DP
we have every document every document
from page one till the last page and
every document is explosive every
information every line is explosive we
are going to bring it decipher it word
by word line by line but the major
takeaway is that at the end political
dispensation was completely completely
compromised and this is not what we are
saying this is what the agencies are
saying this is what the agencies have
 up and they are not stopping
there so this is something which is as
massive as it's get the IDI chart sheet
reveals the family the IDI chart sheet
is naming the leaders the IDI chart
sheet is naming the inner ring of that
time studio she has in position those
entire 52 pictures here when it comes to
the big chart sheet up a shake please
take it over and tell us more about what
we are learning from this
Deepti this is a confirmation of lot of
information that has been there already
in public domain but the difference this
time is that this is on papers
this is submitted in the court this is
now there for the courts to decide what
exactly happened what level of
corruption exactly happened in the
augustawestland case now you know
christian michele has been in custody of
the enforcement directorate of indian
agencies for the last three months the
early of charge sheet that was filed
last year in 2018 was based on
documentary evidence and all the data
that had been collected by agencies but
this time the difference between this
charge sheet and the earlier one is that
this is based on questioning of
Christian mission now one very
interesting aspect that I thought I
should bring to the notice of vs. that
the card sheet mentions that both the
accused that is Christian Michelle and
Rajiv Saxena
they have never raised an allegation of
any threat or portion at the time of
recording of statement under Section 50
in the Enforcement Directorate custody
under Section 50 of the Prevention of
Money Laundering actor so what is
important is that all this information
which is now which now stands
corroborated is something which has been
given or confirmed willingly by both
Christian Michelle and Rajiv Saxena now
you see in january christian michelle
was brought to India he was taken into
custody he was questioned first by the
CBI and then the Enforcement Directorate
based on his questioning the agency has
got to Rajiv Saxena Rajiv Saxena was
brought from the UAE when he was
questioned under custody he turned
approval he came more data some pendrive
now what is important
Deepti is that for the first time
perhaps Christian Michelle on record or
in a a following judicial process has
agreed with the questions or the
questions
were given to him and answers that he
has given essentially corroborate the
fact of topmost leadership of the then
UPA government involved in fixing the
AgustaWestland case at that time of the
AgustaWestland deal for example if I
read couple of lines from the things
that are there in this document which is
now part of court records and which
would be adjudicated now it says that we
had fixed the Cabinet Committee on
security for 30th of July
now imagine these are two middlemen
talking to each other they are saying
that they have fixed Cabinet Committee
on security meeting on a particular date
now this I imagined of the magnitude of
this Deepti and the viewers have to
understand Cabinet Committee on security
Cabinet Committee on security consists
of prime minister in the top four
ministers of the government of india
which is minister of External Affairs
Minister of Defense Minister of Finance
Minister of Home Affairs and the
middlemen are talking about fixing not
only fixing a meeting of the Cabinet
Committee on security they are saying
our CCS note is huge they have
influenced bureaucrats in the Ministry
of Defence who have prepared a Cabinet
Committee on security note that has been
given to Minister of Defence and the
Minister of Defence presents it in the
Cabinet Committee on security which they
say has been fixed by them III think I
will shake this is huge this is very
very significant now I just want to
reintroduce my entire team of colleagues
who've been on that story getting you
the story before any other network does
Aishwarya will shake and a colleague at
all who joins us here in our Studios
who's been able to access this entire
chart sheet now that is in possession of
Republic and what I also do is I just
request a producer janeshia to actually
flash that diary
again and then I can talk over that at
all now we know who ap was what was FAA
Michael
tell me point by point what really are
the highlights at all from this chart
shape by this authority on the request
of an Indian or 30 and they have handed
it over to IDI this entities are saying
that for wisdom the former Prime
Minister of India Manmohan Singh the
present missile also wrote letters to
him apart from him Hamid Patil mister
Pernambuco gee mr. √≥scar finalities
witnessing and others a few top
bureaucrats for written letters by
christen missiles and this have been
recovered by service authority on the
you know on the request of Indian
authorities and now this is in the
position of IDI and this has been
confessed none other than by the
employee
of Christal missile jams which is JB
Subramanyam Subramanyam is an Indian and
he has been grilled by Enforcement
Directorate he was confronted with these
dispatches and he said that yes he wrote
this dispatches at the instruction of
Crystal missiles aims and he was writing
to various political leaders to improve
Lentz them and to back this deal for
augustawestland in which they had got 70
millions as a kickbacks
I also want you to please hold up the
chart sheet and up if a camera person
here on your camera can actually zoom
into some bits of that chart sheet and
we can just put that out also we will do

Congress releases 2019 manifesto
promises to scrap sedition law for the
two clay gang protests and by Congress
in Kashmir once of spa diluted in the
valley this manifesto may Assyrian does
me so this book tour conquer rush
Sookie ecstatic he loved
Congress wants ERP diluted wants failed
to be the norm and not jail some of the
ideas are positively dangerous they are
an agenda for the balkanization of India
Jaitley exposes Congress manifest to a
point-by-point called Santa in their
proto cray and an implementable
republic accesses documents exposing
Raoul's on these links with 2g scam
accused at the time and the UPS
investigating the 2g scam paper sure
rahul was investing in scam linked for
viewers on the burning question I'm drew
the man and partner bhajan today we
focus on our sensational super exclusive
this election season that's setting the
agenda two of the biggest camps during
the Congress treated with a 2g scam and
the NSEL scam in the 2g scam one of the
big companies Scott and whose main
shareholder is now in jail is Unitec the
other is a different one but today what
we focus on is what the country has not
known all this time Rahul Gandhi had
dead business connections and dealings
with Sanjay Chandra of Unitec on the
burning question we are certain
questions from the Congress party and
Rahul Gandhi these are the first burning
question that we're going to be asking
today
while this Rahul Gandhi doing deals with
2g linked firm what was the reasoning
behind doing dealings with a form that
was under scanner the second question
can draw will Gandhi deny any of the
papers and his signatures and all sets
of papers that have been accessed by the
public media network can there be a
denial on these and the third burning
question that we asked at 8 p.m. today
does Rahul Gandhi believe in dealing
with a probe with a form that was under
the scanner with a form that was one of
the main forms under the scanner in the
2g case these are questions that we ask
it's 8 p.m. today from the Congress
party and Rahul Gandhi on these papers
that have been coming out on them
documents with us clearly prove this
these documents that we are showing on
our screen viewers prove this rounds on
the and crores of rupees to detail
business transactions and money
transfers with Unitec the page figures
on a screen show how not only did he
earn money but he also got an income
increase and an int and a tax increase
that jumped first Rowell Gandhi gets
twenty three point eight lakh rupees is
interest income in 2010-2011 this jumps
up to fifty point sixty two lakh rupees
and then it's a whooping 110 percent
income increase and then skyrockets to a
whooping 95.9
rupees in 2014 and 2015 the money
transaction only grows bigger let me
view as quickly now introduce my guests
because on the burning question we have
several questions and first question we
do want to Australian me whether he will
sit in an interview with Arnab Goswami
but this clearly sets the agenda here on
what we're trying to understand and are
not from this case that we have been
covering as an investigation I introduce
my panel today on the burning question
we have two hints in our leader of the
BJP joining us live from Mumbai we're
also joined in our Delhi studios by
surrender Chauhan political analyst
who's joining us live from our Delhi
studios and we also have Pankaj Gupta
who's joining us live political analyst
from our Delhi Studios which will be
joined by such the Prakash mr.
spokesperson of the jdu but the
questions of the screen clearly saying
isn't it time for Rahul Gandhi to also
face or not in a one-on-one interview my
first set of questions to hinson and I
come to you first
how is Rahul Gandhi going to be
explaining this financial collusion but
the main Togiak used remember in 2012 we
as journalists remember covering this 2g
case and how much anger public anger
there was there to lean at that time
because I remember even in the Delhi
courts when this case was going on the
public was seething the CAG the CAG came
out with a number of 1.76 lakh crore
really sir man Mohan Singh was being
shielded by Raoul Gandhi now it's
clearly being known that he was in
financial dealings with Sanjay Chandra
the main accused who bought 20 out of 22
telecom sectors being given allocated to
him by a Raj or himself
so regardless seems to be the one of the
most outrageous and brazen cases of quid
pro quo where you know when the all
kinds of charges were being leveled
against the 2g accused round and he was
quietly doing underhand dealings with
him and acquiring property from that
person so I think in recent history or
maybe you know in the last 20 years have
not come across a more brazen and a more
shameless act of quid pro quo because
obviously the apparent intact intent
over here would have been to give
certainly way to unit 8
which was a private cused in the 2g scam
but look at the other replications of it
until now we believe that that you know
the land grabbing and other corrupt
practice practices were probably you
know just being carried out by the
brother-in-law mr. Raja Huli cally but
if he himself can indulge in such a
brazen act of corruption and of
acquiring acquiring property through
through shady means from a prime accused
in in the 2g scam then you can note you
can figure out that corruption was
institutionalized right from the first
family and I congratulate Republic TV
and you and you know all the journalists
for exposing this ok my second question
then to Solyndra Chauhan several people
surrender Chauhan have been now coming
out and saying no this is not something
that should be really questioned but I
have two questions here did Rahul
deposit the money with Unitec after it
was under the 2g scanner we remember the
Supreme Court had given out a notice at
this time when this entire transaction
was being done and he bought two
properties in go down from Unitec and
secondly if Rahul did deposit money with
the 2g accused what is his source of
income watch you have asked two
questions one is is it the crime buying
a property from the Builder or from a
company we're talking about propriety
here when this one is it your heart was
under scanner in one of the biggest
corruption cases India had ever seen who
G spectrum is different Unitec Builder
is different so you see now 2014 in 2019
okay you're asking a question over these
periods of five year what the government
was doing if these documents were
available with the government or with
the media that if it stood with a
question mr. Chauhan I am asking a
simple question on propriety do you
think at a time and his government was
being questioned the 2g case when a Raja
had actually moved out when Connie Modi
was being questioned when all of them
are under the scanner and Sons each
other I remember used to come and sit at
the court in the 2g case I used to be a
part of the journalist who used to be
sitting there in the Delhi Patiala Court
how is it that Rahul Gandhi's so
casually is having dealings and he's
buying property and I'd also like to
item in the do you have you have got the
access to the document
yes they are they are buying by their a
I guess this is very absurd logic there
are hundreds of other builders wife were
to fall people at a given point of time
when that Pinter is accused or embroiled
in 2g scam can be identified that
particular builder number two V anyway
don't know wrong was last for the entire
family we've seen some of the obnoxious
instances of land grabbing but now it
seems that the brain was uneasy with a
unit eight no no dough would get into
his word about the real Jack please
don't get into this water boundary this
is such an increment incriminating case
this is such an obnoxious case that even
if it gets exposed today it needs to be
given the seriousness it needs to be
given a very high level of seriousness
because it involves somebody who is I
want to answer your question the
document that we have the author about
political sandwich either you go and
become a politician same its twelfth day
of October 2010 and this is an agreement
with Rahul Gandhi's name and Sanjay
Chandra's name it's been signed on the
12th of October 20 and it also tell our
viewers this is just weeks before Sunday
Chandra's et questioning this is also
just a short while before the Supreme
Court notice in the 2g case so yes
sunidhi chauhan sanjay Chandra is name
is very much there in those documents
because all these names but the jungle
to step in your and make a very simple
thing
what about propriety what about the man
who keeps saying chalky that your hair
what about him trying to understand the
public anger that was there in the
question when elections around the
corner and code of conduct all the time
this is a doubt this is a wait a minute
wait a minute for last 5 years BJP was
in power why did these documents
documents I'm not saying that they're
right or a very very very poor argument
even they were in power they had the IDI
with them they had the IT they had CBI
under them why did they not take action
at that time and come up now when the
code of conduct is definitely going to
what stops you know who have the
machinery with you the magnitude of the
guard such that even if it gets
discovered 10 years later scam is a scam
is a scam even if it's gets discovered
five years later scam is a scam is a
scam please understand that Republic TV
can be sued for these documents so they
have put their own credibility or use a
verified documentary you say that it's a
scam it becomes us can answer is no by
Robert okay okay I think your honor
people who don't even understand this
question to them and that I ask this to
you we all remember but the figure of
one the 1 lakh 76 176 lat crore rupees
came out from CAG everybody was shocked
all over it was one of the main reason
that the UPA lost the elections
everybody knew about it everybody was
shocked about it at that time isn't it
common sense and isn't it propriety for
the Indian National Congress is
president not to be having dealings with
one of the main accused in that case
just a simple question
yes or no you see yes on here with
Sanjay Chandra so unity there the
representative of the company where is
the propriety you know in a lot of cases
we've seen the PJ Thomas case and the
Supreme Court on the basis of
impropriety and impropriety people have
been removed from their posts so it is
all a question of propriety Tajin which
is not being followed here another
question that I asked them did Rahul
Gandhi not know it was a big money in a
company that is all government was
investigating Pankaj Gupta on should be
but what surprises me is that see you
know they become double next year and
again double next year how did it
skyrocket in a scenario when real estate
was going down you know at that time
really real estate was going down and
his interesting element of Daniels
already something to be lived a there is
an element of facto ad hoc ISM yeah at
which only which only supports the
theory that is it is a you know it is a
deal today and who's levelling some of
the worst allegations against just came
out right now completely confusing
description is done it is not done on
the basis of any party it is an
investigation that Republic Network has
been carrying on for the longest time so
this has nothing to do with elections
and when these papers are coming out but
you fail to answer the question only by
saying that this is coming out at this
timing the timing is not what we are
questioning here what was Raoul's links
with a scam company talked about Rahul
Gandhi's timing in trying to indulge and
look at the figures that we are trying
to show you at this point of time the
figure that you spoke about the inter
Stinkum jumpin absolutely accurate the
second figure about him joining and
signing this deal 2.9 to crawl rental
income is being taken interest income is
being increased and also the figures
that we are showing you clearly showing
you two kinds of deals are being done in
both types of things and this is what
you were talking about and I'm going to
talk about Sanjay Chandra signature so
Ranger Chauhan you asked me by the
Sanjay Chandra signatures they're almost
anyone beyond average company signing is
signing one with brass signature is
there signing the payment must have gone
to unit a company is a limited company
yeah he got something I can't take the
money
so my only point is the property has
been proceeds from the company if the
cup end property in India has
appreciative value ever seen the 2g scam
the biggest behind I think which really
adds to the theory with this when Vince
uniteq chairman was behind bars and then
you were quietly negotiating a deal with
the company that is all the more heinous
that is all the more hate years you know
I think Gandhi and his family needs to
decide whether they want to be leaders
in this country of property dealers they
are unfortunately very you know this
this entire act exposes them as very
shady property dealers and not as future
leaders of the country and this is not
the only case in which the name is come
there's also been another case in which
around krabi signatures have been coming
out in that case in pitches sicknesses
have been coming out by this Robert
Vadra name coming out my hair's knockers
came CC Trump is named what are the
dealings with Sanjay pandari is the
question several people want to ask on
an investigation that has been carried
on by the public media network when he
keeps talking about your file why is it
that certain lobbies that were trying to
propagate a
the company to take on the defense deal
that was being done and lobbies that
were functioning your of Fighters and
that was being done by Sanjay pandari
were being given help by other quarters
that's not another point that needs to
be debated here but I'm also going to be
you know welcoming my other guests at
the Prakash michaud spokesperson of the
JD was also joining us here
set the Prakash G we're only asking a
simple question here beg scamsters have
been linked with Rahul Gandhi the 2g
scam was the biggest scam of its time
sensational papers that have been
acquired by Republic Media Network
clearly revealed the financial collusion
that was happening between Rahul Gandhi
and the main accused in the 2g case who
are behind bars today
does it not show impropriety odd part of
the Indian National Congress is
President absolutely it is a high kind
you know the history of Congress suggest
to this nation that they have been in
the link of such kind of can stir Rahul
Gandhi must reply on this that he used
that derogatory remarks against the
Prime Minister of India what the nation
now calls Rahul Gandhi in the same voice
the nation will definitely ask him the
question and reply in a right reply in
the coming election you know a member of
parliament and the president of the
party hold on hold on being exposed
against involved in this is true don't
sometimes your face is exposed that you
have linked with the scamster what work
what is one party for your fungus party
in this country so if you had the
connection of the Quattro Qi you had the
connection with so many euro is foreign
to our Europe are you our party which
you're a party
wingman is come who are a part and
parcel of Indian hold on
this is the kind of and your previous
you know that saw the nation they reply
in this election to the Rahul Gandhi who
made you wait investigation definitely
will go on in this case by the media and
by the government as you'll see we are
awaiting for that but Rahul Gandhi why
he is so silent on this why is not a
spoken yet what is the problem yes come
out and the question that we asked Rahul
Gandhi who keeps asking and talking
about interview so eloquently are you

interview on this

fact of some another chief electoral

they will send it to the Election

Commission will decide whether election

so now
Excel for deal Kate calls us in ankles
are the future still going on is the
promisor software and the properties of
DMK sellers ray Morgan as of now so very
serious matter coming in and now you
know it's being told up there in fact
it's up there on the DM KK it was the
seizure under the custody of foreign to
Dutch officials right now and our
petition is also been filed by DMT
children in the Madras High Court are
creating it this is done by for
political in that time politically
motivated and such you know side of our
rates you know at point of time and
sintering the candidate command to in
fact to go for the camping this is a
petition which has been filed by the DMK
it's a treasure a Morgan and the matter
is going to be cured by the Madras High
Court tomorrow
Amica alright Sanjeev II now now we also
have our political editor Aishwarya
Kapoor joining us at this point in time
because Aishwarya just tell us how big
is this cash stash that has been
recovered by the investigative agencies
we've seen that happening just before
elections the kind of cash hole that is
being done but what exactly is the
involvement when we are looking at
certain political parties and how big is
this well absolutely at this very point
of time the visuals are sensational and
they're only and only on Republic Media
Network Amitha if you see the packets
are being open crores of money crores of
rupees have been found
this is unaccounted money for source of
this money is not to be found and they
have been found in the IT rates IT
followed the protocol that is what we
are being told Election Commission and
then the officers but were taken into
the loop and these are exclusive visuals
which you can see from inside the raid
and if you see packets are being open
there are currency notes inside and then
there is a number a particular number
which is a district wise distribution if
you see there is a number 201 there is a
number 73 there is a number 136 this is
not the number of currency notes inside
this is the district number there is
an unsaid code for every district there
is an unsaid number off every district
and it's a known fact for every
politician so these packets were all set
to be distributed district wise that is
what we are being told by uh sources the
IT came to know about it
and the raids were done and in these
raids this is the money which has been
found so this is something which is very
very sensational and it's exclusively on
Republic Network Amitha we are showing
you the doze of money there are there in
sacks there is no value of this money
way because if you see that how it has
been kept and now if you see packets are
being open packets are being open by the
IT officials and you see two packets
come out and now single packets will be
opened up with a particular number over
it and here as here are the currency
notes here are the currency notes coming
out which very clearly show which very
clearly show that this money was to be
distributed district wise and not only
district wise in also district right
village wise and this is something which
needs to be looked into yeah G G
actually we take a lot of time to even
count the kind of money that has been
recovered so far and how neatly that
they have been packed in gunny bags and
also in cartoons but this clearly
unfolds a kind of distribution of cash
which is clearly illegal has been going
on in a rampant manner so what exactly
do you feel that the Election Commission
should be doing now looking at these
which was that we are playing out for a
viewers or shuara
you
this is a sensational cash stash that
has been recovered from Tamil Nadu and
this is an unbelievable amounts of cash
that has been recovered we still don't
know how much of it is but these are the
investigative agencies but these are the
visuals that we are getting of that
recovery that was made in a cement
factory and how neatly you have these
are 200 rupee currency notes that have
been recovered so far at the cement
factory and this has been done by the
investigative agencies there but what
exactly will be the next step that will
be taken by the Election Commission
because this is something that they will
be taking note of definitely but but
some GV if I can come to you on that
because talking about the Election
Commission they need to come in now and
this is how you have not only the
Election Commission but other
investigative agencies who are working
overtime
because this may be a possibility in
other places as well when we are looking
such kind of distribution of cash that
the certain political parties wanted to
do for the waters there in fact they
were also opposition by the DNC a legal
thing and also DNC specially Mervin and
different team was sent to the same
rights because they do have rights at
the warrant and the IT department and
also the DAO of a logistical are told
that based on specific information so
now the DMK
morgan understand Karan had approached
the Madras High Court against ongoing
searches at the restaurants and
scheduled institutions and also inform
with the ongoing crises there already
Sanjeev you are crying foul and they are
saying that this is nothing but
political vendetta but the amount of
cash that has been recovered is
humongous and such kind of distribution
of cash which is clearly illegal there
in the system this is something that we
will take definitely a lot of time for
the investigative agencies to come down
to a number how much cash that has been
recovered so far for the
moment Aishwarya and Sanjeev II thanks
very much",True,en,38692,173,664

hmm and you know annalisha
one more breaking update and this is
huge it could could just be perhaps the
turning point in the entire case an
Alicia what again our newsdesk is
telling us via colleague shovin who's
inside is that in a telephonic call to a
sheeladi he had threatened to kill him
our shears for viewers not very familiar
with the case is a key witness in the
entire case the story analyst is moving
very very fast a lot of updates that are
in fact coming in where the Crown
Prosecution now has informed the judge
about this they've said that our sheesh
is a witness and the Crown Prosecution
they're already indicating that Needham
OD can go and destroy evidence
Subash Purab is another witness an
Alicia that has been spoken of in the
court and what more details do we know
about him is the fact that he's in Egypt
right now subhash has worked for need up
so this this is important because I
think a lot many more important details
on a leash is what the court right now
is looking at that is exactly what I was
pointing out earlier that this is not
only a question of whether he gets a
bail or not the hearing today is very
very crucial in this matter because as I
said you know the the Indian agency the
German team that has come here
has claimed that they are well-prepared
and I was sort of expecting that they
would come with something very very
robust because as I said last time when
when the man was brought to the court it
was just a question of the whole
rigmarole of law where the person was
also that okay do you agree to be
expedited and he said obviously no but
today is going to be very very crucial
today we will talk about concrete
evidence today we will talk about
witnesses today we will talk about how
the gim it how legitimate the questions
are that the Indian sources are are
raising here so it is important to
understand that the witnesses all the
documents that have been traditionally
all that are being produced today will
be looked at carefully and that's why
this way it's going to be very very very
important and also let me remind you
that it is 12 1250 and at the moment in
the UK one o'clock is lunch time so in
the next 10 minutes you could hear
something very big and very important
that is significant Alisha and even as
you speak as we head into a quick break
but we will just reconnect with you on
the other side an important twist that
both inhalation shavon are telling us
mole off did need of Modi threatened to
kill a witness in the case this has been
a fact a claim that has been made in the
court not just that analyst the Crown
Prosecution also saying that neither
Modi has traveled to several countries
and his particular interest to get
citizenship in Pacific buy investment
because he wants to look at a country
which has no extradition treaty with
India
so clearly the modus operandi of this
man Colleen of Modi is being talked
about in the Westminster Code we had
into a quick break but don't go anywhere
we are back on more live updates on that

viral in which a cleric was seen
performing the nikah of the two girls
triggering massive outrage in Pakistan
and India and across the world as well

welcome back the Congress called it to
fool you a surgical strike on poverty
essentially this is not a surgical
strike on poverty that they are planning
it is a surgical strike on the poor here
are the facts and then we debate on the
debate tonight the final assault on
poverty or the ultimate deceit I know
all right yeah yeah ah yeah ah he's
floated a balloon and the scheme which
lacks facts or details if you look at
actual beneficiaries for example in the
first four months of of the irishman
Bharath as per the speech of the
President of India at the joint session
of Parliament at the beginning of the
year about 10 lakh beneficiaries poor
beneficiaries had already taken various
treatments in these private hospital
battle enlisted as part of ouch man
bharat across the country Malkovich
Omega tau Caribe for surgical strike
Congress cotton ear
is it a surgical strike on poverty or
the poor here's a closer look under the
Prime Minister's Grameen scheme itself
one crore families will be impacted if
they get 72 thousand rupees a year also
consider the swachh bharat mission if
rahul scheme applies benefits worth one
point zero eight lakh crore may be
snatched from BPL families that won't
make the cut just to give you an idea
there's something called national social
assistance program which is the Romney
bus of about five elderlies related
pensions for the poor now whether even
if there are a small amounts ranging
from three hundred rupees per month to
one thousand rupees per month what this
poor elderly entitled to these pensions
if they opted for the Congress Party's a
big rebranding exercise to float a
balloon while the poor already get
benefits

couldn't keep it up
it's all done the helping or snatching
from the poor let's do it
[Music]
and we're going to have a good debate on
this one with tanveer and Faruk on one
side and no poor sharma okay no no it's
its new poll versus three okay it's no
poor versus tanveer Faruk and I say
Bangla thank you was that solute meant
for Al Gandhi I'm sure he's watching the
program for you or was that solute meant
for know for you
because you can sort defeat at the start
or was that conceived pardon me I can't
hear you louder please for you always
for me I keep on saluting you you know
every day I don't know if you know
listen to me let me give you a situation
today Congress so why is the why is the
BJP so rattled about it I want to I want
to find about the repackaging so Barry
where tau suppose no no 1 min 1 min 1
min no port let's not trivialize the
debate it's about the poor we know it
reached the Congress could has no
solution so my so my so I'm on a very
very serious point and I I said this
yesterday and I sensed it and then I did
my research and I found the facts and I
found here that as of 2017 2018 there
are 40 1.14 odd direct back direct you
know benefits transfer beneficiaries
across India and if you if you therefore
want to take away what they are getting
as direct benefits transfer and then you
are saying you no longer be poor then
you're actually cheating them today the
Congress party said it's not a top-up
scheme what this essentially means
please understand this that you are
taking away with two hands and you're
giving with one on the other so what
what will happen to the poor is that the
basic benefits they get for example they
get rice and wheat at three and two
rupees a kilo 35 kilos of rice and wheat
it is
it is it is it is a it is it matters to
poor people to get that rice and wheat
food grain to survive you will deny them
that right and then you'll say I took
you lifted you from poverty you will
deny people access to health care you
will deny people access to food security
you will deny people access to the 1.2
lakh rupee subsidy that each ppl family
gets and under the PMA a.y Grameen
Scheme you will most importantly deny
them the LPG cylinders which they get
you will also deny them free electricity
because as of now fifty point four lakh
BPL households in India under the
swappigans came launched under the Modi
government are getting free electricity
you will take away their free
electricity you will take away the
twelve thousand rupees that they get for
making toilets for you may it may not be
matter but for a poor family you get
twelve thousand rupees to make a toilet
you will take that away from them you
will snatch away homes from the poor you
will deprive them of medical benefits
you'd basically take away everything
that they need to live a sustainable
life you'll just snatch it away and then
you'll say when it comes to you or she
comes to you and says why taking it away
by the way you will also take back
pensions you know the old and the
elderly get pensions and not a large
amount they'd get between four hundred
eight hundred rupees a month as pensions
you will take that away you will you
will take away a wheat sugar electricity
please allow me to continue allow me to
continue I'll tell you why you know it
is so unfortunate that just because I am
revealing what your intent is you are
saying wrong facts let me give you an
example okay I ask you a counter
question that we have to ask you a
counter question I want to security bill
I know about it more than you will turn
away from any government food security
bill is part of the government Anna and
I'm also politician I have learned from
people like you you you are you are so
foolish short you
you surprise me sometimes no everyone
who claims to have mature is not far P
even all Gandhi claims to be mature now
listen me even Sam Pitroda claims very
mature but this is not a mix I am
sounding them now now now the question
is honor you don't understand this
understand tell me what we do not
understand we must confess and not and
now I think nuclei I want to ask you one
okay ok tanvi azmi tanvi let me repeat
two jobs as an oath and veer I will
expose you tonight tell me what you
people are doing with the poor is not
funny I have really covered and we've
done what we do you think poop poor are
foolish enough you think the poor people
are fools they are not they are going to
question you and they are going to
punish you
no pool before you come in can we take
one question now foolish and we will
take one question we will take one
question from me and I'll deal with you
will you take one question from me
please tell me the question is of
applicability yes and we convene and
viewers I I now will have to ask then
read a couple of questions and viewers I
want you to listen to this very closely
this is an important debate I don't want
to trivialize it I don't want to laugh
over it I know the number of people who
would be watching to get the information
here and you have accused me you have
accused me of putting out questionable
facts so I will ask you a simple
question that we if you know someone
who's earning seven thousand rupees a
month right you give that person 6000
rupees under your scheme there for that
person's monthly income becomes thirteen
thousand rupees now you said that the
poor pro-poor schemes are not specific
to a government and they move from
government to government listen whatever
you think about me you know even a
kindergarten student knows that that's
not the issue the issue is our
applicability my question to you tan
beer is when that person was getting
seven thousand rupees
13,000 not one multi-window right now
because I'm asking a question with envy
and we listen let me complete my
question let me complete my question we
was let me complete my question a
thousand times I will tell you this let
me complete my question thank you thank
you thank you when that person was
getting seven thousand rupees and you
say that I give you six thousand rupees
why because you are poor so then that
person's income becomes thirteen
thousand rupees and then you go out and
say that see here is a man a poor man
who got seven thousand rupees I've
lifted him above the poverty line and
he's now getting thirteen thousand
rupees please tell me today than read
whether the person was getting thirteen
thousand rupees and hence above the
poverty line will be eligible to all the
benefits that someone under the poverty
line gets simple question it's not
quantum mechanics simple question no let
me answer your simple enough simple
question I'll answer enough firstly dole
is not considered as income even if
you're earning eleven thousand that six
thousand old will definitely come to you
that would not be considered as income
still if at all you're earning less than
twelve thousand rupees oh you already
know it for all I didn't mention those
who have list I didn't mention the word
dole you which you have list I did not
mention the word dole and if you did I'm
sorry the Congress said it's not a top
of scheme today
you forgot that you want this Congress
said it's not a top up spinner the
Congress said it's not a top ice-cream
one minute just a minute just a minute
what you're saying makes no sense I'm
not please wait right now I will hold
you in your tracks please wait right now
I will ask you again this is so wrong
what you are doing this is so wrong what
you are doing you know and just because
I exposed you right now I'm asking you
again when that family starts getting
thirteen thousand rupees that family
will be as per your definition my
definition above the poverty line unless
you say I will also now increase the
poverty line from 12,000 to 18,000
thereby ensuring that after getting the
six thousand rupees the family continues
to be under the poverty line and hence
is also gets the benefits of the
multiple of the schemes including how
subsidies monthly writes of 35 kilos
pensions to the old disabled widows free
electricity subsidized toilet
construction and medical insurance you
cannot guarantee me that and I've caught
you red-handed right now and you know I
have done that I'm not even raising my
voice
we don't tell me to consider to be poor
to 18 thousand rupees
no no board then he must say on the
program that he's raising the number
from 12,000 to 18,000 but no Rahul
Gandhi didn't refer 20 18,000 figure he
referred to the 12,000 figure you
understand either a whole Gandhi scorned
or he's a con you tell me which none
will answer my question I repeat to you
today you give me six thousand rupees
officially take me above the poverty
line and they'll take away from me you
snatch away more than 5.3 lakhs and you
give me 72 thousand in return you think
I'm a fool please don't do this before
an election he would still continue to
get those benefits which you have listed
he's going to get food security bill six
thousand if the poor is getting sick
why because I caught you now see no for
you no poor because on Republic I like
to catch people red-handed and because I
catch them red-handed I'll tell you what
they'll do I have today caught them
red-handed I've been getting feedback
from people because I caught them
red-handed
wait now they come tomorrow and they'll
say we promise you that I caught you
right now you're the one who promised
you're the one who promised you're the
one who promised I caught you red-handed
people are responding to me right now
tomorrow al Gandhi will have a press
conference a
the moon I'll promise you cellphone
because I caught you red-handed no no
don't try this trick on me and
sycophantic journalists saying wah wah

be caught red-handed people are
responding right now tell me under the
onion and tortilla and najin ah please
tell me you give five hundred and fifty
crores of subsidy for one kilo of sugar
to BPL households across the country
right will you snatch the ability of the
poor to access sugar in exchange for
your income scheme will your scheme be
implemented at the cost of forcing every
poor family to pay one thousand four
hundred for rice every month how many
poor families can afford that it's a
surgical strike on the poor people of
this country and I tell you this just
because you caught some wah wah
sycophantic meaningless unread
journalists doing wah wah wah wah Rahul

questions here's Republic asking other
questions I tell you this

June 2010 Commonwealth Games scam was
broken by January February 2011 people
who were angry when one Singh did a
press conference where he says I have to
compromise with corruption to keep the
DMK happy Raja was kicked out calm Adi
was kicked out people started
questioning the economics
and the corruption of the Congress you
know what the Congress did this great
fellow Montek Singh Ahluwalia he changed
the poverty line in urban areas to 30
rupees per capita and he said if you've
got 26 rupees per capita in rural areas
you're not poor and we went around
saying hello what will you have for 26
rupees you won't get an ice cream
but Manmohan Singh said never mind it's
fine have an ice cream be happy he said
26 rupees you pay your rent to pay off
food you get your water electricity get
it rice have three meals a day and as
far as I'm concerned you're not poor the
pen the Planning Commission in 2012
lowered the poverty line the Planning
Commission change the definition of
poverty in 2013 under the great Raghu
Rama Rajan who at that point of time now
gives interviews did not have a
pipsqueak not one word he was RBI
governor then he didn't say once no no
this is morally incorrect the Suresh
Tendulkar committee exposed the European
poverty in 2009

did not provide relief to the poor you
hate or not because he comes to you and

and breaking news sir we shift our focus
now to one more breaking development in
fact a blog that has been put forward by
the finance minister arun jaitley who's
hitting back at the congress and the
nutrients media for a report on the
alleged bribe diaries al-khaliq
appreciate is joining us for more
details on that of a shaker take us to
what we are hearing now from arun
jaitley abhishek can you hear us not
sure if that line is already clear
between try to get him back and I'm just
reading a portion from that blog it says
and I quote conventional print media
followed conservative norms every news
that a reporter brought was checked and
verified do you Karen caution he says
was taken documents were pursued
alternative versions were taken and then
our news which cast aspersions against
individuals was published television
liberalized the conventional view he
says the race for TR peace has led to
every news becoming a breaking news
there is today a complete breakdown of
breaking news the social media has
discarded these norms together for many
in social media this rule has been
abandoned he goes on remember then to
talk of those three lives that he also
mentioned just about yesterday where
he's saying that this is an experiment
with falsehood this was attempted in the
go throught train burning case where he
says a fire from within theory was
created in the issue of jihad case a
successful operation against Alaska
right away Bob module masterminded by
the intelligence and the security
agencies he says was passed on as a
political operation not just this then
he also talks about one more important
uh news he says from falsehood to
forgery this is where he's speaking of
of those Diaries remember that have been
released claiming to be Diaries of BS
Yeddyurappa abhishek is with us now
abhishek take us to you know the
highlights of this block deep 0 this is
essentially
and finish arun jaitley using his
favorite platform of logging and
essentially what he's saying is that
this story that has emerged about some
Diaries if that was meant that morality
in by which it will either be a chariot
of pine karnataka for essentially a case
of salt should plan amplified by a
particular media platform so mr jaitley
the manner in which that amplication
happened at the hands of for that
particular media platform which fine
name in the headline given log which is
the opposition's caravan achieves a new
law from fall so to forgery essentially
what he is trying to say is that
something that did not exist was given
or create an impression was created
around it in a manner that people would
want to believe it to be true in a sense
pushing of fake news using the use of
planting your story and then amplifying
it some amenability of that form
essentially this is a BJP counting
towards this false are in forgeries can
never influence a poll just as voters

that one militant has been utilized by
the security forces in Hajin encounter

militants are from the lashkar-e-taiba
so far the five civilians have been
evacuated from the house they are the
inmate of this very house and but one is
still with the militants but as of now
one militant we are confirming that has

the big Republic story the Republic
sting impact that already is creating
ripples it's not just the Election
Commission as we will just speak a
little while earlier but also the party
now the BJP are shaken as shuara are
telling us more about this and before I
get an estuary I want to get another
shake yeah up shake you tell us that the
stone bJP MP now has been summoned by
the BJP oh well it seems the tea the
story that we have carried out since
morning the exposure has really rattled
the powers-that-be and you know it's a
very balanced operation that was carried
out by our Special Investigation Team
where you have an MP from the ruling
party an MP from the opposition
principle opposition party and then an
MP from a regional party but what is
important is that it is being taken
notify and the latest is that the BJP
seems to have summoned its MP from go
see her in a garage bar and sought an
explanation from him as to why he was
speaking the things that he has spoken
about in the string essentially
indicating towards campaign finance so
things are moving its going to have
consequences we are still in the midst
of an election cycle that is picking up
in fact Deepti today is the day when
possibly BJP will come out with its
first lit list of candidates for
entering Lok Sabha elections so watch
out for all the developments that are
taking place but the latest is that the
BJP has summoned its ago CMP seeking
explanation of his conduct in those
tapes okay and I'm told a shuara is also
joining us for more details on that
Aishwarya take it ahead and tell us what
what are you learning through your
sources in the BJP because this is
something I think that the voters now
Aishwarya are taking note of not one not
two but there are three MPs that
Republic Bharat has stung and people
today want to know what will be the
action against these MPs
first of all deeply if I can just say
regarding the bJP MP first BJP is going
to seek and then analyze the stink tics
of their MP which has been done by us
first second they are summoning him
irrespective they are seeking an
explanation for him because that is the
internal process of the BJP they give
their person a chance to basically
explain what has happened once that is
done and once they have analyzed our
tapes it's only after that that they
will take an action but then this also
suggests that the party which needs to
act the party which has the will to act
against corruption will do will the RLS
be do so will the other party that is
the Congress do so so if they have zero
tolerance towards corruption they need
to act but the problem with the the
other parties are that they have their
national presidents in certain cases
which are directly and directly linked
with with the people who are doing
corruption so very very clearly this is
first but then what has happened and as
abhishek was saying this is a very
balanced sting operation which has been
done by our team members so very very
specifically they have once again tried
to make it clear that what is happening
and it is not very party specific this
is happening at large irrespective of
any particular region irrespective of
any particular party and if you see
these MPs have they met each and every
constituent of their parliamentary cover
of their a part of their parliamentary
constituency no but such people who can
lure them into the money net they meet
them just within minutes so this is also
which is very clear which shows that
what is happening how the system is
rotting so it's not about any particular
party it's not about any particular
region it's about the system and how MPs
MPs at large need to understand that
they need to be beware they need to be
very careful and they cannot do this
because that are LSP MP and we are
trying to get a reaction from the RL SP
chief within the next few minutes deep
tape and what we are being told that he
will be forced to act as well because
what has been shown in Republic sting is
very clear the man is talking about the
hawala route sitting MP a MP a leader
who could very well be given ticket is
talking about the hawala route so this
is as corrupt as it can get
dear Abhishek oh yes oh yes and peas are

water is watching everything the water
is actually watching these sting
operations the reason why you know

we are breaking a big story right now
the Westminster Court has issued an
arrest warrant against need of moody yes
a significant story that is breaking
here on Republic and will also take in
our colleague shovin to tell you the
implications of this entire move because
this many people say remember is just
the first step and this sets the ball
rolling when it comes to extradition on
your screens I think you're looking at
an entire timeline of how this entire
story has moved and these are the
charges against this man the first
charge global money laundering the
second charge is criminal conspiracy and
you saw that image that entire video
that was captured of this man who's also
charged with fake letters of undertaking
when it came to securing those loans
from the banks the fourth charge fake
foreign letters of orhid the fifth
charge is criminal breach of trust
everything there has been cited by the
Indian authorities after which their
arrest warrant now has been issued by
the Westminster Court the sixth charge
is cheating and fraud the seventh charge
is the fact that he raised shell
companies the eight charges up on your
screens there is siphoning off about
13,000 crore
so all this remember I was preparing a
dossier the reason why the Indian
government has been moving for his
extradition for the longest time in fact
about two particular extradition
requests are walked up the MEA were
actually moved and after this entire
video surfaced there was a lot of hue
and cry particularly by the opposition
that said that the government was
snoozing the government was doing
nothing but look at this we are also now
learning the arrests is likely before
Friday's shovin that is a very very
important development that you are
breaking get us up to speed on what we
know on the story so far shovel
well as far as the arrest warrant is
concerned it has already been issued by
the Westminster Court the district judge
has already taken the decision remember
this comes after the UK home second -
had signed on the extradition file on
7th of March and the time period that
was essentially given was about 14 days
a time period that was actually given be
given to understand that as far as
procedure is concerned he's likely to
appear before the court on 25th of March
that's the next date of hearing as far
as this entire case is concerned this is
certainly the first step as far as this
entire extradition process is concerned
what you're going to expect in the days
to come is once it is served at nirav or
these residents he will have to appear
before the westminster court he
certainly has the option of applying for
bail remember this is and provisional
arrest warrant that has been issued by
the westminster court that would only
mean that he cannot travel outside
United Kingdom and secondly he will now
have to face the trial as far as the
extradition is concerned on the other
hand as far as the Indian investigative
agencies are concerned they are going to
now approach the Crown Prosecution
Service the Crown Prosecution Service
essentially represents India in the
court and that's when the arguments with
regards to the extradition is concerned
where India is going to try and convince
the court that this is a fit case for
extradition on the grounds that he has
violated the Indian laws and in the eyes
of the British laws also there is a
clear violation so you don't shove and I
think the story has moved very fast and
you're getting a lot of these breaking
updates for viewers just joining in
please help me understand the entire
timeline you know how many requests have
been moved by New Delhi when it comes to
the extradition what is the process like
and at which stage right now is our
request well this is certainly the first
step deeply let's put this in
perspective because remember this
decision was not being taken for almost
seven to eight months because India had
first filed the extradition request in
the month of August 2018 that's when the
request went in from India to United
Kingdom the next step was essentially
the UK Home Secretary are taking a look
at the extradition file and there
afterwards ascending it
the westminster court that's already
happened that happened on 7th of March
with the UK Home Secretary took the
decision that this is a perfect case for
at least issuing in the arrest warrant
this after a hectic negotiation that
actually took place between the
Enforcement Directorate the Indian
investigative agency and the UK Home
Secretary where they were basically
trying to convince that this is a case
where extradition should take place
there after we given to understand that
the court the district judge Westminster
Court has now taken this decision with
regards to assume the arrest warrant
the arrest warrant would be served at a
lead of Modi's residents the next step
would be he will have to produce himself
before the Westminster Code that when he
is provisioned as a provisional arrest
which takes place and he will certainly
have the option for going in for a bail
we will seek the same procedure taking
place as far as Vijay Mallya's case is
concerned perhaps a rerun of the same
episode here where you would look at
need of Modi going to the court applying
for bail and in all likely once he's
basically granted bail if that actually
happens he will have will have to you
know face trial as far as the
extradition is concerned it would go to
the court where India would also be
sending a team so in all likelihood in
the days to come perhaps in the next
couple of days you will see a team from
the Central Bureau of Investigation as
well as the enforcement and directed
leaving for London where they would be
having a meeting with the Crown
Prosecution Service and handing over all
documents with regards to this entire
case okay so you know shall one does
this mean that the clock now is ticking
for this man you know he might be
thinking that he's a free man he will
not have to face the law but not anymore
because just for the mere optics of it
also you remember when he's going to be
arrested and when that happens oh you
know you'll have to make himself
available before the investigative
agencies that's a Westminster Code
Sakura bail and even if he gets a bail
the point is that he will have to be
accountable for every penny that he owes
us
he owes in there well he'll certainly
try to convince the court that he cannot
be extruded righted on various grounds a
to begin with the fact that there is a
no crime that has been
committed with regards to the the
British laws secondly with regards to
this entire Europe fraud case that India
has been putting across enira Modi
certainly would also try to prove his
case that there is no question of a
fraud because he was willing to pay back
the money that's exactly the modus
operandi pro-hop taking a leave out of
Vijay Mallya's book and that's how you
would see a rerun of this entire matter
but a bill getting a bail from the court
in itself is it's certainly procedural
there is there is nothing that one would
say I said back to the case because this
is just a provisional arrest there's a
part of the procedure but it only means
that he will now face trial the
extradition would actually there would
be an extradition trial that would take
place and this would only mean a step
forward as far as this case is concerned
okay and you know that there is more
information shovin that is coming in and
I think you can just push this a little
further because this is about the story
in perspective the charges you know on
our screens we actually play out those
charges one by one also what we are
learning is that it was revealed that
substantial proceeds of obtained fraud
'le by need of Modi on group of firms
whether that shovin was solar exports
whether that was stellar diamonds
whether that was diamond are us from the
Punjab National Bank and it was diverted
to need of Modi his relatives and
entities controlled by him and all that
I think is gonna be placed now before
the court am i right in understanding
that well he would certainly make this
attempt of shifting the blame we have
already seen this earlier but we shall
bode actually for the first time spoke
to the public TV he's already said that
you know they were being made a
scapegoat as far as this entire business
it is a concern so that would certainly
form a part of the case that would be
put forth by a near a body in the
Westminster Court
secondly the fact that why he shouldn't
be extradited to India there could be
multiple reasons he's already written to
the Central Bureau of Investigation
saying that he cannot join the pro for
various reasons to begin with you know
he's also cited saying that you know
there's a lynch mob mentality in India
if he's actually sent back to India he
would face that but these are some of
the arguments that has been put forth by
see by nirav Modi
that is written to the Central Bureau of
Investigation saying that he cannot
return now remember he's already in the
process of being declared as a fugitive
economic fugitive offender because the
Enforcement Directorate has already
moved an Indian Court here filing an
application with regards to him being
declared as a fugitive economic of an
economic offender that would mean that
once he's declared all his assets would
be seized by the Enforcement Directorate
he certainly does not have even the
option of appealing before the court to
restore his assets here in India that in
itself is going to have massive economic
repercussions we've seen that happening
in the case of Vijay Mallya
perhaps a rerun once again as far as
nirav Modi is also concerned",True,en,5209,20,138

China has blogged the move to designate
muscled other who's the chief of Jasher

does it mean is it a hint of China's
softening stance as far as

T3xH_zRw7hw,Why So Touchy About Term &#39;Anti-National?&#39; | Exclusive Sunday Debate With Arnab Goswami,Republic TV is India's no.1 English news channel since its launch. It is your one-stop destination for all the live news updates from ...,2019-03-18T04:23:42Z,Republic World,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T3xH_zRw7hw/hqdefault.jpg,"welcome to the Sunday debate some may
find today's subject controversial I
don't think it's controversial
I think it's direct the biggest
accusation against Republic TV is that
it calls other people anti national and
some of my detractors say who are you to
call a Centon a tional who are you to
call yourself a nationalist and what
exactly do we do which makes you call as
anti national and I want to correct them
I tell them that I don't call you
international but I give the basic
prerequisite for what becomes anti
national activity what can be phrased to
be anti national and what may be is
activity against national interest and
my definition is simple if you're
working against national interest then
what you're doing is anti national I'm
not calling you an anti national but
your activity could be construed to be
Antonis to let me explain this further
if you are an Indian news channel an
issue and I press conference live or an
Indian news channel and you carry the
wrong map of India compromising the
integrity and sovereignty of the
Republic of India then we are carrying
out potentially anti national activity
that doesn't mean that we call them anti
national but we need to have a very
clear definition of what is anti
national and I think we need to
understand this because the fact of the
matter is whether one side accepts it or
not the country's coming together the
nation is coming together nationalism
has become not just before the election
otherwise the supreme sentiment in this
country there is a lobby that is
perpetually gone against anything
nationalistic which is consistently
supported and given a seal of approval
to this narrative that to create okay
Lobby so today's question is very simple
and hashtag anti national debate it's
not an anti national debate or should I
rather say debate on anti Nationals but
I will define the hashtag as the show
progresses let's keep it neither the
question is simple what is anti national
activity who is anti national what
actions are anti national dish keiki
laughs cat whoa cheese enjoy tasty
Khilafah jobs are adesh care I rush to
serve
tosem MA destro Quijote what is sedition
what is anti-national should we talk
about it and where can you draw the line
of the freedom of expression and say
this far and no further
this will be the Lakshmanan Rekha don't
go beyond this so I open the debate
today by welcoming both sides neither is
- nobody's International but we should
have a talk about it we should have a
chat about it we should we should be
open about it RP Singh on one side
sanjeev professor sanjeev Tiwari is a
professor in his a RSS leaning analyst
RP Singh as national secretary of the
BJP Monika or a BJP leaning Supreme
Court advocate Anushka and one daddy on
this leans towards the BJP n it's fine
it's not illegal to be right-wing you
see in this country it was seen to be
legal to be left-wing and illegal to be
right-wing till two years back no new
people all new people made right-wing
sound like you are descendants of Hitler
but it's not know absolutely no
introduction is that that's also
branding on the other side today that is
Aarti Jarrett senior journalist
sanjeev's trust of senior journalist
both senior to me but I take exception
to the positions that they hold and
Sunni Chopra is leader of the CPI M and
thusly Mohammed Romani is leader of the
SDP I who's known whose links with the
largely unlawful PFI are not sort
largely Allah would not at all unlawful
and it has been approved by the
complicated codes please amend yourself
it's complete should we begin the debate
should we begin the debate one and a
half minutes introduction one person
starts on this side to tell me what is
anti-national and one person starts on
this side to respond to it and then we
open it
take it anywhere take it anywhere you
want the debate I'm open to an open
debate carry on who's going to start now
yeah
who's going to start you want to start
Monica okay what is anti-national what
is the international activity go ahead
and who is our national yes aunty
Matthews any person who works against
the national interest who hates India
who wants to bake India into a national
activity remember genuine Giada who
University where students and poverty
rate to play home games Charla
para people are either young lady they
are anti-national this is anti national
activity then there is one grenade the
NGO ecosystem which always calls army
men Jevons are sexual assaulters as
rapists and they call those purple
Bastogne Panthers as innocent poor
Kashmiri children then the this anti
national Lobby it questions Pulwama it
question the surgical strikes and said
proof DJ they question it quietly Modiji
cool kindle Ollie Mad Carew
now they say Paloma K but everything was
fixed pair chronic gaiety yappin kemar
negative and then they say Imran Khan or
Moody Jimmy fixed her Paloma just
because in elections were there I'm
sorry
anybody who tries to break India on
caste religion communal linguistic lines
is an anti national and the people of
this country will not tolerate them okay
I think I think so why one person one
person can we call cow vigilantes
anti-national also because they are
because they are creating communal
disharmony because they indulgent you
can link jinkx because they go around
killing people poverty rate to create
hunger in Charlotte
[Applause]
Monica you cannot interrupt in the
opening remark continuity yeah so she
made a point let me go what I'm trying
to say is that you yourself said that
anybody who tries to do violence or
create hatred in the name of religion
whatever they are sorry why are you
siding with the country wants an answer
we are also we have not got from you the
country wants this country will not
is to be called sexual assaulters in my
own name of the cow when and phone'll
don't tell me why do you go on telling
article 19 says you have right to speech
absolute it has also integrity and who
where they're questioning the job and
[Music]
these are the activities
and you don't try to bracket yourself
with the National distributed sweets
after 1960 Silver City to defeat was it
national or international you can't
distribute sweets not china
you rascal please find out your dress
code and you've just wait a minute wait
a minute first of all I need to ask the
BJP a few questions
just you see BJP leaders have often used
the garb of nationalism and Sanjeev RP
and Monica and each cannot understand
this that anyone who is not supporting
my party will be called an anti-national
I think that is your weak point and it
is sometimes with our rationality let me
therefore ask you this Sunday should it
be allowed you know on 4th March 2019
just a few days back Union Minister Giri
Raj Singh inviting people for the Prime
Minister's Sankalp rally and we are
reportedly said those who attend the
rally of Prime Minister Modi will mean
the support India while those who skip
the rally will obviously be backing
Pakistan and will be treated as they
should throw his or traitors my question
is I have never attended a prime
minister Ali please tell me RP Singh am
i a traitor
ok please no please answer yes no no
let's see what context it was happening
it was
gonna give me thing it was happening
with us Concha second people give me
second if internal circuitry or third
party if jealous secular Congress party
says this this surgical psyche was a
mealy bug Paloma was a mealy bug so it's
a fine example second example to you sir
in an interview in September 2015 Mahesh
Sharma said the following words Hindi
babbling of and what Cardona yes they
are particularly happen abusive ah to my
Deborah karoonga Tori Dean Velma some a
Punjabi we interviewed a - cow Moo
Salman Hotel way be it NEBOSH - body or
man after body in Santa Fe Jacob dual
Abdul Kalam yeah Nicki despite listen to
me despite being a Muslim APJ Abdul
Kalam was such a humanist and a
nationalist what do you what do you mean
by what do you mean by despite being a
Muslim because Kalam said the National
Kalam sub never treated him as a Muslim
he treated another nationalist no no he
never he never you know I said I'm a
Muslim you said I'm an artist I'm Indian
first no I
so you I'd be I'd be let me only one
thing I don't enjoy grilling you just
like this man I do I often feel that you
yes I have the right Constitution gives
me the right not yes on 29th March 2017
BJP leader H Raja calls reporters
anti-indian
when they questioned him on why the
government is giving Farm Aid to Kenya
when farmers are suffering here he says
I am not prepared to answer you you are
NT Indian you aren t Indian my point is
this see you have a very good case but I
have always believed R P and H Quran you
will agree with me when you have a
fantastic case you should not give a bad
example the case for nationalism is a
strong case but when you associate the
BJP with nationalistic and when you say
if I questioned you and farmers your
anti-national now let me tell you BJP
can I can I can I
now you are padding like novice corner
for for almost what happened you ask
there are people who when they lose
power instead of opposing of political
leaders start opposing India's interests
because they cannot abide with the fact
that they have lost political power that
is anti natural when mu Katara's
passionately opposed the nation when
whom Laura Bassen as well in it when
Rapada passionate we says and I open the
debate now this part the BJP has to
answer see they have to answer on many
things but BJP cannot say nook way what
did he say in 2015 first of all there
was no beef man it was a ban on the
slaughter of beef in public places it
was therefore fake news story I'd said
it but I can understand them making it
an issue you also made it an issue nook
we said those who are dying without
eating beef can go to Pakistan or Arab
countries where it is available why did
he have to say that that for not
speaking up against Pakistani Pakistan
playing in the BCCI but you have taken
it to the point of being ridiculous when
you've said we're not honest if you will
go to last maybe the corner I said if we
like Kali has got married in Italy he
has earned money in India and he went to
Italy to get married hence he cannot be
a raster bug what is this that means
every Indian who goes for a honeymoon
anywhere outside India is an
anti-national then you explain this to
me I want you to know this problem you
need to expand any RP Singh sanjeev

India and with the general elections

these two themes together what are the
two themes what is international a what
defines what is anti-national and I know
this is a touchy subject because of the
use of the term and you have to walk out

of SBB

[Music]
now you we call one Mia you don't let me
you know what please don't do this
it becomes crosstalk listen to me you
know this we don't know I see the [¬†__¬†]
you see a controversy broke out this
week Sanjeev with the Congress party
saying that we will remove sedition what
about removing I'm talking to Sanjeev
please review it will be polite to let
someone's weak pen is on your side for
35 minutes is quite you see if you
strike down sedition as far as I'm
concerned sedition is the only
legislation which protects me through
law
on what is anti-national and what is not
you can't take this garb of liberalism
and tolerance to be used as croaks -
straight down solution
I want solution to stay because if
sedition does not stay will all Gandhi
take personal responsibility tomorrow if
a rally is held saying Bharat keep our
body rally or the Congress party is
elected so I am amazing very serious
issues and if the Congress party scrap
sedition laws will rule Gandhi
personally guarantee that Gautham Nala
car will not go to MU and make out a
case for manonmani
of the Hizbul Mujahideen by saying the
following words my point is if you
compel people like man and Hwanhee
to pick up the gun are you talking about
in other words openly campus and I'm
talking to him you don't need me both of
you don't need me both of you don't need
me I can go by water by now we'll
discuss that later she cannot don't get
provoked wait
you don't want me Oh God the Supreme
Court
you are silly talk about supreme Allah
is the debate about something you love
no it is not but now listen Jesus
awesome when I say popular Sony Chopra I
know you are in a very vocal we don't
remind go it's very nice it's fantastic
to see you so energetic but just wait a
while my question is Sanjeev silver
stuff is striking down sedition and
therefore leaving the country open to
acts of sedition nationalistic or anti
national you make your point and one
person from this side will respond to
that very serious point out here ok just
allow me my because I I get very
insecure with a vision wide because I
didn't want to go into the pony one I
don't want to speak over anyone
yesterday or Thursday it was when Rahul
Gandhi made this statement and I
actually tweeted that in an atmosphere
and nationalism is the theme of 2019
it's a politically not a very correct
statement to make that he'll scraps now
but there are issues with the Sedition
law it is a British time law we all know
and we have all talked about it Congress
has misused it BJP has it misused you
know what my problem is
with those is it anthem I filled my
problem with that side is very simple
isn't it how come they have decided to
become the arbiters of who is
nationalists Suzy but also my specific
reason I asked you the question wait a
minute you will not are there and you
look and you look at two meters and 75
centimeters okay go ahead
listen to me here if not to protect anti
Nationals then why do you want to revoke
a law that blocks hatred against India
what is sedition blocking
wait a minute let me argue my point 124
a what does it make punishable whoever
by words either spoken or written by
science or visible representation brings
or attempts to bring into hatred or
contempt disaffection towards the
government established by law in India
yes now I want to tell you this you can
say that this can be misused when laws
against rape can be misused log and Audi
can be refused even a law that goes
against a murderer can be misused that
does not mean you don't have a lot of
0.1 although you can see I have a
limited expression I can
almost kill a person but he may not be
dead and hence don't take culpable
homicide against me is that going to be
an argument it won't similarly similarly
you can say I am almost being maybe you
know I'm inciting people not to the
point of disaffection as per my
understanding of the English language
and hence don't provoke it against me
that is a foolish thing because a
problem with many of these NGO types
this gautham narlikar types is they
think they speak better English then
then the police inspector who's sitting
in the local thana has they understand
it better but they must understand the
sentiment of the people of India is
clear about it
go back was the slogan is going go back
yeah it is international
this is not understand why don't you
answer my question because there is a
body they're happy hot generally there
has been there has been talk of the tape
seven judges benches are free allowed
seven judges of Supreme Court in Qatar
not sink versus state of Bihar this was
the exact issue with a sedition law is
valid law or not their Supreme Court in
fact enhance expanded the Sedition law
what Supreme Court said and I'll quote
Supreme Court said any such word which
incites or has tendency to incite or
even intention to incite violence
disorder
do you know there was a poster
[Applause]
[Music]
- you guys have louder voices and me so
you get to me I don't have a voice but
let me speak why are you supporting a
law that was written by Thomas Macaulay
your government has sent the Sedition
law should be scrapped how can I answer
she's Fukushima money I will you don't
need an anchor then one thing is the
program you don't
this is too much you guys have to butt
in no you are not appreciating the fact
that you are not understanding two audio
layers nobody will hear I'm making a
genuine request I will let you come in
but I was on trust and faith you are
both welcome come on now the question is
wait a minute please before you come in
each current because you know I want to
ask you and please understand I Artie
can I have your attention she mentions
Lord Macaulay I have one question - this
is a 1870 law I accept it
I want to ask you two three things in
just hear me from 1947 to what 1964 yeah
one minutes Lisa don't complain 63 and
then this did this law of sedition exist
very happily and it Congress use it
during Nero's period yes did they want
to scrap it they wanted to I also want
gold took poison this guy second point
is second point is did this law was it
in existence and very strongly enforced
by in the Ragan absolutely did they do a
thing about removing it taking it have a
manifesto never grew a 9-point third
point allowed to complete third point
was it used very actively during Rajiv
Gandhi's time very supremely actively
sedition which is being spoken about
Macaulay's law was one of Raja
when these personal favorites did he use
it yes he did did they want to remove it
no then what happens is that to create
or a gang incidents happens in 2016 by
now this Lobby has realized the national
sentiment is against it til then it was
been happily used till to create okay a
gang was found until JNU happened they
never thought of scrapping the law at
all in fact when the UPA was in power
for ten years and when that what is his
name the owner of that failing Clear
Channel failed TV channel
there was one there's a Minister
particular Minister no no he was a
minister for law and justice it was a
very people year when the UPA was in
power for ten years and the gentleman
was a minister himself for law and order
did he ever say I have a quest to scrap
sedition because I'm a liberal you need
to complete my sentence I have a need to
express myself and I need to talk and I
need to express myself I'm a progressive
liberal I need to scrap sedition did he
talk about it once known so I want to
know in fact I'll tell you one thing
Kapil Sibal
spoke against sedition is even
advocating against sedition going
against Indian interest the question is
this decision to do away with sedition
is not a stray comment are they
understand in perspective even
advocating against sedition goes against
Indian interests how do I deal with
those people who are constantly saying
scraps additional office before an
election
to complete argument with eglise turn on
please in the noise let her not read not
realize how wrong she is I need I need
you I am asking your questions a green
historical fact always clear please
understand by the way
IPA section 124 a D was not an IPC to
late teens 1870 right there was
something similar in what you called
McCauley and Macaulay was not 1870
Macaulay was 1830s so I know my facts he
wrote the 1860 loss the problem with you
is one problem with you and Caravan is
that you don't look at Henry T I just
made a stray comment so the question is
this that that the Java the draft Penal
the draft Penal Code was made in the 831
but I am NOT going I am going into
medieval it's fairly modern my question
is please know you tell me one thing you
tell me one thing my simple question to
you is one please tell me see please
tell me a single instance in the 65
years they were in power when the
Communist Party even thought of
scrapping the Sedition law one question
one second second give me a single
statement today so Google before to
create 27 sort of sedition I am NOT
spying on behalf of the community not
16b all I'm saying is all I'm all I'm
saying is why you're behaving like them
also all I'm saying is why did you
realize
a small point I'm not bothered what the
void is avoided especially after Jean
not bothered what the Congress party for
myself for myself only speak for myself
I will not speak because you know I just
have one I'm not saying once again all
these 1860 laws started falling one by
one organizer of RSS was banned in Delhi
in 1947 Delhi High Court said article 19
you can't ban organizer the famous case
of a communist paper went to Supreme
Court remains top Supreme Court said you
can't ban the newspaper First Amendment
by Nehru was what first amendment saying
bring in restrictions to speech not even
reasonable restrictions we are America
refused to pilot the amendment will say
no restrictions then they made it
reasonable restrictions so leave alone
reviewing the law our Constitution in
the Constituent Assembly gave us a law
he would have dismissed and abolished
all these laws once again don't
interrupt me he would have a bonus today
sure if you wanna
[Music]
these arguments of the coolers in the
dustbin of history
I just want to ask this can't wait
Sanjeev listen you know please let us be
a little logical and let us not say that
we will not raise the

if the Congress is saying in Chidambaram
tweeted this he said section 104 a of
IPC that defines the offense of sedition
must go lock stock and barrel right
please tell me in the ten years that he
was a member of the Cabinet Committee on
security cabinet Committee on Economic
Affairs he could have decided everything
between 20 2004 to 2014
why did it not occur to him even once to
say the following the second point every
time in the past my question is what is
the hurry see my question is of intent
and I think RT without emotion about it
allow me to most of the ills of this
country can be traced back the longest
party because they have the artists and
even scientist team what is not obvious
and where you are going wrong is the
following let us look at a whenever a
law has been brought it's gone through
you process when the Prevention of
Terrorism Act happened one of the first
part is to insist that it go through the
process of going through the law
commission was the Communist Party
they said katate was a law commission
chairman they said unless it goes to law
commission we cannot have an evaluative
approach towards this now let me tell
you the shocking thing
rtu said that okay you said that it
should be strengthened and I say that it
should but wait you reviewed and
contextualized sure let me tell you let
me tell you many of you may not be
applied I'll tell you the facts ERT
since you believe that India lost
civilization since the BJP came to power
let me tell you one thing let me tell
you what certainly lot civility
sensibilities only they've got a glove
one may one miss you see you need
around aluminum remember this it has
already been clarified in Parliament by
the Minister of State Hans Raj ahead in
a Lok Sabha reply last year please
understand why these are foolish debates
it's fake news
he said the launch edition will be
amended if required and he went on to
say the following words please hear me
the report of the Law Commission is
awaited I don't understand absolute
means unless you feel the
[Applause]
my point is the counter you see is
current on an issue CRT you said that
narrowed in one solution now I'll tell
you the head he made a statement saying
that he wants the solution law to be
scrapped but he never did it actually
lemma did it actually one minute please
Kenna now now you'll have to let me
connect this him otherwise you take over
the debate I'll tell you one thing party
I'm ITU will have now have to have the
I'm not saying patients you will have to
have the knot humility I would say to
you as ability I would say you must have
the open-mindedness to listen to what
I'm about to tell you can may I you see
I have studied the contradictions of
Nehru better than most people and I
don't suffer from any sense of false
humility hence I will tell you I'll tell
you when you look at you if you look at
and what I need to know
in 1955 the Act was amended in 1955
nehru when he was Prime Minister got the
act amended to enhance the punishment
for sedition to imprisonment for life
you realize of big this's section 124 a
by Nehru amended it the Indian Penal
Code 124 a by providing for punishment
or transportation for life or any
shorter term the provision was amended
by act number 26 in 1955 Nehru
substituted the punishment for life or
with fine with imprisonment for three
years and or with fine so he was
constantly amending this to make it
stronger now I need to explain this to
you
you give me any other which way in which
you would take on any activity which
goes against India's interest give me
any Clause of the law or you say that in
this country you don't need any Clause
at all you know the problem is the
problem is that you are you choose to
hear only what you want to hear you
don't actually listen to what I'm saying
you just made up your mind that I'm
saying this and then and then precisely
what is happening whoredom needs some
defense capable of defending himself
carefully you don't try to put anything
in between I thought on what you want
you want to basically scrap the Sedition
Act and that is what the Arnim is
talking about that it was basically the
and in the u.s. 98 98 in USA in 1798 the
same act was brought it was scrapped in
1820 in USA it's a very progressive
country and it's the most liberal
country where all your liberal things
are forgetting one you are once you are
entering the USA what happened in USA
again it was reconsidered and in 1918 in
the USA and it's more stronger than what
it was in my question to you is please
understand can I come to a consensus on
this panel that anti-national includes
everything which wants including the act
of wanting to give the states and
anything that jeopardizes the Romani the
money Romani help my fellow
money my money I want to ask you
I think the streamlet money is the
chance to speak and should be allowed to
speak mr. Romani at today you know what
happened is that there is this there is
this beam army chief the Bema me chief
Robin Chandra Shekhar Azad he said he
said maybe mccrory go fedora Duga now
listen be mccrory go you know the kind
of violence one person died property was
burned buses it was terrible violence in
India would you know ever develop he
lives right you not allow me to ride it
like a fool
thank you that my question it's polite
it's polite to listen to our questions
it's polite
my question is please tell me is it
anti-national to threaten caste-based
street violence of course it is thank
you organize Cosby's genzaburo rallies
note that is an it's not so that's what
I'm talking about
sleeplessly money if you don't allow me
first I get them to quiet before they're
quite big I start off wait a minute
please you see please understand look at
the entire matter with some sense of
perspective like I want to bring in
perspective into the debate right like
when I spoke about Nehru you know people
don't like it but what did Niro do
earlier the punishment for sedition was
transportation for life as maximum
punishment which means management or
exile what didn't he do
narrow Hardin did to bring in bring into
H ambit absolute life imprisonment what
does this mean after he speaks against
addition ed sedition he effect leave a
hardened the rule against addiction he
didn't scrap it that's hypocritical now
I don't even want to go back to the
1950s I ask you today there's a person
called Adam that the Roy
she says Sanjeev and my next question to
you is this with his reckless preemptive
strike on Bala coat in Pakistan
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has
inadvertently undone what previous
Indian government's almost miraculously
succeeded in doing for decades is that
statement when you call it a reckless
preemptive strike on Bala Court in
Pakistan right preemptive in double
quotes and he called she calls it
reckless you
an Indian citizen simply asked me is
that attempt to demoralize and
[Applause]
please don't side with the lies
Monica wait Monica wait please
now let's be very sharp on this when the
political party is launched you know
what the jamaat-e-islami J&K have done
they have complete links with subversive
activities if and if you tell me tell me
one thing just speaking a lot today one
article me I left supported the JNU
Lobby months ahead of the Bengal
elections you made an argument here that
matter is in is being seen through the
legal process if it is going through the
legal process why are you supporting him
them in the interim the left supported
for the Albin guilty when this will have
to be proved what is the me to urban
axial movement what what is the me to
open movement about are you overturning
I'm absolutely not but I'm asking you
are you overturning the legal process
before every election you finder to
anti-national before every before every
election the group panders to antennas
I'm sorry I'm sorry sorry
Vegeta solution of the Sedition Act and
that is why they are trying to bring it
is being misused by the Congress
comments what I am saying or the
basically putting behind the bar to the
a diva system are condoms in 2014 by the
Congress government there that is a show
that is this again I said when I said
than the J what I meant Sanjeev now
you've said your piece allow me I'll
just say couple of sentences that all
those who think or you believe are
seditious people or anti-national please
register a police case against them
[Applause]
[Applause]
it's got the got the emergency like that
which was a kill a piece of Krishna
Nagar
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
one by one fifteen minutes on the debate
I want to ask you a few person when the
Congress says that those who carried out
this nationalist or carried out the
attack was interrupting I cannot debate
this nobody here wants to hear there is
no one to twist everything that we are
saying because you
he was a television
[Applause]
my next question to you is send you by
avoiding my question if they want to
avoid my question because they are
avoiding they are avoiding
can you gonna stop why anyway anyway you
see the problem is you will need to
understand this you need to understand
this in the garden tell no no no you
guys have to understand this in my last
question which I made on the Congress
party homegrown terrorist question
listen to me and just listen to it
calmly RT was completely stuck in the
reply and she was tied in knots
and you interrupted and then she started
singing or letting me speak with Jay
escape route therefore no you didn't let
me my next question to you do not say
these things you I was form even Rahul
Gandhi wouldn't require so much time now
my question is now what are you trying
to say then I ask you let me ask you do
you think there is nobody reads it
nobody nobody gives a damn for it but I
quoted because of the anti national
article written there I have no qualms
in saying that in my view when you say
we do analysis of whatever limited class
it has just a background of the 40 CRP
of Jevons whose deaths were confirmed
immediately after the attack when you do
the caste census of the Palama matters
is that anti-national or not yes it is
anti-national it is anti-national so to
call those people who did it
anti-national is appropriate or
inappropriate it was an int national act
I think it was a stupid act stupid to
everything you know
no because there are Sarah they say it's
not India there are certain times there
are certain times when we have to
remember when we should be rising above
all these concentrations no undeb you
cannot go to mr. Romani just because my
answer is more sensible I called it very
sensible piece of journalism then you
would have allowed me to when certain
students have said that I don't when an
AMS you win an a mu student house the
jaws of the
[Applause]
please understand who you made why is
all this happening and I'm going to
close the debate in five minutes but I
want to ask you you made your your aware
you made a mistake is anyone anyone is
proudly nationalistic you called them
jingoist everyone is proudly
nationalistic you said their
hypoventilating and the problem with you
especially the left here is that you
made it about the narrative about
jingoistic nationalism even post the
airstrikes you have an anger problem
with nationalism and and you put out
press releases saying the postponed wama
developments are seeing an orchestrated
efforts to rouse jingoistic nationalism

yff_tDzswEk,New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern Issues Statement On The Christchurch Mosque Shootings,Republic TV is India's no.1 English news channel since its launch. It is your one-stop destination for all the live news updates from ...,2019-03-15T07:34:13Z,Republic World,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yff_tDzswEk/hqdefault.jpg,"absolutely questions that we'll be
asking including access to firearms this
stage I'm certainly asking people to
continue to follow the advice of the
police yes we have ever hindered there
have been three individuals apprehended
however the police aren't taking for
granted that there may may well be
others that that may need to be brought
into custody they've got no reason to
expect that but they haven't ruled it
out so please in the meantime continue
to listen to police advice but I also
want to give assurance to people the
police are obviously incredibly active
on the ground they are bringing in
additional police officers the Defence
Force are bringing them down so just
listen to the advice that's available to
you but we are ensuring the security of
those who are moving around in
Christchurch at this time not directly
connected to the attack that is my
understanding is in connection to the
attacks today or the individuals that
wasn't there would be a question for
Commissioner Bush I'm not sure if
there's something kind of able to share
but not anyone who is a threat to the
public certainly that is the assumption
that I would make at this stage we've
seen from one of the offenders that they
have publicized their ideology I've no
reason to assume anything other than
that those others who have been arrested
would subscribe to the same ideology
which I can only describe as
I'm not in a position to give away
additional details on the on the
citizenship at this stage Barry you know
at this point I think that's an
opportunity to really acknowledge the
work that the police are doing you know
the Ibrahim apprehending of a of a
suspect and an extremely volatile
situation really putting themselves at
risk on our behalves and I want to
acknowledge that particularly also
disarming the explosives that were as I
understand attached to the suspects cars
there were two of them they have been
disarmed now but obviously that was a
high-risk situation gives us an
indication that there was a degree of
planning around what has happened today
I cannot speculate around what the
intention was but again it was attached
to the suspects suspects vehicles not at
this stage my message would be you know
we should not be perpetuating sharing
giving any oxygen to this act of
violence and the message that set behind
it we should all be condemning obviously
what has happened here today and the
peaceful nation of New Zealand and what
all of us can at least do is ensure that
we do not share spread or actively
engage in that message of hate we have
been given assurance that online at
least those platforms where some of
those images have been shared are
actively being removed but I just ask
people don't share them
sorry can you say this is not who we are
this act was not a reflection of who we
are as a nation that is why so many New
Zealanders every New Zealand or I
imagine will be shocked by this today
because this isn't who we are you know
this is something that we all of us will
utterly reject and of course it will
take time to heal and tonight our
thoughts and our prayers need to be with
those affected but I'm sure of course
that all of us want to retain the
identity we have as a nation because
that's why those who live here live here
agencies always need to be prepared we
need to be vigilant we need to ensure
that if we have a an act like this on
our shores that we respond quickly to a
give assurances to the public that we
can protect them and they be safety is
top of mind so we are always prepared
we've personally prepared for these
things to happen an event like this of
course is always a shock but for our
agencies we were ready we must always be
vigilant obviously we've left our threat
level from low to high that's of course
so that we can continue to give
assurance to the public around this
safety it means we have heightened our
response from our agencies at the border
at the airport in fact at every level we
have a heightened response and again
that's so we can give that assurance of
safety to the public
as I say of course events like this we
always have preparations in place and of
course we'll always be working to ensure
that we've adequately responded I'm very
keen to travel as soon as I can but of
course within reason taking advice from
the police around when I can do that in
such a way that doesn't interfere with
the operational work my hope is that
that the very latest that I'll be down
there tomorrow may have come directly to
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
Trade but at least I know directly
certainly from Australia at this stage
often the messages are conveyed via
social media as well and I'm sure
everyone would want to thank them for
their thoughts and their offer of
assistance no I haven't I haven't had
any information that that confirms that
at all no no I cannot confirm that do
feel free to put that question to the
Commissioner on why these people would
miss when are you going to be meeting
with them again
look I speak to I am likely to reconvene
with them again this evening you'll
appreciate and bury that at the moment
our immediate response is on ensuring
the safety of those in Christchurch
ensuring that the police have everything
they need from an operational
perspective to secure the areas and be
assured that everyone who should be in
custody is acknowledging that they have
moved extremely quickly to have those
individuals already in custody of course
we will continue to look at the details
around the suspects and every element of
this attack but tonight it's about
securing the safety of others
this attack at the stage again as I say
three have been arrested we have no
reason to suspect at this stage there
were others but we haven't obviously
ruled that out at the stage I cannot
give you a hundred percent sure and
assurance of that but certainly all
three are connected look at the stage
obviously I'm one of the members of
parliament that always has a security
detail with me obviously the moment that
we were informed of this situation there
was a slightly heightened presence and
but I expected that soon that will
probably resume back to to my normal
presence defenders who look I can't give
specifics around who was directly
involved at each mosque and NorAm I'm
sure at this stage that that's detail
that we're sharing do feel free to put
the question to the Commissioner though
is my understanding
you know this stage advice has been
given to to those who would usually wish
to worship at their local mosque and
that for the time being they're being
asked to to just not to congregate there
but in time my hope would be that the
outpouring of compassion and support
that I know New Zealanders will want to
show show it to them shout to the
members of the community who sought to
worship safely and who were the victims
of this of the Sutekh today and I know
New Zealanders will want to do them my
understanding that it is a relatively
short period of time since last entry
into New Zealand again I don't want to
get into too many details around that
because that's still an emerging picture
[Music]
a moment is that they weren't on on a
watch list again I'm cautious around how
much more I say given that we have
individuals in custody and I don't want
to jeopardize the case but there may be
detail that the Commissioner maybe
weren't willing to share all right
everyone look I'll look to reconvene and
give you any additional insights I can
tomorrow and we'll be keeping everyone
updated my plan is just get to
Christchurch as early as I can and as
soon as the police are happy for me to
do so no I certainly can't confirm that
there's nothing like being briefed on
we'll make sure that the commissioners
able to give you information as soon as
possible thank you everyone",True,en,8899,66,110

hLR8Tj3KGq8,Mega Impact: Rahul Gandhi&#39;s Land Agent Pahwa And Robert Vadra&#39;s Aide CC Thampi Summoned By ED,Republic TV is India's no.1 English news channel since its launch. It is your one-stop destination for all the live news updates from ...,2019-03-14T10:51:04Z,Republic World,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hLR8Tj3KGq8/hqdefault.jpg,"well it's only broken on Republic TV and
op India on witnessed is getting much
bigger I remember yesterday we told you
that Congress party that is Rahul Gandhi
Priyanka Gandhi and Robert Vadra are
facing some uncomfortable questions on a
land deal with a real estate agent based
out of Bagram and also CC thumpy dubious
land deals that tell you that Congress
party is direct or indirect long link
that leads to Sanjay Bhandari the story
is getting much bigger as the
Enforcement Directorate and agencies
looking at these deals have summoned
have summoned HL Paiva
who's a gurugram real estate agent who
sold the land to go to Rahul Gandhi and
Priyanka Vadra he's now in someone along
with CC thumpy who's also Robert Vadra
ade they've been someone in connection
with these landings let's go cross
straight to Siobhan joining us with
details
Siobhan well Raj an important
development as far as this land deal is
concerned because HL power the
controversial land dealer as well as a
CC Tam P a close aide of Robert Vadra
they were summoned by the Enforcement
Directorate in fact CC thumpy has come
up with a new excuse altogether saying
that he is undergoing treatment in the
United States of America and that is the
reason why he needs a month's time as
far as the actual power is concerned
Enforcement Directorate believes that he
is still in Kerala but he hasn't
responded to the summons so far and it's
important to point out that these land
these sale deeds that Republic TV as
well as op India had essentially access
these sale deeds were recovered from
actual powers residence or when
enforcement directorate had carried out
the raids thereafter this summons were
also sent asking it will power to
essentially explain his role in this
entire deal that actually took place
we've also have got some details with
regard to this entire investigation and
it's important to point out here that
sale deeds the Enforcement Directorate
suspects could be back dated and there
is this entire money flow that also that
the Enforcement Directorate is looking
at to deals under the scanner which
could once again be linked to the land
deals that have been struck by Robert
Vadra Priyanka Gandhi vatra as well
as a rule gandhi that is to deal struck
during the UPA era one of the petroleum
Deal and the other the defense deal the
Pilatus deal and that's where sanjay
banderas role also comes into the
picture what the enforcement directed
essentially suspects at this point in
time is that the kickbacks that were
basically received after these two deals
were struck the proceeds of crime were
essentially used to invest in the land
deals as well as ben-ami properties in
London so there is certainly a common
thread that is running between all the
deals that have been struck by sanjay 20
as far as those land deals are concerned
and also the Benham property and that's
where a you know the bigger news lies
because at the end of the day it's the
kickback money that has essentially been
used to purchase land and the
round-tripping of money that is actually
going on and that's exactly why the
enforcement director has actually called
actual power as well as CC thumpy but
both have refused to join the probe okay
in fact one of the persons whose bill
now summoned his name is CC thumpy
shaman CC Tom Pease believed to be
Robert Vadra is close aide he's been
summoned several times a UAE based
businessman very very shady deals and
the public TVs rhythm around bhardwaj
confronted events in fact he's been
tracking him she confronted him on
several occasions here's what he said
the last time we spotted it can we ask
you a couple of questions
Alondra and Robert Vadra we've been
trying to get in touch with you and ask
you several questions of the language
and Robert Vadra why are you trying to
avoid the camera sir certain questions I
wanted to ask you several times you see
thumping see see something we passed you
several questions and wanted to ask you
about your land dealings CC Tom P if we
could just get some answers from you on
it
I shall one is joining us not sure what
now yesterday we showed that web and we
also put out that webshop on of the
money the source of the money in the
first place now land deal is one aspect
of it but I think the key link is the
money that was routed to the land deal
which is believed to be defense
kickbacks if I'm not wrong is that what
they are looking at now well they're
certainly looking at the common thread
that runs between the land deals the
pail army properties and the kickbacks
that were received from the petroleum
deal as well as the defense deal the
defense need happens to be the Pilatus
deal and as far as the petroleum deal
it's the deal that was struck between
ongc and Samsung engineering Private
Limited both the deals are basically
under the scanner of the Enforcement
Directorate important to point out here
is that enforcement directorate is
essentially looking at a money trail
that's a specific money trail of 50 flow
crore that was actually handed over to
CC Thampi which the agency believes that
was given by sanjay pandari finally
reached HL power and the land was bought
so there is certainly the kickback money
that the Enforcement Directorate is
looking into because it's important for
them to look at how this money was
routed through various shell companies
that came into the picture shell
companies that have been linked to
Sanjay pandari they have been able to
establish the money trail as far as the
bellamy properties in London are
concerned because there is a clear link
between Sanjeev and daddy Robert Vadra
and his other associates but as far as
the land deal is concerned they're
looking at another important angle
that's actually come up a new angle or
altogether it's with regard to a trust
which is operating in New Delhi and
there is one person that has been added
to this entire list we're not revealing
the name of this person because the
summons haven't really gone out so it's
better we withhold the name but
certainly a new angle essentially
developing in this entire case a new
face emerging of which again the
Enforcement Directorate believes it's a
trust that was operating out of the
national capital and this man in
question was directly in touch with the
Gandhi family so that is one thing that
we are being told that the Enforcement
Directorate
a probing at this point in time in days
2
you would also look at one more name
imaging in this particular land deal
which is going to be extremely crucial
now where is forever and where is
thumping and when was the last time
thumpy I remember he responded to the
summons where are these two people as we
know it Siobhan well in fact
Neera well in fact Najib I did manage to
speak to a top source of mind within the
Enforcement Directorate who's confirmed
that yes the Enforcement Directorate did
get in touch with CC thampi after the
raids that were carried out on these the
sale deeds that he writes actually
looking at these deals were recovered
after the raids that were carried out
part powers residence and thereafter we
been told that after the Enforcement
Directorate sent out those summons CC
thumpy has basically said that he's
undergoing treatment in the United
States of America and that's the reason
why he'll not be able to join the probe
and he's actually asked for a month time
now to join to respond to the summons
that have already been sent out as far
as power is concerned the enforcement
director believes that he's still in
Kerala and he still hasn't responded
even to the summons that have been that
have been sent out nor has he really
asked for time so it remains to be seen
how exactly is actual power going to
respond so far because after the raids
he's certainly under the scanner and
they're looking at a key link that has
essentially emerged after new names that
the enforcement directed essentially
looking at okay what we'll also do is
shaman will try and you know get a new
push arm off of India on the phone line
because she's put out that put out that
report which shows the Rahul landing for
all of us who are joining us the story
broken on the public TV and Republic
Network yesterday both of Republic bar
up the Republic TV told you about a land
deal Shawn the land deal so there is a
man called paha
a land Dayton called Pahoa who sells
landed a whole Gandhi he also sells ran
to Priyanka Vadra Robert Vadra and then
he buys back the land from Priyanka
Vadra and Robert Vadra using money that
is given by a man called thumpy who's
Robert Vadra
8 so essentially essentially the
suspicion or the investigation the scope
of the investigation is how this man was
perhaps used perhaps used to funnel
kickbacks
isn't that isn't that the story shavon
well there's absolutely no doubt the
bigger news here is that how the
kickback money was actually hooted how
they utilized this entire money looking
into the land deal because it is
certainly bizarre and this is exactly
what you've been pointing out the
dungeon since yesterday that nothing
really justifies us to why you would buy
a land at a particular price and then
you know sell it at another and there is
absolutely no link whatsoever so that
only raises more questions now the
reason behind this sort of a dubious
transaction that you're looking at is
because there is a kickback involved in
this entire deal and that's what the
Enforcement Directorate believes at this
point in time and they're also looking
at the sale deed these sale deeds they
believe because there are a few
signatures that have been missing out of
the sale deed and they suspect that this
could be back dated because if you look
at the timing of the land deal and the
timing of the kickbacks that actually
came in so there is certainly a mismatch
however there's a caveat to this entire
thing that's exactly why the Enforcement
Directorate believes that it is highly
possible that the sale deeds were also
backdated it is highly possible that the
kickback money was essentially routed
and that's exactly what they are looking
at because they have been able to
establish so far the money trail with
regards to the London binami property
because they believe that the proceeds
of crime were essentially used to buy
properties in London as far as the land
deals are concerned there are two
aspects to it one these tale T's that we
already have in possession the other is
the land deal in amid poor where once
again we are given to understand that
the kickback money was essentially used
this entire web of land deals that you
are actually looking at the bigger point
that one needs to underscore at this
stage is that this is kickback money
that has come in two very important
deals that have been made the defence
dealer the petroleum deal both the deal
that was struck during the UPA era these
two deals we are now given to understand
they're completely under the scanner of
the Enforcement Directorate and they
certainly suspect that the kickback
money was used to buy the land the
kickback money was also used to buy the
binami property Sean we'll leave it at
this for now let's see what the Congress
party says and also important
mind of yours they're all down there the
Congress party have accepted the deal
yesterday after Republic TV broke the
story Congress party admitted that Rahul
Gandhi had bought the land from this man
called Pahoa who's a land agent based in
gurugram so they've admitted to the land
deal pilot while also saying that the
land was gifted to Priyanka Gandhi not
talking about the other deals that are
under scanner so the Congress party has
admitted while also dragging in Priyanka
that was yesterday but the story is
getting bigger as the land agent in
question and also Vadra said Rajas land
agent Vadra Zaid
thumpy both of them summoned by the
Enforcement Directorate tracking the
story very closely Chauhan thank you for

and breaking news we get you the first
joint press statement that has been
released by India and Pakistan on the
cathode perceived corridor and I'm just
quoting from their entire statement here
as we also wait our colleagues to join
us live on the story the statement says
and I quote the first meeting to discuss
the modalities and the draft agreement
for the facilitation of pilgrims to
visit go to Iraq at Abu Zeid using the
Qatar for corridor was held today at
Atari in a cordial environment it goes
on to detail the kind of four aspects
actually have been put on the table good
Preet breaking more details of that
statement good treat tell us more about
this well that the meeting has been over
as you are this is the statement which
you have just read and right now we are
at Atari but we can see that the Indian
delegation will address within a half an
hour to tell that to what they have
discussed about this thing and it is
very clear on second April they are
going to a Pakistan to visit the
modalities the way they have discussed
about everything here the way the Indian
government will go and understand that
how the modalities will work in Pakistan
this is what the this is the meeting
just finished a few minutes ago and they
are the Pakistan delegation has gone to
Pakistan and the Indian delegation will
come and address the media but in the
joint statement they did not mention
about whether the terror angle has been
discussed or not that we will ask the
moment they will hold a press briefing
here at 3:30 which there which is a
scheduled time for the press briefing
they will explain and tell that how they
will work and how this corrosive
corridor will carry forward this is the
moment by the Indian government to
because this is the demand of the Sikh
community for the last so many years and
today this meeting has been held as the
first bilateral meeting between the
India and Pakistan and now the meeting
is just over and the Pakistan delegation
has gone back to Pakistan and Indian
delegation is coming to address the
media where they will tell that what
discussion had been had been done and
modalities of the Qataris corridor is
being discussed between both the
countries and now on second April the
Paxton the Indian government will go to
Pakistan where they will have a
discussion to find out that how they are
going to connect how they are going to
make this Qatar per side corridor
between both the countries by India and
Pakistan okay you know Gopi do tell us
at the next meeting now has been
scheduled for the second of April and we
are also breaking that detail on our
screens but this is also what I want to
understand from you though you know the
statement is not talking of terror but
when you talk of in here India and
Pakistan and you've seen that entire
image of Imran Khan there meeting the
weight loss aid of half a side and I'm
given to understand through our sources
that that possibly could have been
spoken in that meeting - what really are
we learning well that that is the one of
the main agendas from Indian government
because the way we have seen that every
time the Pakistan is backstabbing again
and again we were ready to talk and as
we know that our amia minister that
Sushma Swaraj she says that dialogue and
terror will not go side by side this is
the one of the main reasons why the
Indian government is going to highlight
and ask this question they were supposed
to discuss in the meeting in the joint
statement they haven't mentioned
anything about the terror angle that
because this is also a junction they
even though intelligence or Punjabi
intelligence they had the conducted a
survey report and they had also
mentioned that is is I is being backed
by Pakistan government and now because I
in 2020 that mission which is the
colistin mission that is also going on
and intelligence inputs were already
there but this was also the the Indian
delegation I trust you to actually ask
that question that wash terror on the
table or not for the moment good pre

who have borne
that they may be forced to pursue other
actions
at the security council if beijing
continued with this policy
remember china has for the fourth time
blocked this move to designate masood
azhar as a global terrorist now this
move was brought in
by permanent members of the united

france
united kingdom and the united states but
now china has used
a technicality to block this move and
the responsible nations
have now in a statement said that if
china continues to block this uh
designation
responsible member states may be forced
to pursue other actions at the security
council
it shouldn't have to come to that uh
chavan joins us on the phone line with
all the updates sharon this is a very
strongly worded reaction
to china's move at the s united nations
security council
almost as a warning to china to fall in
line and back the
fight on terror or else the responsible
nations who walk back the india's fight
may be forced to take other actions
well with this comes the statement comes
from a
united nations security council a
diplomat who
essentially said that responsible united
nations security council members would
perhaps be forced to pursue other
actions
this is as is in response to what we've
essentially seen
uh last night where we've seen china
putting a technical hold
on the proposal that was essentially
moved by
uh the p3 nations you've had a united
states
uh as well as uk and france basically
moving a proposal after the perwama
attack to designate
muslims as a global terrorist remember
this
particular proposal now was blocked
by china now with regards to perhaps the
step that has been taken by china
remember
that essentially doesn't really mean
either the proposal gets
completely killed but it is got delayed
by another six months
and as per rule perhaps china still
could
delay for further three months but as
far as the proposal
is concerned it still remains alive but
clearly
the kind of response that we've
essentially seen with you know china
still going ahead with what we have done
it has only uh you know backfired as far
as china's entire policy is concerned
and the kind of statements that they
have made post the perhaps
saying that they have also taken uh you
know hard steps as far as
counter terrorism is concerned but
clearly at this point in time
all such promises made by china appear
to be completely
short hollow given the fact that they
haven't really taken
the step that many would be expecting at
this earth

pilot proof of the barcode strike is out
and open it's here with Republic TV ten
pictures show how Indian Air Force
destroyed Jai Simha birth champs in
Bollywood impact of the strike seen in
these pictures musgraves Pakistan Army
bakers and ambulances spotted a
precision strike by Israeli spies 2000
missiles and destroyed the biggest
Jewish camp in Bala code
and Congress heaps more insults on
forces called airstrike in event demands
casualty figures love
well the opposition did it in 2016 they
wanted the proof of surgical strike they
were given the proof they are generated
in 2019 they wanted the proof of an
airstrike and today we have the proof
the opposition now chooses to call it an
event the opposition yesterday called it
an accident but when this proof is out
on your channel
what is the opposition going to say now
for the first time ever the biggest
proof that airstrikes not only happened
but in the very heart of terror camps in
Pakistan Khyber Pass tuned WA we
decimated pjh camps in the burning
question tonight we are square as Imran
Khan and those sections of international
media which questioned the professor in
area Foresters Imran Khan want more
proof when it comes to airstrikes the
way three Jewish camps were pounded by
our Indian Air Force bellacourt
Muzaffarabad and chukoti let's move on
in the burning question tonight we also
ask when this proof is out where will
Imran can't run now is this not a bigger
embarrassment staring at the face of
Pakistan and adding more to its
international credibility crisis and
also international isolation and back
home back home when we talk about the
blatant politicization of the airstrikes
by the opposition we ask in the burning
question tonight will the show prove
Brigade and now come forth and apologize
the nation never asked the nation ever
questioned it ever wanted the proof but
then opposition raked it
they politicize it where is the
opposition now and before we go into the
debate on the burning question tonight
let's explain to our viewers niranjan
and I'm Swami redditor explains the
visual proof which actually speaks
volume of how decisive these strikes
were and how it actually decimated dj's
terror camps in Bala code in Pakistan
you
what it does it's a smart guided
air-to-surface droppable from a standoff
range so this was deployed from the by
the Mirage 2000 above Pakistan
it's a fire-and-forget Messiah uses
electro-optical guidance as wing
commander nip was trying to explain it's
automatically hits the target relying on
our navigation seeker which is in front
of the missile which is very it's it's
the intelligence that this missile works
with the Israeli spy mm missile is smart
it's it's an acronym for smart precise
and and in a cost-effective missile as
far as as far as the Bala code is
concerned this is what has happened look
at it very closely now this this wall
explains that the entire operation from
the Agra airbase some of the air warning
systems were airborne just to explain to
our viewers the entire operation that
unfolded on the 26 from the Borelli
airbase some of the Sukhoi 30 MK eyes
were deployed by the indian air force to
give support to the operation that
evening from hal vara once again a few
more Sukhoi 30 MK eyes were deployed
that evening to join the 12 mirage 2000s
to be a part of this secret operation in
which the jewish camp was targeted and
from Bhatinda another embraer air
warning aircraft was airborne now this
system this plate also took off now all
of these planes were headed in one
direction and all of them were headed
towards Pakistan look at this just over
Muzaffarabad this spice 2000 missile is
deployed and on your screen the manner
in which this missile operates it enters
the target it penetrates it penetrates
the target it penetrates the target goes
inside the building and explodes killing
people inside but it does not destroy
the entire structure itself
colonization of this event should be
avoided people from the ruling party are
making statements about how many seats
they will get you see a road up as many
statement about Karnataka about how many
seats his party will get posters event
this is sheer blatant volatilization of
an event which cannot be accepted we
stand behind any action the round for
cystic we have proud of the valor and
the courage there is absolutely no
debate on that no one can even think of
questioning the action of armed force
so we was exactly after 12 days of bull
mama 12 days after the pill Varma
Massacre our forces took revenge not one
but perhaps were pounded and Bala coats
the first proof is out and such an
palette of the Congress chooses to call
it an event does it not add more insult
to the injury when it comes to the
martyrdom of her forces defense experts

was the BJP that created the doubts
because every leader of des gave a
different figure when gossipy Sharma can
you please I mean I it's laughable when

opposition calls it accident
when they talk about the numbers then
they try to trigger a national debate as

whole world is learning that only a few
countries have this capability which
India realized under the leadership of

whether mediation will be the way head
any moment now
eleven eleven a.m. the bench assembles
any moment we shall know from the
five-judge bench whether they believe in
their wisdom mediation is the order of
the day remember in the last hearing
26th of February they had deliberated
and asked all the parties to come before
them and to state whether they believe
mediation is the way forward all the
parties had given out their dialogues to
the top court after which today the top
court of five bench senior bench of the
Supreme Court had to give out an order
today on whether mediation would be the
way forward so very crucially even as
Sagarika we are joined by a guest today
becomes very relevant the idea bench
assembles they owe their bench is going
to be passing an order on whether
mediation is the way forward last time

together let them be looked at by a
court monitored mediation happen that's

update coming in from the Supreme Court
the lawyers today are being allowed to

matter for mediation all right that
becomes very crucial because in the last
hearing the Supreme Court has said we
want to give time to all the parties to
give us their stand
the Hindu parties or the Muslim parties
at that time immediately and
spontaneously certain parties had said
we are in for mediation some parties had
said we are not in for mediation both
the parties will now be given a chance
to put forward their stand for mediation
so there will not be an ordered
immediately we can go back to our
panelists we can go back to the justice

Aspire Cisco LED and Sterling holiday
differently Rajan the Singh is also
joining us on the show but I want to go
across to both RP Singh and DK Giri
first up with me in the studio
DK Giri the fact that the Prime Minister
is talking about the fact that they are
not going to relent on the war against
terror the fact that he is talking
openly about it the fact that perhaps
opposition today feels that the current
government is doing what they could not
do when in power and therefore the
current government might get some
electoral benefit out of this is that
why the opposition has lost its bearing
because it seems after surgical strikes
for these airstrikes also DK agree they
continue to do the same politics now is
it our fault the fauces fault
the country is fault that they don't
know what they could do at that time
after 26/11 or after Parliament attack
yeah we all know that the opposition has
the right to ask ourselves what they are
asking wrong questions I must say that
instead of questioning the the evidence
ends or asking for evidence of the
airstrikes they should question the
government on the strategy and the
policy there are ten different questions
that can be raised from the policy
failure of the current government for
which we have this crisis but the
costumes are wrong I mean the army
action should not be questioned but
lions are doing it DK Gary electoral
issues or electoral you know arithmetic
cannot be the reason this kind of
politics that's my question completely
lost interest yes and in the name of
democracy you cannot support nationally
give me some give me some give me wind
up your 6-deuces that is tinder treats
worked are you ready not need loskutov
our california home at campo de rigueur
sorry
so they talk about trees and when the
green says that give us proof when one
over the world
chief says that give us proof when they
alliance partner says that it never
happened I mean use all our all a
fabricated again and when they say those
another [¬†__¬†] or just below code is
not there pal Accords different ballot
work so completely okay so when you do
all this you raise question on the
weather of the air force and you force
the air for sea to come on the court to
tell you yes you were given a target we
hit the target and there are the port's
now that they were cleaner mobile phones
on that target
so when target is hit you cut you are
saying no your mr. foreign minister mr.
dick we're saying and you general secter
you saying oh why don't you have give us
evidence like the u.s. gave object or
seven that was one to one hitting it
does air strike the different building
air strike and one to one hitting so
please don't belittle my friend are
missing one sentence likewise
example told you there are confirmed
reports now with the system that they
were more than
see the question is not how many
casualties please understand this is a
great diversionary tactic it seems the
opposition has found rotten Shahji
because it takes away from the fact that
there's a complete shift in policy when
it comes to terror attacks in India the
Prime Minister has just reiterated the
fact that it doesn't matter where the
terrorists are the camps are we're going
to strike this seems to be a
diversionary tactic so I raise my
question again is it raising any kind of
doubt on the air force a strike at a
time when Pakistan is trying to do this
and discredit these strikes across the
world isn't this as good as raising
doubts on the forces that is the
question you see let me put in a very
different perspective this is I got a
people camera in the bedroom who put a
camera behind a spouse would put a
camera in the bathroom saying whether
the kid has got to bathroom or not they
would see whether a spouse's gone where
she or he is going to say so this
suspicious nature is most horrifying
secondly they are laying where the
intelligence of the security forces know
nobody in the world would have such a
proof imagine 1970 bunch when Israel
Gandhi fought and created Bangladesh
good people if they asked for the proof
that America for your ability had
actually helped by mukki by Nene or
whether the surrender was real or
whether the atrocities in the Bangladesh
are real that would be such a shameful
act so does this kind of continuously
look at Pakistan their Air Force pilot
died he was lynched to nearly linked to
death and died in hospital they're
denying it
they don't own it up and none in the
focused Hani media or from helium has
ever questioned this
don't abuse the forces I was reminded of
what is happening now he has been called
out for his government because you
cannot keep going on like this I'm
asking you a question you have to stop
and answer my question the truth haha
she thought you have to stop and answer
my question this is not the way it's
going to go so how come no
notlikethis pression they are trying to
so then then listen to Mina then listen
to me give me time to answer your
question you know what my question is
happening here is the whole nature are
you saying there shall be no action
setting it please listen to it the
question here is that nobody is know the
whole nation knows that the Air Force
has struck nobody is questioning that
what the nation is questioning is how
these secret details were leave because
just now mr. RP Singh was they saying
that this is not just be made of driving
under gravity you should have been
discussing lies now let me make of the
fact the question is if you can amuse me
pallies don't should not abuse and abuse
avoided talking above anyone who just
the Army's being used to fight election
but he believes it I mean this is the
most bizarre logic left non general
okay before we get him back with us I'm
pissing you want you to come in yes
please don't belittle army
don't risk question on the Valor of the
army what I doing when you say proper
things appeared again nothing to do sir
we are not hiding behind of you know not
seeking vote on a mahogany we are saying
that because Prime Minister Modi what
courage enough and has said I'm not
waiting for heaven's sake yes please go
ahead yeah what I actually wanted to say
was that the whole situation is rather
pathetic it is hardly the time or it is
hardly the type of operations on which
there should be any politicking
whatsoever I feel that your army or Air
Force the whole country's proud of it
irrespective of the type of government
that we have we have always delivered so
anything you found army says or the Air
Force says must be taken as a gospel
truth and no question need to be raised
on that because they won't tell you a
lie that is point number one point
number two is is becoming a prime
minister or winning elections all that
important is it more important than the
existence of the nation I think it is
high time that our politicians realize
this and unnecessarily do not pick holes
in each other stories to try and score
political points let the selection be
fought on a sentiment that has come in
from the Prime Minister just barely
twenty minutes ago

our forces because you only want to play
politics can the opposition be allowed
to do that and for how long shaman well
we've seen this happening soon after the
ori attacks and thereafter the
opposition started questioning saying
that what is the proof of the surgical
strike in the first place and you've had
some you know below-the-belt comments
made by political leaders saying these
are farcical strikes a similar sort of a
situation essentially pans out now after
the successful airstrikes that were
carried out by the Indian Air Force but
a befitting reply coming in from the Air
Force chief what would say a very sober
response coming in from the Air Force
chief and what many would say is that
those questioning the very claims made
by the Indian Air Force have very little
military knowledge otherwise they
wouldn't have come up with such bizarre
questions to begin with now when an
operation of this nature is basically
carried out once the targets are hit you
don't expect the Indian Air Force to
start now counting dead bodies now
that's absolutely impossible how do you
do that in the first place now there is
a method that is attached to it that's
known the bomb damage assessment which
is done after a strike of this nature
that is not done by the Indian Air Force
when they care about this entire
operation and this is a post you know
sort of a a post operation a system that
is basically in place and that is done
by another you know Center which is
basically well equipped to basically
figure out what was and the damage
caused by the air strikes and a you know
those imagery
is basically part of the satellite
imagery that the government is in
possession with now whether or not to
release it there are multiple factors
that are in place whether national
security is compromised or not and what
objective does it really achieve by you
know releasing those pictures all of
that basically factors in it is not
about domestic politics at the end of
the day we have a lot to answer and that
is the reason why the government would
also be very cautious before releasing
any imagery at this point in time it is
a you know a well-thought-out decision
that would be discovered only then
perhaps you would expect this sort of
you know proof perhaps to be put out but

potential misuse of the f-16 jet the
Indian Air Force on Thursday remember
display parts of the Amram aim-120 see
missile which was used by Pakistan to
take aim at Indian targets and as far as
America is concerned now saying that
they're aware of the reports and are
seeking more information because if they
have used it and they have it is a

isn't that correct shower that's exactly
what participants has been trying to
hide all this while even ask the press
conference that was conducted by the
TGIF yeah the first reaction was right
in the formation that was actually used
there was no f-16 now that was only
because they know that this is a clear
violation of the end-user three but that
was signed with the United States of
America with the clear instructions of
these f-16 that would basically handed
over to Pakistan that would essentially
fuels against terror groups now this is
a clear violation because remember it's
an aggressive suit by Pakistan by you
losing his f-16 that were given by the
United States of America
yes today us essentially feels that
there is a violation after getting a
report from Pakistan then it would be
more trouble Pakistan because that could
mean the supply part for the f-16 would
be stopped because remember this is this
is the aircraft which is built by
Lockheed Martin and they give it to
understand that as for the agreement if
there is any sort of violation then US
has discretion to stop providing the
spare part for this particular ethically
right and you know the the stand taken
by Pakistan so for one they denied the
use of f-16s in any offensive operation
against India - they
neide firing any missiles on Indian soil

what was the display that is the Ambrym

handed it to Pakistan in fact it is a

that you are tracking as you're
reporting from the line of control see
Sagarika what's happening on the line of
control let me tell you first but since
the guns have fell silent on the borders
here in orisons yesterday but there is
an uneasy calm that is prevailing on the
ground because the authorities are so
all all the agencies are expecting that
something will
from across the border and that's why
the reinforcement the alertness is being
maintained and also the sufferers are
the border residents because they have
been dislocated they can either go to
their places not they can have move to
the safe MIT makeshift originals that
had been put in place by the
administration because so far they are
completely potential palpable on the
ground that we see the army then we
speak to the army people here they say
that we are alert with the men and fella

from the international border the way
the violations are being taken place so
we can say this in an ism calm or here

more about the ruck shaman trees meeting
with the Tri Services chief very
important because after yesterday the
way Pakistan did not met its ways even
violating air spaces even at the LOC
this is important in Milazzo Sitaram
induction monthly is speaking review of
the border situation as we speak from
the Tri Services chief
so shovin over to you what why are you
picking up the brief that could possibly
or likely come from Rajahmundry to our
try services cheetahs go all out and
don't spare them when the Tri Services
chief met Prime Minister late last
evening we are given to understand the
prime minister made it very clear that a
free hand would be given to the security
forces they can go ahead with any plan
with regards to the strike back now with
as far as Raksha man 3 is concerned
remember she is actually essentially
detailing the bottom management also
looking into the kind of reaction that
are coming in from Pakistan monitoring
every development that's actually
happening in Pakistan would also become
crucial as far as the entire
intelligence plan is concerned because
we are given to understand that multiple
charters have picked up that there has
been a significant deployment coming in
from Pakistan in the border areas and
also troop movement from Sialkot
cantonment not just that the fact is
that with regards to Pakistan Pakistan
essentially also right now trying to
scramble and then basically trying to
come up with a response looking at the
kind of response that came in from the
Indian Air Force now on wetness day when
this entire this adventure was thwarted
by the Indian Air Force when Pakistani
EF 16th basically tried to intrude into
the Indian airspace now that was one
attempt that was completely thwarted by
the Indian Air Force by the combat air
patrol that was put in place so in the
meeting perhaps that we are given to
understand the drugs about three also
looking into multiple options available
at this point in time very important is
that right now the top priority
so the government is also the return of
Wing Commander been undone because that
becomes extremely crucial this is
something that India has already picked
up with with Pakistan the Acting High
Commissioner of Pakistan was basically
suffered by the Ministry of External
Affairs where India strongly protested
the unprovoked aggression shown by
Pakistan and also reminding Pakistan
that what they were essentially doing
with wing commander Abbey London where
locals were basically beating him up
where the fact that the entire I get
approached that a Pakistan had
essentially adopted with a wing
commander abandon there was a strong
protest lodged by India saying that
remember the Geneva Conventions and as
for the juvenile conventions that cannot
possibly treat a prisoner of war in this
particular manner that's right try
services chief our meeting Radmila
Sitaram and the meeting is underway the
rock shaman tree in fact is seeking
overall review from the Tri Services
chief as far as the border management

the border is considered the review of

and first up on this edition of the news
we are breaking one more lie of Pakistan
in fact that's my colleague shovin who's
joining us on top of this edition of the
news
shavon this is Pakistan Army's lie on
the judge facility that again stands
busted tell us how well Republic TVs now
accessed a picture which perhaps
Pakistani army would certainly find it
very difficult to deny a picture which
basically exposes the lie that has been
peddled by the Pakistani army this is a
picture which we are basically access
it's a signboard which exists in Bala
code now this particular signboard
viewers clearly indicates that a mother
saw was being run by jesh of Muhammad in
Bala court the same very training camp
that has been destroyed by the Indian
Air Force now in this particular
signboard which we've also got a
translation done this signboard clearly
indicates that a mother saw in Bala
court was being run by Masood Azhar on
the right of this picture you have
Masood Azhar's name written and also on
the left is Yusuf Raza Yusuf other is
the very man that has been eliminated in
this particular airstrike that was
carried out by the Indian Air Force
there we are given to understand that at
a Lima Quran was being taught in this
particular Medusa and the signboard
clearly indicates that this mother she
existed in that very place important to
point out here a deep day is that
several international news agencies have
also quoted residents of Bala code who
have admitted that there is a mother
sigh in that very area which was being
run by cheshire Mohammed so viewers what
we have is a visual evidence the
evidence of a signboard which clearly
indicates that a mother saw was being
run by Jesse Mohammed we're given to
understand that this is in the guise of
a mother so it's a training facility
of the Jacob home but this is exactly
what the Indian intelligence agencies
have also told her public TV that as far
as the training facility is concerned
heavily guarded by the Pakistani army as
well as the ISI something that the
Pakistani army has been clearly denying
because they certainly do not have the
gumption to essentially admit that Jerry
Muhammad was essentially operating from
that very place can the Pakistani army
now really deny the existence of this
very picture the picture clearly
indicating the signboard basically
showing that there is a mother sigh in
that very place in that signboard they
clearly writing that Masood other is the
man who runs this particular mothers are
along with him
you have Youssef phazon and not just us
but the international media also now
reporting and which we have also access
to in those reports they've clearly
mentioned coating some residents of Bala
code saying that yes there is a mother
side in that very place and this is a
brother son that is being run by Masood
Azhar so clearly this visual evidence
only makes life difficult for the
Pakistani army who would refusing to
admit that in that particular place in
Bala code is where the training facility
was operating out of and what's
important to point out here deeply is
that not just the Indian security
apparatus that has raised concerns about
this particular training facility of the
Jesse Mohammed in fact several multiple
several inputs from not just India but
also from United States of America
coming out indicating that Bala khat is
the very place where these training
facilities are there and not just that
planning and plotting of several attacks
not just on Indian soldiers but on
American soldiers have also been plotted
from this very training facility that is
one of the reason why using the kind of
support that has basically come in from
the United States of America a strongly
worded statement this morning coming in
from the Secretary of State saying that
it is time that perhaps Pakistan acts
and a decisive manner to demolish all
these terror facilities that are and
more importantly terrorism emanating
from their soil so what the viewers we
are presenting before you is a visual
evidence of what exists in balla code
and what the indian security forces have
basically been able to demolish zero
shavon what we are at republic are doing
is exposing Pakistan's many lies
bit by bit to see it deception lies
terrorist on there are so many different
names but they just have one address
that is Pakistan shovel
well there's absolutely no dearth of
evidence when it comes to the fact that
in Bella code itself how they have been
able to run this entire terror camp
training facility where we are given to
understand that at some point in time
masood azhar used to frequently visit in
fact multiple rallies were being carried
out from the that's this very place just
few years back when there was a security
threat to masood azhar be given to
understand that he was shifted out of
Ballack or to their main camp in bihar
pool where he's actually in right now
wind protection of the pakistani army
but as far as this camp is concerned
this camp was essentially being run by
Yusuf Pathan a man who was taking all
the calls in fact Masood Azhar's son
Abdullah was also trained in this
particular camp in the year 2010
December 2010 is what we are given to
understand when the training took place
in fact in the last three months 60 jesh
of Mohammed terrorists were trained in
this particular camp so clearly what
Pakistan is trying to avoid is answering
direct questions that have been posed by
the Indian government as far as evidence
systems and multiple evidence have been
presented before the Pakistani
government but they have never acted
upon it and that is the reason why
Sunnah after the airstrikes that were
carried out India made it very clear
that there was a this was a preemptive
step that was taken and this was after
specific intelligence input essentially
to suggest that several other plants are
being hatched out of this very place and
it was imperative that the security
apparatus basically takes this decisive
call to demolish this entire training
camp and there is enough",True,en,4732,25,92

some Java Express has been stopped by

who's joining us on the phone lines from
yota Express was earlier called the
friendship Express a bi-weekly train now
stopped by Pakistan is at the breaking
input that we're getting now aishwarya
what more are you picking up right now
engine at this point of time the the
scenes what has been happening in the
last 48 hours the same thoughts thought
process was there on the Indian side but
then the Pakistanis have been able to
decide it's Riya is to leave from Lahore
tomorrow at 7 a.m. but that has been
stopped this is happening for the first
time force 2003 that the friendship
Express as you just called it the some
Auto Express has been stopped the train
Express between Delhi and the number of
occupants from the Indian side after the
polls Obama attacks had drastically
reduced but the service was still on but
that has been stalled once again I'm
repeating it was about to leave from
Lahore Pakistan tomorrow at 7 a.m. for
the national capital in New Delhi or not
has been on Iran yet okay that's a
breaking news input that says that's
coming in aishwarya breaking information
now that the train was scheduled to
leave from Lahore tomorrow but the train
has been stopped by Pakistan and
Aishwarya like you've been saying what
we also know at this point is that there
were lesser passengers already traveling
on that train but has any announcement
been made to that effect yeah before I
go cross to Aishwarya who's breaking
that information Pakistan has stopped
the some dota Express and this was
supposed to scheduled to leave from
Lahore tomorrow for New Delhi it was a
it is a bi-weekly train let's go across
to our panelist also joining us this
evening as we try and get in our inputs
are to this breaking information that
we're picking up kr
how do you how do you respond to this
information of Pakistan stopping the
some dota Express I personally feel this
is face-saving acts of them and it's
more to pace the the mood of the
Pakistani people I think you know after
all if the Pakistani government does not
take any proactive steps after having
been given the bloody nose that Bala
caught so apparently they also would
like to do some face saving acts like
this by trying to show their air power
moving being moved across the border or
cancellation of this like that that's
what that's the way I look at it as of
now yeah left in general carried out IB
I also have sort of Sukanya sort of
quickly what do you make of this aura
what do you make of this sort of as
Pakistan is begging for talks on the
other hand Pakistan is still getting for
talks while the back foot talks they've
stopped the song go to express the
engine I can tell you I I can tell you
that they are under intense diplomatic
pressure they are bankrupt economically
they realize that India's upper hand and
the world has realised that India's war
against terror has been established this
is not have already spoken sentence the
war against terror and Pakistan is
provoking India by attacking US military
installations they have to realize they
have to pay hell if they continue with
this path and the Government of India
has to realize that one strike is not
enough they have to strike the terror

can make this big news to the country
that our forces have successfully foiled
yet another brazen attempt by pakistan
air force trying to intrude into our
airspace and now pakistani jet was
inside three kilometers inside our
territory outside of the border in Jammu
and Kashmir in our sheriff sector and
our forces have shot down f-16 in lum
Valley remember three kilometers they
try to inter in our airspace we've seen
lot of activity happening in the
airspace in Krishnamurthy sector in now
sheer as well as alam where Pakistani
Air Force tried to intrude our airspace
but the good news it's coming in as we
try to explain to our viewers the
geographical location of where this has
happened where our forces in fact has
successfully brought down fighter jet of
Pakistan Pakistan f16 jets that tried to
intrude into our Indian airspace and the
shovin is joining us live with more
details on that shovin
birth cycle a massive pushback by the
Indian Air Force when once again
Pakistan essentially trying to intrude
our airspace we are now given to
understand that sue 30s which are
basically part of the combat Air Patrol
they basically ensured that any sort of
incursion that was actually made by
Pakistan that was pushed back so the
kind of propaganda that you're
essentially looking at at this point in
time from the Pakistani side should be
completely rejected because tough
sources are confirming to the public TV
that sue thirties which are basically
part of the combat air patrol that was
essentially used and that is one of the
reason why they could not cross over the
line of control that's what we are given
to understand the f16 was basically
brought down in in fact it also details
coming in with regards to a parachute
that was actually observed and were
given to understand that that basically
dropped in the area called Lum Valley
which is in the now share area so
clearly when once again Pakistan trying
to intrude and we have given it back
were given to understand there's a sue
thirties which is certainly a lethal
formation of the Indian Air Force
remember soon after the below code
attack were given to understand that the
Indian F was had stepped up their entire
surveillance and that is the reason why
this entire once again miss.adventure by
Pakistan has been pushed back massively
hmm so our Sutra T little the combat
Jets have managed to push back Pakistani
Jets f-16 brought it down shut it down
shove and continue to stay with us on
this story any information any inputs
that you can attribute to your sources
as far as the parachute that was
reportedly spotted and the pilot the
Pakistani pilot tried to eject do we
have any information about the pilot
well preliminary information coming in
at this point in time but we do know for
a fact that the parachute has been
observed by the Indian Air Force
surveillance are up we also have a
drones which have been put up the hair
on drone for the surveil is for a full
time surveillance that is being carried
out remember after the bellacourt attack
instructions that were basically given

briefed the CCS on all these my new
details as far as this retaliation by

that ccs meeting informed other
colleagues that 25 top commanders of the

these free drone strikes
he further briefed that the target
demolished was not an ordinary pteropod
remember jacoti remember Muzaffarabad

considering not only their location the
facility was also paired with the built

those images on your screens Republic

coverage of a story that matters today
all our raka leaks tracking every update
that is just outside the village month
rally the Ministry of External Affairs
we earlier also saw Sushma Swaraj just
moving out from the ministry not saying
much but we heard the the Foreign
Secretary earlier pulling out a very
very clear statement a statement I think
that the world today is a rhythm
Sokolove Chavarria namitha going to be
looking very closely Evita and more
importantly what's are being pointed out
as far as the information that's been
given to all the foreign dignitaries and
the ambassadors and the envoys is that
of China as well because China has
fought we have seen how tactically they
have been maintaining distance and they
have been supporting Pakistan all
through even today at the time when we
are looking at these strikes that has
just happened on part of India China so
far continues to remain mum remember
viewers the even at the time when the
Palama attacks that happened China did
not straightaway come forward and
condemn those attacks those formality of
that kind of the statement that came
from China's side came days later the
pool mama attacks but what we are
getting to do it's the Foreign Secretary
himself who was just a few hours back
giving out the official statement of
from the government's part on the
airstrikes that happened a pre-dawn air
strikes that happened he is a very
person who is now also briefing the
Chinese envoy on the situation
especially because China so far has been
saying that restraint and dialogue is
the only way forward but this is the
dialogue that India will be indulging in
if provoked by Pakistan by the AFP Adama
take us through that if possible because
we are now learning that China has urged
India Pakistan rhythm to exercise
restraint after the airstrikes but what
China and Beijing actually forgets
rhythm is that your India is not the
aggressor but we have F
right to defend our boundaries to defend
our men rhythm and that's exactly what
the Prime Minister also in his speech
has said I Wow will not allow India to
bow down a very clear promise coming in
from the prime minister who supervised
the entire operation a very clear
promise and even as we're ready missile
ready to missile tests have been fired
by DRDO let's quickly tell our viewers
the latest updates that are coming in
missile test has been fired by the DRDO
for the army foreign secretaries have
been briefed by foreign envoys I beg
your pardon
have been briefed by the foreign
secretary who gave that statement a
short while ago when he spoke about what
India's attack was and very attacked
viewers we attacked at the very
forefront we attacked in at those camps
at Bala Kota okay we also have visuals
right now of all those foreign diplomats
whom the government has just briefed all
of them have been briefed of India's
action against Pakistan an action that
came within 12 days of the poll Varma
terror attack an action that should
teach them a lesson these visuals show
the truth that India has now spoken out
India is also now giving out a briefing
to the foreign envoys telling them about
what's happened the MEI secretary
meeting them those visuals on the screen
clearly showing you even as the Prime
Minister assures India we will not bow
down the visuals also showing India's
keeping the global community ahead by
briefing them about the action they've
taken even the Chinese envoy has been
briefed here Shivani very crucial
Shivani that even as these hectic Poly's
are taking place the meam and Sushma
Swaraj is also going to be speaking to
the opposition parties all this coming
at a time when the Prime Minister has
assured one thing
India's strong-willed India will
continue India will attack if needed to
to save its sovereignty so there are a
lot of developments coming in from all
fronts one of course is the diplomatic
front we're all you know foreign invoice
in India have been briefed by the
Ministry of External Affairs it is the
first arm of the government that
actually came out and put on record what
was done as far as these air strikes is
concerned since then we've of course
heard the primary
as well and what the Prime Minister has
said you know without delving too much
subtle into what the action of the
military or the Air Force has taken he
has acknowledged that there was demand
for action and punitive action against
Pakistan but he did not go too much into
as far as the military action or the Air
Force action is concerned and he once
again reassured the country that it is
in good hands as far as the faith in its
Jevons and its forces is concerned he
continued to reiterate that as the head
of the government at least as long as he
is there he's not going to let down the
the pride of the country India bow down
that's a very strong message with a very
strong undercurrent there because as we
stay with these visuals remember earlier
the foreign diplomats particularly from
us from UK Amita from Russia Australia
Indonesia remember some of these
countries were the first one to condemn
Pulwama if you remember even some ASEAN
nations their diplomats their envoys
were also in fact a briefed by a VJ

Ava with you it's ironic that on a day
that you have the Prime Minister
dedicating the war memorial to all of us
remembering the sacrifice of our
soldiers you have a Mehbooba Mufti who
stoking violence she is a former Chief
Minister of the state of Jammu and
Kashmir the reason why this becomes
extremely dangerous before I tell you
what exactly she has said we put out the
burning questions that will try to get
answers from from an entire panel here
because as I said this is an extremely
dangerous remark that has come in not
from a booba movie the reason why we say
Shan Mehbooba be arrested immediately
when the reaction against her she is the
same former chief minister who said get
Pakistan a second chance once they
martyred abraeve ups the second question
will also just go up on your screens
which says hasn't even launched an anti
India campaign is she challenging the
sovereignty of the country will Mehboob
among these security be withdrawn will
that be the real test of how the state
responds to what we've heard the from
Mehbooba Mufti and as we get you those
burning questions before I take this to

take it to wash to Tosh I should though
sharp and also much at high three up I
see him there on our screen sir good
evening to all of you gentlemen Ashutosh
what is wrong with a Mehbooba Mufti will
she do this to be able to garner some
bit of words in the valley is this your
plan to get words who at least give her
the credit they get it yeah that she has
voiced
what was in her heart know if you know
who is speaking against the country
openly it was better news and she's
speaking about you're saying she's
against the country and arrest her are
you saying that I don't want every voice
that speaks in a different tone to be a
risk
difference is the country Ashutosh there
is a very thin line but there is a lie
by the codes no but according to you if
nothing that that comment actually
warrants ought to be arrested I'll just
come to Kashmir suffers with ordeal
I can only request you this is the
tragedy for our country we don't want to
say anything we don't want to do
anything we want the law to or do
everything we want the government to do
everything what is this sir GOG said
harsh Akagi I am only saying we should
have our opinion we should have our say
yes let the government do its job but
what we have to do you tell me one thing
who is attacking article 35 nobody's
attacking the government the country has
gone to a court what bigger thing can be
happening but now with the reactions the
way she has spoken is a absolute clear
cut indication of speaking against least
8 it is a contempt of court the judge
the minimum that judge should hold the
country and the judiciary to some
respect is to issue arrest was it never
one of the perhaps does not understand
that 35 a article 35 a gives supremacy
to J&K legislature

by just saying you know this is what
Mary wants I think these are natha's
like the Abdullah's and above these who
for long kernels up have only been
furthering the political gain I also
want to get in a major tendrils up and
then I'll get in marches idea but Major
General Saab why should my papa of tea
be allowed to be free
she's the same person who the other day
said give for the Pakistani Prime
Minister and other chance
good evening VP this is the irony of the
state of affairs in the J&K we have been
saying this that the local regional
political parties speak a different
language while they are addressing the
masses or when they're in the valley and
they speak a different language when
they move out of Delhi or other south of
Bonny Harvard will come to the center or
dealing with a center central government
what my mu Bob of T has said today I am
really pain that we had she in her as an
extreme in astir who should have been
striking a very sensitive balance
between the rest of the state and the
central government and the emotions of
the masses what I heard just now what
she said what you played in the
beginning of the program
she is fueling the passions of the
locals in the valley
[Laughter]
[Music]
take a moment to recall what you heard
from Randeep Surjewala pose these
attacks
he said homegrown terror that is you
know the kind of politics that you have
seen post the full mob attack and
Mehbooba Mufti is also playing to a
political Galleria
but to him you were doing business with
her she's a former chief minister of the
state of Jammu and Kashmir today should
she not be arrested for that comment
do it well absolutely you know the FT
have been following her behavior from
14th February and it's so vicious that
rights first of all in the first couple
of days she tried her best to deflect
attention to Pakistan by focusing on
attacks against Kashmiri students they
will the only Kashmir you get a chance
to speak all it has to be a monologue
actually I thought number two the fact
is my an alliance with her let me let me
address that very important point let me
address that very important point yes we
have been accused of having an alliance
with her we had that alliance because of
the unusually fractured mandate which
which Kashmir had produces crush me
there was no guarantee that a similar
bandit could not have come had elections
mean image immediately taken place but
we had to pull out when we realized that
for all the outward show of her being
with India these people could not grow
out of her Jeeva Jeeva Pakistan
mentality that is the time when you 0
when she pushed both for
you have so much force when you ask that
question I wish at least today why
should she not be behind the back one
second magic
Deepti I hope I hope I am given a decent
listening see I am neither PDP spokesman
nor their supporter but today she has
really Grammer eyes the true face of
nari Shakti why I say so is because when
the someone who has formed by the
Constitution of India who's raised by
Constitution of India is speaking such a
language because of the being done by
the BJP today for India for the
Constitution for the state will you do
that yes in fact see she may be having
politics but why this mission
just listen to me
module vkv or adequate time now you
listen to us you will go by your rule
only that one at a time okay now coming
to this point that whether she
represents the complete Jane K or not I
hope you are very clear on it that what
kind of word she got it was not even not
even 150th of the total population so
how does she become the voice for the
complete Jane K that is my one my number
two point is as I brought out
joining us you have to let the other
people you you got space
Colonel Sabra miss Markham is also
joining and I think you can together
rebar mm is also a usual suspect arm
dummies Megumi for hollow would you want
to divide the country the violence
violence I agree with you I am NOT white
on the other hand see you know it was it
was an alliance it was a compulsive
alliance it was an alliance which was
there only because hat we you know if we
had an election soon after there was no
guarantee that the results would have
been any better with 28 seats for the
PDP and 25 port for the BJP my friends
would you have yes

of Robert Vadra who's been asked to join
the investigation remember there was a
court hearing that was underway and the
court has decided that interim
protection given to Vadra has been
extended but he will have to join the
investigation tomorrow as per the
directions from the court till then the
invest the Enforcement Directorate will
not take any action against what Robert
nonetheless it's a big setback to Vadra
he will now have to join the
investigation and this is an update to
the Congress party as well which is
watching the developments very closely
because Congress party is planning to
give Robert Vadra a ticket posters have
already emerged in muradabad from where
he's expected to contest but the case
continues he will have to join the
investigation now let me take us through
what happened in court he was hoping
that he won't have to cure more than
interesting agency till the time the
documents are not supplied for him for
the special Patiala House Court has made
it clear that there will be absolutely
no stay on the investigation and
irrespective of whether or not Robert
Vadra gets the documents you will have
to cooperate with investigation and you
will have to appear before the
Enforcement Directorate to answer all of
their questions regarding this entire
money-laundering so there's happening
after we saw how Givens happening in the
hole between Dez as well as Katie is
something I was representing Robert wada
and what can you so she was essentially
staying with edibles against natural
justice to interrogate Robert Vadra even
on the occupant that he doesn't have in
his possession but at the same time the
IDI made and I'm clear that these are
the documents that have been seized from
Robert waters possession so he knows the
contents of these documents and they can
be absolutely knows the only
investigation itself because the
parallel investigation is also going on
again Manoj Arora who said to be one of
the very close is of Robert Raja system
a steadfast enemy you will have to
cooperate he will have to answer the
question of the Enforcement Directorate
the investigation will continue and any
sort of release of Robert Vadra was
hoping for has been absolutely
diminished by the patella okay thank you
for joining us with those inputs in fact
just one more question alanine oh now if
he joins the investigation tomorrow what
was the
nice party hoping what was the Congress
party hoping in this case because they
were also setting the stage for Robert
Vadra and to give him a ticket from
muradabad from what we picked up
well absolutely inside this seems to be
largest an attempt this party to bring
Robert Vadra into the political sphere
but also an attempt to shield him from
all of these allegations regarding money
laundering
now all the robot workers come on record
instead that till the time all of these
baseless allegations as we call them are
not diminished he's not going to go
ahead and contest election but despite
that I you correctly pointed out we are
seeing posters in muradabad regarding
Robert Watrous entry into the entire
conscious fear the political sphere
arada so we will have to wait and watch
exactly what the strategy of the
Congress is going to be because it
wasn't just Robert Butler who was hoping
for some sort of relief from the court
today that he will not have to be a part
of this entire investigation that's
going on but as until then the court has
made it clear that there will be
absolutely no relief granted to Robert
Vadra specially at this stage it's only
a setback there was also a setback to
the Congress party that has put its
entire weight behind Robert Vadra
and defending him so we have to read
into exactly what the strategy from
chiron plans ought to be whether or not
they plan to delay Roberts on US entry
into the entire political sphere after
till until after this entire case is
dismissed socks because that's what
you're hoping for but like the IDI also
correctly pointed out in the posted it
seems to be nothing except for delaying
tactics on part of Robert Azza to ensure
that he does not have to appear before
the investigating agency and that he
does not have to answer any questions
that are posed by the key right now let
me thank you for joining us with those

each team plays matches against every
other team and I feel if India does not
play a match in the World Cup it would
not be an issue he goes on to add that I
feel it will be really difficult for ICC
to go on with a world cup without India
you also have to see if India has the
power to stop ICC from doing such a
thing but personally I feel a strong
message should be sent sort of Gangrel
saying a strong message must be sent by
India strong message must be sent by the
BCCI and it will not be a message it
will not be a problem at all if India
boycotts Pakistan at the World Cup
itself so our Ganguly goes on to add
whatever reactions come from the people
of India was right there is no chance of
a bilateral series with Pakistan after

by a focused on e bomba Iran for the
first time perhaps in history has named
a Pakistani bomba has said that a
Pakistani bomba is responsible for the

news by reports suggesting that the man
who carried out a suicide bombing which
killed 27 members of Iran's elite
Revolutionary Guards near the border
with Pakistan last week was a Pakistani
a senior Revolutionary Guard commander
has confirmed to the media according to
the Tasneem news agency based in Iran
another member of the terrorist cell
that planned the attack was also a
Pakistani citizen the head of the guards
ground forces brigade general Mohammad
pappu has told news wires in Iran he ran
of course in the last few days has
repeatedly blamed Pakistan for
sheltering militants connected with
attacks in the border area although
Tuesday's remarks appear to be the first
time that Tehran has said that Pakistani
citizens were directly involved in the
attack Iran has also accused a regional
rival Saudi Arabia of promoting violence
among members of the Sunni Muslim
minority mean right Pakistan and Saudi
Arabia have denied any role in the
attacks in Iran but Iran perhaps for the

across to a Abhishek Kapoor our
executive editor joining us on the phone
line Abhishek this is a big big comment
coming in from the Iran military of

Pakistani origin bomber but now one
senior in the government their Brigadier
General Mohammad passport has actually
spoken to an agency in in Tehran and
said that the bomb but has actually been
identified as a Pakistani in fact he had
another comply so Pakistani origin

naming Pakistan and a bomb and actually

for tat in the wake of the pull Varma
attack in fact he's also going on to say
that this is the time to act and not
talk he's also demanded a mix of
military diplomatic and economic
measures against Pakistan now remember
this comes on a day when Captain
America's saying was inside the floor of
the house as a Cali girl
Emily's cornered enough Joe Singh Sidhu
his cabinet minister for his
pro-pakistan but captain number in this
position has been absolutely clear the
first top congress leader chief minister
of Punjab who's taken an unequal vocal
position against Pakistan in fact
captain Amarinder Singh had also passed
a resolution in the Punjab Assembly
where he had said and he mentioned that
on the floor of the house that he would
teach Pakistan army chief bajwa a lesson
group is joining me on the phone line
could read an extremely strong statement
they're coming in from captain Amarinder
Singh on a day when we witnessed that
dramatic confrontation inside the floor
of the house captain Amarinder Singh
today says that they kill 41 we should
kill 82 an unequivocal message they're
coming in from the chief minister of
Punjab oh well that is the recent
development there captain I mean the
thing that he placed upon Java he has
given it a strong statement against
possibly he was he had taken a stand
against one of those things they do even
when he wanted to visit to Pakistan he
was the first one who of those things
should not to go to Pakistan as he
wanted what his son should learn lesson
from such things that way they are they
are acting like they are attacking India
Indian forces again and again and today
he has made it very clear from the
statement that he still he stands by the
Indian forces and he is also X army
officers and he has he has said contrary
to those things they do
the reign of those things involve
backing for Pakistan he was saying there
was a sign to her there is a time to go
for dialogue but the captain Malinda
saying he has made it very clear there
is no delay and it's the time to teach
them a lesson he said in his statement
also that law
the first minister and Prime Minister
will take the final call but if the fact
are gently on such issues the way we are
losing our Diwan every second day it is
not acceptable across the people across
the country and the anger among the
people of the countries are very clear
and no the government should act but I
hust and he has made it very clear his
band is if they are going to they are
going to kill 41 we are going to kill
482 this is what he feels that he wanted
to teach the Pakistan government a
lesson from such thing and the situation
and the statement is very clear what
action at this point of time well as the
his name tablet blistered
he was trying to fuel statement and one
point of time he was paying dialogue and
today the protest and confrontation
between Germany at al-azhar they wanted
to bring a resolution in the hands of a
session saying that the Pakistan
government to the Pakistan government
should be should be declared as the
country as they are giving they were
providing hostels they are providing
hydros to that organization so this
confrontation was very clear and now
another thing has a given very clear
that statement that he stand by the
Indian forces and he wanted that the Sun
should be lying should be given to the
Pakistan government so an extremely
strong statement they're coming in from
punjab Chief Minister captain Amarinder
Singh who since day one has been saying
that Pulwama should be avenged today in
this statement captain Amarinder Singh
says that Pakistan killed 41 we should
kill 82 in fact it's time for a mix of
military diplomatic and economic
measures against Pakistan but the same
chief minister of Punjab is facing
questions from the Shiromani Akali Dal

think they got it wrong and absolutely

how long they will find out well how
long my question is also how long they
go how long will we wait before we see
the snow we the government
I would not allow it Jacque I tell you
today
Jacque I tell you I want to say
something today I got up is on the
program I want to say I want to say one
thing do not do this to me I do not do
this when I do this when the bodies of
my Indian is standing on and that is
symmetric warfare and you die menschen
has been added try and understand don't
talk politics
try and understand iiiiii one minute
just one minute just one people not let
anybody talk today about any political
issue hi hey what should we do as a
nation what should we do today
so that Pakistan is not a lesson from I
I can I can I say something before next
generation can I say something before I
pass on to God of what he wants to
respond that today I don't want to have
any any petty politics or opportunistic
politics I don't want any chameleon-like
behavior I don't want any disguise
because if you are a patriot you don't
need a disguise and if you are not a
patriot
you can wear the best disguise but it
will show today the Prime Minister
yesterday we've seen the deadliest
attack on our forces in the valley in
recent history today the last journey of
our slain soldiers has begun
the Prime Minister is assured their
sacrifice will not go in vain
I will only say one thing that today I
believe my prime minister
I believe my Prime Minister the prime
minister of my country forget which
party is fronting the prime minister of
my country you know right one minute any
shot I will not have the usual talk you
I say once again we shall just wait your
turn wait your turn this shun I said
wait your turn
I don't audio disturbing this was you
don't I don't want the audio disturbance
I'm making a point I'm requesting the
producers I'm making upon you shan't
speak after I finished please I am
saying I'm saying I am saying today
after some time the shunt I'm saying
today that the Prime Minister of my
country at a time when my forces have
been attacked has a short me that we
will take revenge
I believe my Prime Minister that's it
say what you want you can say what you
want
I believe my army and that is not I
believe my Prime Minister I believe the
commanding commander-in-chief it's
politics it's not politics what I
believe you know there are veterans
sitting in the studio it's a very solemn
occasion it's a very emotional occasion
the supreme sacrifice that Indian or a
soldier can name is the sacrifice that
is brave a segment
[Applause]
[Applause]
we only say this needs to be done we
need to kill Pakistan a lesson Narendra
Modi ji has spoken this country a nation
state visit the injured we pray for them
we pray for the recovery I'm sure
I wish - I wish to do this it's
political and I wish I could is not a
leader of a party and the army chief and
the Prime Minister are leaders of the
nation and of the forces and they shot
has to be stopped and I want to cut the
audio if he doesn't stop please I'm
making a request to my producers a
sincere request because today right now
I won't forget the pictures I saw
outside Parliament I'm back I don't know
how you felt I don't know what emotions
went through you but so short when I saw
those pictures out there
as I saw each one of those bodies and
each one of those coffins being brought
out of that Globemaster plane so shall
one by one write each of the soldiers a
fellow pall bearer for another soldier
when I saw the home minister of my
country with the CRPF cap on him he was
a pallbearer out there you know for that
moment it doesn't matter what political
party you're from I want to today's
Sushant just say I don't care I will
back my government and my army I will go
to any extent the Prime Minister has
said the terrorists have made their
biggest mistake I would support him the
Prime Minister has said we will make the
enemy pay it so shan't I will support it
and the Prime Minister has said that our
country will win this why we will
support him that is not political and so
shot I want you to also speak up on the
sentence and now I cannot I cannot agree
more with you see number one I don't
have anything against you no bringing in
politics on the issue of terrorism so
that the government is held accountable
and the opposition behaves
responsibility which means that you
criticize the issue but do it
responsibly not the way I don't know
where you find the kind of people who
bring to your panel who keep shouting
and yelling and screaming and shouting
and don't even realize the solemn Ness
of a particular occasion and they'll
just keep ranting but that's your
problem my problem is that I I think the
kind of scenes we saw today they of
course they filled me with cold rage but
they also gave me some hope because the
way the entire country United including
the leader of the principal opposition
party
I think that was creditable that is that
is the kind of grace which needs to be
shown at a time when the gauntlet has
been thrown before the country there is
a time for politics and there is a way
of politics but this was neither the
occasion not the time to do it
and I think it was a very sensible thing
which the principled opposition leader
did having said that I think what the
resolve the Prime Minister expressed
and given the record of him living up to
the commitments he makes I think the
Pakistanis should be extremely worried
and extremely scared number one number
two I don't think any of us should push
either the forces or the government into
taking any ill considered action it
should be called Rage it should be
calculated and cold-hearted to punish
the enemy thirdly let us not talk about
teaching a lesson to Pakistan I think
the time is long past this is not about
teaching them a lesson because teaching
them a lesson connotes an action
reaction kind of a thing I think we need
to get out of this action reaction thing
and what we need to do is a concerted
national policy which is neither going
to change with governments nor with
seasons a national policy which will
last for decades if not centuries but we
will fix this Nasu or this cancer on our
borders we will fix them and we will fix
them in a way that they can never raise
their heads again if that is the result
and this occasion this tragic occasion
needs to be utilized to build up that
consensus if the Prime Minister and the
opposition parties can get together and
build that consensus so that regardless
of who comes into government and who
sits in opposition the competition is
how you operationalize and how you make
effective that national policy not this
pettiness and this third-rate kind of
politics of taking General jibes at each
other taking digs at each other it
neither helps your political political
cause nor does it help the national
cause but you know there are some people
who are too small and they cannot rise
above this this kind of pettiness so I
don't expect anything more than them my
only advice to you would be don't give
them the platform you give them it is
better to shun these people rather than
bring them all these kind of solemn
occasions because I think this shame all
of us for in front of the whole curry
let me tell you for whom we want this
revenge you know I I was seeing one of
the quotes that CRP is CRPF
for news and if I can read it out often
it is pasted in many controlled meant
areas and units it says if I die in
combat zone box me up and send me home
pin my medals to my chest tell my mom I
did my best
this is the sentiment that each one of
our soldiers lives by and that is why we
want revenge people so why do you want
revenge
another thought which in many
containments units elsewhere is written
do not lament the death of a warrior
killed in the battlefield as those who
sacrifice their life in the war are
honoured in heaven that is how our
jo-ann's live each day and they fight
for the nation it is for them that we
are seeking the revenge and let me read
for you today
the ten commandments of the CRPF one
place country above self to uphold the
Constitution and the rule of law we obey
your lawful commands for be disciplined
courageous and alert five be mutually
supportive compassionate and considerate
six respect human life rights nobody
respects their own human rights but the
CRPF says we do 7 perform duties
promptly impartial ii and courageously 8
acquire an upgrade professional skills 9
rise above caste creed and religion 10
have pride in the force and respect the
model service and loyalty these are the
ten commandments ladies and gentlemen of
the CRPF I can't trust that with the
ugly behavior of people like Michonne on
a program as somber as this tonight
now now am i Marshall Bob burn up for my
wife chief of where stuff and I am
Telling You that when I am Telling You
that the entire country a marshal bought
for our army and we shall Barbara I am
speaking to you now no Nisha not tonight
not tonight not tonight a marshal what I
said I said please I'm making a genuine
request I'm speaking to Air Marshal PK
Barbara can you be not on the screen at
the same time please
thank you okay now first a marshal more
versed in the power we look at it we
have it appears to me in the past sir go
ahead go ahead sir quiet so yeah in the
past two decades or so the nation has
made some mistakes or taken not taking
decisions that we need to have taken we
have gone through Mumbai we have gone to
proton code we have gone to Horry we
have gone through many of these things
and the services are ready to give their
life like this forty people have given
me but unfortunately we did not get the
opportunity to do more service to the
nation when it came to us more so
specially after Mumbai which was an
aggression and different services are
supposed to retaliate and destroy the
aggression we did however I am very
proud to say today that some statements
have been made which will give the
opportunity of this very fine different
service to pay back to another neighbor
who has been on a killing spree we have
taken up this issue internationally we
have succeeded some places but
unfortunately you've seen China's
reaction today it is sad but what the
hell if we don't get international
support we are strong enough to deal
with Pakistan and for goodness sake like
you are mentioning let us not politicize
this we are all Indians and as Indians
we must stand together with the nation
and request the nation to support us
also to do the job that we have been
paid for please have some sympathy yes
on the fallen soldiers and their
families for goodness sake yes sir so
III
dream with you completely sir you've
spoken my mind but but if I can ask a
general yes yes right and gone right I
need to ride in from Hyderabad go on
writing but not please are not my idol
condolence to the entire family I bow my
head in respect to the entire soldiers
we have lost today 40 young soldiers of
the country they are the children of the
some parents they are sisters brothers a
very very sad situation that we are
going through and I'm not blaming the
BJP nor the Congress but I do question
the BJP and the Congress today how long
is this going to happen and how long are
we going to wait patiently and when are
we going to come out of this yeah we are
not yet full tie the issue but there are
major flaws in the government in the
procedures in the process the way things
are handled with the army today it is
done I don't know how far and I don't
trust any of the government's anymore I
don't trust any of the government's
anymore because this is going to be
another page torn over for a story book
this has to be done God and they have
got a very strict measure at the point
the point is making first of all first
of all right first of all right honey
right and if I make in the pot right if
I may if I may know if I may say one
thing to you right and if I may say one
thing to you god no I don't know I am
right right and right and right now I
want to come in first right in the
Suhani first of all don't man la didn't
hear me right in here me right in here
me you've raised the point first of all
first of all I appreciate the tenor with
which you've spoke at one minute one
minute one minute
you have shown some element of
bipartisanship which is good actually we
should be partisan and prejudiced
completely and that is prejudiced and
partisan towards our nation is the
nation which
losers however you raise a point colgado
the question is how long and why not the
question has been every military expert
of the program Judy Bakshi and general
bhishambar Dayal as well as the very
respected Air Marshal Barbara all are
saying one thing that we have the
capacity to hit them harder you see I do
not believe in their nuclear blackmail
Arava but yeah I do not want us to be on
your leader do you believe I just want
him to say is there a trepidation
somewhere is there something that holds
you back I'll tell you what is it that
holds you by no let me answer please
what mr. Royden say I take it as a
sentiment of a citizen
it's not about party politics - stir of
the country would be as valid as any
other citizen the Home Minister also and
it is my firm belief on up that the
Indian Army which has been given a free
hand will not take a second longer than
what is necessary to end open without
exact Oh Rigby which is simply why not
so far no why not so far let us not
forget that completely isolated in the
international community and the
political fight Marmite is far more than
Pakistan secondly we have to raise this
in the United Nations asking for
economically goes with a begging bowl to
China so you have to
also cut and I'll last but not the least
militarily we have the bravest army and
we are sure that the army I like that
like the generals to come in also be
which one of us for God's sake what sake
was i wide like general Bakshi to speak
please
you tell Bakshi my question to you is
just a minute sir yes I'm saying that it
appears to me the groundwork has already
started may I please sir may I please
sir may I please sir the groundwork has
already started first of all my brothers
and sisters across the country may I
just share a little bit of my analysis
to my to my dearest viewers I do not
want to viewers to believe that is
nothing happening that is wrong we'd be
doing a disservice to our forces and to
our government we was don't believe
anyone who tells you that one the Prime
Minister has given a clearly worded
warning to Pakistan in which he said the
forces have been given a free hand the
last time the prime minister said the
forces have been given a free hand or
also we saw the surgical strikes happen
may I may I please complete my point sir
I I'm I'm saying something to my dearest
you know brothers and sisters watching
this programme millions are watching I
want to talk to them first but the Prime
Minister last time said I've given a
free hand then the surgical strikes
happened secondly we've crushed the
economic cord we've drawn the MFN status
to Pakistan at a time when they are
going with a begging bowl to the IMF
this is not just a symbolic thing
thirdly I'm just updating GD Bakshi
meetings with many foreign diplomats
have begun which gives you a sense of
something major Germany Hungary Italy
European Union Canada Britain Russia
Israel Australia South Korea Sweden
France Spain Bhutan Slovakia all have
had individual meetings with the
Ministry of External Affairs
that means we must acknowledge the
government is not waiting and pondering
actually the government is in a super
fast mode right now
Gd Bakshi it's not which means before
you have a response you must lay out you
know all your other options and you must
do your diplomatic action please and by
the way the Indian High Commissioner to
Pakistan Ajaib Azaria was called back
this afternoon
this is a laying in my limited
journalistic experience it's laying the
groundwork of all things to come viewers
that's why I don't want any deception at
this time gelbach sure you know better
you know our table at the outset let me
state Prime Minister has given his mind
as clearly as he could is he said that
place
timings methodology I leave to rearm for
absolutely I support another and let me
also assure you we have very competed
generals achievements who are at the
help very experienced people it is let
us leave it to them we trust them yeah
right and now I would like to take this
discussion a little at a mod serious
strategic play last UK 30 years last 30
years we have been facing an unchecked
asymmetric war page by Pakistan bar of a
thousand cuts that's the point since
Pakistan is believed they have got us
where they wanted because they have the
Duke I want to tell people today this is
tell them settle is a vast debate there
was no tell himself it is time to call
the nuclear Bluff of Pakistan look back
to the Kargil war it lasted for three
months Arnab how many nuclear bombs did
we see falling on Delhi let me tell the
people very clearly so the core
commanders the army commander of
Pakistan you know they live in palatial
bug laws they have Impala at Mercedes
car such people do not press the they do
not press the nuclear button at our
table today I would like to reveal
something that would shock your viewers
do you know that general bajwa chief of
the Pakistan is due for
Hartman in the month of November you
mean the man who Sidhu was was hugging
right this bad has been angling for an
extension you know and he brought car
was likely kg because he's the man bajwa
put him in power he wants him retired
part of our has created by this I laid
this make this open charge
haha part of our is trying to
orchestrate a situation wherein he will
get an extension
Boris sake of an extension that Pakistan
army chief oops into Harvard general
sort of only general general the
helpless children I have three four
quick issues firstly there's no doubt
there has to be an irreversible policy
long term strategy on Pakistan
irreversible his respective change of
government but today is the time
Pakistan is a nation which does not
understand until unless you do what
Pakistan does to you if visible action
at this juncture needs to be needs to be
there from the Government of India and
to start with please
beardy chief prime minister of Pakistan
is not the Prime Minister of India today
must issue a warning or must issue a
letter to the Prime Minister of Pakistan
that irreversible in three weeks
either dismantle just a moment please
deported chief or India will take
following actions we are strategically
we must think through we must have a
long-term plan but let's take an action
at present over and that we can use I
also tell you V the people will not let
the politician revert this time India
will take action people will make you
take action people are in the other
people have will be nation no politician
no individual matters I just have to
come before this nation by Vivint
article before the seat box that is what
I'm telling you be happy
you must understand what is on your car
son he has brought us to knees when you
get down a man wants to talk to the I
want to get bored people will be
inducted thank you I want to I want 20
suspects were there in Afghanistan in
last one years twenty such genious
traits were there and we bought them and
I knew this is coming I knew this is
coming to India you brought it here you
keep clapping you keep doing it and I
tell you what no poverty thank you sir
thank sign of strategists also one mid
once a Marshall Barbara one last point I
don't think Prime Minister Narendra Modi
believes in mere condensations
Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not
believe in me Rapala geez every time
Narendra Modi has warned Pakistan it has
been followed with Pakistan getting a
damn what I am saying here is I also
want to say thing you put pressure on
someone who needs the pressure one
minute one minute to put pressure on
Prime Minister Narendra Modi let me
assure you of that
the country knows that each time he has
warned is given and the army have given
a bloody nose to the
[Applause]
yeah let me assure the Prime Minister
and the nation the Prime Minister must
have been already briefed by the three
Chiefs but for the sake of the nation
let me tell you the Army Air Force and
the Navy have their plans we can
actually go into action at least as far
as the Air Force is concerned in far
less than 24 hours and we know what to
do similarly Army and the Navy not to do
for the nation sectors remember you are
safe we are there for you and if
Pakistan wants to raise a nuclear bogey
again do they have a triad they don't
they don't know what to do if something
happens even by a rogue element in
Pakistan who launches something what
will happen to the country I have to
unfortunately take it easy good man the
dust I have to unfortunately take a
short break now but but nation please be
with each word of yours I feel that
sense of assurance and I am just saying
one thing right now and and my my senior
soo shan't agreed with me that this is a
time to look beyond every political
divide and not think of anyone's loss or
advantage it will be the nation's loss
if we are not together not United and I
know what GD Bakshi said is correct this
has made us even more United I'll take a
short break you are much more on the
other side",True,en,143710,1111,3590

hearts has been brought to the national
capital
Nalini joining us with the latest
details as the army chief also reaches
the paalam technical airport 40 brave
hearts were on route to take charge in
Pulwama they were part of a convoy that
was carrying over 2,500 CRPF personnel

Muhammad terrorists the mortal remains

understand is that Rahul Gandhi is also
going to be present add the polymer iPod
to pay his tributes though these CRPF
Jevons who are going to be reaching the
national capital any minute now the
officials within the Home Ministry have
told us that arrangements have been made
to ensure that all of these mortal
remains go back home across the country
back to their families but at the same
time what we're also given to understand
is that there are a few of these
soldiers who still remain unidentified
because of how Grievous the attack was
so there will be there will be officials
looking into it from within the CRPF

contingent that has gathered here there
is still so much grief in the air right
now even right here as the nation awaits
for their brave hearts to return back
home after having served the country
after having laid down their lives it's
extremely saddening moment
for at least this moment while we wait
to receive our free hearts all the anger
of course the anger can't be forgotten
but I have the same time it needs to be
set aside because it's the time to bring
back these soldiers back home for the
one last time
after all that they've done for the
country all right Nalini
Shivani the side will continue to stay
with these visuals we are also being
told that the army chief and Defense

given to understand is that the Defense
Minister is also going to be there not
only to accompany the Prime Minister but
also to pay her tributes and to pay the
last respects to these 40 fallen
soldiers after they leave from those
gates of the Panem Airport we're given
to understand that all of these bodies
will be taken back home just for a quick
recap again we are given to understand
that almost nine of these will be
heading towards prior garage of course
accompanied by the CRP of professionals
six of them will be heading towards
Pathan code and the areas around Pathan
code and twenty five of them will travel
from by road from the national capital
around the areas around Delhi so keeping
that in mind we are given to understand
that the plane has also landed inside

from now we can expect for those mortal
remains to be deboarded we can expect
for the Prime Minister the Home Minister
Rajnath Singh the Defence Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman along with the army
chief to all be present right here and

gates you can see the massive amount of
security that has already been put in
place and of course there are also

deported from the plane into the trucks
that will finally take them back home
for the one last time on their last yes
Melanie stay with us we have live on
those visuals as preparations are being
made and Colonel an Alberta I want to
come to you even as we beam these
visuals what is most important is that
you know the sacrifice the bravery the
owner and the memory of these Jevons has
to be protected and the best way to do
that is to ensure that India does not
bleed anymore Colonel but can you hear
me can you hear me can you hear me okay
brigadier general okay so please go
ahead if you could hear my German yes we
can go ahead we you know to make sure
that to make sure that we don't bleed
more that we don't bleed every day and
the innocents don't die in this decades
of terrorism perpetrated by Pakistan we
have to make sure that again I add the
cost of being repetitive I will keep
repeating that the separatists and their
network has to be disabled they have to
be removed they have been separated from
this valley the separatists have to be
separated because even if you remove
their security till they are there they
keep they will keep doing what they are
doing so far they are not going to stop
they've got enough office you know we've
talked about your point and eyeball
cross to PK Barbara former Airways chief
once again
could not finish his earlier thought so
we stay with these pictures as we pay
our respects collectively your thoughts
once again first of Mumbai our Chiefs
are called
only after 24 hours and then
unfortunately we were asked us what can
we do in case of a case of Mumbai type
of attack we had plans ready we even
discussed it with the government and we
are ready to pass a very strong message
obtained in incident or aggression like
this which would pass the message which
will be appreciated by the international
society and we will try and ensure no
collateral damage we already am sure the
plan still exists today
but again we being called soft because
of this reason we are not taking the
action that we need to take don't forget
military diplomacy is the one which can
be used at any time by any nation to
send a message are we doing it yes our
forces are ready but is the civilian
government they don't use the military
diplomacy that we have been trained hmmm
respond to the serve what would your
response then be to those who would say
that you know Pakistan wants this India
cannot afford this there's a greater
price for India if there is any
escalation and therefore it is India
that bears the burden of restraint no
restraint why restraint why have you got
such a massive defence force you have to
use it when there is aggression every
way aggression was there after Mumbai
after yury after Pathan coat and now
where is the political will to pass the
message we prepare the three services
and the paramilitary prepare for war if
required use mnf well most favored
nation what the hell three billion
dollars is that all that going to impact
is it good to pass a message let us
through in them
ruin Pakistan economically right and you
will find that they'll come to the knees
should I take your point and we have to
use forceful
yes you know all of these points
well-taken and of course that
deliberation will continue even as we
await for the government's ongoing
response they're doing their best
as far as diplomatic efforts right now
is concerned but let's not forget
brigade ii Akira
just the sheer you know scale of this
attack and therefore the sacrifice of
our brave hearts that is the most
important thing to remember right now
you know the pain then their families
must be going through right now the pain
of the entire country in fact is feeling
and we've brought these visuals of not
just anger but pain and solidarity and
an eruption of emotion that has come
from across the country
you know you've served yourself so as a
you know a soldier yourself your
thoughts on the sacrifice absolutely
swanny this is extremely sad and I
really want to put this across point
across to the people across the LC
dammit we are gonna get behind you we
gotta get real through you and we're
gonna ensure that you bleed you know
this is happening for too long and we
really can't sit on a haunches this side
I don't think we are weak we are gonna
strike you real deep and she won t able
to tell you the Prime Minister made it
very clear today he made it very clear
he is given the army to select its
target D location and the timing I think
that's a very strong message from the
Prime Minister of India to the Chief of
Army Staff and I would say to the
services and I think this time we are
going to go a little more than the
surgical strike you know as a lay person
we often talk about attributes Brigadier
Kira to the soldier but it is impossible
as a layperson to understand on a
day-to-day basis also the sacrifice that
a Japan has to go through working in
extremely tough conditions in hostile
conditions in you know our weather
conditions which are you know are so
difficult
and not a day goes by when they shook
their duty isn't it you know it is
because of them that we can sit see if
we can sleep safe and that is the
message that the entire country kind of
soaks in tonight
there it is because of them that we are
here today absolutely Giovani I think
after seeing the visuals on your monitor
I think the complete nation is in grief
there's so much emotions among them and
I can tell you if some of you who are
not in the services you must see the
life a soldier lives in the valley it's
extremely difficult look at the people
who are serving and glaciar I mean it's
it's it's extremely and they served
there with very limited leave the forg
or they leave because of operational
reasons and I think this is very
unfortunate very unfortunate and I you
know I grieve with all the families and
I hope we give a very strong message to

welcome back even as the country comes
to grips with the latest attack on
Indian forces the biggest ever in recent
memory it is important also to mention
the fact that China has not issued even
a word of condemnation condemnation no
statement yet from China or the Chinese
government and remember this is
important to note because China has been
a major roadblock as far as the clamp
down at the UN level on Masood other is
concerned
you
so even as we approach the 24-hour mark
of that dastardly attack on the forces
in pol Varma in which nearly forty
Germans have lost their lives now a
single statement has come in from China
while various other world powers and
countries
India's friends and others have actually
issued a statement in the aftermath and
have also condemned and offered full
support to India in the aftermath of
that attack but no word coming in from
China how is India to take this let's go
across to my colleague shavon Sen as
well who continues to bring us more
Travon not surprising but big question
mark right now in India China
relationship because China has been
blocking the clamp down by UN on Masood
Azhar jaja mamma chief well it certainly
doesn't come across as a surprise
because as many point out that talk
about Joshua Mohammed you're talking
about China and the way China
essentially has protected
Josh of Mohammed the fact here is that
with the United States of America we'll
just amping up the pressure on Pakistan
with regards to Jesse Mohammed there's
very little that has come in from China
at this point in time and also China's
yeah at least silence you know the
conspicuous silence is something which
is a huge cause of concern at least for
India at this point in time and what
becomes very clear is the the handiwork
of the Pakistan ISI when it comes to the
pull wama attack there is enough chatter
that has been picked up by the Indian
intelligence agencies with regards to
how aya has essentially planned this
entire attack and even sources within
the governor's office clearly pointed
out that look at the amount of
explosives that were basically brought
in",True,en,3646,33,53

and we're getting you all all the
updates coming in or on the slew of
meetings that are taking place in the
national capital and today the nation
stands in solidarity to say a prayer for
our martyrs and their families a quick
update for our viewers is that the
martyrs mortal remains will be brought
to the national capital in an Air Force
a c-17 transport aircraft the mortal
remains were brought to Delhi where our
forces will render the final salute and
then the mortal remains will be given to
the family members will be officially
handed over to the family members 37 of
our brave hearts we've lost yesterday in
that horrific terror attack and every
single one of their martyrdom will be
avenged that's the message coming in
from the government even as the cabinet
committee for security is currently
meeting at the Prime Minister's
residence the prime minister himself has
cancelled to all political programmes
today and tomorrow as well
all political programmes of the party
the BJP has been cancelled keeping in
mind what's happened at the dastardly
terror attack in Pulwama the ni a team
right now is enroute to the attack site
they will be reaching very very shortly
and kick off their investigations as
well home minister Rajnath Singh is also
going to be there in Kashmir soon after
the CCS meter ends it's currently taking
place remember at Prime Minister Modi's
residence after this meet ends Raj Nath
Singh will be making his way to Kashmir
and everyone is asking one question how
exactly is the government going to crack
the whip against Pakistan a Pakistan
that is not just denied any role in the
attack but is also resorted to provoking
at the border just hours after this
horrific attack
and we're also putting out on your
screens the first pictures offered the
Cabinet Committee for security meet
that's underway Union ministers coming
together there this is a meet that is
being chaired by Prime Minister Modi Raj
Nath Singh in attendance Sushma Swaraj
Nirmala Sitharaman Arun Jaitley besides
NSA Archer de Waal several
representatives of the Army and Air
Force are also present
Emma tree officials are also present for
this meeting but this is the first
picture that we're putting out on your
streets are off the meeting that's
currently underway being chaired by
Prime Minister Modi some big decisions
expected and they will possibly be a
communication after the meet ends on
exactly what kind of a decision has been
taken to teach Pakistan of fitting
lesson we've discussed this before about
how a surgical strike clearly hasn't
taught Pakistan a fitting lesson what is
the kind of step that needs to be taken
what is the further isolation that the
government will do to ensure that
Pakistan is taught this time that this
kind of an attack will not be allowed to
the Indian soil Abhishek Kapoor is
joining us with more details on this
Abhishek we're putting out those
pictures of the CCS meat and this is a
very very crucial meat that's under way
possibly any decision that's taken by
the government diplomatically also
speaking with regards to Pakistan will
be taken right now well except it's gone
much beyond the isolating Pakistan know
if you see the statements coming from
capitals from across the world in the
last it you know it's clear that
Pakistan stands isolated and if it goes
to the statement of China China is the
only one in fact which is not spoken but
if you go to his treatment of Russia of
UAE of America of Israel they are
specifically mentioning
Jessie Mohammed as a terrorist
organization based out of Pakistan and
asking Pakistan to restrain from
indulging in these activities but as I
said it's gone beyond isolating Pakistan
there are some measures that would be in
order and the CCS which is the top
decision-making body when it comes to
national security is now looking into it
some indication that the
casualty of this dastardly attack in
Palama yesterday could be the carpel
processor because the establishment in
Delhi has been skeptical say the least
about the intent of Pakistan and
pursuing Kartarpur
so that could be the first step but even
beyond that actually we are told that
some measures would be were would be
shorted out and you would see something
happening you know we really cannot
discuss those things in public domain
but obviously the government is looking
at the possibility of bringing the
attackers to justice
in whichever manner possible so that's
what the CCS is about typically yes you
know what happens in CCS is given
options by the security establishment
led by the National Security Advisory
Board and the National Security Council
and then decisions deliberation it is
it's not it's not necessary that CCS
should go for long because some very
prep direction during the discussions
take place and then of course the the
security establishment takes over so
present in the Cabinet Committee on
security which is going on at 7 l km our
ministers of home finance External
Affairs and defence the composition of
the Cabinet Committee on security apart
from the Prime Minister and of course
present also to be the CCS is the top
security establishment led by the
National Security Advisor ATO that's the
process going on a cheetah and as I said
in the immediate aftermath a coracle
process could be the casualty but more
measures would be designed or decided
upon so that the factors of Palama
terror attack are brought to justice
and you made a very very pertinent point
about China as well Abhishek that is of
the goal so there will be closely
tracking about whether a decision is
taken on China China which is time and
again
stopped and insured no action has taken
globally against Moscow the other
against the JM and China is the only
country so far that hasn't even issued a
message a statement about this terror
attack so it's very clear which side of
the fence they're on and so we'll have
to see if in the CCS meet a decision is
taken about how really we're going to
take this forward with China as well
we'll be tracking this very very closely
for the moment abhishek thanks very much
for joining us we're putting all those
pictures off the ccs feet that's the
Cabinet Committee for security meet
that's currently underway at Prime
Minister Modi's residents slipping into

we're getting more brick news coming in
now a day after Prime Minister Modi
warned fugitives in his speech Oracle
Vijay Mallya has taken to Twitter once
again repeated his settlement offer he
has said and I quote I have made the
offer to settle before the Honorable
Bombay honorable High Court of Karnataka
this cannot be dismissed as frivolous it
is perfectly tangible sincere honest and
readily achievable offer the shoe is on
the other foot now why don't the banks
take the money lent to KF a rattle
Mallya has repeated his settlement offer
this after Prime Minister Modi's
crackdown on economic of in discerning
us on the phone line is my colleague our
cheetah our cheetah Mallya clearly
rattled he has put out about two hours
ago vegimalese responded to the prime
minister yesterday when the prime
minister spoken in Parliament he had
mentioned the fact that there are
fugitives who run away making an
assurance that he'll bring them back now
Vijay Mallya in a response saying that I
respectfully ask why the prime minister
is not instructing his banks to take the
money I have put on the table so he can
at least him credit for full recovery of
public funds led to Kingfisher not just
that another tweet that he's put out is
what also you read out in which he says
why don't the banks take the money lent
to kfe has gone on to say that his offer
cannot be dismissed as frivolous he's
going on to call it a perfectly tangible
sincere honest and readily achievable
offer now it's not just that something
that which Amalia has done time and
again he's attacked the media saying
that I'm opposed to say the least
the media's oppose of the enforcement
director claiming that I hid my belt if
there was hidden wealth how could I put
approximately fourteen thousand crores
worth of assets openly in front of code
so Vijay Mallya once again not just
repeating a settlement offer but trying
to put out a knowledge if there is some
sort of witch hunt against him and even
as we're tracking these developments
very very closely sure but it's clear
that it rattled Mallya has put out a
series of tweets where he said that the
Prime Minister should accept his offer
way he said that banks should take the
money lent to KF a he's also dismissed
the claim that he has any hidden wealth
Archana thanks so much for joining us
Mallya clearly rattled off
the crackdown by the Modi government on
economic offenders now this comes after
the UK government also has approved
Malia's extradition meanwhile the Agusta
middleman was also excited from Dubai to
India and India is building pressure on
Antigua government as far as near a
moody and mayor joke they are also

welcome back I have kept account and I
can confirm tonight that Rao Gandhi is
single-handedly peddled and God knows
what his desperation is I know that
Robert Vadra is being questioned
Robert Watrous mother is also being
questioned Raul must be feeling bad
about it but the desperation viewers
he has pedaled 14 fake news items on her
phone
every morning he gets up and pedals a
fake news story this was the fake news

Andhra file Modi is doing what I'll do
Narendra Modi ji anil ambani k middleman
and he talks to himself at night one day
becomes the Chokey thought one day
becomes which or schizophrenia is that
what's happening in the last few days
Rahul Gandhi has been losing the plot
mostly banking on leaks and selective
papers this is an email written by an
executive of airports where he's clearly
stating that mr. Anil Ambani met the
defense minister front then told them
ten days before that I'll deal with nine
that he was going to get it today the
Congress president's credibility hit
rock bottom as he flashed a 2015
internal corporate email to push his
flight of fantasy a mail on choppers
given or a file spin
let Rahul Gandhi first explain from
where did he get the internal email of
Airbus who is supplying him
he claimed that Airbus French government
anil ambani knew of the mou when the
fact is that the MOU in contention was
on civil and defence helicopter programs
he claimed that the 2015 male showed
that Ambani knew of the rofl deal when
the fact is that the Rafale deal MOU was

Rajiv Desai my first question will be to
you and not to Chitra not to Rajat not
to no poor Sharma not to say that a slum
and not to Vikas Gupta my first question
will be for Rajiv Desai - Rajiv Desai my
question to you is this there is a
person I can't hear anything
who wrote there is a person in India who
wrote one book a bad book and since then
only calls Maoist terrorist guardians
with guns that person said that Rafael
is an aircraft carrier recently now we
thought that was the height of ignorance
but today we have come to the conclusion
that for Rahul Gandhi the file is a
helicopter because I don't love know but
why are you laughing this is not correct
I will not speak if you laugh please
stop laughing okay it's not this is this
is not allowed can I please ask my fish
will every you see Rajiv decide Rahul
Gandhi thinks that profile is now a
helicopter when you're staging it are
not manufactured
mainly short no I don't want to be it's
a helicopter email and this morning this
banter with as long as you have besides
getting 1000 votes in an assembly
election helps all can t produce such
rubbish ridiculous on a daily basis my
question is my question is you know how
did round Andy allow my questions and
why the ground Andy show and Airbus
helicopter in a with his hand
people of India this morning once again
harmony laugh I'll laugh and sneer and
ridicul the fact is established that the
Government of India has paid too much
for the aircraft that the Government of
India has not insisted on adequate
safeguards that the Government of India
changed the deal mr. Desai has his hand
up in it was against no achievement to
show that now further it's also shown
been shown that he has lost what make it
to first base Chitra a problem in
Maharashtra so and you still think that
Rao Gandhi's got egg on his face
scrambled nearly live in some alternate
reality the fact of the matter single
fried egg that it's the Prime Minister
who stepped into this unbelievable
The Curious Case of Rahul Gandhi I want
the views of Chitra Subramanyam on what
I consider to be the Curious Case of
Rahul Gandhi what what do they use the
city said a heavenly shield all she ever
did was innuendo on bow force oh damn
will you stop it you got both us hanging
all over your face even now just who is
this clown who
okay okay yes because you have got a
problem she's given it back her name is
Chitra Subramanyam and she gives it back
now listen to me
Chitra today Rahul Gandhi waved
executive and he said in the context of
this email written by an Airbus it said
he said this is truth about the 36
Rafael aircraft
later it emerged that this email God
knows how he got it was not about Rafael
at all it was about an Airbus helicopter
he goofed up therefore once again my
concern is is Rahul Gandhi regularly
goofing up really show today that really
show today the real issue is I mean you
see hi I'll tell you one thing
no I just want to say one thing to drop
before I before I give it back to you
you see find out Chitra Chitra Chitra
let me see let me say one thing myself I
can't remember the new derivatives or
remember the Nira Radia tapes in the
Nira Radia shown many people including
one x journalists it's already was now
attempting to make a comeback by holding
on to the four tales of the Congress my
DA wants to be a burden which is not my
question is which my question is right
now Raja decide loss in the mirror
became evident it's already not be the
stairs in the Northeast can I not be
disturbed
come on push me in the mirror idea tapes
it became evidence fires in it became it
became can I just be really inspires
them Danny da da da tapes okay one I'll
take a sip of tea one man one man one
would let me let you see where
journalists are on the payrolls of
certain corporate deals journalists take
the handouts from the corporates and
they publish it as news is Rahul Gandhi
on the payout or hand out of some
corporates that he's getting some emails
some inside track from someone and being
told go like a parrot and say to the
world and Rahul Gandhi without any due
diligence goes and says whatever the
corporate gives him unless it is a
corporate backing him who on earth could
be feeding him this information on a
daily basis is the source of the that is
what the journalist sources I think that
is not important what is important is
only only because she really knows on
the subject I will say one thing before
I go to Chitra Nora will speak now he
was something very significant is
happening in this country I'm only
introducing Chitra so everybody can be
quiet for a minute today Rahul Gandhi at
a press conference and I do know that
questions are raised about round and
this depth of information on anything
but that's not the issue
he picked up an email on the Airbus
helicopter deal which by the way by the
way mr. Anil Ambani did not get if I am
not mistaken that deal went to Mahindra
right and he passed off that email as a
email or than a file deal question
number one how can a serious politician
do such plagiarism secondly is Airbus in
some kind of a competition with Rafael
in any corporate sense we'll have to
investigate that matter third how is it
that internal Airbus emails which are by
the way Chitra acceptable only and only
and only and only only and only two
Airbus and insiders of ebiz are
diligently being procured and given to
Raj Rahul Gandhi
now remember BJP saying Rahul Gandhi is
working as a defense doubt I want you to
look at this viewers just at the very
top of this please if you can please if
I can pinpoint this very part is there
anyone to zoom in okay I'll just tell
you viewers at the top of this email out
here somewhere out here there is a
reference to Eva's this is an Airbus
internal memo internal mail
believe me viewers nobody can get this
mail I am Telling You he was with all
sincerity and only an airbus insider
get this mail or somebody who has hacked
into the EVAs insiders email this is a
case of corporate espionage or corporate
planting I'm saying this with all
seriousness and Rahul Gandhi do now Oh
an serious answer to the country on
whose behalf are you working please
reveal it
it cannot be manipulated information
fabricated emails and emails such as
this are being passed on are you
somebody's parrot Rahul Gandhi if you
are somebody's parent you should say
Chitra Subramanyam what on earth do you
think is going on what is this selective
leak of information which is invariably
going wrong every time in this case
Chitra let's hear it - Chitra no please
so according to my understanding of it
of what's going on I believe this is the
last these are the last gasps of them
Haggard songket okay they don't know
which way is up
most recently Chandrababu Naidu who was
on a fast start about speaking about
some Air India planes you know then some
Air India stuff so they don't know their
facts be I find these attacks against
Indians extremely racist because it
assumes if Rahul Gandhi and I'm assuming
that everything is saying is right
because you've got to give people the
benefit of doubt if Rahul Gandhi is a
true true true patriot you should pick
up the phone to the French government
and say what are these emails the
assumption being that the Rahul Gandhi
6th and Rahul Gandhi's extremely well
placed to speak up word drives given
that the Gandhi family is chief
accountant a small-time accountant from
Nepali Watauga Quattro ki was coming in
and coming in on fire
fertilizer - energy - PS use - Gundams
so this whole thing about you know
analogic bribe given a Neil Ambani and
I'm saying that because we don't even
have the final Roger you know this guy
run or Tiger Patrick you run the Indian
government who are you talking about you
know don't think that people have just
fallen of the trees and finally finally
this story does not belong to any
journalist this story belongs to India
and anybody who really cares about India
must right go to France go to Paris
right right to people and figured out
why the bright giver assuming this a
bribe giver is let off scot-free but on
what basis can a person hold up an
airbus email and claim it is from rafael
can i do you have any fathomable answer
for that you've got to be plain crazy or
motivated no be doing something like
that the assumption being it's a plain
lie it's a lie
so someone's feeding him these papers no
no so someone is feeding him some papers
yes corporate group is he being used as
sources he's not even double-checking I
mean what is a simple simple
journalistic role at least it's not a
journalist to double-check his sources
but he's where do you double-check your
sources you see Rajiv now the fact of
the matter is that Airbus helicopter has
partnered with Mahindra for the military
helicopter program what happened this
morning Rajiv you may not like it was
what we call in English a lie a plain
and simple lie you can you know flail
your hand you know out and get hyper
about how would you know I would I know
because I partnered with Airbus
helicopters I know because it is the
truth haha
[Laughter]
you know that is a front man and what
happened here was that Rahul Gandhi was
desperate that there was a negative new
cycle about his sister-in-law both of
them constantly been questioned by the
IDI he wanted to switch over the new
cycle and they could do some drama in
front of some imbeciles journalists in
Delhi so he cooked up this whole thing
and it could very well piano twitch
himself tied down you don't have to call
him beside anomalies might take offense
you could have timed it out sir please I
know laura larae look all the journalist
le Cheyne nobody is ability for no no I
I am calling there is a reason that is
unfortunate I am beside no no there is a
reason behind it because they are
giggling they're evil they may not
around the plants and that along with
Rahul Gandhi on a matter with
information at that time they were
supposed to ask questions no no that is
a not have no it's on paper he was
holding it from a house and he comes he
has a monologue he just comes out he
just comes out he was holding the paper
from a distance mind just to change the
new cycle and Kamaraju deciding no no
but therefore there every journalists
had the basic thing to ask him the right
set of questions where did you get this
email from Wow what are you trying to
prove out of this is a different company
email out of context
[Music]
news on secrecy Clause busted fake news
on discussing busted take music
commercial favoritism busted fake news
on pricing busted I mean who is going to
tolerate all this and all you can do
you're frustrated like hell man lissa
why don't you believe these on the pulse
of some corporate as some people are
alleging right now these fees doing this
because he's on a semi global defense
Lobby that is just out by Rahul Gandhi
please where is understand the function
of Eurofighter and it's really
unfortunate
the important thing was in chitara
chitara
thing was the nature of the reductionist
house here right you try if I can have
your attention please for a minute what
is what actually causes me great concern
what what quite what see I don't I don't
pretty much care about Rahul Gandhi but
but but but the concern point of concern
is that if you take a fake email today
or a fake document yesterday but on that
basis today you said that the Prime
Minister is guilty of treason and I'm
going to put the Prime Minister in jail
now somewhere I have a fear that he's
not looking normal have you observed how
he looks these days because there's
something not normal if I just play out
a number of some lights around not read
their emotions this the behavior is not
behaviorally behaviorally he's looking a
little off-balance it's a point of
concern have you seen it and if on the
basis of this kind of a paper which is
proven to be fake you say the Prime
Minister of India is guilty of treason
what's going on there really I mean now
what's going on is they're called names
must also discuss and debate what has
been published in leading newspaper
which paper which I'm talking about the
Indian Express to report do I go by the
media Chitra
Chitra yeah evidence will only come
after investigation without in the ocean
while you don't even vestigation there
can be no evidence no know what your
bots have basically watch basically
therefore happening see what's happening
see what's happening off because we got
no point 1 min open because Chitra
cheater I see what's happening at Chitra
see what's happening here everybody is
trying to shoot off the other shoulder
please notice Chitra nobody is taking
responsive paper isn't taking
responsibility the party is not taking
responsibility they are all shooting off
and somebody's saying a paper in France
a paper here a party and nobody saying
we take responsibility for the facts
there's something very strange going on
here I am convinced now Chitra there's a
global corporate which is feeding in
recently that global corporate is
against there are file deal solutely and
it just fed information to some chosen
people in India I'm going to pull it out
it's the Eurofighter it's a unicycle
lobby ok
it's a Eurofighter Lobby and I don't
care I don't care about it what really
worries me what really worries me is
that the person who may one day become
the Prime Minister of India is holding
up a paper without cross-checking or
double checking and the next day another
paper as a patriot I would expect the
person and forget the leaks to actually
write to the government to France right
to ambu right and ask them or otto
hasslein awesome what's going on its are
these emails verified can you verify
them these are handed over to me and
then present the complete set of
documentary evidence and so just you
know one paper by one paper and it
doesn't add up because he's not making
one point he's making many points
totally and none of the matter is the
benefit of browser scripts only because
in as a democracy well well I don't
think so
you're being generous I think this is a
global political political corporate
plant here and the people of India are
beginning to see through it I thank you
all for joining me and debate number two

outfit

times running out for this radical
outfit
in tamil nadu tanjavur six pfi men
booked for murder of
k worker ramalingam
was 42 year old ramalingam hacked for
opposing conversion
fire reveals chilling details
and now our demand grows for a
nationwide ban on pfi
big debate coming up
welcome everyone you're watching the
burning question i'm shivani gupta
exactly how many such outfits would be
allowed such a leeway despite
their links coming out with several
crimes extremist activities
radicalizing and chilling murders that's
the question
that we're posing for our viewers and
our panelists tonight
the first burning question that we're
asking links to several murders is that
not
enough for a nationwide ban on pfi
that's not all isis links extremist
activities communal hatred
is this going to be allowed
and the big question we're asking
tonight pfi banned in jharkhand should
there be
a nationwide ban next
we've got mp rajya sabha and rss
ideologue rakesh sinha joining us on the
show with me in the studio is tuhin
sinha
leader of the bjp mahmoud paracha
advocate supreme court and also firoz
khan ghazi an advocate would be joining
us very soon
i want to go across to mahmud parachar
first up
mehmud parachar so many illegal
activities so many
objectional activities that this one
outfit and its people are being
associated with
why should india tolerate such
activities
under the garb of freedom of speech or
even religious activities
see just about a
six months back there is
there was another band which was
squashed by a jharkhand high court
so i would think that the the
jharkhand government has not taken up a
cue from what is
the mind of the judiciary in this matter
so
it has been already quashed once i don't
know why we'll discuss that later
i'm asking you for are you for a ban
for an outfit six people including top
hierarchy
has been arrested for a brutal murder
once again
let me not let him divert the issue i'm
asking you
as a citizen of this country who cries
you and cry all the time in the name of
religion
like look at what the fire against these
six ps5 men are saying
writing and criminal conspiracy members
one second one second murder
communalization example
once again for opposing conversions can
organize
like an organization called rss please
don't do this
let me congratulate
because it takes a lot of courage to go
to you know go ahead and ban an
organization like pfi
now let me let me take you back to 2010
when a leftist cm
of kerala aching had
gone on record to say that pfi is
working on an obnoxious plan to convert
convert uh you know large sections of
kerala into islam
and by 2030 they have a sinister plan to
make it a muslim majority state
in 2012 again the leftist government of
kerala fined
had found a you know a case in the high
court of kerala
saying that the activities of pfi are
dangerous to society
now you can do an about turn the
opposition can do about 10 but our stand
on the issue is very clear
now i congratulate you he has shown a
lot of conviction
now in so far as the national ban is
concerned yes
that needs to happen but we need to be
very sure of the proof that we have
okay what happens is during the day this
this organization works as a social
output of it you know you know
completely
uh deceiving uh or completely uh you
know
not letting us know what the real
activities is but the fact is
that
you know the the last nail in the coffin
okay one second
let me once again give an opportunity
you know this reminds me very much of
the case
of zakir nayak on the face of it
a so-called peace preacher he called
himself but there were so many nefarious
activities
that the nia had to crack down on mahmud
parachar as i bring in professor
rakhistana
i want to give you an opportunity are
you for a ban
on a radical outfit like this several
cases have come to light
this this rss this
rss and bjp have been soft peddling
zakir nayak for a very long time because
he is their agent
understand this and they are banning pfi
very nice despite the fact there is no
connection
because if you're going to answer my
question straight i'm going to allow you
time
you live in some parallel universe of
conspiracy theories
if you are an advocate if you can
present me proof
i'll be happy to give you time universe
do not do yes
i am answer my question the proof is the
proof is
jharkhand high court judgment why did
this government
why did this government had the gut yes
so they've come up with another ban now
that the state will have to justify it
one second that the state will have to
justify
radicalizers
your first response
kind of listen to other this is a panel
discussion this is not a monologue
you know any organization has to justify
try to deflect the success you don't get
to ask questions you did not answer my
question you don't get to ask questions
i'm warning you this is coming across as
a tactic for you
to not let others speak or not stick to
the subject i'm not going to allow this
that is your editorial professor ask him
how can he be trusted
how can he be trusted you know no ask
him
ask him you are a lawyer you don't
behave like this
debater in the street just i have three
reasons for that
the formation of the pfi it just goes
through the formation of yeah
one of the organization which was merged
to become a pfi was involved in the in
the bomb blasting
in tamil nadu and more than 68 activists
were arrested and dozens of have been
given the the
life imprisonment award in kerala the
other organization which was must
to create a pfi is activist chopped off
hands of tj joseph a christian teacher
in a school because he in a college he
has given some some
question paper which are related to
muhammad sahib
third organization voice which was from
karnataka has has history to create this
harmony in the society
so you go through the literature of pfi
go kindly go
translate it from balayalam you will
find that this affection against the
indian republic
their first tragedy to deconstruct in
the indian republic they are not ready
to accept india as a republic india the
union of states
they they consider that india is a is
and secondly they they are getting money
from
they are getting money from south uh uh
arab countries
and they are using to create conversion
they are they are declaring that
all the all the lists should be
converted in the time bound
so that the the muslim professor said i
cannot come in here these are all very
serious allegations
please let me come in here these are all
very serious allegations
my question then is if we have fine
jharkhand has taken
the lead they have once been questioned
by the court they've done it again
they'll have to now
you know stand the scrutiny of law my
question to you is
what's happened to indian politicians
and governments that all of this is
available in public domain
why has there been no action and should
there not be greater
accountability of the law enforcement
agencies what are they doing
why are they not putting together the
clues and the investigations
and the uh so that you can go
i'm giving you latest information that
jharkhand government had collected all
the information
or the pfi they are the very very
dangerous information
that would be supplied to the court
whenever court would demand that these
information
for mahmoud i am going to tell you two
things they
had been planning to create a criminal
rights in jharkhand
the government has a substantial report
that they were planning to create
this harmony during the election they
are in the process to radicalize the
muslim use
i have confident that indian muslims are
not going to be trapped by the pfi or
any other
organization but they are attempting to
radicalize the youth creating
disaffection against the indian republic
so i don't think that
why pfi why mahmoud pracha is pleading
for the pfi
as far as jacqueline is concerned i had
debate with my mistake
so many times he he was defending jackie
knight
now now he's saying that jackie knight
was the bjp agent i had debate with
mahmoud prasad more than dozen times
when you are defending
jackie nack as a as a great person as a
great prophet of islam
and now he is saying that no no he is
agent of bjp
so mahmoud don't change your side
according to the context
jackie naik is a traitor
of communism are you going to sympathize
with an outfit like the pf5
you you are you are the leader of the
devil
can i answer now can i yes answer can i
answer
to your lies why is it that you put the
owners on everybody else
but the psi today no no no
show me one instance show me one
incident mr rakesh
that you are not lying about zakir nayak
whenever i defended zakir nayak
i have always said that he is an rss
agent show me one instance
i will say sorry for them
[Applause]
hey
[Applause]
[Music]
anymore
india you are someone who stands for the
secretive culture of india
are you for pfi activities or are you
opposed to their activities
can you make me your individual stand
clear
rss i will be the first person to oppose
pfi
right now they are only following the
constitution
for the national nationals
every question by bringing in rss
[Laughter]
is
also let me remind you one more time the
discussion is not on rss the discussion
is on the fact that pfi has been banned
in jharkhand
for very serious allegations six of
their men have been arrested for the
brutal hacking of a man
who was opposing religious conversions
if you can get so much of your hate out
of your brain maybe you can
take some other information as well no
hate
i'm professor by love for my country not
the husband for rss
which is over okay all right let mr
sinha come in now
you know you know there is a logic
behind that why he always compares
because by comparing the rss he tries to
communicate the world
that rss is as radical as isis
rss as radical as pfi therefore he gives
respectability to pfi in india yes
he is giving message to the muslim youth
if you if a
hindus are joining rss then you join pfi
in a way mahmoud pracha a learned lawyer
is
acting as a recruiting agent of the pfi
unfortunately you are acting as a
recruiting agent of pfi
on your software you are more dangerous
than the pfci
as a lawyer at the intellectual or
national tv channels you are giving
message to the muslims
india is a terrorist version of
organization
can you make a difference between isis
also is a terrorist organization
only because muslims are no different
but you you are defending
is
this is a difference between you and the
common muslim message
they are the patriotic all indians
indian muslims are not going to be
misguided pfi should be banned
you should support the banning of the
pfi you are opposing the ban this means
you are supporting remember ideology
either no
you don't know any kind of equivalence
or
even an analogy does not justify
the activities that bfi and its people
have been linked to today
that is the most poor argument to try
and justify the fact
that many of their workers have now been
arrested in murder cases
is not a conspiracy on silence around
agencies and outfits like the pfr in the
name
of minority appeasement i'm saying it
openly
and mahmoud paracha you are doing great
disservice to the cause
of law and order in the country when you
back and
create false equivalences i will leave
it at that a big thanks to all our
guests for joining us",True,en,10305,94,358

Chandrababu Naidu lands and deli to lead
the opposition in sunburn against the
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is hitting
below 34 everybody you have seen all
leaders is attacking left and right
[Music]
yes that is out of focus story how low
will the opposition stoop of a good
evening I'm deeply searched they were
with you the shows called the burning
question and there is just one burning
question on everyone's mind today why
does this happen almost close to every
election right from 2014 - the Gujarat
elections - the build up to 20 90s and I
think we can now look at those burning
questions that go up on your screen so
the questions after the entire panel
today will actually answer is this an
opposition strategy to target the prime
minister and particularly Prime Minister
Modi's background
it all started dump in 2014 when you had
money Shankara you are actually making
up the chamalla jive is this an
opposition strategy to Target Prime
Minister Modi's background so the
opposition we are again and again
reiterates that we are just giving it
back to the BJP in their very own style
but is that positive politics is this
what the people of the country really
wants the answer is No
this is the same person who is
responding who is associated with Agatha
rights this is the same wheel we also
know the history we know the history of
political violence witches which the BJP
any indulgent
mr. Burton man 3G the facility okay sir
guru complete curtail as they treat
contagious pradhan mantri Hindustan
canny Pakistan the pradhan mantri array
monopod hanwen 3d pop never evolve
obligated party
all right so this is just an entire
story that gets together to tell you
what is the opposition doing and
thinking right now cheap politics such
they're dodging ET I think this is
exactly what that shows as I say good
evening our two centers that have
decayed areas of Parma and also so
they're shwarma who'll just stop be up
with us here on the broadcast in a bit
but D Kagan is AB why why so much of
abuse why so much of niche rachna t what
are we doing gone down from across the
political bodies the opposition says DK
Garissa when the opposition says we are
different we are practicing orogeny T
that is unlike the BJP you really need
to be walking your standards and I have
an entire list of the kind of abuses we
bought from the opposition close to
every election know that that comes from
BJP a jewel you cannot single out so you
did you defend this abuse no I don't at
all for a moment I don't but then it
should be you know the people should
observe standards across the parties
that is my only P you know they should
not have person they should not hurt
personal abuses and bring down the
politics to a gutter level really but it
happens for both parties unfortunately
but I don't know what is gotta level by
saying he deserves used cops the
pakistan Prime Minister chavala
unforgivable dropping Yamraj vodka
Saudagar Sanjay sir Rob the list is long
and somewhere the opposition says from
the BJP or BJP key allies say he sneaked
hi so are you equally guilty
Sanjay can you hear us now I don't think
he can hear us we're also uh in fact
guests so they should warm up with us so
he's with us here in our studios we'll
just get the audio line through but
awesome Pamela how do you read into this
what is this desperation the opposition
gets together they don't have a face
they don't even have a common agenda
they have nothing positive to talk about
only name calling is this how you today
and that's about the Prime Minister and
the Prime Minister the country's Prime
Minister this is I mean suppose
elections you try to say that we have
nothing to do with Manish and Correa is
removed only to be inducted back this is
when we talked about the chamalla jive
and the niche joy so they're shwarma but
you know you will also have to walk the
talk is the opposition and ruling party
equally guilty not today
what happened it reminds you it will
remind you let me record it for you like
rude Allah you know it has become a
platform where everybody is coming and
crying it hurts it torn and who can cry
you know louder that is the competition
there so anybody who is coming
giving abuses to Prime Minister the rest
to speaker comes he comes with
there's a platform how strongly you can
abuse the Prime Minister this was a
platform for that you see whatever the
issues they raised swap under position
on the issue everybody knows because of
the 14th Finance Commission special
status was not given that is the fact it
was against the people watching a
Chandrababu Naidu when people are gay
and water Derek O'Brien sales people are
listening in they will be looking at
one second EKG I think of the snow when
today voters are looking at this entire
conversation if you say the BJP is bad I
accepted the BJP has its own share of
questions today that they need to answer
[Applause]
is not to repeat those please this
is not what we as a channel should be
doing for our waters today and for our
viewers but awesome aha tell me
something is there nothing positive that
the entire opposition has to talk about
on the opposition believes it's only
fashionable again
Clara to your question I am good I am
going to reply to a question just
earlier our panelists to please keep
quiet for a minute okay I will highlight
two points which were discussed today
and in the opposition Larry is the
mistreatments to the States run by the
opposition party now somehow you see
we've seen in the past also the prime
ministers of different party in the
states being headed after the people of
the states are the people of the state
they're people of the country so you
can't disrespect you
[Laughter]
one more comment ourselves awesome do
have that sip of water because you will
have to answer for arvind kejriwal
he was a part of that entire united
opposition yes interplanetary stages of
our sign language who is he who is he
what are his credentials
Prime Minister ICO path yes are you
forgetting that my Sheikh to issues of
really want to expose no degree please
listen to others son Joseph sanjay
jadhav
you will also have to answer for a load
of these words a load of you know all
this abuse the utterance that also comes
in from your side do not think that the
voters do not have a mind yeah
the way this a portion is behaving
honestly I am Telling the day our
everyday losing their voters if they
feel they are behaving this way they
will get voters there every day they are
losing just see the Chief Minister ops
delete State who has not been able to do
a single constructive work at Delhi he
speak is the Prime Minister is you know
like his bumihills speaking fight style
language let's see the height what's up
a message they want to give our
neighboring countries but kill only that
type of neighboring countries because
without that poster phone free because
there is a larger story and then I'll
get so - to respond - wait if we can
actually run a poster fulfill this
discharge all our trackers are post
you touch I cut glass de natal came out
my up Nick they're stadia so what you're
doing is digging all those people it has
been put by someone that will be taking
care of but the fact remains that such
posters has not been withdrawn by the
owners and it shows the demeaning
attitude of these people towards
democracy but the Chihuahuas elected as
prime minister they have not been able
to digest this because these are the
people you know about Arvind Kejriwal
your drinking objection to he be gone
insane but tell me people of this
country who voted for an increase D wall
would be really sad the today is driving
with the same forces opposing he was
opposing corrupt people and all these
people here to pose individually and
know you know you know how everybody you
know and now he is ganged up with
everyone
I think I should make this observation
what happens is when you try to show the
mirror to the opposition there is a
Liston TJ PB by Cartier but then you
want to say that you are a different
opposition is this your manifesto so
Pamela the manifesto of being different
but is by it by resorting to cheap
insults or you think that this is that
you know this is the real way that you
can and perhaps for me you see including
Chandrababu Naidu trans about myself
Abuja bodkin ADT Faribault Liga
after-work Tigers Clinton a career
Marikina comma Club a even Chandrababu
Naidu also condemned this statement or
which was damaged was exhibited there on
a posture what I am trying to say is in
the past if you see that the even the
even the BJP did not you lose any stone
unturned to call the Prime Minister ex
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to be
involved with the Pakistani to have a
meeting to have a conspiracy
possibly nice and gentle nature please
do not believe that the voters are fools
you can donate the waters not talk about
core issues not about positive agenda if
I say anything people are watching you
people definitely do not need this
village level of politics gentlemen
thank you I hope we don't have more
debates on issues like these but
unfortunately so they hdk agree are safe
and Sanjay this is an election season we
should be braced up for the moment thank
you to all of you we are back from the
other side",True,en,6352,95,108

the indian republic they are not ready
to accept india as a republic india the
union of states
they they consider that india is a is
and secondly they they are getting money
from
they are getting money from south uh uh
arab countries
and they are using to create conversion
they are they are declaring that
all the all the lists should be
converted in the time bound
so that the the muslim professor said i
cannot come in here these are all very
serious allegations
please let me come in here these are all
very serious allegations
my question then is if we have fine
jharkhand has taken
the lead they have once been questioned
by the court they've done it again
they'll have to now
you know stand the scrutiny of law my
question to you is
what's happened to indian politicians
and governments that all of this is
available in public domain
why has there been no action and should
there not be greater
accountability of the law enforcement
agencies what are they doing
why are they not putting together the
clues and the investigations
and the uh so that you can go
i'm giving you latest information that
jharkhand government had collected all
the information
or the pfi they are the very very
dangerous information
that would be supplied to the court
whenever court would demand that these
information
for mahmoud i am going to tell you two
things they
had been planning to create a criminal
rights in jharkhand
the government has a substantial report
that they were planning to create
this harmony during the election they
are in the process to radicalize the
muslim use
i have confident that indian muslims are
not going to be trapped by the pfi or
any other
organization but they are attempting to
radicalize the youth creating
disaffection against the indian republic
so i don't think that
why pfi why mahmoud pracha is pleading
for the pfi
as far as jacqueline is concerned i had
debate with my mistake
so many times he he was defending jackie
knight
now now he's saying that jackie knight
was the bjp agent i had debate with
mahmoud prasad more than dozen times
when you are defending
jackie nack as a as a great person as a
great prophet of islam
and now he is saying that no no he is
agent of bjp
so mahmoud don't change your side
according to the context
jackie naik is a traitor
of communism are you going to sympathize
with an outfit like the pf5
you you are you are the leader of the
devil
can i answer now can i yes answer can i
answer
to your lies why is it that you put the
owners on everybody else
but the psi today no no no
show me one instance show me one
incident mr rakesh
that you are not lying about zakir nayak
whenever i defended zakir nayak
i have always said that he is an rss
agent show me one instance
i will say sorry for them
[Applause]
hey
[Applause]
[Music]
anymore
india you are someone who stands for the
secretive culture of india
are you for pfi activities or are you
opposed to their activities
can you make me your individual stand
clear
rss i will be the first person to oppose
pfi
right now they are only following the
constitution
for the national nationals
every question by bringing in rss
[Laughter]
is
also let me remind you one more time the
discussion is not on rss the discussion
is on the fact that pfi has been banned
in jharkhand
for very serious allegations six of
their men have been arrested for the
brutal hacking of a man
who was opposing religious conversions
if you can get so much of your hate out
of your brain maybe you can
take some other information as well no
hate
i'm professor by love for my country not
the husband for rss
which is over okay all right let mr
sinha come in now
you know you know there is a logic
behind that why he always compares
because by comparing the rss he tries to
communicate the world
that rss is as radical as isis
rss as radical as pfi therefore he gives
respectability to pfi in india yes
he is giving message to the muslim youth
if you if a
hindus are joining rss then you join pfi
in a way mahmoud pracha a learned lawyer
is
acting as a recruiting agent of the pfi
unfortunately you are acting as a
recruiting agent of pfi
on your software you are more dangerous
than the pfci
as a lawyer at the intellectual or
national tv channels you are giving
message to the muslims
india is a terrorist version of
organization
can you make a difference between isis
also is a terrorist organization
only because muslims are no different
but you you are defending
is
this is a difference between you and the
common muslim message
they are the patriotic all indians
indian muslims are not going to be
misguided pfi should be banned
you should support the banning of the
pfi you are opposing the ban this means
you are supporting remember ideology
either no
you don't know any kind of equivalence
or
even an analogy does not justify
the activities that bfi and its people
have been linked to today
that is the most poor argument to try
and justify the fact
that many of their workers have now been
arrested in murder cases
is not a conspiracy on silence around
agencies and outfits like the pfr in the
name
of minority appeasement i'm saying it
openly
and mahmoud paracha you are doing great
disservice to the cause
of law and order in the country when you
back and
create false equivalences i will leave
it at that a big thanks to all our
guests for joining us",True,en,10305,94,358

Chandrababu Naidu lands and deli to lead
the opposition in sunburn against the
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is hitting
below 34 everybody you have seen all
leaders is attacking left and right
[Music]
yes that is out of focus story how low
will the opposition stoop of a good
evening I'm deeply searched they were
with you the shows called the burning
question and there is just one burning
question on everyone's mind today why
does this happen almost close to every
election right from 2014 - the Gujarat
elections - the build up to 20 90s and I
think we can now look at those burning
questions that go up on your screen so
the questions after the entire panel
today will actually answer is this an
opposition strategy to target the prime
minister and particularly Prime Minister
Modi's background
it all started dump in 2014 when you had
money Shankara you are actually making
up the chamalla jive is this an
opposition strategy to Target Prime
Minister Modi's background so the
opposition we are again and again
reiterates that we are just giving it
back to the BJP in their very own style
but is that positive politics is this
what the people of the country really
wants the answer is No
this is the same person who is
responding who is associated with Agatha
rights this is the same wheel we also
know the history we know the history of
political violence witches which the BJP
any indulgent
mr. Burton man 3G the facility okay sir
guru complete curtail as they treat
contagious pradhan mantri Hindustan
canny Pakistan the pradhan mantri array
monopod hanwen 3d pop never evolve
obligated party
all right so this is just an entire
story that gets together to tell you
what is the opposition doing and
thinking right now cheap politics such
they're dodging ET I think this is
exactly what that shows as I say good
evening our two centers that have
decayed areas of Parma and also so
they're shwarma who'll just stop be up
with us here on the broadcast in a bit
but D Kagan is AB why why so much of
abuse why so much of niche rachna t what
are we doing gone down from across the
political bodies the opposition says DK
Garissa when the opposition says we are
different we are practicing orogeny T
that is unlike the BJP you really need
to be walking your standards and I have
an entire list of the kind of abuses we
bought from the opposition close to
every election know that that comes from
BJP a jewel you cannot single out so you
did you defend this abuse no I don't at
all for a moment I don't but then it
should be you know the people should
observe standards across the parties
that is my only P you know they should
not have person they should not hurt
personal abuses and bring down the
politics to a gutter level really but it
happens for both parties unfortunately
but I don't know what is gotta level by
saying he deserves used cops the
pakistan Prime Minister chavala
unforgivable dropping Yamraj vodka
Saudagar Sanjay sir Rob the list is long
and somewhere the opposition says from
the BJP or BJP key allies say he sneaked
hi so are you equally guilty
Sanjay can you hear us now I don't think
he can hear us we're also uh in fact
guests so they should warm up with us so
he's with us here in our studios we'll
just get the audio line through but
awesome Pamela how do you read into this
what is this desperation the opposition
gets together they don't have a face
they don't even have a common agenda
they have nothing positive to talk about
only name calling is this how you today
and that's about the Prime Minister and
the Prime Minister the country's Prime
Minister this is I mean suppose
elections you try to say that we have
nothing to do with Manish and Correa is
removed only to be inducted back this is
when we talked about the chamalla jive
and the niche joy so they're shwarma but
you know you will also have to walk the
talk is the opposition and ruling party
equally guilty not today
what happened it reminds you it will
remind you let me record it for you like
rude Allah you know it has become a
platform where everybody is coming and
crying it hurts it torn and who can cry
you know louder that is the competition
there so anybody who is coming
giving abuses to Prime Minister the rest
to speaker comes he comes with
there's a platform how strongly you can
abuse the Prime Minister this was a
platform for that you see whatever the
issues they raised swap under position
on the issue everybody knows because of
the 14th Finance Commission special
status was not given that is the fact it
was against the people watching a
Chandrababu Naidu when people are gay
and water Derek O'Brien sales people are
listening in they will be looking at
one second EKG I think of the snow when
today voters are looking at this entire
conversation if you say the BJP is bad I
accepted the BJP has its own share of
questions today that they need to answer
[Applause]
is not to repeat those please this
is not what we as a channel should be
doing for our waters today and for our
viewers but awesome aha tell me
something is there nothing positive that
the entire opposition has to talk about
on the opposition believes it's only
fashionable again
Clara to your question I am good I am
going to reply to a question just
earlier our panelists to please keep
quiet for a minute okay I will highlight
two points which were discussed today
and in the opposition Larry is the
mistreatments to the States run by the
opposition party now somehow you see
we've seen in the past also the prime
ministers of different party in the
states being headed after the people of
the states are the people of the state
they're people of the country so you
can't disrespect you
[Laughter]
one more comment ourselves awesome do
have that sip of water because you will
have to answer for arvind kejriwal
he was a part of that entire united
opposition yes interplanetary stages of
our sign language who is he who is he
what are his credentials
Prime Minister ICO path yes are you
forgetting that my Sheikh to issues of
really want to expose no degree please
listen to others son Joseph sanjay
jadhav
you will also have to answer for a load
of these words a load of you know all
this abuse the utterance that also comes
in from your side do not think that the
voters do not have a mind yeah
the way this a portion is behaving
honestly I am Telling the day our
everyday losing their voters if they
feel they are behaving this way they
will get voters there every day they are
losing just see the Chief Minister ops
delete State who has not been able to do
a single constructive work at Delhi he
speak is the Prime Minister is you know
like his bumihills speaking fight style
language let's see the height what's up
a message they want to give our
neighboring countries but kill only that
type of neighboring countries because
without that poster phone free because
there is a larger story and then I'll
get so - to respond - wait if we can
actually run a poster fulfill this
discharge all our trackers are post
you touch I cut glass de natal came out
my up Nick they're stadia so what you're
doing is digging all those people it has
been put by someone that will be taking
care of but the fact remains that such
posters has not been withdrawn by the
owners and it shows the demeaning
attitude of these people towards
democracy but the Chihuahuas elected as
prime minister they have not been able
to digest this because these are the
people you know about Arvind Kejriwal
your drinking objection to he be gone
insane but tell me people of this
country who voted for an increase D wall
would be really sad the today is driving
with the same forces opposing he was
opposing corrupt people and all these
people here to pose individually and
know you know you know how everybody you
know and now he is ganged up with
everyone
I think I should make this observation
what happens is when you try to show the
mirror to the opposition there is a
Liston TJ PB by Cartier but then you
want to say that you are a different
opposition is this your manifesto so
Pamela the manifesto of being different
but is by it by resorting to cheap
insults or you think that this is that
you know this is the real way that you
can and perhaps for me you see including
Chandrababu Naidu trans about myself
Abuja bodkin ADT Faribault Liga
after-work Tigers Clinton a career
Marikina comma Club a even Chandrababu
Naidu also condemned this statement or
which was damaged was exhibited there on
a posture what I am trying to say is in
the past if you see that the even the
even the BJP did not you lose any stone
unturned to call the Prime Minister ex
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to be
involved with the Pakistani to have a
meeting to have a conspiracy
possibly nice and gentle nature please
do not believe that the voters are fools
you can donate the waters not talk about
core issues not about positive agenda if
I say anything people are watching you
people definitely do not need this
village level of politics gentlemen
thank you I hope we don't have more
debates on issues like these but
unfortunately so they hdk agree are safe
and Sanjay this is an election season we
should be braced up for the moment thank
you to all of you we are back from the
other side",True,en,6352,95,108

that the Prime Minister of India has a
deep he has stolen 30,000 crores from
you the Defense Ministry is objecting to
his interference
sliced and diced raw file not torn apart
another attempt to confuse has being
demolished but the select of nature with
which the contents of the meat are being

[Music]
ladies and gentlemen no matter how much
how much you slice and dice the truth
has always got a way of emerging and
tonight Rahul Gandhi the serial liar has
once again been caught out on Rafal here
is his latest attempt to parade a
narrative muting and using an edited
piece of paper which within 60 minutes
was exposed on Republic planet here's
the story and then we debate here Sukhoi
Pak Hindustan tea sitar
[Applause]
that the Prime Minister of India is Mary
pass love ILP pilot
what are you we're on the debate tonight
watch how the biggest row file lie has
been busted
he waived a spliced note published in a
newspaper and repeated this friends in
the Air Force generals pilots it is
written clearly here that the Prime
Minister of India is a thief he has
stolen thirty thousand crores from you
in minutes the truth was out and the
fake news busted where you have that
note by the Defense Secretary and you've
got the dent defense secretary chief
Mohan Kumar signing off they've chopped
it off right here not even making you
know not even showing the full signature
of Mohan Kumar because that would mean
that the first page of the Raksha
monthly statement will be shown after
this in the very same page towards the
end is where Manohar Parrikar has in
fact made his comment has made a note
and this is the full page this is the
full Intel note that you see here with
particle signature also he signed off on
this document at the very end the rock
shaman three exposed him on the floor of
the house and man who let the file
negotiations destroyed every Rahul I
first and foremost I want to tell you
that this note has got nothing to do
with the Indian fields negotiation on
the repeal for government because this
note was not initiated by the Indian
negotiating team this has been initiated
by a person called 3sk Sharma who is
deputy secretary err - he was not part
of the Indian negotiation team at all
there has never been any interference
from anybody including the PM Office
this note of a Modi which has been put
out and Hindu is itself an evidence of
no interference there has been no
parallel negotiation contracted by PMO
because everything that is there in the
intergovernmental agreement is something
that has been framed by the Indian
negotiating team in consultation with
difference negotiating team how many
more lies how many more abuses
tonight will rahul gandhi apologize for
pushing a narrative by peddling fake
news Andhra file let's debate
[Music]
and on the debate this evening I am
joined by the defense minister of India
mere malossi theremin thank you very
much
Missy theremin for joining us also I'm
joined by Air Marshal SBP Sinha retired
he retired on the 31st of December his
former Deputy Chief of Air Staff and he
was the head of the raw file negotiation
team whatever you say on record today
will have tremendous significance in the
context of this attempt at making this
the latest controversy near malossi
theremin first I'd like to draw your
attention to the two pieces of paper
there's one piece of paper which I call
the adore each III the incomplete letter
and there's another piece of letter
which I call the Puri Chitti which is
the complete letter that is apparent to
me that the Hindu newspaper for some
reason which only they no chose to
publish the Dooley Chitti and let me
tell our viewers how this happens this
is the full piece of paper if you fold
the top part and remove the first
paragraph and you then fold the bottom
part and you remove all the critical
note things including that of mr. in the
ball but occur in the bottom you end up
with a hugely edited piece of paper a
piece of paper which can then their
mullah settlement be taken out of
context and used to perpetuate any kind
of life I am shocked actually and
surprised that the Hindu did that but
what doesn't surprise me is that Rahul
Gandhi used this to try and amplify the
lie today have you come to the bottom of
this why this happened and what attempt
was made to give the RAF Ally another
lease of life Missy theremin
well I'm not sure because it's clear
that the Congress party under the
leadership of their current president
Rahul Gandhi is embarrassing themselves
repeatedly after the Supreme Court has
given its verdict after on their demand
a discussion was held in the Lok Sabha
wherein I have given an elaborate answer
point by point and in spite of that they
peddle all kinds of lies
today they resorted to using a newspaper
which came up with a half-baked story
and as a result of which they exposing
their desperation in wanting to serve
God knows whose agenda and that is where
I suspect there is reason to believe
that they're playing in a larger game
probably of multinational corporations
which are trying to rival each other why
with each other to get projects
otherwise nothing and can explain this
kind of a public posturing calling names
of the Prime Minister repeatedly as
though they have a right and the irony
is the president of the Congress party
and the former president of the Congress
party are both out on bail you know it
surprises me actually what has happened
today viewers let me tell you what has
happened today what has happened is that
an individual who has nothing to do with
the Rafael deal at all an individual who
has nothing to do with the repeal
negotiations at all an individual who is
a deputy or undersecretary in the
Ministry of Defence who has no iota of
information and zero role in the Rafael
deal negotiations an individual who is
not an expert on defense an individual
absolutely not aware of Indian Air Force
rules regulations an individual who
knows nothing about aircraft in other
words an individual who has nothing to
do with us at all
arbitrarily on it all on his own wrote a
letter and that letter obviously was it
was not taken seriously and it was put
aside I find it very surprising why that
individual wrote the letter was the
individual lobbying for someone else did
the individual have some other corporate
interests in mind would this letter by
the individual which is who has nothing
to do near milazzo Terrebonne with the
negotiating team have gone on to benefit
the Eurofighter and this very letter is
now picked up and published eight column
in the Hindu as I said I have the
deepest regard for mr. n ROM but I don't
know mr. n around what you did when you
publish this letter I am willing to
speak to you about it but what on earth
is going on Raksha monthly in this case
III don't find head or tail anymore as
far as the Rafael story is concerned
what is your reading of it
well uh as I said the Congress party is
desperate for issues and Minister of
Defense is something in which when the
whenever the Congress party was in power
decisions were not made without the role
of a middlemen under Prime Minister Modi
decisions in the ministry whether it was
under per acre G whether it was on
Jaitley whether it was whether we are
talking about now the Ministry of
Defence does its business and goes about
its work with no middlemen whatsoever I
think the Congress party is not able to
come to terms with it as a result most
often they are on a fishing expedition
and they have not gone anyway then where
we where they started but the fishing
expedition continues
with brazen immunity because in spite of
the Supreme Court's verdict in spite of
the open discussion in Parliament in
spite of me every now and then
periodically showing the documents with
which I am answering them they continue
to perpetrate very brace and lies and
also misleading the public 30,000 rupees
has gone survey asked them to show us
the money trail where did the thirty
thousand emerge from and to whose
account it went if they can show in the
context of Raffaele about which he is
speaking day in and day out and
therefore I feel if you ask me have I
got to the bottom of it no because this
is apparent there's no need for me to go
searching for where it the fact lies
they are continuing with it because one
they can't believe that the ministry can
run without any corruption - they
started it they don't know how to get
out of it and therefore they're
pretending us so they're finding more
about mr. theremin if I may know what
that
we are successful because because they
say come what may
we got the Defense Minister of India
riled up and she spoke in Parliament
they say doesn't matter anymore I spoke
to some people luminosity Raman in the
Congress who said listen we achieved our
objective didn't you see Nirmala
Sitharaman reply in Parliament that was
our object didn't you see that a file
story come back in the news another day
at nine that was our object very well if
the objective is to have this discussed
every day we are willing to do it if
that is your objective carry on with it
but each time at least for the sake of
the people of India except you've got
answers for each one of them and in
spite of that you're pretending as
though you're raking up a new issue but
the more the Congress party rakes up
this issue they are going to get exposed
that even answers after answers being
given they continue to raise this issue
probably because they just don't have
anything more and this unfortunately for
them it's not sticking on us and it
shall never and I shall never sit by me
if I may while you are there I also want
to ask a Marshall sbpc now has been
former Deputy Chief of Air Staff and
head of the rapha√´l negotiation team so
you retired just about five weeks back
do you know of this gentleman SK Sharma
deputy secretary brackets err - two
brackets closed and can you tell the
viewers what role he had in Rafah see it
is difficult for me to recollect if I
know mr. Eskridge Sharma because I have
been out of Delhi I was commanding the
Central High Command for last three
years and I had handed over the
chairmanship of the Indian negotiating
team on 38 December to marshal Bethulia
as far as 0 fire negotiations is
concerned it was carried out by
team of seven members of which I was the
chairman and it was appointed No and I
was appointed by government efficiency
writing this letter sir and he was not
part of the indian negotiate what local
standard does he write and give his
special two bits on Andhra file that is
what I am saying that it shows great
evidence to prove the point that there
was no interference with the Indian
negotiating team while this is an
internal I would a middle level
bureaucrat in the Ministry of Defence
you know get into this issue you know
which also involves the deepest and
highest level of global corporate
interests and and and and millions
hundreds of millions of dollars and that
is why that's my question and that is
why the den rock shaman three has closed
the issue on a Modi files it's a it's a
matter that was harmless Rahul Gandhi's
himself involved in some corporate
lobbying why is he picking up this
incomplete piece of paper and trying to
parrot it see the that is not of
opposition to the raw file deal
primarily to somehow get this Rafael
contract cancelled okay and this will go
a grave damage to the capabilities of
Indian Air Force and in turn to the
national security why is there great
interest in getting the raw file
contract contract canceled sir
because there is a procurement of
another 114 aircraft and if you can
knock out one competitor the chances of
others right III I heard I have a solid
information that the American
ambassadors principal job in the last
seven to eight years has been to get the
MMR see a deal for a American company I
have I have solid information that the
Americans have been seriously lobbying
with the previous Congress government
and that they were very nervous when the
BJP government came in because they
really desperately wanted wanted the
MMRCA deal and so it went to a French
company it really hit them hard see I am
not aware of the attempts by the
American ambassador but what I want to
tell you that when
evaluated the six aircraft for the MMRCA
deal our evaluation process was
universally acclaimed and I had letters
from the US companies who appreciated
our assess evaluation of their aircraft
also though they were lost the contract
no the question is actually and and I
think Nirmala Sitharaman referred to it
is that is Rahul Gandhi a lobbyist for I
mean is he actually because the
desperation must is he somewhere a
lobbyist for some American defense
companies you know is that his real
interest mr. Thurmond you're maintaining
US diplomatic silence on this one is
Rahul Gandhi some kind of a I think we
lost the line there she's she's
disconnected but I think this question
must be about you sir which it is Rahul
Gandhi some kind of a lobbyist because
Delhi is teaming with lobbyists of all
kinds is rather than this somewhere a
lobbyist in this high-stakes corporate
battle Nirmala Sitharaman for any
American corporate interests
mr. Thurmond can I ask you the question
again it was disconnected in between I
was cut off in between AI Quoc is LA we
are all wondering here in the studio
yeah as I sorry so we lost you in
between but we are all wondering here in
the studio is Rahul Gandhi a lobbyist
for certain American or other competing
corporate interests who have great
amount of interest in hundreds of
millions of dollars that India will
spend in the MMRCA deal for which the
Americans were lobbying very hard in the
past I'd like to have the answer for
that from somewhere I'll be keen to know
I begin to know - I think we must
investigate this matter well near Bala
Sitaram on we she's going to she's going
to be diplomatic on that I'm not
surprised because it's a question my job
to ask the question but it's a question
in everyone's minds I thank you Nirmala
Sitharaman defense minister for joining
me live on my on on the on the debate
tonight and now let's go into the debate

till then you and you and achieve this I
solve the personal issues you are having
you see let's now debate with Faruk on
Abhijeet ir mitra and on the other side
we have we have GBI shastri line number
one line number one Juvia
Rahul Gandhi says the Prime Minister
stole thirty thousand crore rupees and
gave it to Anil Ambani first of all if
Anil Ambani were to have 30 thousand
crore rupees then he would not have
filed for bankruptcy a week back Anil
Ambani in case you don't know has taken
one of his marquee companies and filed
for bankruptcy a week back so that's a
whole lot of hogwash Rahul Gandhi you
don't know what you're talking about
the fact is that a Marshal's in house
sitting with me on my right who was in
uniform just four weeks ago says there
is no cash given to an offset partner he
says today there is no cash given to an
offset partner and therefore there could
have been no 30 or 3,000 or 300 rupees
given to onion Ambani sir can you
explain that please for all our viewers
because you know this this must be
counted it is very important for the
viewers to understand the difference
between tio T which is transfer of
Technology and offsets yeah when you
bring in technology you pay for it
and you buy the technology for producing
a craft and for maintaining the aircraft
when it comes to offsets there is no
cash exchange in offsets it is only
credits now what happens in offsets is
that whatever is the foreign exchange
element in the procurement you clawback
a certain percentage of that into India
by buying either products which are made
in India or by utilizing services that
are provided by Indian companies or by
investing direct foreign investment in
Indian companies or by transfer of
technology to DRDO or other government
approved organisation incredible so in
this fifty nine thousand crore is what
is in the media is the total cost of
procurement yeah so out of this you have
to take out the cost of performance
based law
which is for maintaining the of l36
Ravel for five years then you have to
take out the cost of the installation of
simulator through turnkey infrastructure
construction and thereafter whatever is
the left out portion of foreign exchange
fifty percent of that has to be plowed
back now the new by an equipment
route back to all the companies which
are offset partners yes I will come to
that when you as I just just want my
viewers I want you to listen to this
part very very carefully because what a
Marshall Sinha is saying is that there
is no question of taking one rupee and
giving it to Anil Ambani leave along the
established fake news story and the lie
that 30,000 crore rupees is given by
Modi to Ambani he is the person who has
headed there our file negotiations and
he knows it and I dare anyone on the
panel to question him on facts today
please sir please continue so one day
after he speaks so when you do a
procurement without offset it comes at a
particular cost say 100 rupees
yes and if you do the same procurement
with offset you will have an offset
loading which if you take universally
accepted norms it is between 5 to 8
percent depending on the nature of the
offset packages so but whether if this
is the case then how is how is this
story being spread that so the 30000 has
probably come half of 59,000 but that is
not so because the actual foreign
exchange that is going is much much
lesser than so called 59,000 which is
the total cost in this contract as per
the media reports now then you do
offsets you get credits that means if
your offsets are for 10 thousand rupees
you will either buy products made in
India worth ten thousand or services or
a combination or it put dfi or give
transfer of technology so any company
which has a contract with Government of
India and is implementing offset it is
at liberty to choose its offset partners
and this is as per the DPP the
Government of India has no role in
selection of Pinus I then I then I then
want to ask here Abhijit you are
listening to this sk that they're
listening to this
lie after lie after lie after lie after
lie now when I say then they say oh you
know what you're in the support the
government rubbish
I'm support I'm supporting the truth one
minute Razak yeah who is a chill the
company which was servicing the Mirage
which crashed a weak company very very
very important revelation to make now
and I want the sign right Abhijeet and
for hopefully now I come to the most
important part of tonight's program
yours can I speak to you for a minute
he was you have word
Rahul Gandhi and it's for you to judge
which 50 alone or 50 year-old adolescent
have been speaking about I'm not calling
him one you've all Gandhi go on about HL
HL HL HL a Chia one is from the same
family that allowed HL HL HL to go to
seed
he's from the same family that ruined
all the good public sector corporations
made them inefficient he's from the same
family under whose tenure Chinese
companies came and took over at a time
when Indian drug manufacturers were
wanting to compete they killed the
Indian companies brought the Chinese and
Rowell Gandhi first come clean on your
links with China and then talk and now
let me tell you the truth about a chair
with the greatest of respect to all the
employees at a chair please listen to
the truth and Rahul Gandhi have the
sense to listen HL was in no position to
deliver under fire and I'm not saying it
this is being said but the man sitting
to my right a formerly deputy chief of
staff when I interviewed him for the
public ballot in detail he told us that
H I do not want interruption Razak I
don't want interruption Razak he said
that
HL was not in a position to deliver on
the timelines and the specifications
that were required in the interest of
national security without interruption
can we listen to him please sir I'm not
they accused me of putting words in your
mouth first of all I have no right
reason or ability to put words in his
mouth this is a live program I have not
recorded it your witness to that sir the
time right now is 9:40 p.m. we are all
live right now Shastri are we live or
not if we are live I I want to ask a
marshal s Anakin's called air marshal
SBP Sinha why was a cheerless chosen by
the Indian negotiation team please tell
us the truth
the factors that the previous
procurement of MMRCA the RFP had a
chapter on transfer of technology for
making the
a craft in India this chapter was made
by HL themselves and during the
negotiations the entire procurement
became a hostage to the transfer of
technology because the saw and HAL could
not resolve the differences of
manufacturing the aircraft
there were various issues primary issue
was the escalation in cost due to the
additional man-hours that were being
sought by HL and for the additional
infrastructure that HL wanted to
construct secondly there were issues
related to who will take responsibility
for the HL manufactured aircraft and
therefore the cost of the hundred and
eight aircraft to be manufactured under
licence by HL were never finalized
because the negotiations never came to a
close when it comes to offsets League
when it comes to offsets the OEM chooses
their own partners in this case the
aircraft is being sold by the so the
engines are from saffron the avionics is
from Tallis and the weapons are from
MBDA so all these four on pro rata basis
as part of their contract are doing
their bit of the offsets and they all
have their individual partners which is
totaling 7080 vendors and what is
important is that of all the contracts
that Indian Air Force has signed which
have offsets it is close to 17 billion
of which HL has got an amount of only
400 million which is just about over two
percent and this is primarily because
not many foreign vendors are keen to
work with HL you know this is a as you
are speaking every word I am getting
hundreds of tweets every 30 seconds and
therefore I'm making a request today to
all the viewers and to you Shastri and
everyone on the program that I intend to
extend this debate beyond 10 o clock for
a piece 15 minutes I hope you'll bear
with me now you heard that foreign and
the gentleman sitting here Marshall SB
piece enough former chief of Deputy
Chief of Air Staff and the head of the
Raphael negotiation team is known to be
a man of great technical expertise and
incredible and unimpeachable integrity
he has said five things about HL today
escalation in cost padded infrastructure
no accountability for the aircraft
Farook and he's also said that the cost
was not finalized because the terms were
not agreed what this means there for a
marshal is that had this continued it
would have been years decades perhaps
before we would have gotten a file onto
a fleet therefore there were only three
choices either to continue indefinitely
meeting for a chair and the so aviation
to resolve their differences and arrive
at a conclusion or to cancel the whole
process and restart the negotiation all
over again or to go through a
governmental government spawn deal for
an aircraft that has already been
evaluated and determined as a l1 render
in a multi vendor procurement now you
see this is this is so important you
said it because with all my due respect
to you knew this and even on you they
could my deeply deep regards to you I
have one caution saw that if HL is such
an underperforming PSU we have in India
why the government of India is not
abandoning and closing it down so when
we compare saw the Reliance defense and
the HL Hunley a new no vice company
having no exposure no experience
whatsoever and HL i sir don't understand
and I beg to differ with you sir with
all my due respect that it is completely
beyond reasonable apprehension so the
point of concern is mr. Goswami has well
that you have got or justify farouq
farouq evolves transposed once again
once again once the eight minutes you
have heard right now from a man who
knows is subject and like you see you
why do you why I would like to respond
so put your apprehension stress now
listen to him singing no no because you
know you are saying why got it share
money he's giving you the reasons why
not a chair right now it case so how
from Vani the testimony of the accused
is taken as a gospel truth so let
investors be done and it's a position it
is not proven this is I
I request you at least or behave like
the No he has told you on your right now
listen to me listen to me now one one
one one one one it is not cute
it is not cute that you lie about papers
you are chuh it is not cute that you
edit out facts and it was not cute do
you believe in the Hindu it could be I'm
not in towards the Hindu has published I
don't want to comment on what the Hindu
has published the Hindu I'm sure will
publish the completely FERS also second
of I have great personal respect for mr.
Engram and for the paper what the Hindu
has done or not done is the Hindus
business
editorial freedom I might veto of the
editorial freedom to put the correct
story in perspective I have no Republic
has no issue with Hindu the Hindu is not
the contours those story is not this the
Hindu story is not they should sorry
the Hindu story is not they should issue
issue is today the facts which we've got
now can I take a break and come back
after I take a break Thank You viewers I
I I'm extending this debate on your
request and when we come back more facts
versus lies and thank you for your big
feedback coming back in a few minutes
the next lie GVR the next lie summit on
this mega trending debate edition over
20,000 199 tweets thank you viewers the
next slide all Gandhi says that the
Prime Minister is directly involved in
the know file scam the person who heads
the negotiation committee
Abhijeet says the person who heads the
negotiation committee says a Vegeta I'm
asking you about what he says that there
has never been any interference from
anyone including the PM Office am I
correct am i quoting you incorrectly
please tell me yes you're right was that
any phone call didn't our Indra Modi
call you no did the defense minister
call you and say I want anil ambani in I
want Reliance in was there a call to
that effect no there was nothing to
influence the negotiating team directly
indirectly consciously unconsciously
voluntarily did you receive a phone call
a written communication a text and
indication a hint box there was no
communication in any form or shape to
influence the Indian negotiating team
and it was not me alone there were seven
of us so if there is no interference and
he says and that is the ultimate truth
then I think what's the problem in
believing in a budget what's the problem
in really
well the problem and believing it is
that Rahu is acting like a man-child he
got caught out on his first light and
now he goes on concocting new lies and
planting information to cover up the
initial life isn't it a leaf or even
tedious it's getting very boring and
tedious because here's the thing if
you're accusing him of giving if you're
accusing this government of giving
30,000 crores in deals to Anil Ambani
why did the UPA to give a hundred
thousand crores worth of defend and some
of it defense contracts also to an
alumni this is an issue under the UPA to
then US ambassador Tim Roma went and
visited Hal and he said this is an
obsolete hundred thousand concocted fact
various design you may have you graduate
you need to doubt guarded a sort of
problem but I just don't tell line on
this one second once again
one minute I want to tell you this
thousand Kirwan hi I wonder you bye-bye
you cartoon I want I want to say
something tonight I want to say
something tonight and I want to say that
a Brigitte is right and you dr. Farouk
dead right wrong Tim Roma have the
article went in February 2011 you
silence please went to spoken over on to
silence please silence please when facts
are spoken about following statements
like yours you silence Tim Roma say meet
Tim Roma says is Raheem robust says Tim
drama said Tim Roma said the following
words the potential for hell to
successfully partner with US firms on a
truly advanced aircraft remains suspect
this is what he wrote and he was happy
[Music]
thank you for your solution
yes oh my god I asked you this I asked
you the TV
now now I'm saying this I think there
needs to be an investigation I think
there needs to be an investigation irony
is that this is what mr. Rahul Gandhi
wants to do create a false perception
mr. Rahul Gandhi is trying to create and
flow to false narrative we in fact after
the Supreme Court judgement why do we
need to answer every question the
Supreme Court categorically said there
is no commercial favoritism the name of
Reliance company was taken the Supreme
Court concluded are we higher justices
than the Supreme Court for God's sake
try to understand liar Gandhi statement
the liar Gandhi and the bail family has
no other issue on which they can allege
Modi they have no other issue they have
no allegations against this government
that's the reason as to why they're
trying to manufacture issues that's the
reason as to why they're trying to make
one would have forests conferences
national potluck Oh his kindergarten
student got there he does know at least
he does not even have he does not even
have the committed dead body for my
friends beyond praise
he's the joint Socrates the one who is
initiated this note who he signed the
note and his sign he has very clearly
you read that what who's our buddy and I
have my God he's like bunny over here
you say no no no somebody does not delay
or something just listen it is mr. mr.
Sastri mr. Sastri why show half the
paper when the complete paper was
available by simply showing complete
paper why did you hide while mr. Ogami
conveniently only shows the letter Y
direction is the para que si at this not
we are all are English people is not
what is written submitted for approval
immediately sign you know
[Music]
in the look at the Congress party today
look at mr. mr. mr. Sastri just a few
seconds and then you can rebut me back I
asked you bees mr. Sastri
can you please allow me a few seconds
I'm answering you give no eye signals I
think I think I think a point is the
point is the known at the point is the
point is the point is you know it has
been said that Modi negotiated the rough
I'll deal on pricing today defense
secretary G Mohan viewers whose noting
is part of the document which is being
paraded by Rahul Gandhi says my dissent
had nothing to do with Anil Ambani is
being projected so no matter how many
lies to weave in the it won't work just
a minute just a bit I want to also say
today that Rahul Gandhi knows the one
person who can rip him apart under a
file is yours truly I have more facts
with me Raoul has been running away from
me for four years now
the courage and face me once
unedited interview broadcast on both
Republic pirate and the Republic Media
Network one observation from you one
from me non-stop unedited will be
carried till then I do need to
understand where is the proof of a quid
pro quo you Greg early asleep put out
press statements that mr. data and and
which is very serious where he said what
was the quid pro quo for Modi to
compromise India's interest by waving of
the sovereign guarantee now back to that
is what narrative about the quid pro quo
is Rahul Gandhi propagating when then
defense secretary Jiwon says you can't
take an x-up and blow it out of context
fact number two there is a letter
written to the prime minister from the
then Prime Minister of France Manuel
Valls
dated December 2016 that talks of how
the French Republic is fully committed
in doing whatever is necessary to make
sure that industrialists of salt
aviation and MBDA France each in their
own respect to their utmost to fully
rest their obligations it is clear that
without a sovereign guarantee to they're
100% committed commitment to the deal
Rahul may not have the depth to
understand these serious matters do you
want to pick up for a debate Faruk or a
sovereign guarantee kohu do you pick up
for a debate paru chorus boy be a boy be
okay so I pick recovering guarantee
costs money it adds to the cost of the
deal but signing this is an
intergovernmental agreement which
basically imposes sovereign guarantees
on the French government correct without
costs does not so you read this is a
cost-saving measure I'm sorry I have you
on the phone I didn't know she was
waiting for so long one of India's most
celebrated investigative journalists and
a senior editorial advisor to Republic
Chitra tell me what on earth is going on
you've been an investigative journalist
have you seen anything of the kind that
happened
hi AdMob and everybody thank you for us
no I find this hallucinating but
actually I'm not surprised because if
you are influenced by the king of ball
bearings of muradabad
from muradabad and you know this metal
metal metal handicrafts people from
muradabad you would think it's the same
thing as Raphael right so no I'm not
surprised I just think that's a whole
Gandhi night let's not have any
disrespect to those who are in the
methods business and more otherwise we
have all the respect for them but I
think what you essentially are the 42mm
is mr. Vadra mr. Bartlett represents
nobody from anywhere I can assure you he
only represents himself I do not wish to
and I do not wish to disrespect the
metal metal industry in muradabad
but if you think that from there you can
talk about I think it's just
disrespectful not just of the entire
Indian system you know people have
worked these deals take time people have
worked very hard and for months and
years on end to get the best deal for
India and now to just knock it off
without evidence and if there is if
journalists feel that there is something
that's not quite right put your money
where your mouth is go and investigate
get the confirming get the final
documentary evidence that shows that
you're right what I find extremely
disturbing is that you you use
information in rips and bits hoping that
something will stick somewhere that is
not investigative journalism that's
blackmail
yeah yeah yeah you know you know Chitra
this is this is extremely worrying and
and and at this stage I want to ask with
you listening on
I heard a whiff of a rumor today and
this is nothing to do with you're not a
politician I'm hearing the horrifying
thought we are hearing the potentially
horrifying news that mr. Gandhi will
again tomorrow morning he will go with
another press conference have a calm
debate what she tries speaking some with
the gentleman who shouting about defense
notes has he read the entire entire case
law of defense notes you know what are
you talking about one note here and one
know things this is done I mean I you do
you really understand what you're
talking about or you just want to appear
just using apologize I'm not saying
anything today based on this note that
bill defense minister of this nation has
given a plane that it flora all you're
celebrating that this is the shallowness
of your situation
I'm not into happiness is that
neoclassical
reply no no I have not I want to ask
some big patre about the J's note
because that is very I think I just I
just want to sum it wants to respond to
minutes on the debate yes please yes
please yes blue yes only shouting so
much to understand as to what exactly he
wants to know I understand and see as
far as this whole case is concerned I
firmly believe and I have been repeating
that from the very beginning that the
highest court of this country has heard
the case on all the counts on which
apprehensions were laid and thereafter
the court came out and said that no
roving investigation is required I don't
see any reason as to why any one of us
should be feeling that we are higher
than the justices and be shouting on a
news channel secondly an extremely
importantly a very important point mr.
Goswami by you there as far as mr. mr.
toddler is concerned lies after lies and
lies have been exposed you know in
subsequent days we had seen that he was
lying about the French president he lied
on the floor of the Parliament and
thereafter the French president's office
replied that what mr. Rahul Gandhi was
saying was wrong thereafter he lied
about Holland that was also wrong he
lied about the saw the de saucy or came
out and gave an interview and mr. Raul's
lie was caught and yet again he was
lying about a half-baked article the
article which did not really come out
with in fact remember half-truths are
sometimes dangerous lies no one gives me
no I this map my last question
appreciation a lot may be shouting at
the top of his voice it does not mean
anything to us a lot of appreciation I
must say today coming in for Air Marshal
retired SBP Sinha former Deputy Chief of
Air Staff and head of the Raphael
negotiation team many people have
appreciated that you've come on live TV
programme emotional sauna it is unusual
for a man five weeks back in uniform to
throw himself into the middle of the
most raging political controversy
you could have responded to me today by
saying I do not want to come to your
studio I want to stay away from it what
made you come here today first of all I
have a conscious and having been in the
thick of this negotiations and knowing
all the facts my job is to present the
facts to the nation one you are aware
this that the political class will not
spare you either where your way that you
are throwing yourself and that's why I
think you must be respect you're
throwing yourself into the middle of a
political cauldron and that's why as I I
am a trained fighter pilot and all my
life I never bothered about whether I
live or not so it does not matter what
happens my job is to state the truth in
front of the nation and what I'm
speaking is is for the good of the
nation and it does not scare me who
thinks what about what I'm saying
because this is absolute truth the other
reason why I decided to come is because
I saw on the watts of media some
messages to the air warriors that you
are being cheated cheated in this nation
by some people I have served in the
earth for thirty nine and a half years
yes and dirty of the Air Force is aware
of my credibility and professionalism

Air Force that please continue to have

hero sorry for that in a way they were
celebrating the attack on our palate I

else in the world
do these people come together to
celebrate the execution I would
celebrate the execution of the
terrorists where else in the world would
they come together to celebrate the
terrorists they've been celebrating
absolute on my soil
I find it be intolerable they will
divide it into why do they do it they do
I do they do it because after 1990 I
know the left around the world has
become them what I call the Sharia
Bolsheviks they have nothing to do with
the economy they have nothing to do with
abandoning and fighting poverty
uplifting people this entire discourse
of the cpi-m the ultra and the trade
union movement has been said only to
destroy the only alive civilization
ancient civilization on earth free

significance of the mayor of our ad
campaign
nology 9th February symbolizes toxic
cocktail of urban Islamists and urban
next slides urban leftist who are out in
the campaign to click-to-play India and
you talk about mAb were mostly talking
about your campaign she was mollycoddle
but the daily news channels you know
what used to be the discourse on those
channels
it wasn't about whether India should
compromise on Kashmir Pakistan it was
how much India could be goaded to
compromise on Kashmir and Pakistan now
this is the research in India this is
such an Indian media countering that
this sounds hard that's what people say
to us God is not sedition is not part of
diversity you're talking about by nation
by nation nation for listen get over it
this is not a piece of real estate that
you would like to divide between nations
but as will the communist ideology you
support it ug lavinia your poles move it

Emily its full 2015 letter reveals the
Rahu's rough elided congress parade of
crop to report to push a narrative
opposition latches on to a sliced and
diced notes just to attack Modi
government under file
former defense secretary and the man who
headed to the file negotiation slams
Rahul Gandhi falls out his life
so once again Rahul guy Rahul Gandhi's
lie Andhra file has been caught dead
Rahul Gandhi actually tried to set a
false narrative and push a fake news
agenda once again on the roof I'll deal
only and only the target Modi government
by stating that in 2015 it was PMO which
was trying to strike a parallel
negotiations with the French government
specifically on refil claiming a certain
media report and conveniently
conveniently omitting the most crucial
noting by the then Raksha mantra Manohar
Parrikar we questioned why in the
burning question tonight your channel
Republic TV has accessed this fulham
only document of 2015 which explains yes
Rahul Gandhi's credibility has taken a
final beating by lying has Rahul
credibility being smashed because
remember we told you how envira will
Gandhi conveniently omitted Manohar
Parrikar's noting in that mot note
in the morning question also as we
debate the false defile rhetoric by
Congress party how many lies and how
many abuses will now continue rolling
out from Rahul Gandhi and the Congress
party and with that we also ask Congress
and Rahul to explain in the burning
question tonight we ask why did Rahul
actually concealed manohar particles
signature and important noting in that
very very crucial emery document of 2015
and why what Rahul apologized for riding
on half-truths should Rahul Gandhi not
actually apologize now don't you think
it's high time for Rahul to apologize
for riding on half-truths which means
that Rahul actually lied and if he did
why did he lie he says that this is the
important portion he says the context
between our two governments define in
particular the terms of the
intergovernmental agreement
intergovernmental agreement which is
determined to our mutual satisfaction
the framework and modalities of our
respective commitments it's agreed
between our negotiating teams he says as
agreed between the negotiating teams
point number one the negotiators had
come to an agreement and this is one of
the biggest points that you know we need
to highlight because the opposition's
claimed opposition claim is that the
negotiators or at least some of them had
not agreed with this deal negotiators
came to an agreement and I think this is
one big news point and this is what we
need to highlight remember around
Gandhi's entire premise of the document
a half document that he showed claimed
that some negotiators or some officers
were not happy as agreed this letter
goes on to show that is agreed between
our negotiating teams and then between
our two defense ministers so remember he
said Parrikar was not on board Parrikar
was also on board and this was being
communicated by the French Prime
Minister Parrikar was on board and he
had no questions about this deal and
then he goes on to of course say and
that as far as the Government of India
is concerned will be required to make
down payments before the delivery of the
aircraft's and associated armaments I
hereby confirm that the government of
the French Republic is fully committed
in doing whatever is necessary to make
sure that industrialists Dassault
Aviation and MPD a France each in their
own respect do the utmost to fully
respect any of their obligations in
accordance with aforesaid
intergovernmental agreement and our next
supply protocols the guarantee is your
the guarantees your that they will take
complete measures to ensure that the
French French you know industrialists
pay back the government of India to make
sure that the pair payments or
reimbursements will be made at the
earliest and this was a letter written
to the Prime Minister
so while Rahul Gandhi not actually make
a mention a clear-cut mention of Manohar
Parrikar the den Raksha Montrese noting
serve a crucial noting in that
particular newspaper remember that
portion has been conveniently omitted
tow-in Sinha joining us on the show
tonight BJP leader from Mumbai we also
have professor Sanjeev Tiwari RSS
analyst in our daily studio Ashutosh
Mishra joining us as a political analyst
who will try his best today again Asha
dodgy to defend what Rahul Gandhi did
today it's going to be difficult for you
because we at Republic TV have full
access to that a Modi copy and also we
have Mehmood watch on the show joining
us tonight
mammoth I think you want to open the
debate but before that I want to tell
our viewers remember today Raksha mantri
dismissed Rahul every each and every
charge befittingly she in fact quoting
her she says her newspaper published a
file noting written by different
secretary if a newspaper publishes in
noting then the ethics of the journalism
will demand that the newspaper published
the then different missile defense
ministers reply as well and that's
that's exactly the crux of the matter
let's open the debater Sanjeev Tiwari
you start and we can have Asha Tosh and
then we go to other panelists as well
why did Rahul Gandhi not simply make a
mention to the omitted portion either he
was not aware of it and if at all he was
not really aware of it
that means the much of the raw file
controversy is manufactured by certain
political parties for their own vested
interests trying to make the fool to the
entire country the way that the way the
way he is basically lying and the way
he's repeating again and again because
his raffle is raffle what you called
vehicle is already punctured by the
Supreme Court in the judgement on the
14th of December 19 2018 when the
decision that when when the train when
the three issues were addressed there
was no question there was Green
processor there was no it's not any if
there was clean cheat on the pricing of
there was the prime minister what he has
been asking you why did Rahul Gandhi
code that half note and half note nobody
knew about it unless it came you know on
the public domain when we Republic TVs
reruns on our editor you know we explain
to our viewers what was omitted and why
was it omitted that's the simple
question you don't have to be the
sharpest reported or surplus this
questions not why was that portion of
Manohar Parrikar omitted that media let
me answer now my questions being asked
to be why did rawa meet you you are
asking me a question who choose to hide
did he choose to hide yes mammoth
burrata it's an act of professional
fraud no no see prove it now allow me to
say fraud that is the first kind of just
the fact is one-sided John the fact fact
is no let me answer but the biggest
fraud in our countries our prime
minister so don't talk about frauds and
he is answerable to all these okay you
said about one aspect behavioral aspect
I am saying how can you say no no you
also behave yourself I have reasons to
say fraud but I'm saying this now you
you know you better focus on would
rather than yesterday because you could
not say that with only knees
everything you blame Prime Minister you
haven't asked are you haven't answered
my very simple question very very simple
question even a journalism student in
the country
[Applause]
is the cover-up is by the government
which is trying for a paper by weight
despite being just plain first of all
first of all despite being explained a
thousand times what is the meaning of
and says this is one of the biggest
[Applause]
omote note and I would mood Parata to
comment if you want to have a shikaka
but when you are not specific mention of
the explained para five appears to be an
overreaction
defense secretary may resolve the issue
in consultation with the principal
secretary to the Prime Minister
Manohar particles noting on 11th of
January 2016
why was this not discussed why did Rahul
Gandhi not talk about this now explained
now it's an active professional frozen
explains there are room fools of
document rooms see again he will not let
me if he talks about I will again say so
don't ask him - how do you know what I'm
saying is what I am saying is this is
one document there are loads and loads
of document room full of documents which
will expose the range of all these odds
3/4 of the docusate tape one goes away
at mr. Anil Ambani Anil Ambani
has been put up as a prime minister to
siphon off that is the be talking about
we we spoke to G Mohan Kumar was the
former defense secretary and
particularly on this entire Ambani issue
he has told her at attorney Ranjan that
witnesses remarks of Arnold Ambani angle
is complete Buncombe you please go back
I'm asking you I'm asking you yesican
what is that my temperature is there you
have a list of 7000 ox-head partners
have you studied what are the amounts
each one of them has once again we can
respond to that convenient
what is happening the sole CEO has
already in fact given an interview to
one of the agencies from the government
when it comes to it was
was flashing that that means paper
report like that he could have gone to
the next page also when we have an
overpass noting we coming back to that
simple question
I opened the debate with that question
is none of you has a question as we wrap
up this one person handing that and that
is enough this whole county is that a
file I on this note has been nailed do
you think that's going to take a big
beating as far as the Congress
president's credibility is considered we
take a short breather here I thank all
my panelists for joining us tonight when
viewers remember our editor-in-chief
Arnab Goswami will be debating on this
very big topic at 9:00 tonight
Rahul's life coach that continues to be
a hashtag a short break here we'll be
back
so the big question tonight we asked as
it has Rahul Gandhi its credibility
being completely vacant of beating
remember we are talking about lies after
lie
remember he said Prime Minister Modi
changed the deal he negotiated the deal
he also talked about heard assault force
was forced to pick reliance whereas
dassault has actually refuted those
allegations
Prime Minister Modi gifted 30,000 karate
on an Ambani line number tree another
lie from Rahul Gandhi did the price of
aircraft shot up to sixteen hundred
could roll remember after that more
coming on refine rhetoric where Prime
Minister has announced the deal
unilaterally also Rahul Gandhi has been
repeatedly trying to push the fake news
agenda under file saying that the
Cabinet Committee on security did not
clear the file deal and also the soul
was forced to pick reliance which to the
soul has completely refuted these
allegations as the well in an Air Force
chief suppressed facts this is also what
according to Rahul Gandhi transpired way
back in 2011-12 and government ignored h
IL faut etre file lie another life from
Rahul Gandhi that UPA's row file deal
was cheaper as compared to bjp-led NDA
refil deal and also continuing with the
series of these lies specially to trying
to set a new rhetoric Andhra file
tonight we ask after Rahul Sood a file
note lie has been caught blatantly do
you think Rahul Gandhi's credibility
stands completely smashed debating

[Music]
with an army chief now a minister in the
Narendra Modi government general vijay
singh is accused of plotting a coup by
moving agra based 50 para Brigade to
Delhi
eighty-two months later another news
report has countered that story calling
it a UPA conspiracy this has appeared in
the Sunday edition of sunday Guardian
newspaper which headlines the story
UPA two top leaders wanted coup attempt
by army prude this was that there was
not there was no attempt at all this was
all a manufactured coup the then defense
minister is caught on the backfoot
defense ministers of India at that time
I had given answers in the Lok Sabha and
I shall read them detail until you get
the answer and the BJP has fired five
questions to the Congress what was the
motive for plotting a fake story about
the army coup who were the ministers
involved in spreading lies and defaming
the army was Rahul Gandhi the brains
behind this dangerous conspiracy was
there any consultation was there any
attempt by the ISI to defame the Indian
Army seven years later this report has
raised questions for the Congress did
they malign the Army for political gains
let's debate
[Music]
ladies and gentlemen seven years after
the theory of a coup of the army by the
army was peddled seven years after the
Congress said that the terrible army was
trying to do a takeover in this country
it now appears according to this report
that this was a false of false couturier
a fake story now should the claim that a
fake coup was orchestrated by Congress
ministers of overwhelming seniority be
true it raises many more serious
questions question number one and on
this our debate starts this evening John
Dayal and GVL will start the debate did
the Congress ministers to avoid the
pressure and the questions on corruption
allow the stability of the country and
the morale of the Indian Army to be put
at risk and spread the fake news that
the army wanted to carry out a coup
against an ineffective corrupt
dismembered credibility les Manmohan
Singh government you are facing problems
the people of the country were against
you but which top Congress Minister or
ministers what advising Manmohan Singh
to push this fake coup story you know
sometimes you don't realize the
consequences of what you do you
essentially are telling the country that
the army is in disciplined that the Army
is power-hungry that there is no
difference between the army of India and
the army of Pakistan you are beasts
marching the army and you were knowing
that it's a lie but you just kept
spreading the lie you are basically
trying to tarnish the image the image of
the Indian army that is the sad part of
this you know you can't handle your
corruption so you basically try try to
create a fake story
is true who could have done something as
dangerous as this I want to begin the
debate basking gvl and John to debate
one after the other either of them first
and tonight viewers we must listen to
every word and also understand the
consequences of this entire episode
because if you are beginning to say that
the army of this country is disloyal to
the nation the army of this country is
disloyal to the Constitution then you
must be taken to task now which one of
you wants to start first either of you
either of you can stop or not yeah let
me start this or now you see even in
2012 when these stories appeared in the
media no one in the country believed
although prominent publications carried
the story because everyone has respect
for this institution called army and our
army has the credibility and
undisciplined and therefore certainly
there was a subversive attempt by senior
ministers in the government to somehow
switch the image of the army and to
bring it on par with Pakistani army
which is known to be a rogue army I
think I want to understand this cannot
this could this could not be purely a
political conspiracy to me it seems like
a conspiracy against the army itself to
lower their morale and to damage the
reputation of the army both in India and
also internationally and therefore it is
not just any other fake story but
something that is really subversive at
the very roots of it so certainly
therefore this is the matter that the
complete facts about this particular
episode must come in public domain and
therefore we have sought a meeting with
the did the defense minimal defense
minister we will also try to discuss
this in a defence committee because I
think the complete facts about this
particular episode not just as a media
report or but they should come out in
the form of a public report which the
country can really rely upon and
we can avoid such incidents in future
because this is actually a grave danger
to our national security without a doubt
it is now now John I know you hate the
army but still think about it why would
you say Oracle II that they cannot have
a why would they Indian Army
one second one second one second one
second we are talking about the Indian
army no no no no no what second we're
talking about the indian army right god
of general you are basically said that
the indian army wants to take over the
country yes and you publish this and
then you have spread the lie and
ministers are reacting to it this is the
government is going to be functioning
the government wants a function like
that on the basis of a fictitious glory
will give me a professorship in their
thoughts you give me the throne even
this bro if you tell me the proof I no
no the BJP spokesperson is saying you
know this time the committee is then
where is their brain show me the
evidence this is show me the evidence
way to be functioning
all right so many years have passed show
me the evidence The Comedians ovation of
evidence bogus report you owe me a shred
of evidence that there was going to be a
coup show me one which is roaming gia
Bakshi GD Bakshi sensi questions we
should also ask you show me the proof
show me the proof you said mom is
[Applause]
line of trying to link the forces of the
Union
gonna be double finished sir how can you
say that for five well why did the
difference I hear laughs I think avenge
of the Union yes dealers who are astray
casting you are a bunch of severe loss
treasure that is what you are that is
what you are will the Army is decides
will be the media we used to hang them
out wider than have barred the copy
election you can say we chief joshi this
country have you heard the way he was
hounded out because he was very
convenient he wasn't playing ball with
young Robbie BUP so you build
applications in the media of accidents
in the naming today he resigns all those
reports of accidents in the name on top
you must speak it was very very
suspicious
you had no point to give speeches was
just yelling to know have dropped why
engine off substrate if so okay now
you'll be UDK signal why I like to come
in for a minute you as one minute well
made one but one way to make one with
one the debate is also on in the studios
one minute one just a minute just a
minute just have John they all John the
Allison wait wait John there wait wait
John wait wait general general general
Tsin eyes within the studio and so is
jog dial now I wish to with 50 seems to
say something I have had many
disagreements in his vacationing we are
having a debate I have had many
disagreements with VK Singh I've
questioned him and taken him on at one
time he used the word prostitute to
describe me I have fought him then and
I'm willing to fight him now bar fact of
the matter is you can't say
that he was involved in a coup that's a
very very very serious allegation one
minute one year in 2012-2013 press
articles claiming that an army coup is
going to happen in India came to light
let's deal with this very strongly
please don't speak over me and and now
there is a counter that debunks the army
code theory and raises certain very
serious questions about what was going
on the top leadership of UPA - was
allegedly involved in the last few
months of 2011 and 2012 to lobby hard to
establish that the army and the denim
ETV casing was part of a fictional coup
and therefore the Congress party must
now either furnish evidence or be
answerable for the allegation because
you are telling the whole world that
India's like Pakistan and a political
leadership that vilifies its own loyal
hard-working intensely United and
unquestionably disciplined army he's a
political leadership not worth having
and I am ashamed of such a political
leadership only people like John they
all will see merit in it Arnim and one
last point this was a distraction from
the under movement absolutely desert do
you add to our distraction in the
movement yeah so you spread this line
now yeah show me the proof if they ever
show us the proof now just a sec general
just a sec you asked John Dale directly
no no just give me a minute and half
please like one minute our please
firstly it was a political consequence
here like differencing secondly and
secondly mr. John t al I when you were
speaking I was not speaking please have
the decency after him he was given us a
chance how much for my good I have not
spoken okay are you happy - speaking
speaking you were speaking ok please

are music or none after him is that okay
Jarrah
are not minute and a please
uninterrupted minute laughs let me show
us John not me yeah send some blood
blunt thoughts
firstly let me tell you very
categorically if Indian army wants to
take over no power on this earth can
stop Indian army firstly secondly we are
a political army and I would like to
Quahog when madam Gandhi requested
Jenner Anna
when Babu Jayaprakash Narayan support
Kunti was going on he refused he said we
are a political army madam our roles are
two primary role and secondary role
primary role to defend the border so can
be ruled at 2:30 maintain peace and
order inside the country we are not in
the in the field of governance that is
your problem
governance is perogative a political
system we are not part of the political
system we obey the mandate given to be
given to us by the central government
that's it
so therefore do not play politics with
Indian surveys
no where's the proof secondly most
people give me the position is you
should as well as the proof just I'm
coming to that
Manmohan Singh comment ordered IB
Intelligence Bureau to inquire and I
what IV said zero there is no substance
in the case damn it you're interrogating
your enquiring Authority your your
highest authority in the country to
enquire in such incidents has given a
string chat to gently kissing then how
the hell did you say that coup was wrong
then what is the proof tell me yes I
finished you tell me now general you
don't have to shout I quite agree with
you
the Indian Army is structure no because
in such a manner wisdom does not aim to
down on your ever be know gone dungeon

is a national consensus they went from a
family of Army United army Indian Army
ok if there is if there is a coup there
is a coup if there is a story fake story
that should be established and people
who spread it should be punished I mean
I am saying it in no uncertain terms
that anybody who was manufactured the
story or spread this cherry should be
punished but we can't worry nobody smelt
a coup I don't know how this story in
January 2016 you're dead Minister said
your Congress minister said troops from
aghanim
I don't nonsense you have fig Danny yeah
can you can you bear to hear the problem
the wife of luth said they try and get
to your family
to office please mr. destroy aku did it
we have two brigades of the infantry
solid infantry stationed in Delhi
because we have because we have first of
all first of all that there are GD Baek

you think I want it's an emotional
now I want to make I want to tell you I
want to tell you I want to tell you
something and and I first of all I'm
grateful for all the support that's
coming our way here on Republic today we
rededicate ourselves to the country the
dish our nation and now I want to ask a
simple question you see it was not some
foolish story in January 2016 but then
Congress Minister asked about the April
2012 news report on the Indian army
moving towards rice in a hill said and I
quote Gaurav Arya insofar as that
particular story you're referring to
that time I used to serve in the
Standing Committee of Defense and it is
unfortunate but the story is true in
other words the Congress party said the
army was trying to carry out a coup and
and when the congress spokesperson in
january 2016
supported that coup theory a certain Luo
Tian's journalist responsible for the
story praised him saying what this
Congress leader has said is a bold thing
better late than never
which means a Luo Tian's journalist and
a Congress leader came together to keep
alive a fake story that defames the army
now two years after publishing that fake
report another article came out saying
general aka Chaudhary was director
general military operation January 2012
has confirmed that there was alarm at
the highest levels of the UPA government
in mid January 2012
so you once again tried to pass off the
story as the truth now I want to know
today where is where is show me one
piece of paper god of this way anything
can be peddled as a factory absolutely
and it's being buttered you can say
there is already a court tomorrow yes
you could say that government symbol you
can say we're gonna have military ruling
in god of God of God of God of this is
part of this whole intelligence consists
when it came to tarnish the image of the
army did that I would request I would
request dr. Rao to let us assume we have
any kind
I just want to say something or knob
what what general Judy but she said
makes so much sense two brigades plus
other elements of the army this is the
national capital there are almost 10
thousand officers and Men
why would somebody need to call 2,500
people from Agra
for what reason there are enough people
within here but like general jadeybug
she very rightfully said you know we
have the support we have the trust of
this great nation they know that even if
there are 10 brigades even if there are
three divisions here in in in Delhi
nothing is going to happen because this
army has always kept a distance from
political power it has kept a distance
and this is the reason why this army
needs to be respected the army is an
army which is saying you are saying once
a I've got GBL back GPL you are saying
it's a fake story but the whole country
believed the fake story when the
Congress was in power oh no nobody
believed us you tell it out I mean the
country did not know that was it cool
there was no coup it was a lie over
this was two lines please ask them to
keep watch if we are going like it's a
story that concerns national security
very important points number one in 2012
January this false alarm was raised and
intelligence bureau immediately reported
that this was a false story and then in
April 2012 three months later or four
months later these four stories were
published was there an attempt by the
Congress party why to support Indian
democracy like they didn't change
laughter I just want to tell you this
and the facts speak for themselves and
the questions are all to take in their
side why do you consider abuse and
denigrate the army yes this is a debate
Arnab enough can I kill him a card is a
compliment
yeah go on we could have four minutes
left yeah yeah are now can I please come
in
Arnab a point was made here that there
was no coup that this is a false story
why then was it carried by one of the
leading newspapers of this country and
why then was it vocalized by one of the
leading editors of this country who
appears not only on the print media also
on the elect
Media why was then it parotid by
sections of the Congress by ministers
why after the whole storm had died down
because of the official denials in 2016
was it resuscitated it is war by
innuendo an attempt to defame a very
honorable institution and attempt to
demonize the Indian Armed Forces equate
them with a Cooper own country like
Pakistan
may I please remind you that there are
serious structural differences between
the Indian and the Pakistani army 80% of
the Pakistani army yes have you seen the
fire okay
yeah Indian Army's not capable of
staging a coup are you have you heard
what I say yeah you know what that is
what I'm trying to tell you have a hide
what I said now kindly listen kindly
listen and I've said there are strong
structural differences between the
Indian and the Pakistani army the
Pakistani Navy is got an officer eighty
to ninety percent by Gabby Muslims they
can keep their bloody secrets this army
is a multiracial multi-ethnic it is
loyal to the Republic seventy-two my god
I now want to I just wish to say I just
wish to say that you can't you know you
can't do this you can't do this you know
this Lobby it regularly got of car runs
down the Army's capability it calls them
Liars it refuses to acknowledge their
victories it name calls the army chief
but if it says that the Indian Army is
disloyal to the country then nobody is
going to take that at face value they
are going to give it back see you
tomorrow at 9:00 good night and goodbye

CBI and cooperate with the investigation
is this now more than an observation
hasn't been confirmed that the Supreme
Court wants Rajeev Kumar to cooperate
with the CBI
yes actually in fact what we are getting
in is that the Supreme Court has
officially passed an order they have a
strategy of Kumar to be a part of the
investigation which is of course a
massive massive blow to the mamta
Banerjee government they've also however
gone on to clarify that at this stage
the CBI cannot go ahead and officially
arrest Rajeev Kumar but at the same time
they've made it very clear that Rajeev
Kumar has no option but to cooperate
with the investigation he will now have
to appear before the CBI he will have to
give the details of the entire
investigation and take questions on
exactly why and how the investigation
was compromised upon by the SSAT big
breaking news that's coming in Mumtaz
blocking the CBI but the Supreme Court
giving the go-ahead here for the agency
to continue with the investigation the
Supreme Court has also gone ahead and
issued that contempt notice to Rajeev
Kumar only big breaking news one that
Rajeev Kumar will have to cooperate with
the CBI
and two that the contempt notice has
also been issued yes a condemned the
notice on the contently has been issued
through the sacred the chief secretary
the DGP and rajeev command himself and
they will have to now respond to the
plea made by the CBI asking for the
initiation of contempt proceedings
against the three of them of course
contempt is a larger issue that the
Supreme Court will be looking into but
the fact that a notice has been issued
to them means that prime office either
Supreme Court does find some merit in
the petition for the CBI to come forth
and make this plea before the top coat
of the country now they will wait for
the responses from the chief secretary
from the DGP as well as from Rajeev
Kumar to see whether or not or what they
stand on this entire cases and how they
plan to defend the contempt proceedings
that the supreme court might initiate
we will have to see exactly when the
next date of the hearing is going to be
but the order is still being dictated by
the Chief judges were still getting
details of it as we speak
but of course massive massive setback to
Rajeev Kumar himself as well as to them
of the Banerjee government he's been
clearly asked to cooperate with the CBI
he
has to appear make himself available
before the investigating agency answer
all the questions and now Rajeev Kumar
the chief secretary and the DGP also
have to respond to the CBS contempt
petition and mamta Banerjee who you see
on your screens there who's been all at
her for three days
she's now said let me look into it and
then I will comment she is saying that
she's gonna wait till she gets all the
details of what happened in the Supreme
Court but this undoubtedly
is a huge setback for Mamta Banerjee on
her government
she's gone out on a limb to defend
Rajeev Kumar to claim that CBI is acting
unconstitutionally and whatnot but the
Supreme Court has made it very very
clear that the kolkata top cop that the
Kolkata Police Commissioner will now
have to join the CBI investigation it to
the shara the scam you see those visuals
are of mamta Banerjee also on her phone
walking away and when asked by the media
for her reaction she says very clearly I
have a look into it but for the CBI this
will mean that they can go ahead with
their investigation not just that there
were two Prius in their petition filed
one was also to kick off contempt
proceedings against a Rajeev Kumar and
the Supreme Court has issued a notice
based on that play based on a contempt
plea",True,en,20865,149,577

that happens does that mean that
possibly tomorrow day after is when we
can see the Supreme Court once again the
bench once again assembling to make the
observations clear about that sealed
envelope
[Music]
well that is extremely likely because
today the CBI has filed an affidavit and
they're only seeking permission to file
the sealed cover report they have not
filed the sealed cover report yet if the
supreme court today allows the gamma the
CBI to go ahead and file the sealed
cover report then it is extremely likely
that yes the Supreme Court might again
assemble in the next coming few days to
share this matter once again depending
on the kind of evidence that has been
brought to them by the CBI they had
given the Liberty to the CBI to approach
the court at any time that is
essentially what the CBS acted on
through this affidavit and through the
sealed cover report that they are
looking to file now and this directly
pins the blame on the TMC led by Martha
Banerjee herself whether or not the
political party was trying to protect
the companies that were involved in the
chit fund scam merely because they were
getting campaign funds from these
companies is the bigger question now
it's not just about Rajeev Kumar Rajeev
Kumar of course was only a means to an
end in this entire investigation yes he
compromised on it yes he slowed down the
investigation but the story has become
much bigger than just Rajeev Kumar now
the the finger is being pointed at the
West Bengal government that the West
Bengal government knew about this that
they consciously allowed Rajeev Kumar to
go slow in the case so that these names
do not emerge out through which they
were getting campaign funds and now it
remains to be seen whether Martha
Banerjee will come forth with any
answers on this entire issue as to what
the CBI has claimed before the top coat
they've put it on an affidavit it's not
just or words that they're saying in air
before the bench they've put it on
affidavit that these companies were
involved that these companies have a
direct nexus not only with the TM
but also with the s ID that was
investigating the case and there is a
very good likelihood that Rajeev Kumar
himself was involved in the destruction
of evidence because the fingers of that
are being pointed at the SI t it says
that to protect these companies and to
eventually protect the TMC
there was evidence that was being
destroyed by this same si T that was
investigating if the case which is of
course raising serious serious
aspersions on the entire situation of
law and order in West Bengal as to how
much the Banerjee allows these things to
happen right under her nose and under
her supervision so of course there will
be people from the TMC that will
eventually be roped in in this entire
thing we'll have to wait and see what
happens
in the top word of the country just in a
few minutes from now when all of these
startling facts are brought forth before
the three-judge bench being led by the
CJ himself so the bench is assembled any
moment now we will also be getting the
latest updates from the court from the
Supreme Court this is a three-judge
bench that's currently hearing this
particular case and as we said earlier
Nalini has been putting out details of
exactly what the cbi affidavit of state
very very crucial details being
mentioned by the cbi where they've even
said that because of the kind of
campaign contributions being provided
there were several companies being
shielded that some of the main evidence
in this case was even handed over to the
main accused by the SI t which is of
course headed by Rajeev Kumar that is
some of the kind of evidence some of the
allegations being levelled by the CBI
India affidavit naal any one of the

today when the Home Secretary off United

UK Home Secretary and I'm staying with
this debate the UK Home Secretary Sajid
Javid has after a strong diplomatic
intervention from the Narendra Modi
government he after Narendra Modi
government lobbied hard and worked hard
they have signed the order to extradite
Vijay Mallya to India and the British
Home Office has now said that this
matter has been signed
now Mallya is accused of fraud is
accused of money laundering is accused
of major things and oh these ability to
get back Mallya is truly extraordinary
in this case because as we all know the
British government does not do it to
show it show on show and what more can
you tell us Shawn Shawn Shawn
he certainly has about 14 days to appeal
but what's important to point out what
was important to point out here is that
the UK Home Secretary has taken the
final decision now that's you know the
final step perhaps now we're given to
understand that only the last option
perhaps he has is from starting from
today 14 days to appeal but in all
likelihood given the fact that the court
has always uj6 come to a conclusion and
now this is very executive powers
our conclusion that he should be sent
back clearly means it's there is very
little room now left for Vijay Mallya",True,en,49146,488,1534

they are explaining why exactly mamta
Banerjee stacked on earth now let's put
that out on our screens right now and
first up you have this tweet that says
the democracy and federalism is under
attack the central agencies under the
directions of Prime Minister Narendra
Modi and amatuer are attacking all
institutions of the country and are
destroying the constitution of the
country let the country come together
and save democracy and the federal
structure of the country save India from
Odisha save Constitution from
institutions save federal structure save
democratic institutions save
administration from disaster save forces
from all sections from Modi vendetta
save United India but so far it's very
interesting Shanta shri because this
tweet that has been put up by the All
India Trinamool Congress first line it
says save India from Odisha is that
actually the true intention of the
Trinamool Congress because defeat Modi
that continues to be the ultimate aim
what about saving the Constitution as
they have been claiming so far that is
the single agenda of all the political
parties standing unionists and that they
have to defeat Narendra Modi and Amit
Shah must ahead of the 2009 you boys
this is the ultimate stage that they
have caught and this is the platform
being used by all the political parties
to send out a message quite strong that
they are united and they will be doing
anything and going to any extent in
order to defeat now in the movie just a
head over to the house and I can oppose
so definitely this is an important
message symbolic as well but to send a
cross and the Twitter offer the official
Twitter handle of a ITC has put out that
save the democracy save
shishun as well but ironically so they
are not doing anything in that matter in
order to see the Constitution because it
is unconstitutional to stop the CBI
officials from doing their work it is
unconstitutional to the hound and harass
the CBI officials and put them inside a
vehicle and then to take them to the
nearby police station so these are those
unconstitutional measures that has been
taken under the directions of the
Banerjee but still month of an anon kid
sees that she is she is going to
continue her indefinite strike in order
to save the Constitution or to save the
country so quite a huge irony playing
out over here but this is adding to the
entire political slugfest that was
started a year ago when the purpose all
the opposition parties are actually were
actually hijacking most of the public

coverage post that's a phenomenal budget
speech by Pew oil what a moment for him
and there's not one not two not three
but at least five high points of this
budget let's take that conversation
forward with another industry expert
keiki mr. e vice chairman and CEO HDFC
is joining us now he did talk about you
know certain reforms that have been
initiated in the banking sector PU coil
but overall the focus today has turned
out to be the impetus to future
consumption isn't it with the softs the
tax ops for the consumers how do you
look at that mr. mystery I would say the
budget focuses really on three areas the
first is rural economy which is
reflected in the payment that will be
made to farmers the 6,000 rupees per per
year that will be paid to farmers that
well that will increase consumption in
the rural economy which in the long when
the medium to long term will benefit the
entire economy the second focus of the
area has been on the real estate sector
we are aware that the real estate
markets per se have been a little
sluggish in recent times there is an
inventory pile up of real estate and
this budget will go to occur it to some
extent in trying to improve the
situation for the real estate sector and
the third focus of the budget has been
the consumption the consumption bought
in the rural economy and in the urban
economy will increase as a result of the
budget the rural economy because of
these payment the special payment that
will be made by the government the 75 or
thousand cross that will be allocated
for the whole year and the other is the
urban economy which will benefit by
virtue of the fact that for a common man
the tax exemption limit has been
increased from 250 thousand rupees a
year to five hundred thousand rupees of
yours so with the increase in the tax
exemption limit effectively the amount
of tax that an individual ends up pay
will come down as he pays less less
taxes you will have more income more
money left with him to spend which will
spur economic growth and will also
spurred demand for housing because with
the more
available with him his ability to take a
higher loan will increase because he'll
be able to service the EMI on that loan
right as far as big business big
businesses are concerned there weren't
any big-ticket changes but he did talk
about you know all the structural
changes that the government has done in
over the last two years especially since
the advent of GST as well but do you
believe the government's done enough
really as far as the boost to the small
and medium enterprise is concerned I
think so
Irene the government see we must
recognize that this was not a final
budget this was an interim budget a
final budget can probably get presented
once the elections are over so you have
to take this in the context of the fact
that this was an interim budget and
cannot be expected to take a full
fledged view of the entire economy but
having said that this budget even though
it was an interim budget has really made
a whole range of changes across the
various various sectors of becoming all
right kick in mystery

announce a series of populist measures

could if you were able to curtail mr.
Modi's government to an interim budget
it would not have the requisite

going to be stopped now will this budget
be prop 100 percent I'm sure it's going

to show that it's going to be Pro jobs
will they have to do a thin defined

nation in case you're not getting it my
sincere request to you is please contact
us by our website or contact your cable
operator
we're gonna go allowed to make sure the
child reaches you obviously before I get
into the bullet points of what is
expected from the budget just some you
know a picture of how the economy looks
like how the situation is and of today
when the finance minister picks up that
brown bag yeah
monthly GST revenues have crossed one
lakh crores last month yeah yesterday
there was a development where three
banks have been taken out of the prompt
corrective action mechanism by the RBI
public sector banks which which means
that those three banks are doing fine
now and are out of the ICU GDP growth
numbers sustained at about 7.2 percent
over the last three four quarters Sensex
was up 665 points on the global scene
Dow had reclaimed 225 thousand mark
yesterday with a with a jump of 400 over
400 points the Fed the American Federal
yesterday indicated that there is no
further scope of a rate hike essentially
it reflects on how the Indian economy
would respond respond so essentially the
Finance Minister huge goal in this case
today
what are we headed into were people that
I was coming expecting for people so I
was coming to that yes essentially all
this provides the situation where given
the fiscal discipline that this
government has maintained there is a
scope for opening the goodie bag and as
the catalyst at goodie is going to be
and the cabinet meets for approving the
budget or number at the Parliament House
you can expect that there would be a
farm package we are being told it's
going to be up to about one lakh crore
rupees which can include include a cash
transfer scheme to compensate the
farmers for all the input costs there
are already indications that a template
of telangana right ubuntu scheme or the
Orisha collier scheme could be used for
that
and then there is likelihood of some tax
exemptions for the the pension system
called the NPS service and possible
tweaking of the income tax slab but of
course the big big expectation would be
our nob some kind
of universal basic that is my first
point today on which I go to submit para
and all the other guests of the studio
let's open the debate and the whole
story those are the budget papers which
are being presented to Parliament you
know it's incredible out there and see
those pictures out there each year it
looks exactly the same the budget papers
is the same I suspect the truck which
brings them is the same the bags are the
same I just hope the budget papers are
not the same but in any case even if
they are the same that mr chidambaram
should not be cribbing because he was
the one who gave in more stops in the
pre-election year hypocrisy for the for
the opposition to say don't have a
budget mr chidambaram do you have
something called a memory or not the big
question this morning will the universal
basic income scheme which is a scheme
whereby the government guarantees to
every individual in this country a
minimum income that they can count on to
live a life of basic dignity will that
happen that is the question and that's
what we should throw to some bit pandro
should this be implemented it will be
the biggest and most historic pro-poor
measure by the Modi government and in
order to priam that Rahul Gandhi said
sometime back I'm going to announce a
universal basic income if the Congress
party were to come to power it would be
a revolutionary move but what does it
mean it means that whether or not you
are rich you're poor whether you're
working or not you would receive a fixed
income from the government universal
basic income is the first step towards
taking accountability of the welfare of
the people and providing an amount that
is basic for survival at a time when
joblessness is on the rise there's no
immediate solution to it it is a radical
concept some with that unconditionally
delivers to every individual in this
country of basic salary based on the
individual needs
now I would like to add a caveat here
mr. Modi is not known in the past to
believe in soaps yes he is he's a
delivery man he does not believe in
socks I would be surprised
let me say it openly I would be
surprised if they go for it the BJP they
will do everything short of it in my
view but they will not go for the
universal basic income scheme and I
don't think Rahul Gandhi's saying it is
going
make a difference but you can never say
what do you think open to everyone
good morning it's good it's good to see
all of us laughing and smiling that's a
very good beginning of the budget day
but nonetheless let's come to the most
important issue that you have questioned
me on remember budgets of this country
are all myelin sheath it is not about
one-upmanship it's not about political
rhetoric it is about those are pictures
of purest oil one minute I'll go full
frame to those pictures for a minute
always always as always that's interim
Union Finance Minister EUL with the
briefcase now there is his happy now
fight and now one thing about pure oil a
very very successful Chartered
Accountant investment banker there isn't
a person with a better background to be
doing this today and he will be missing
mr. Arun Jaitley who is recuperating
from his from his recent you know
medical interventions in the United
States of America the country wishes mr.
Arun Jaitley well quick speedy recovery
I am told he's going to be coming back
in a few days which is fantastic news
and he is also huge coils mentor so
those were the pictures mandatory
pictures go back to the debate is the
ubi going to be announced universal
basic income scheme go ahead somewhere
yeah or no what I was saying was look it
is not about one-upmanship or rhetoric
s-- budget is all about prudence and
remember as far as basic income is
concerned Universal income is concerned
the basic economic understanding that
needs to be put into the ground over
here is
in the fiscal deficit will the inflation
will the prudence stand by it so I
firmly believe that I am NOT the brown
suitcase who knows as to what is
contained within it that only mr. Pooh's
Goyal knows and within a few minutes
from now we would probably be hearing
from him but the most important issue is
for God's sake let's not politicize
something where prudence is essential
second extremely importantly as far as
this budget is concerned I firmly
believe let me steal a few words from
what mr. Pranab Mukherjee the den
finance minister in 2008 and 9 while
presenting quote/unquote Wharton
accounted extraordinary situations and
extraordinary measures so to say that
this is just an interim budget step into
a field the government should not hire
anyone from the barrio
because it would be knowing as much as
you or anyone on this panel know but
since this is a debate we are all making
a point I firmly believe that as far as
the push on the agricultural sector is
talked about I was hearing you before I
joined in you are talking about the push
Rabi shake was also talking about pushed
into the well yes if the need be always
it has been a priority we will move
ahead with that you have your own
talking about
cycle sir said sir don't sound like a
rattled cycle today's about your Lotus
so you don't worry about my cycles are
you worried about your decaying low
delicate tea which the people will pluck
and prevail very soon in 2019 okay so
let me come just just few days left sir
okay can smell your bio it says it is
they came so you can you can begin
smelling of corruption so it's not about
Lotus sir let me complete sir yes sir
short circuit ticket mr. Goswami look as
far as mr. Modi is concerned he has
consistently said about one thing he had
right from the first day he had said
that look mindless needless populism
need not be pragmatism need not be the
takeaway of any budget he has followed
that till today and I firmly believed
that mr. Modi who has always believed in
mantra of reform perform and transformed
had really reformed and transformed the
economy of this country and I believe
that that would be the mark that we are
going to see in today's budget
presentation okay some beta FS and some
bit and pheasant you don't so I think I
think I would I would like to introduce
also at this stage let's get a
perspective from Mumbai taking a taking
a very close watch on what's happening
is my friend RJ Berger executive
chairman of OPC acid solutions and oh
they have a the partner of K nav
Chartered Accountants is Mumbai nervous
Ajay first to you is Mumbai nervous in a
pre-election budget
Mumbai is always a little edgy in a
pre-election budget how is it this time
well under bits got discounted in
already and yesterday we saw a very good
move up in the markets and we saw three
thousand corrodes coming into the market
from foreign investors yesterday which
was a vote of confidence to some extent
so what the market is really looking for
is where does the fiscal deficit number
come I personally think it's a non-event
it will come very much within
expectations the three big expectations
are one farm package
for relief package which will be very
positive for consumption and our Navarre
economy really runs on consumption 65%
of our GDP is by private consumption
expenditure so any money
that is put into that gets a multiplier
so it will be very positive for the
economy the second big thing will be
some relief for the small trader the
small SME we expect some packages to
come they're already mudra is doing a
excellent work there a lot of money has
gone into that part of the economy and
third will be some relief to the middle
class was really stood by the government
who are a very compliant in paying their
taxes we are expecting an increase in
the exemption limit for the taxes so
these are the three big takes from the
budget or not but overall if I expect
you which address a lot of the if I hear
you RJ you you sound so so reassuring
here for a lot of people because the
sense one gets in Delhi is sometimes
always hyperbolic before an election or
mr. Modi is going to do in the final
finance the fiscal deficit or the fiscal
is going to go for a toss oh it's going
to go for five percent it's the end of
the world kind of situation but what I
hear is very practical logic that's
coming in from RJ where he says we are a
consumption-driven economy and a big
farm package is going to benefit
consumption and benefit the country
there are no end-of-the-world scenarios
RJ please stay on I'd like to also
welcome Sanjay Mehta who's from the
Indian merchants chamber the deputy
director-general of the Indian Muslim
Chamber but before that to you who there
who they what can we expect in terms of
tax concessions on the taxation front on
the personal income front what should we
expect
how will this affect inflows for the
people of this country
oh there thanks no no clearly this is
not a word on account as I think immune
occasions are very clear it's an interim
budget and so it could certainly if
that's the case
that would be taxation proposals as we
call it in a Part B of the budget speech
I think in order to make it more for the
common man Kay would be whether the
exemption limit would be raised from 2.5
l x2 maybe all the way up to 5 lakhs
personally I feel five legs I think is a
high limit here is a is a case where the
government wants to increase the tax
base so you generally don't want people
to go out of the tax net
having said that the Finance Minister
did it very smartly two years back when
for the 2.5 left to 5 lakhs the tax rate
was reduced from 10 to 5 percent okay
that gave a lot of relief and if you
look at the ATC limit of insurance
premium and Provident Fund etc 2.5 lakh
anyway goes to 4 lakhs plus you have a
standard deduction for the employees it
goes to 4.4 lakhs
so I think the other than increasing the
exemption may be a good thing in my view
would be to raise the standard deduction
from forty thousand to one lakh I mean
that really will help the salaried class
people that is one and certainly to pile
a claim it can go to 3 lakhs 3.5 lengths
that could add more money to the common
man and that will come in the way of
bringing more money into the economy by
higher spending so I think that's on the
individual front I know any changes on
the higher income bracket and you think
so just by a percent reduction but there
I I would I would say this time yes I
would say this time or there yes that
that of course you're the expert but
knowing the political scenario in the
country I expect I would expect a five
lakh tax exemption limit to be very very
practically you know implementable for
the government right now not that
anything we know anything below 5 lakhs
will not reduce I have no difficulty is
a problem you know I want and I want
what I just asked at one point what I
don't Jaitley in his last budget speech
said that there are only 76 lat
taxpayers above 5 lakhs and what this
government is taking credit that we've
really increased the tax payers from 3.5
groats to 6 crores if you
to fire you next yes no I just want to
bring in a very practical issue here any
changes in the income tax lab requires
an amendment to the income tax no please
or not if they can alter it's not a full
budget is a full they have listed it as
an interim budget the last an estate in
Parliament on the agenda as interim
beliefs cannot be objected to by any
political to each other
no I exist in the studio what do you
think it can without a chance be
practical without being partisan let's
be practical it is the last budget
before the elections of course there are
going to be some shops for those who
stood by our party and by our government
more the government than the party right
and there is a cacophony of voices which
wants to bring mr. Modi down and he will
see to it that the budget in such a way
meets the needs of the people who needed
the most as well as the people who have
stood by the BJP government and have
helped us to come so far in the last
five years well I mean you know I'm
being very frank and very to do
something on the eve of a 90.5 and five
lakh between 2.5 and 5 like let's not be
penny wise pound
seconds please mr. Goswami short point I
remember there's a convention that
requires and a men are we just a second
to a law exactly don't hound me like I
had mr. Saur t hear me Artie please
Artie remember there is a difference
between convention and a constitutional
rule or a law as far as interim budget
thank you
as far as con as far as vote on account
or an interim budget is concerned that
is a convention that is not a
constitutional law because remember in
1948 when the first budget was presented
I mean the interim budget so-called
budget when the government was outgoing
was presented it was if I'm remembering
right Lee it was our case and mu gamma
XI T the first Finance Minister he said
that well yes let this be the convention
the convention has been broken on T
number of times Pranab Mukherjee when he
extended the ambit of the fiscal deficit
is a huge from two point five to six
point five that was also an interim
budget we had seen tax labs tax Karthik
sack lobbying changed during interim
so-called budgets to say that there has
to be an executive order for the same is
our wrong understanding of a convention
versus a constitutionally laid down rule
yes yes you know I I also want to tell
you by the way viewers President incomes
lab is what between 2.5 and 5 lakh that
at 5% between 5 and 10 lakh you attract
income tax of 10% right now this is the
middle class and I think if there is any
any benefit given to the middle class of
the country even Aarti Jarrett will
eventually benefit from it and even
she'll be cheering for spread the good
cheer good point
making a political point Sanjay Mehta so
jameth of the Indian merchants
and then there's no debate I have never
made up my mind and the most open-minded
person here would find on Indian
television or today
well I'm Sanjay Mehta submits an
giametta to give his views on what is
the what is the last and final budget
you know of Modi government yes please
Sanjay yeah money under morning all my
panelists yes I firstly I agree with mr.
Sandeep Patra that this is just a
convention and not the constitutional
law and nothing stops the government to
present a budget that is as area as a
full budget and as far as this budget is
yeah and as far as this budget is
concerned the expectations are very much
there for increase in the limit of
personal tax not to the to look for a to
do like a 2.5 to 5 lakhs but at least
somewhere so some figure which is which
will bring tears and benefit to the
middle class which is due for a very
long time and another expectation from
business community here is is a
reduction in a corporate tax if you
remember mr. Arun Jaitley in his first
budget has mentioned that the corporate
tax would he will gradually bring down
to 25 percent so that is where the eyes
of the business community is on this
project i I also I just I just managed
to pull out a fantastic document please
look at this and all everyone will be
very interested to this with this bit of
information especially you face on and
RJ Berger and Ravi Shrivastav Abdul
Razak look at this this is the interim
budget of 2014-15 presented by His
Excellency P Chidambaram the first line
of P Chidambaram B Chidambaram's interim
budget is its P Chidambaram
I found he says as I prepare to write
the speech first line first line of the
budget sunni chopra as i prepare to
write the speech I found that whether it
is a Dilla budget for the folia or an
interim budget
this is price st Ambrym paid this is
Chidambaram in the interim budget of
2014 Sony Chopra
he says interim budget of full budget we
are not affected by what happens in the
rest of the world happened after 20 fold
all these exchanges happened after 2014
remember that remember the quick crash
course you are giving me in Indian
politics is not necessary though York do
you older and more handsome than me the
question is right now this not that I
need to tell you that budgetary
regulation is right about it being very
smart
no one is contesting that what I am
simply telling you is that Chidambaram's
budget speech in 2014 through the full
budget versus interim budget theory out
of the window that's the point I'm
making debate that with me really debate
that with millions have everyone debate
that with me go on he paid the price
no there's no surprises
the common man has already pay the price
Russia the common man paid ninety two
two people the person loves after being
defeated in four nights they think about
final good morning they be taught to
anything for the former are not the
viewers the Republic TV viewers know
that Narendra Modi is going to come back
and take it forward this is going to be
a great morning for us the budget we
want with a new budget which is going to
come
[Music]
[Applause]
let me go let me go let me go and let me
expose the opposition on this completely
as I go into the break my one question
of didn't you stand for this budget
morning is is it true or not is it true
or not
and I J Pakistan is it true or not that
in his interim budget of 2014 his
highness P Chidambaram accepted the
demand for one rank one pension in
principle saying I am happy to announce
that the government has accepted the
principle of one rank one pension for
the Defense Forces not only that he says
I immediately proposed to push a sum of
five hundred crores to be transferred
you made a commitment into tens of
thousands of crores you transferred 500
crores and you're crying right now
you're crying right now when this
government is doing the same thing
it's a pre-election budget not an
interim budget I'll see you on the other
side the political debate has only

these are ad rates which are underway in
at least seven locations in Lucknow
these rates are in relation to the cases
which are pending during my a--they as
the Chief Minister BSP supremo myopathy
this is when she was heading the state
of Uttar Pradesh way back in 2007 to
2011 and these as we speak IDI rates are
underway at seven different locations in

with more details on this as Enforcement

raids in Lucknow this is in connection
with the cases the pending against her
and and and I think this is pertaining
to Maya memorial myopathy memorial
during her tenure as a chief minister
but what are these locations that we are
talking about shovin more details please
so the confirmation now coming in from
the Enforcement Directorate such as
raids are being carried out at seven
places in Lucknow this is on the basis
of the case that was registered by the
yupi state intelligence department that
was under Sections 120-b of the IPC that
again criminal conspiracy and thereafter
Edie had basically registered a case on
the Prevention of Money Laundering Act
which he says it resulted in loss of
over fourteen hundred crore to the
carbon Exchequer and that is exactly
what the Enforcement Directorate is
hoping as result it does what
significant to point out here is that
this inquiry that was basically works by
the Occulus government against my own
body now the enforcement they've
collected essentially acted on the case
that was resisted by the group of state
intelligence department the allegation
is that between 2000 2007 and 2011 when
given to understand that what we have
been calling it as a memorial yeah we
give in to understand there is a scope
of money-laundering that is that
directly she's looking at at this point
remember clearing the tradition my work
is certainly under the camera between
these days and are these rays only are
confined to Lucknow one cycle the
consolation that has come in from the
Enforcement Directorate only indicators
that we raise are being carried out only
in Lucknow back to seven places we still
not very clear at this point in terms
where in these rays are being carried
out whose offices where these rays are
being carried out by the Enforcement
Directorate but clearly the memorial
scan indicates that we are looking into
colleges they are also going to look at
the role played by several politicians
and not just that also the road sinister
Pradesh biography because during her
tenure this model was basically granted
the functions were basically given what
the enforcement objective is looking at
at this point in time using money
laundering aspect ok shaman stay with us
a little bit more details just to put
this in perspective of an election up do
you think this is a back in focus now
under Edie's lens the my avati memorial
cases during her tenure as the chief
minister now this case is back to haunt
my avati as the IDI launches crackdown
at seven different locations
some of them like you just rightly
mentioned are robbed not disclosed and
these raids as you speak are taking
place in Lucknow remember the facts here
is that the U P states
vigilance department already initiated
this entire investigation where they're
looking at a criminal conspiracy angle
also now taste on that we are now being
given to understand that the enforcement
directed is looking into money
laundering aspect as far as the memorial
scam is concerned remember the my Abadi

state of Gujarat also now home state of
the two big politicians of the BJP the
Prime Minister and the BJP president
yesh 1 once again I got 39% visitors to
54% of the BJP you know you know so they
are coming down from 60 that's that's
true that's an but but I mean this is
this is how much dissent it can be
you're in dissent it can be as far as
Gujarat is concerned to two seats which
the Congress is still leading are in the
north gujarat and and there they have
been there pretty much strong word
abhishek would know that he has been to
those areas pretty often so all said and
done goodra remains firm with the BJP
form with Modi as the time if I can come
to you on this as well the Gujarat
numbers look absolutely plausible and
probable because BJP has had
traditionally their 50 percent plus
margin should keep in the party in good
state and the numbers so far as seats
are concerned
yes month is absolutely right because
from 26 my feedback is it could be
between 20 to 24 he's putting at 24 that
should be fine okay
state election showed that BJP had very
very dense pockets of support yeah in
parliamentary election that doesn't play
out well for bath isn't a party so these
numbers my might my tone may not hold
you would be correct
having said that it is very unlikely for
a stage okay to vote against a sitting
Prime Minister who is how do these
numbers look to you nothing changes
nothing changes I just I think Congress
has gained a bit if you compare the 2014
because NCP had if I remember and CP had
one seed there so I think this is more
realistic more realistic I think it's it
looks better I think it's for Congress
it is a bit slightly higher slightly
higher Congress is like
that is incorrect no all the seats all
the seats
unless quickly from Alta Badia all the
seats in 2014 were with BJP and in 2019
yeshwant I've been repeatedly saying
these two for Congress are not coming
and today the news is that Al paced Huck
or the North India the north gujarat
congress guy is is probably going back
somewhere but not with congress so what
will happen here is I am Telling
indecently 26 to 26 with BJP ah
I think 24 versus 2 is something that
you think is fairly decent but I think
it's January 2019 Yashwant because now
we are putting out their entire series
I quickly want you to comment on that
and then I'll just take it to the studio
ones before we actually head into
another break here yes what do you
notice a significant difference or
Gujarat is a state that doesn't change
whose wrath is not changing much and and
I'm afraid for for for for anybody who
is trying to analyze it the other way
round even when we were telling that
Gujarat assembly election BJP is likely
to get down to asmath hundred seats
which we said that even at that point of
time even in those numbers even in the
exit poll of Gujarat their voting
intention for the prior further
parliamentary election was absolutely
crisp and clear that they were voting
some of them were voting against BJP at
that point of time and they were very
clear but when the looks of my elections
come we are going to vote for Modi so
it's a crisp and clear over the crisp

Part B Sanjeev go and car group new Ford
Aspire grooving MP Birla cement in style
partner Raymond
and welcome back viewers you remember
just after our launch Republic TV did a
detailed sting operation in Hyderabad
we stung members of the ISIS we exposed
the ISIS India Network that was in May
2017 today the Islamic state terror
threat in India is not just a reality
but it's actually bigger than we
imagined the raids have reached
Maharashtra and a very dangerous
chemical attack plot has been unearthed
just imagine if the is had carried this
out on Indian soil let's debate on the
debate tonight there can be no denial on
Isis threats anymore
32 kilometers away from India's
financial capital in a place called
mammarra agencies arrested Isis suspects
seized from their possession laptops
mobile phones and key documents the
third such crackdown after a series of
raids in Delhi Uttar Pradesh and Punjab
these nine youth were given to
understand that they were basically
interacting on a whatsapp group which is
also basically put under surveillance
they had plans of carrying out attacks
in several parts of the country however
the target was a big congregation they
were actually planning to carry out
these attacks in fact goon was something
that they were looking into a dangerous
chemical attack plot unraveled three
days before Republic Day group mr.
Malkin akikusa to drop a voter a
poisonous mixture chemical k sorry
banana Kiku cigarette or Java bang gotta
that was kebab food Yahoo water may be
but a public function made mr. pure
water made me laughter sadhus is a
Telugu Kumar mahadji's in something the
attack unit equipping your recruiter
Mohsin Khan
I usually radicalized the suspects
showing them Isis videos from
bomb-making tutorials to planning
attacks with rocket launchers and now a
plot to carry out mass poisoning on
earth Republic has been saying this
since we exposed the ISIS in their
network in May 2017
good afternoon and welcome to the
special broadcast with me here is our
editor investigations and news
premise-free devi and prema has is today
bringing you yet another expose just
before I introduce this the story prema
essentially what we are putting out
today
is the fact that the ISIS not just
exists but it's operating freely here in
India and India for to be in denial on
the ISIS radicalization reality let's
debate
[Music]
I'd like to welcome Vikram Singh our a
sensing I'd like to welcome is Ilya
sharafuddin Mehmood Baraka and article
him on on the debate and there's very
serious concern about this because had
this had this plot being you know even
remotely implemented the target one of
the possible targets being the kuma so
the possibility of a chemical attack
organized by the Islamic state when the
khumba as a possible target is not
something that you can joke about this
tells you how stupid and foolish we have
been to allow some people to create a
lot of noise to shout down all of us who
constantly say that radicalization in
the Islamic state is a reality in this
country I'd like to first start off with
our sensing on this rsn it's a
terrifying plot and the toxic plan of
undertaking a chemical attack in our
country with a possible target being the
coma the consequences would have been
frightening please understand
can anyone undermine this threat now
anymore yeah I think I think as far as
I'm concerned it is an inflection point
a dangerous inflection point you know in
proxy war of this and India and let me
make one very clear submission that this
is after lot of research I'm telling you
that Isis in India is a vector being
used by the Pakistan ISI Shafie armar
who was allegedly know was who claimed
that he is very close to Benghazi
actually he was pulling a big one he is
an ISI man and in this your story also
somewhere now the bride's name will also
be will also come so it is it is a
terror plot it Isis is only a vector
that is being used by the ISI yeah other
thing is that there is no moral
objection as far the as far as the jihad
is
concerned against using weapons of mass
destruction
what did security minister of UK Ben
Wallace say just few months back he said
that you know they can turn any
everything into a weapon they want to
cause as much harm as possible terrorize
as many people as possible if people can
convert vehicle security Hydra machines
to mow down people then I can see the
mindset now now now now now the problem
is that look all those nine I went
through the record there engineering
graduates there are some of them it's
clear to proxy war god listen to me
object
I'll tell you the problem with the truth
I'll tell you the problem with Faraci
first I was the person actually sky I
want to I want to tell you the problem
with a choice that lies with this busy
lies with a straight face
he lies unflinchingly and on
apologetically he can actually lie in a
sequence that he can lie the secret set
up your qualities and therefore I will
expose his life with one question I am
NOT one question up your cloud now you
be quiet you be quiet watch I will be

combo male are going on there's a kuma
Mela going on in this country and in a
combo manner please be quiet in the
camara viewers hundreds of thousands and
lakhs and tens of lakhs and millions of
devotees collective aggregate in one of
the largest religious congregations in
this country and in the world in the
Camela it is the largest congregation of
devout Hindus in the world
innumerable numbers of devout people
come seeking spiritual guidance to the
khumba it is a holy occasion it is it is
one of the most holy days in the Hindu
calendar and you know I I really am I
feel sorry today that people like
barrace I do not think that even the
Atheist is saying they are verifying
whether the Kumu Mela was on the target
of these men or not they're
investigating this matter but what I do
know today is that the ISIS was planning
one large chemical attack and they were
trying to make a poisonous mixture added
to food or water and the ATS is still
looking at whether the kumbhamela was a
target or not my only question tonight
to you all viewers is this that GD
Bakshi we cannot you know try pretend to
keep our eyes closed anymore people like
Parata say what they do based upon some
Home Ministry presentation or response
in Parliament then it is not evil not
jealous that is 2014 it's not relevant
pick up a two thousand fourteen or
fifteen document now no no I'd say it is
relevant is that is opportunism and
hypocrisy of the worst guys you would
not do this that is opportunity okay
please
babies Bitcoin why every sport is that
what is the date today what is the date
today the biggest oppa Roger stop
shouting I'll tell you viewers viewers I
must tell you today I must tell you
about people at furniture no no I'll
tell you what people like borracho
I'll tell you why he's a liar let me say
this viewers you know viewers I really
want to speak to you let there be no
doubt that this country is under a very
serious radicalization and
radicalization leading to terrorism
threat people like paratha part of Allah
be if you go and act against some people
accused of links with the Islamic state
then they immediately religious
denomination and when the proof comes
out then they pick up a one year old
Parliament response and say doesn't
matter all the evidence and the proof
and the Abdullah assets are the
terrorists at the plots that you've
caught in the intervening eight months
we will now pick up and say yesterday's
also incorrect I mean this is such a
matter is please look at the audacity of
the targeting patterns it is now
designed to cause horrendous mass
casualties a chemical warfare attack is
generally awaited and even a nuclear
doctrine says to a chemical attack we
can respond with a nuclear strike the
Pakistanis are using a so-called is is
cover to try and execute a chemical
attack in this country shame
evidences which have been found this is
too serious provocation it cannot be
taken lying down it will not just end
with burrata giving us human rights
sermons and the government now saying
yes we mix it in the in the bud we have
to take Pakistan to task
how can Pakistan dare though she son who

also I also what I also want to share
some more facts out here out of the nine
Isis accused who have been caught by the
Islamic state and are now getting
indirect support here from a mood
borracho attica rahman a part of a

a deeper conspiracy of the deeper reason
and please understand the geopolitical
situation is rising and you know ugly
head in the country I'm not surprised
you know why one reason I'm not
surprised is because my last line of the
debate is under the Congress government
they said under the Congress government
they said is like Mujahideen does not
exist they kept saying the Indian
Mujahideen does not exist under the
Congress government they supported and
patronized swimming under the Congress
government say they said the bat Laos
encounter was a sham and a scam so I
don't need to repeat what happened I
think the point is they do believe that
another Modi government the Islamic
state is being caught and they're really
worried what's going to happen if this

all right so what we've got on this

just pulled away from one lie that the

another lie that the Congress party has
been speaking for the longest possible
time Republic has been able to access
about age a new video switch are apart
of the chart sheet the states show the
genu gang shouting anti army and
anti-india slogans i think the nation
today should take a note of what we are
really looking at Republic the first
channel to be able to access those to
great apes aishwarya is the tracking
that story and he joins us on the
broadcast aishwarya talked us more about
what we are looking at as far as the
evidence is concerned because i do
remember that the Delhi police again and
again has been reiterating there are a
lot of these videos that they've been
able to access a genuine they have
forensic reports but what do these
videos actually tell us leave these six
underrated videos which are part of the
charge shield have been accessed by the
public TV these six underrated videos
are of that time that period which shows
that oh great oh great yang in reality
they are taking on the army they are
taking on the CRPF
and you can hear them these are those uh
narrated videos which have been taken em
from the eyewitnesses their phones or
their mobile devices these are those
videos deep deep which are now a part of
the chargesheet submitted by the Delhi
police
I'm just interrupting you here but I
look what ma who's our associate editor

aishwarya I think we'll just see if our
locusts again patched with us and he's
been able to access these videos and
Aishwarya also would say something no no
and that is exactly what what I was
trying to say I have heard five out of
these videos deeply which we have been
able to access these are unedited videos
they have been taken out of the phones
of those I've witnesses and they are
part of the chart chief you can see how
this complete to put it over a gang
whether it's scania commodore the other
members of this table to prague and they
are taking out rants against the indian
army they are speaking out rants against
the paramilitary forces that
specifically against the RPF so they
that is why Delhi Police has mentioned
these videos in the chargesheet that
whatever cases whatever IPC they are
using is on the basis of this visual
clue and once again we are repeating
these are unedited videos unedited
videos which have been gathered by Delhi
Police as a part of evidence from the
mobile portable devices of individuals
who were standing there right there
inside JNU while these slogans were
being raised and that is why it makes it
a very credible evidence and that's why
they have been made as a part of the
chargesheet the six to eight videos
which they have been able to access show
that how and the reality the real face
of cognitive a gang this is they are not
even leaving the brave soldiers out they
are taking on the Indian Army and you
can hear it if you could play that third
video VP it clearly says they are taking
out rants against the Indian Army and
that's why Delhi police is basing its
complete chart sheet on the basis of
these six to eight videos there are more
videos which you will try to access so
enough but these are those videos deeply
which clearly show and clearly okay
but also get an army again that is big
and I yes all right

and we move on to more news as far as
the NIE rates that began early this
morning in the multiple locations are
concerned talking about parts of Western
with the predation also in Punjab or
what we are getting to know as far as
several people and so far have been
detained they are being questioned by
the ni now searches and places include
like rampid will ensure near at hopple
am Roja in western u P and also in
Ludhiana in Punjab let me straight away
go across to Siobhan Sen who has more
details regarding these raids a shovel
now these rates have been going on for a
very long time since last month's this
cetera Rice's module was busted but take
us through also the links that are being
now drawn upon to Ludhiana in Punjab we
will just reconnect that line with
shovin but it is just not in Punjab but
you also have the Kashmir link that has
now emerged in the investigation so far
now with regards to Kashmir the NIE
maintains that the accused in the case
were trying for arranging a meeting with
the Mujahideen so this is big as far as
this terror module is concerned it
branches are going on several places are
being connected to several places in the
country especially talking about Western
UPI imparts in Punjab as well and now
the link also been drawn to Kashmir now
you can see how the dots are being
joined by the ni a for the follow-up of
all the reads that were taking place
since last month and today as well as
they continue
several arrests that have already taken
place in the past more people today who
have been detained that they are being
questioned but one person also is being
questioned by the ni a for links with
the newly formed Isis outfit now these
people who are concerned earlier who was
a Maulana who was said to be a
mastermind of all these grades and that
were conducted on him a huge cache of
arms and ammunition also that was
recovered from them but this is a
mother/son Ludhiana that is being raided
in punjab so you can draw the links
Weston up2 Punjab - also in Kashmir how
you have the ni√±a simultaneously
conducting raids and there are
sensational developments that are taking
place shovin can you take us through the
links that are now being drawn towards
punjab and also kashmir
shovin if you can hear me just take us
through the Kashmir and the Punjab link
that is now emerging in the NIE rates
well as far as the Kashmir link is
concerned remember Mufti Sahib
Iftekhar who was actually arrested by
the national investigation agency and
was interrogated by the agency he is
revealed that he had actually visited
three places that's thrall Banda pura as
well as Maggiore
in Jammu and Kashmir now the as far as
these visits are concerned this is with
regards to arranging a meeting with the
Mujahideen for training as well as
procuring weapons remember as far as
this is time what you look concerned
what we give it to understand understand
is that there was a training that was
carried out and they're also essentially
looking at how weapon procurement
actually took place not just Iftikhar
who was arrested on the charges of the
fact that of this entire the fact that
he was going to Kashmir the very fact
that he was actually getting training as
well as a weapon procurement also also
cash oven if you can a detail to us as
far as the Pakistan links now that is
emerging to the Isis module because what
we are getting to know that this after
suspect a Musti Sohail admitted speaking
to a handler across the border so it
doesn't in parts of India it goes across
the border as well before I answer your
question we have got some documents with
regards to the national investigation
agency raids that I've now been carried
out this is the seizure memo that we
have actually got the seizure memo in um
Roja this is where the raids have been
carried out we are now given to
understand that these are the following
items that have been recovered from um
Roja they are talking about mobile
phones that have been recovered from the
house of one
mohamad good fun apart from this we are
also given to understand that they have
also recovered other items which is also
the second page this is also with
regards to certain SIM cards that have
been recovered from there also bill and
receives that have been taken from the
residence of one person in um Rojas so
this is the seizure memo of a raid that
has been carried out in um Roja the Rays
that were carried out earlier in the day
now the object that we have essentially
gone from the national investigation
agency this is an official confirmation
that raids have been carried out mostly
in Western look the pradesh in areas
like harper Ambro ha as well as Bullen
shed we are given to understand that as
far as harper is concerned it becomes
extremely important because they are
looking at the entire recruitment that
actually took place
it is mufti sahib if the car who was
actually first arrested by the national
investigation agency who actually taken
training in kashmir and we're given to
understand that the NI essentially
suspects that perhaps the recruitment
for this newly formed Isis module is
concerned was actually taking place from
this very place apart from that also
errors like Buland share remember there
have been few detentions that have
actually taken place so far however
there's no official confirmation really
coming in from the agency with regards
to how many detentions have taken place
but sources from sources we have
essentially picked up that people are
being questioned by the national
investigation agency this on the basis
of the interrogation of the accused
remember over ten people have already
been arrested by the national
investigation agency and today the new
link essentially emerging is that of a
Punjab where the raids are being carried
out this raid is being carried out in
Ludhiana this was in a mother's are that
we are given to understand that the raid
was actually carried out by the National
investigation agency",True,en,546,2,19

letter we're going to go through the
high points of the letter and this is
exactly how that letter looks like
released by the missionaries of Jesus
and these four sisters in fact if we
could just pull out and get you the
points of that letter sister Alfea this
letter perhaps the teens address to
these four nuns and they've been asked
to leave this communique is intended to
remind you once again to recall my early
repeals inviting your attention towards
mending the current way of life so they
are asking them to mend their ways of
life magnified public statements that's
it that is what this letter regards the
position that these four nuns remember
but the only one who took this father
malakal head-on who is actually out on
bail and they are calling that
circulation of baseless stories I'll
beat the unprecedented challenges faced
by the congregation from within this
letter actually goes back a to recall
what had really happened and now this
letter released by missionaries of Jesus
is addressed to Aleph a palace airy
sister Alfea and she's been asked to
leave we we are going to in fact zoom in
or on those key words and key phrases
acquisition sands truth with pooja is
with us as we stay with these
highlighted portions of the letter pooja
over to you and the one thing is very
clear that this letter is aimed at if
it's watering down the seriousness of
the nature of the crime that has been
slapped on molecules face it
in fact tries to downplay the whole
truth and calling it circulation of
baseless stories absolutely not just
that if you see the tone antenna off the
letter throughout circle it seems as
what we are trying to
yes pooja stay with us we're trying to
reconnect with pooja let's once again go
back to that letter if you can just zoom
in slowly and try to go through the
contents of the letter it says that this
communicates in Teta to remind you to
leave let's go down a bit if I can
request my camera person to slowly zoom
down to remind you to once again recall
my earlier appeals inviting your
attention towards mending the current
way of life and activity so basically
the letter released by missionaries
offer Jesus it's like a firm reminder to
these four sisters pooja is again live
with us as we stay with the letter it's
a firm reminder to these poor nuns to
mend their ways just because on the
basis of those serious allegations that
surfaced they are reminded to not only
mend their ways but they're calling
those allegations baseless and they're
asking them to move out trying to water
down what had really happened the
serious rape charges
the entire tone antenna off the letter
is so threatening it is almost as if the
crime hasn't taken place so there are no
allegations leveled at all and you know
all of this is only done to tarnish the
reputation of a particular organization
and throughout the letter the only a the
only factor in which there is emphasis
is the fact that you know there is no
unity within the congregation and at the
end of the day there is an image that
needs to be protected of the
congregation and to make matters worse
as we were seeing earlier
Frank immunocal not just received a
hero's welcome when he went back to
Jolanda but also has been reinstated to
his a previous position as the Bishop of
the gel and the diocese and here you
have four nuns who are asked to go back
to their parent organizations you know
if the explanation it makes it even
worse because we have put out versions
of you know those who stood by the
wisdom as to how a year she went from
pillar to post and approached several
authorities within the church seeking
justice to what was happening but
instead a not just word those shut on
her face but okay systemic victimization
continued and finally left with no
choice she went to the police and here
are four brave nuns were standing by her
and they're now being dug are continued

were sent out five days ago asking these
sisters all of them nuns to move out of
the convent remember ever since Bishop
Franco you know you know left jail he's
out on bail ever since he came out of
jail there's been a deliberate campaign
to malign these sisters and there's been
a lot of pressure on different church
bodies to try and somehow chunk them out
to somehow somehow try and take revenge
on these you know Nina these nuns you
also saw some of those pictures when
these nuns went to public events some of
those who are close to Bishop Franco
hounded them and they were sloganeering
against these nuns they were hounded for
a long time now and now we hear that
these sisters have been shunted out
story breaking on Republic TV we're
getting details of the order that these
letters were dated a 10th of January
Dipti later stated 10th of January sent
to these nuns asking them to leave the
convent where they are currently based
now this is this is a big breaking story
around Republic I will also try and go
cross the puta Prasanna who's able to
get get some more details but this is
from now that these four nuns have been
moved out and you know niranjan I think
just because the story has been very
very closely tracked the by us here at
Republic a lot of people during the
course of the entire coverage of have
been asking that where is this man where
is this Bishop Franco he today is a free
man and look at what's happening with
these nuns with those witnesses who've
actually put out their testimony in
spite of the pressure coming in from the
church well absolutely and and you know
we just you know this has been a
campaign and you will remember when we
spoke to Bishop Franco remember that
interview the primary day we conducted
with Bishop Franco this was when he was
in Jalandhar
she went there she would manage to speak
to him and he was defined from the
beginning even before he was arrested by
the police he was defined and Bishop
Franco has all along maintained and you
know even in the tone of his interview
and in his tone following the you know
following you know leaving jail has
always been aunty the victims he's
questioned the victim he's questioned
the sisters are the nuns who were
protesting against him and you know we
now have a confirmation that they've
finally been shunted out there has been
a lot of pressure on these church bodies
as well from a bishop Franco's team to
somehow try and move them out they were
also targeted by by you know members who
are you no clue who members of the
clergy who were close to Bishop Franco
and you know all of this has been
happening in the last couple of months
at public events when they were present
at public events or at church gatherings
you know they were also targeted by
Bishop Franco's you know aides and this
is what has happened so far and we we
have a confirmation now that these four
sisters have been asked to leave the
convent this is a letter written by
Superior General Regina of the
missionaries of Jesus to the four nuns
and the four hands of course their
identities are already known the four
nuns as we know our sister you know al
people are Saral sister Josephine Valon
nickel sister Anupama
and also sister Ann citta now these are
the four nuns who've been fighting for
that for the nun who was the victim in
the bishop Franco case and these four
nuns have received
I've received a letter they've been
asked to leave the convent where they
have been
and this news has been confirmed to us
you saw them holding placards you know
in Kochi have they had that big campaign
for justice for the victim in the bishop
franco case and the church body has now
asked them to leave looks like Bishop
Franco has had the last word but
niranjan what does this letter in
specific say take us through the
contents of that letter yeah
before we go closer you know before we
go get you the contents of the letter
let me also go crossover indicate
joining us on the phone and bring daddy
gate is an activist she says she's had
very strong views on this matter when da
da getting the news now that the four
sisters who fought for the nun in the
bishop Franco case have been asked to
leave the convent Bishop Franco a rape
accused has had the last word in this
case this is absolutely shameful
violation we have that accused we have
the perpetrator we have the rapist who
seems to be having all the fun enjoying
all the facilities and the so-called
respect and dignity but women who have
stood up the nuns who had stood with the
victim is being asked to leave the
convent and I think the convent gendell
the convent management and the local
bishop has to be pulled up because he is
directly in charge for that Conda
nothing less but in now stay with me but
now stay with me because they also have
son there are you on the phone line and
Sunday reduce the lawyer for further nun
one of the nuns has been fighting this
bishop Franco character for a long time
Sangha looks like you know Bishop Franco
has had the last word in this case I
know that you've been fighting and
fighting for several months now and fact
that these nuns have been asked to leave
the convent is a victory for nobody else
but Bishop Franco yes actually this
series of business interpretations I've
been happening from the time the a fire
had been filed and he has been actually
constantly telling the court as well as
telling the court as well as the people
involved that there is a threat
perception man Tom action has to be
taken when they had transferred all the
mother-to-be they're also from some
Hollander to hear that time also the
same thing was actually raised but
somehow nothing seemed to be huh seems
to have been done because everyone
expects the nun to keep on going to the
police to explain their fears and things
like that at each and every instant the
only kind of protection which was
provided and the fear of them being
shunted out was there from the moment
circulars Larry showed asking them are
asking people not to associate associate
with them so this is a very dangerous
thing and this is a very serious matter
which I personally feel that the court
has to look into a rather than you know
let it go through the normal load of law
and order closes because the big witness
intimidation is huge here Sonia
beginning in the information that you
know your client I don't to call it a
client but you know the fact that sister
Anupama is that sister Anupama who's
been asked to go back to jail and girl
can you confirm because we have some
information that sister Obama has been
asked to go back to Punjab that is
Jolanda Webb Bishop Franco was placed I
think that's that's a punishment posting
that's punishment under Bishop Franco is
or rather was yes yes I live in half so
because I was I caught this information
from oh you people so I'll have to just
confirm but the entire events at this
point of time but if she has been asked
to be transferred to London then it is
it is like the church actively
collaborating too hard all of them up
absolutely something I want you to stay
with me because I also have bring the
Adi gay and you know a lot of lot of
anger across India as we break the story
you know on TV and also on the social
media Linda gave you know just before
you came in was on the phone line she
was also shocked
brinda you know be getting in more
information that sister Obama has been
sent back to Jolanda which was Bishop
Franco's original posting from where you
know where the alleged crime it is
believed to have taken place no I'm
sorry that was in Kerala but the fact
that the sending him sending our sister
on Parma to the convent where
Bishop Franco was originally posted I
think this is punishment punishment for
these kiddos nuns who've spoken out
we've taken so much of courage to sort
of Friedel come out on the streets and
protest and ensure but Bishop Franco was
you know face justice
you're absolutely right punishment
posting and what what now the police
need to do is file the case add these
people to the FI are as those who are
party to the rapist because these people
are nothing short of doing that when
they know that that man is not going to
go back into jail just now and he still
has a lot of caracal power over there
how dare they send up a little this nun
back there as punishment they have to be
accused with that rapist absolutely and
you want to respond to the sandia you
want to respond to that it's
intimidation
it's intimidation and intimidation it
isn't it is intimidation of the highest
order and we can later Supreme Court
gentlemen coming in for witness
protection what is happening right now
is total violation because we've been
constantly regularly asking for a
witness protection for these nuns
because of the because of the the high
no resource-efficient but somehow
everyone seems to be feeling that
nothing much will happen but the fact
that he's been transferred where she's
been transferred to the new church she's
been transferred to the London and other
sisters being or the Mother Superior
being transferred from London to here
and it's a little isolated plan of
isolating sister and isolating the
victim the story goes because I you know
this is this is this is I think shocking
that the church body has decided to side
with Bishop Franco let's see where the
story goes Sandhya and Linda thank you
at this point we leave it at this while
we try and gather some more information
about this big breaking story that the
church body has succumbed to Bishop
Franco and his aides who have been
hounding the four sisters or the nuns
who've been fighting for the victim in
the
franco sexual assault case they've been
asked to move out

Council meeting begins with the BJP but
what we are getting to know as far as
good CBI director once again Nageshwar
Rao is concerned the earlier decisions
that he had taken as far as transferred
over eBay officials is concerned that
now holds a back to position again as
far as a local bar 36 hours that he was
as the CBI director who had reversed all
those decisions that were made by
Nageshwar out now it seems Nageshwar Rao
has reversed the decisions that are
loquat mom made in those 36 hours
interim CBI chief MA
Nageshwar Rao has reversed all the
transfer orders now the status remains
as it was on the 8th of January coming
back her to shabaan who's been tracking
all the developments closely shovin now
there are several rapid developments
that are taking place rapid changes that
have been happening as we oversee what's
happening within the CBI am now - were
policy decisions that have were taken by
him in 36 hours that were reversed by
Alabama now comes back to position and
square one shovin if you're able to Yami
just take us through as far as M
Nageshwar Rao is concerned immediately
when joining office today he has come
back and he's reversed all those
decisions that were taken up by then CBI
director Eloqua ba in those 36 hours he
had reversed the directions of M
Nageshwar out now it seems M Nageshwar
Rao has reversed all the transfer orders
that are Luftwaffe had nullified
[Music]
so the latest what we are getting to
know even as we connect the line with
Shabana all your Atma status on the 8th
of January is concerned where there were
several policy decisions that were taken
up by Nageshwar Rao as far as transfer
of several CBI officers is concerned now
they stand active as far as whatever
decisions were taken mabye aliquot mind
those 36 hours when he was reinstated by
the Supreme Court verdict immediately
when he joined office he had reversed he
had nullified M Nageshwar aus transfer
orders to other CBI officials now back
in office as the CBI director M
Nageshwar Rao has brought the position
to what it was on the 8th of January
that means as far as the decisions taken
by our loquat moms on the transfer of
CBI officials that now stands null and
void Sharon I believe is back with our
vengeance or throw more light as far as
the first decision being taken a by M
Nageshwar Rao is concerned reversing all
the decisions that were made by 36 our
director of the CBI Alok Baba
shavon if you can hear me now just take
us through what has happened as M
Nageshwar out 2x George once again when
I mattered the first decision that the
interim chief has actually taken is
reversing the order that was passed by
former CBI director our Luke Varma the
transfers that actually took place
remember these transfers included some
key officers like a Kaiba C who was
actually transferred to another unit
altogether in fact kk ba c is the
officer who was actually probing Rakesh
Astana's case the one of the first
decision that had now been taken by the
interim chief is to restore the same
status as it was on 8th of January it
was on 9th of January when Alok Varma
was reinstated as the CBI director and
the first decision that I look for ba
took at that point in time is reversing
all the transfers that were actually
done over 30 officers by K Nageshwar Rao
but this once again is the reversal that
we are essentially seeing Anna status
quo as far as the notifications are
concerned the transfer orders that were
basically passed by mr. Alok Varma now
the interim chief has actually changed
it it was certainly on the expected
lines given the fact that this was one
of the first decisions that K Nageshwar
Rao had taken once he took over as the
CGI director as the interim chief of the
Central Bureau of Investigation now the
decision being taken that he has
reversed it many actually viewed this as
a controversial decision taken by a low
firma because if you remember when he
was reinstated as the director CBI one
of the underlying messages that was that
he were he couldn't have taken any
policy decisions however transfer of
officers would not be seen as policy
decisions but rather routine decisions
but the fact that he had brought in his
own officers officers who were perceived
to be close to the director hid them
bring brought back in itself was seen as
a controversial decision that was taken
by a low farmer soon after he was
reinstated as the director CBI
absolutely so the transfer orders now
reversed by negation allow all those
decisions that were made by a local
admin now that seems to be nullified by
interim CBI director M Nageshwar Rao
