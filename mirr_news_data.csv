looks about 2019 polls kicks off on
April 11th with the first phase of
polling hello and welcome to explain
where we are going to analyze why this
particular phase is so crucial and
joining me on the show is mere announce
consulting editor Vanetta mari thank you
I feel slightly different but a very
very important question on the menu
tonight absolutely so the big question
on explained tonight is what is at stake
in this first phase of polling on the
11th of April now when I there are some
very crucial states that are going to
polls in this particular in this
particular round you have 91 seats
spread across 20 states and it is going
to determine the political fate of
plenty of politicians
yes and whenever you have a seven phase
election with 91 looks of our seats
means there is a lot at stake for all
parties but in the first phase there is
a lot at stake for some very important
regional parties some down south some up
in the north but a lot at stake for a
lot of parties and and that's why this
phase one is being called so critical
bias also goes to polls in terms of
selecting its assembly members as well
and the two really crucial states in
this particular election are Andhra
Pradesh and Telangana now these two
states are going to polls only in one
phase so you're not going to see a long
drawn battle on the cards here but our
position Telangana are interesting for a
number of reasons first you have this
bitter rivalry between KCR and Chandra
Babu Naidu interestingly both of them
have tried to pitch themselves as a
third front leader and they've tried to
build this coalition that centers around
them that's right and I think what's
most interesting for me is that every
single regional leader from Andhra the
in Telugu leadership within India pretty
much Frances themselves as the kingmaker
in Delhi I mean it's not just that the
batting for their own state they're also
batting to become a kingmaker in Delhi
and and all of them believe that they
have a chance at that including jag and
ready for instance he also believes that
he's got a chance to play kingmaker at
the center and of course there is a semi
election there as well but in the
national politics these three leaders
are every time their roles are varied
but this
the fact that they can be kingmakers is
the supreme on the minds know John
already is somebody whose stock has
really risen over the past few years
he's left everyone guessing in the sense
you would always assume that he's a
natural ally of the BJP because of the
acrimony between him in the Congress but
he has kept his options open a little he
has kept his options open and just two
days ago he went public by saying that
I've forgiven the Congress for all that
they have done to him having said that I
think any such comment ahead of the
election is meant more to send messages
it's still we still can't be sure
whether he's keeping his off social but
I think he's just a hard bargainer also
something about the politics of Andhra
both these states Telangana and Andhra
the party parties are likely to go with
whoever is making the government at the
center because both sides want the
center to help them with doles
that has been the practice in Andhra
Chanda Babu Naidu successfully did that
in the past big government into the 1998
and this is much the same is what they
are looking for as well I'm interesting
the fourth person you see on your screen
there is the X Factor Pawan Kalyan he's
The X Factor Pavan Kalyan for mousse for
a lot of her viewers in not perhaps may
not know he's a superstar that brother
of Chiranjeevi who's had a stint in
politics he merged his brother azzam
party into Congress but it does enjoy
quite a lot of popularity on the silver
screen at least Pawan Kalyan is
considered as big a lead as big an actor
and has big a leader remember Robin
callaghan's importance politically is
that he also belongs there therefore the
Kapoor community and Kapoor community
you pretty much have about 20 percent
what share in the state and that's where
the X Factor of Andhra comes in how much
damage will he make to the fortunes and
to whose is a big question in this
election right now let's just move up
north a little with the Pradesh which of
course all roads to Delhi go why are you
p there are eight seats that are going
to go to polls and this is a very
crucial it's largely the Western
dominated belt is where these seats are
going to poles there have some very
crucial seats Kara now we'll just talk
about karana
which is going to poles this was the
testing lab for the SP BSP rld alliance
that's right yeah they're trying to
regulate that now in the Lok Sabha
absolutely so the yellow that you see on
your screen is pretty much the K in
caste and communal belt over the
opposition many ways the politics of
this area decided by sugar cane this is
her by caste and it's aside by common
listen and as you rightly said Chi Rana
in that sense was the was the lab
and these influence of Khurana and what
happened in Muzaffarnagar and mirror
trains to have a spillover effect very
interestingly this is also the region
that got most impacted by the Romantic
movement the U P is a very unusual state
in many ways on the left of the screen
the Western Europe 'part is very
different from the way east is and
Western Europe E is prosperous the
farmers are rich and also now come
intensely community divided that's not
the same in the East as which is ybj for
the BJP this face is extremely relevant
remember the last time BJP did
dramatically where they swept the entire
Western Europe in many ways so for then
it's a huge you know a lot of things at
stake for them in many ways because they
are now pitted against an alliance which
is not the case now there are two other
seats this is of course there are two
ministers who are you know up to face
the electorate there is VK Singh who is
contesting from Ghaziabad and is also
Mahesh Sharma from Gotham both Naga both
of them very urban NCR constituency
right so NCR of has of course northern
Gaza but it also has Goodwin Farida but
an NCR in that sense is a very pampered
part of India I mean you have acne for
unionist is coming only from the NCR two
of them from the areas where we are
going to polls no idea which is also
known as Gotham but another and
Ghaziabad and in that sense the
political for tune of two cabinet
ministers are at stake also v casings
image of a complete right we remember
last time he won by the second highest
number of votes in India I mean after
moody his board share was actually the
second highest so he enjoys a strong
support base in Ghaziabad but again
because of the coalition politics this
time he's pitted against the slightly
tougher opposition this time right let's
just focus next to be hard now Bihar is
another very crucial state alliances
have been formed up here only four seats
are going to polls in Bihar and face one
but the whole myth is was is lalu
rivalry forced on friends don't force
again but the alliances at least are
formally in shape on both sides that's
right and in Bihar them the image of the
screen are pretty much people whose
political future and career is at stake
in many ways if the RJD congress align
just badly
lalu and his family will have a huge
setback in many ways louder remember
he's in jail he's incarcerated so in any
case he's looking at this to somehow
come back into the reckoning for Nitish
- who's flipped out many times a bad
performance here will completely
marginalize him at least in the near
future
Ram Vilas Paswan another man who can
flip from here to there and has actually
been part of many governments of the
state center no matter which party comes
to power is another one whose political
failure is at stake in case he ends up
doing badly in this election right
another very crucial state that's going
to polls is Maharashtra again there are
just seven seats that are going to polls
in Maharashtra but this is a very
crucial region the Vidarbha region
that's going to polls which is badly hit
by an agrarian distress and
interestingly nothing got curry of
course is going to be testing his
fortunes in Nagpur once again absolutely
not working the RSS headquarters won at
least two constants is here goon dia and
gradually also Knoxville dominated in
some ways and that has its role to play
in that part of the state
Marash is a very large stage of
graphically it's one of the large
estates of India geographically and also
the second-highest number of seats come
from here so of with herbs performance
will play a big factor in how well the
two alliances shape remember the
Congress NCP and the BJP should Sena
have been locked in a battle successive
elections in many ways I mean the last
time she was in a Congress Shiv Sena DGP
came up trumps whether the NCP grammars
can actually arrest that's like
especially in mr. Barry's home constancy
is a big question but the love-hate
relationship between the BJP and the
Shiv Sena continues whatever happens
that's something that we know we're
definitely that's a that's a given let's
just shift focus now a little to the
east there is West Bengal which is going
to polls just two seats and also a lot
of seats in the Northeast you have two
seats in Arunachal Pradesh two and Maga
live one in mizerock one in Nagaland so
a bunch of seats in the northeastern
states are going to polls but just one
quick word on West Bengal now you have
seen this intense rivalry between the
BJP and the TMC it's almost like the CPM
which was you know one of the bastions
in West Bengal has been pushed to the
sidelines and the TMC is now seeing its
major forced or major challenger in the
BJP yes I mean many people are billing
it as the batter between drama and Rahim
in many ways right there are some other
experts and commentators who build it as
a battle between drama in Durga
because in Bengal the image of Durga Dee
is evoked more than the image of RAM and
a lot of people believe that that may be
one reason why BJP may not lead as well
but having said that the larger
narrative from Bengal is the BJP has now
completely removed left and has become
principal Amish in the state so now the
task of defeating the TMC will be BJP so
not the left anymore I know a lot of
states in the Northeast now I'm going to
polls a lot of people are wondering oh
just one see it is just to see it what's
the significance of this but these are
the states of the BJP are particularly
eyeing to offset any damages that it may
have elsewhere in the country absolutely
and I think again not this is a
narrative issue the Congress seems to
have abandoned that part of the country
completely BJP has moved in
systematically in seized control almost
entirely 25 seats in Northeast and
remember in a tightly fought election
especially when you have a situation
where the BJP is peaked in a few states
and they even obviously lose a couple of
seats say in Gujarat Rajasthan and shut
these guard this is where the
incremental shoring up comes in because
if you do well in those twenty five
speeds even if you get say 18 20 out of
it you help arrest the slide that you
may have in other states where you
peaked so for them it's a very important
part of the country where they believe
they were to do well and have a
seriously sister palance's everywhere to
see that it happens well 91 seats and
it's a high stake high-voltage first
phase of polling on 11th of April weird

PLHQKXTna1I,Is Election Commission picking sides in 2019 Lok Sabha polls? | The Urban Debate With Faye D&#39;Souza,Former bureaucrats wrote a letter and raised questions on Election Commission being biased and gave 9 instances of violation of ...,2019-04-09T19:12:00Z,MIRROR NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PLHQKXTna1I/hqdefault.jpg,"[Music]
on the debate tonight the Election
Commission of India's credibility and
independence has been questioned the
Election Commission of India is being
accused of being partial as many as 66
bureaucrats have written a scathing
letter to the president
expressing their anguish they have said
in a 9-point letter that the Election
Commission did not act according to the
expectations they did not act when the
Prime Minister Modi's address was made
on operation Shakti they've also said
that yogi Anita knots remark on Modi key
sinner should have been dealt with more
stringently at the same time they have
raised questions on namo TV accusing the
BJP of getting a free run they
questioned why no action has been taken
against na mo TV they're asking if
political leaders are in fact getting
away with divisive speeches which are a
direct violation of the election
commission mirror now asks is the
Election Commission picking sides the
selection let's debate well this is a
very serious story and it should not be
taken lightly this letter has been
signed by very very senior retired
officers who've spent their lives in the
service of this country including as
you've drunk the formula 10 governor of
Delhi
let me read out some of the portions of
this letter we express our deep anguish
that the Election Commission of India
which has long and had and wrong an
honorable record of holding free and
fair elections despite the enormous
challenges of scale and complexity is
suffering from a crisis of credibility
today the Election Commission's
independence fairness impartiality and
efficiency are perceived to be
compromised
we are distressed to note the misuse
abuse and blatant disregard of the model
code of conduct by the ruling party at
the centre and the election commission's
dissimilarity in coming down with a
heavy hand on this violations we would
like to bring to your attention a number
of glaring instances and it lists out
instances
including the Prime Minister's
announcement of the anti-satellite
weapon the Election Commission's you
know reluctance to call out the Prime
Minister's film the biopic Modi a common
man the five journey episodes that are
currently streaming by eros now the namo
TV channel in the Election Commission's
lethargy in taking action against him
who goes on to list out nine different
instances and finally the letter says
were deeply concerned about the
weak-kneed conduct of the Election
Commission which has reduced the
credibility of this constitutional body
to an all-time low any erosion in the
people's confidence of the fairness of
the EC has very grave consequences on
the future of our democracy we appealed
through you honourable Rashtrapati ji to
the Election Commission to conduct
itself in a manner where its
independence fairness impartiality and
efficiency are not questioned now this
is something that's being raised for the
last several days but nobody has put it
as clearly as these officers is the
Election Commission at this point
failing to create a level playing field
why is it that some members of our
political class are actually behaving
with complete impurity as if the code of
conduct is just a piece of paper that
doesn't exist on the show with me this
evening Romani vegetation is an IAS
officer and a signatory a former
Highness is officer and a signatory of
this particular letter so is Amitabha
Pandey who was the former secretary of
the Indesit Council the Government of
India on the show as well shalosh gandhi
former CIC Anila Singh for the BJP
Ashutosh is a former who's the senior
journalist I beg your pardon and dr.
Qureshi from a Chief Election Commission
I welcome all of you to this
conversation and I thank you for giving
us your time mr. Venkatesh and good
evening and thank you for joining us
would you please tell us what prompted
you to write this letter why you believe
the Election Commission's credibility at
this point is at an all-time low
mr. banker tation if you can hear me
yeah yeah now I can hear you
it's I you know the issue really is that
you know in the course of our careers
also which they have often been they
have sometimes been violations of the
model code of conduct but we generally
found that on reports from the either
from the election officers or from the
returning officer or other officers who
are working under the election
commission the Election Commission has
immediately taken steps to rectify the
situation that I think is the problem
really today that unilaterally action is
being taken by a particular party now
I'm not mentioning any particular party
only but in the present case it happens
to be those from a particular party and
the Election Commission has not come out
with any specific directions at least it
could have come out with specific
directions on what should be done or
issued certain advisories from time to
time on each of these issues and I think
that has been it has been found severely
lacking over the past month we also did
not issue a letter immediately after the
code of conduct but we've been watching
this phenomenon develop over the past
month and I think we felt it was time
now to call the issue into question and
ask the laconic
Election Commission to fulfill its
duties under the Constitution
sir amitaba Pandey joins us as well also
signatory of the letter former secretary
of the interstate constants of
Government of India mr. Pandey good
evening and thank you for joining us I
want to go over the specific instances
in this letter the first one of which is
the announcement of the anti-satellite
weapon you say in the letter that this
that parading the achievements of a
government in this manner after the
announcement of the elections is a
serious breach of propriety and amounts
to unfair publicity the Election
Commission judged that this was not in
violation of the
why do you believe the Election
Commission is going soft on the current
government well I can't answer why I
mean I don't know what their motivations
are but certainly it did go soft this
was a clear breach of propriety it's not
a breach of law because the model code
of conduct is not a is not a it is not a
law is not him you can't punish anyone
but it's a very strong moral code of
conduct
it's a code of ethics which has been
derived by consensus by all the
political parties and the election
commission is being tasked to enforce it
now within the Maluku under the model
code of conduct any publicity of this
kind after the model code of conduct has
come into force is absolutely completely
against any of the principles of that
because it gives them it gives the
ruling party and the government an
unfair advantage
placing to be able to publicize an event
which is which instead of being
announced
if at all it had to be announced then it
should have been announced by a by an
official should not have been announced
by the Prime Minister it should be
announced where someone in the Dro which
is what we have said in our letter but
that - they have ruled they have not
called it the pitch of the model code of
conduct for purely technical reasons now
this kind of narrow technical
interpretation of the module code of
conduct is completely against the spirit
of the model code of conduct this is
it's like what is cricket and what is
not so this was not cricket well I would
have bring in mr. khureshi dr. Qureshi
at this point oh yes is the former Chief
Election Commissioner of India dr. crazy
good evening and thank you for joining
us you've made a couple of statements as
well but I am sure you've read through
this letter
it's scathing and it points out it it
mentions that the Election Commission of
India is currently at an all-time low in
terms of credibility and confidence
and it literally calls the Election
Commission partisan and says the
Election Commission is choosing sides at
this point and actually batting for the
BJP do you find this letter in any way
do you believe in the substance of the
letter do you agree with any part of it
or all of it
dr. Qureshi sees he myself but at the
same time the situation having come to
this path that senior civil servants and
so many of them have come to the
conclusion that this letter had to be
written that itself is a very
unfortunate situation because in the
election perceptions are extremely
important any institution more so the
Election Commission has to be perceived
to be neutral and fair if equal question
is being raised at this hatch situation
at the same time I would like to say
that perhaps this is inherent in the
institutional framework itself the
Election Commissioners are appointed by
the government of the day and once
appointed all the C's he is protected
from river well the other two members
can are not given that protection
now those two commissioners think they
are on probation and since the decisions
are taken by majority in the Election
Commission these two Election
Commissioners who are not protected by
the Constitution
they may in the overrule the CEC
10 times a day now which is a bad
situation and we have been demanding and
not just me and my predecessor that this
must change we are familiar with the
system of Collegium we have a judge a
the who are appointed by Collegium so
CIC the CVC
the fact that the the laws of the land
when they set up CIC and CVC they
consider Collegium a necessary therefore
I think at least this appointment should
also be done by Collegium and the
removal of the other two should also be
protected so that they feel safe from
the government and even the perception
because even if the Commission
fairly the perception also can be the
that they are spare which is also wrong
on the on the commissioner do you
believe that the Commission has acted
fairly in these instances the instance
of the namo TV channel for example on
which the Election Commission is silent
and the TV channel continues to be
on-air the film that was released the 10
part webseries that was released the
ASAT anti-satellite weapon that was
announced and it goes on even today for
example the Prime Minister in two
speeches made a statement saying first
time voters need to pledge their watch
to the martyrs of pull Varma and pledge
their watch to those who carried out the
bulk out attack and what for the BJP
this has been expressly you know has
listed out of something that cannot be
done but he continues to do so is the
Election Commission being fair well no
more they have not yet commented and
your allegation is that they're slow
they should have come in to donate I
have an opinion on number Channel but
I'll come to that later but he's had as
far as they said is concerned if I was
the CC surely there I would have found
it objectionable because we have
established law the rule and the
practice that anything which is which
can be postponed must be postponed and
if it cannot be postponed it have been
pre-decided then the inauguration is
done not by a politician even if it was
pre shedule he then it is substituted by
a bureaucrat and in this particular case
or if you see lost had 20-30 years every
announcement but the idea was made by
the scientist and in this case exception
he has made and a politician is making
the announcement so this probably
required a little different treatment
and I don't know that you said you have
an opinion on the numb of TV channel
what is that opinion dr. Qureshi
well I said the the I don't know what
the Election Commission is going to
decide but the mood I would find nothing
wrong with there no more channel in
terms of licensing because political
parties own channels
Methos own channels so that really
doesn't matter for Election Commission
is concerned however in 232 ways one
that any expenditure on the power and
publicity on that channel is subject to
expenditure reporting because all media
expenditure has to be reported in the
expenditure Restatement and secondly
there if it is a propaganda and it is
the election election campaign its
entire content has to be pre-approved by
the Election Commission I wonder if it
is being done if not then of course it
will if I'd some and one more question
to you dr. Croatia before I bring the
panel back is this the statements made
by the Prime Minister today that first
time voters should pledge their votes to
the matters of Paloma and the heroes of
ball quote and what for the BJP do you
see this as a violation of the code I
recently read that an instruction will
issued in 2013 that there will be no
reference to army and the army will not
be used in campaigning and that was
reiterated by the Election Commission
fearing that that will be the case to me
promised I see the what I heard today
that sound in violation of those
instructions
all right bringing the panel back right
now I want to go back to my panel thank
you dr. Croatian please stay with us
though
we also have a sheet OSHA and shalosh
Gandhi but I want you to respond to what
analyzing of the BJP says missing first
of all why is it that the BJP is
behaving like you don't have a model
code of conduct and you're going out and
if you just we just had a conversation
with dr. Currie issue who's the former
CI Chief Election Commissioner who
pointed out various counts on which the
BJP seems to be in violation of the code
and secondly do you agree with this
letter to the president that the
Election Commission is currently lacking
fairness and impartiality
no absolutely not
I am not here I'm not sitting here and
I'm not going to say anything in favor
of the letter which has been written to
the president of our country like one of
the one of I think one of the bureau
credit ad Bereket who has signed this
letter I he is on your panel and he has
mentioned that why they have written
this letter though I do not agree what
they say I totally have a faith in the
institutions of our country and I have
got faith in Election Commission as well
as far as you are asking me about her
agenda party's statements or stands time
time to time and election commission has
taken notice of that then I have to say
Election Commission has to do what
Election Commission has to do as a party
Jinta party worker I can only wait for
the decision of the Election Commission
nothing more than that but at the same
time I will appreciate faith that you
can point out other political parties as
well you can if you can say something
about Maya worthy like she's what did
she do
from the stage she appealed one
particular religious community to vote
for her
so I can cite ten more examples why only
parties in the party know that's a fair
point early listening and I completely
agree with you you are absolutely right
by arthi calling on a certain community
to vote for her is completely wrong and
by that yardstick yogi Adityanath making
a statement that was religious is
completely wrong the prime minister
making a statement that was religious is
completely wrong the Prime Minister
calling upon people to pledge their
votes to pull Rama
completely wrong is the Election
Commission going soft
that's the question challenge method you
want to respond to what Anila Singh said
they seems to be and you we've had
various Election Commissioners in this
country this at this particular point we
seem to be at the weakest as far as I
can see
yes you're right the Election Commission
is looking very very weak but I must
also contrast it with the fact that this
election is one of the most hatred
filled anger filled abuse field
direction that I can recall earlier this
was not the case to give a simple
example one party calls the Prime
Minister thief and the other pipe and
the middie recalls the others is
traitors I have not seen this kind of
his appearances in the country before
however I do agree with Qureshi saying
that the Election Commission has been
soft this time and it was its role it's
its job to interfere and to issue
comments and I think this started a year
back when the electron bonds were
proposed the Election Commission should
have gone to the Supreme Court and asked
for this to be struck down which it did
it's very clear as to what it's trying
to do and what the quraishi says is true
that the two of the commissioners
probably feel vulnerable but that's a
sad coming to India it's the senior-most
public servants of the country do not
look at their duty but I'm more
concerned with their jobs being
safeguarded that I think is a slightly
sad coming I'm sure it's true
and what analyzing says is also true
various parties are me mean extremely
abusive on the no more TV I agree with
dr. Qureshi unless there is some in
legality I don't see anything wrong I
cannot say that there is something wrong
with there's a restaurant which is come
up in Tuticorin quiet no more restraint
modelled on mr. moody no you can't blame
all that reservation the reservation
with namo TV and I'll go over to Asha
though should be able to do a better job
of explaining this is there are
regulations for television channels you
have to first decide what category you
are in are you news are you
entertainment are you GE are you
advertisement based on that category you
have to apply for licences with the inb
Ministry register the name of the
channel the NB Ministry has to issue a
license that is then given to the DTH
operator that
the laser the channel also when you
apply for that channel the logo carries
the Prime Minister's face and his
photograph for which you have to get
express permission from the Prime
Minister's office to put his logo on a
channel like this and if it is there in
the category of advertisements then dr.
courageous point of the fact that it all
content will need to be cleared by the
Election Commission we don't have any of
these details because the Election
Commission hasn't given us any of these
details they've asked for a response
from the IB Ministry but we don't know
what that response is Asha doji do you
believe the Election Commission is going
soft in the knees right now is the
Election Commission weaker or are the
politicians that much more powerful this
time Seafarer I think in the entire
panel which is oh Jesus which is here
probably I am the only one who has
covered when TN session was the Chief
Election Commission and I had seen how
election commission functions and how it
has created havoc for the politician and
imagine it was in early 1990s and at
that point of time nobody thought to the
Election Commission as the institution
could be independent and could create
problems for the politician but mr. t
unsession used the might of of the
institution and it has made election
Indian election a beauty what it was not
anymore
the point is today we are very
charitable with our words when we are
talking about Election Commission
Election Commission in my opinion
because I had seen TN session working I
had seen James Michael Ingo working
today Election Commission is dead and
buried let's not talk about Election
Commission at all
how can you imagine here is a prime
minister who is saying when they're all
Gandhi is going to file his nomination
he's saying the majority has become
minority and minority has become
majority and that is why he has gone -
it's a clear-cut violation of the of the
of the model code of conduct there is
there cannot be a more brazen in the
blatant violation and today he has again
used the Bala code can you imagine
something like this ever happening and
what Election Commission is doing
Election Commission can issue a notice
to my Abbate because she asked what in
the name
of Muslims but Election Commission has
not issued notice to the prime minister
of this country who happens to be the
top leader of the BJP on the issue of
majority minority issues he the Election
Commission will not file a note will not
send a notice to the Prime Minister on
the issue of Bala code the prime the
Election Commission will not send a
notice to yogi Adityanath he has made a
statement there are passed to earlier
hamari pass butter and jelly what can I
be like Jim Commission we have today
Election Commission is not independent
today Election Commission has become a
Department of Government of India
directly reporting to whomsoever I dunno
I don't want to spell out the fact is
these retired bureaucrats have have
become saucer while I am sorry to use
this word so servile that they are not
loyal to the institutions but they are
loyal to their political masters and it
is because of this today the election
this election has become completely
partisan and it is supporting only one
sorry to use these words but sometimes
one has to use it well unfortunately
analyzing there isn't anybody who agrees
with you at this point go ahead I know
you want to respond unella Singh go
ahead I am NOT okay I am not bothered
with whether anybody agrees to me or not
but I don't
I totally disagree what Asha goes he has
said right now okay he cannot blame each
and every serving bureaucrat like that
but bureaucrats bureaucrats are working
another under the political leadership
they are not working for the Institute's
you are absolutely incorrect and
bureaucrats do not work that way there
may be few who may get influenced by
their political Akash or they sell their
soul is political occurs but majority of
the bureaucrats they are very much true
to their work no I do not agree to it
it's realize the reason we're having
this conversation is because 66 senior
bureaucrats wrote a letter and let me
what second let me take this back to mr.
Romani when contention the reason is you
want to bash Prime
you want not know where we are having
this discussion because you want to bash
Prime
technology you want to bash chief
minister yogi havoc Nagi you do not want
to discuss about others who who are
continuously saying all those things or
doing all those things which Election
Commission doesn't allow the no sir one
second so analyzing analyzing if you one
second I don't know sing listen to my
question I really absolutely Jason Lisa
Vasily general abaca can i okay that
there are other people who are
continuously doing things one second
ma'am you said there are other people
who are continuously doing things that
the Election Commission doesn't allow so
you accept that the Election Commission
is a toothless paper tiger that nobody
respects right now because everybody is
going out of doing whatever they please
and the Election Commission has done
nothing to stop my avati it has done
nothing to stop a study Thea not it has
done nothing to stop the Prime Minister
Anila Singh can you hear me
we'll come back to
we're going back to mr. Wang Qishan mr.
Wang Qishan the 66 you know bureaucrats
who okay one second Ashutosh go ahead
see i just want to remind you that mr.
wen mr. Narendra Modi was the Chief
Minister of Gujarat how he lump earned
and communal eyes even this situation of
Election Commission he used to call
James Michael Lindo and used to stress
on the word Michael because the purpose
was well a link mr. Lindo did not
succumb to the pressure that election
should be pre porn or should be held
before so he continuously fought with a
very powerful chief minister and he did
not succumb and that is why his name was
used a specific focus insistence was on
the word Michael to communal eyes the
the electorate of Gujarat it's a
different matter altogether whether they
did it make a difference or not but yes
he did win the election but the fact
that the same man is again using the
similar words I am just saying there is
a history behind it and if Election
Commission do not want to interfere in
this do not want to to correct that the
language of the Prime Minister I do not
know where this election will lead
because we are still the first phase of
polling it still has to happen and lot
more gutter words will be spoken by all
all all kinds of politician I am not
only talking about mr. Prime Minister
even every other political party that
even the top leaders are using the same
language and if Election Commission do
not want to control then there is no
future for them then it's better to
remain as the Department of the
Government of India mr. vegetation just
taking you back to the letter right now
in the instances that you have brought
up you've brought up at number seven the
statement made by mr. they--there not
the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh
where he brought up you know Modi Cocina
you've also talked about other instances
of the language do you agree with mr.
shaileshwar Lee and Asha toch that there
is a dangerous precedent of hate and
divisiveness in this
election that go if it's unchecked will
actually change India permanently before
I go to the subject of hate yes which we
have discussed in point eight of our
letter yes I'll just mention briefly on
two other points where I slightly
disagree with what mr. Qureshi has said
and with what was stated otherwise
number one is as far as No More channel
is concerned I would like to draw your
attention to section 39 of the
representation of people's Act which
gives the Election Commission the power
to control the airwaves in one sense in
the sense that the Election Commission
can decide about allocation of time on
cable TV and related electronic media
between different parties and so on now
my point is that when you start creating
channels tomorrow if every politician in
the country starts creating a channel we
are going to have mayhem so I think
there has to be some sort of a code some
sort of a regulation built in here to
prevent us running amok as far as TV
channels are concerned also because
there'll be no control on it that's one
point the second point is as far as the
powers of the Election Commission are
concerned article 324 is very clear the
Supreme Court rulings are very clear the
Election Commission has wide-ranging
powers which go beyond the laws of the
land if the law of the land is silent on
any point the Supreme Court says that
the Election Commission can pay past
necessary orders even when the law is
silent so that means that nothing
prevents the Election Commission from
going ahead as far as the third issue is
concerned you know this is our usual
sort of example of what about arre you
know I'm sort of abusing you so but
others are abusing me so let's all sort
of abuse each other but the point we
have made in point number eight of our
letter is all hate speech should be
proceeded against very promptly and very
sort of decisively by the Election
Commission it is a fact as mr. Gandhi
said that this is one of the worst
elections as far as and this is the
trend that has built up over the past
few years
it is one of the worst elections as far
as viciousness is concerned in terms of
no decorum no decency as far as language
is concerned and unfortunately when one
party started other parties started
everyone is indulging in the same sort
of rhetoric so I think her point that we
are making is that very firm action must
be taken in each and every case of
violation of decency civilized norms and
dignity of the individual regardless of
the importance of that person the
stature of that person and so on as far
as the point you made regarding the
you PCM is concerned we had made the
point in our letter that the Election
Commission gave what I would not even
call a rap in the knuckles you know it
was more or less like a teacher telling
a student key by ugly bars or a deathly
and I as a math karna I think this is
being a little too lenient you had
already wants there are two thousand
thirteen directions the Election
Commission want again don't use the army
now when you say don't use the army
don't use their pictures don't use their
photos it obviously also means don't
talk about them you don't keep talking
about individual cases then saying that
you know they've done this they've done
that and this using of a particular you
know characterizing the army as of a
particular person followed by whatever
statements were made today
I think clearly indicate that we are not
learning our lessons so somewhere the
Election Commission has to come down
with a much heavier hand and say look
you people have to follow certain norms
as far as civilized talk is concerned
well I have some interesting questions
that our viewers are raising as well
with the heart fair see Percy has a
question saying can the Indian citizen
complain about the Election Commission
of India and if they want to who do they
complain to dr. Qureshi if there is a
citizen who wants to complain about the
Election Commission who do they complain
to well
dozens have complained to the president
these sixty-six civil servants and
citizens and they've complained and I
think they can write in the media they
have a voice some days the voice will be
heard somewhere well there's another
question from AM ratio dev and I'll take
this one to Ashutosh embrace yada wants
to know why is the court not stepping in
and asking for a report from the ECI
obviously no court can step in unless
someone brings a petition before the
court but I think that basically the
question is who is the body above the
Election Commission during elections
Ashutosh phae-phae I just hey I just
want to make a small correction when
they elected even there when the
election process has begun then the
court cannot intervene that's uh that
that's one of the one of the basic
fundamentals yes one can go to the court
one can always petition in the court
court can always the the verdict can
pass over deck but as a matter of
practice once the election process has
begun court has no jurisdiction and they
should not interfere in in the matter
the issue is not about with the coat one
interfere or not within the food that
the president wanted the issue is why
the institutions are crumbling today and
Election Commission I can tell you
during the sessions time everybody from
freshly to Kanyakumari used to know the
name of mr. T and session everybody knew
the name of James Michael link doe but
today you ask anybody on the road people
will not know who is the Chief Election
Commissioner of this country very few
people will be knowing Sunil Arora as
the Chief Election Commissioner that's
the difference because session became a
cult figure in this time because session
used election commission to create an
institution which made Indian democracy
we all are proud of otherwise before
Election Commission before tea on
session Election Commission was a pocket
institutions of the Communist Party and
others who we're in the in the
government but session took it out from
the pocket made it what it is and that
is how Indian elections became very very
peaceful and very very clean but not
anymore
absolutely and I'll open this up to
responses from my panel but we have
one on the phone line art kay Aria on
the phone line from Delhi Mysterio
good evening go ahead would you maybe
distinguished panelists what we see
every day that the model of Code of
Conduct which has come into force and it
is the duty of duty of Salomon duty of
the election commissioner who we seem to
have lost that connection mr. shanly
shanthi just yesterday in the day and on
Friday we were talking about the amount
of cash that is being seized across the
country the amount of black money that's
actually doing the rounds today we're
talking about violations of the code it
almost seems like it's you know the
gloves are off there are no rules being
applied in this you know in this
particular election and to just pick up
the points that mr. Van creation made
even when the Election Commission has
has taken action it's been a soft
warning or a gentle sort of nudge they
haven't sent out any serious notices
they haven't debarred anybody there's no
there hasn't been any real action so far
at all oh it's this disappointing to you
as a citizen absolutely this is looking
like a WWF which is very sad and one
thing which the officers or the letter
also mentions is transfer of officials
why should officials be transferred
during elections at all at all I am
saying and if an officer is misbehaving
suspend him stop this transfer then this
whole concept of saying the officer is
not doing properly so we'll transfer him
either suspend him and as a basic rule
do not transfer officials that's
happening routinely right now I think
everywhere across the country I keep
hearing some official transferred from
you at some official transferred from
Lee is this right and let's get people
of character we can damage the idea of
India if we do not take care if you do
not have ethics we do not have it fixed
controlling the way viewer and
particularly in terms of religion there
is a clear move to divide the nation to
divide communities based on caste
religion all this was there earlier I am
NOT saying it was not there
was never so open right now everybody is
referring it to it very openly and this
is very dangerous and not for the good
of India and I wish the Election
Commission wakes up then it has a duty
towards the nation it has a duty which
must fulfill properly because we've got
democracy we've got India both can be
damaged very seriously the Election
Commission doesn't take action I never
sing here's my question when yogi
Adityanath made a statement Sigma DG
Cocina he old mr. Raj not sing today
offered an explanation saying moose a
nickel yoga it was a slip of the tongue
so how is it possible that the Prime
Minister made a statement like this
today after the Election Commission inch
introduced a clarification and a
reiteration of the rules on Friday
saying that you cannot do this today he
made a statement saying first time
voters must pledge their vote to the
martyrs of poleramma
what does this mean analyzing is it not
in violation of the code I don't think
so and if it is then Election Commission
will do its job and what is what is the
harm when the Prime Minister appeals to
all the first-time voters that you
should come out and vote and you should
vote for all the martyrs for all the
soldiers for our nation for each and
every citizens for all the people who
are contesting this election so I don't
think there is anything wrong in that
but I have a question from our Satoshi
just now he mentioned the names of the
two previous Election Commissioners what
rest of them were doing ah Satoshi you
should declare that as well one of them
one of them is a co-panelist as well mr.
khureshi
what about him didn't he didn't he do
his job properly let me make this very
clear I think oh you're no no let let
let let me let you answer and you know I
think what you are trying to you are
trying you are trying to create some
kind of politics with
me in mr. khureshi sir I have a
tremendous respect for mr. Christian
Qureshi she has done a tremendous job
but I can also I also want to tell you
that how this situation is crumbled the
Toit's is started missing don't
interrupt
I have a solution because because you
want to do politics because you want to
do politics you even you want to do
politics please do politics and you are
very good at that
the point is very so much what the point
I was trying to make is that unless
institutions are being protected this
country will not survive I just want to
make a very small point the is the the
Election Commission made it a point that
army will not be used and after two days
of this announcement the BJP comes out
with a lower with with the film in that
film which was released by the prime
minister mr. Modi the pictures of the
army men were used and nothing has
happened Election Commission did not
even bother to send a notice to the BJP
there cannot be a bigger tragedy than
this that you make an announcement you
don't want to act on that and everybody
has seen those those pictures on the
social media and other platforms well
let me make it very clear to Anila Singh
when you say you don't see anything
wrong miss Singh let me tell you what is
wrong the Election Commission's
guidelines say very clearly no
politician is to use the photograph or
the mention of the forces in their
campaigns they are to desist from using
the forces in elections in any way this
is precisely what the Prime Minister did
today but I saw miss Amitabha Amitabha
Pandey his hand go up as a body go ahead
you had a point to make yeah I'd like to
make a few quick points first of all I'd
like to remind people that in 2009 UPA
assembly elections all co-panelists was
sy Qureshi as the Chief Election
Commissioner
ordered the BSP to drape all the
elephants in the in the Box created by
Mohammed II because the elephant was the
symbol of the BSP and he felt that it
would have an undue influence
on wooden behavior now this was one kind
of exemplary order where something quite
innocuous certainly not illegal was
frowned upon by the Chief Election
Commissioner and he ordered that they
should be draped and covered and that
order was carried out now is that the
kind of Election Commission we expect to
have now to the Election Commission has
enormous powers it is the only agency
which has a completely open-ended remit
and for the conduct of fair elections it
can intervene in in ways in which no
other Authority can because it is not
bound
it is not self conscripted by in any
manner three when the elections are so
polarized and so divisive the role of
the Election Commissioner becomes doubly
trebly so much more important because
this is the time when all kinds of when
when the animus is high this is the time
when they have to come down much more
strongly on on the ruling party and
fourthly the ruling party because it is
the party in power has to be far more
circumscribed in this circumspect in the
exercise of power and to be seen as
being behaving as having the high volume
ground now the onus is on the Election
Commissioner to ensure that the ruling
party does not misuse or abuse its power
because it is in a position to do so and
therefore to say that why aren't we
saying the same things about the
opposition because the opposition is not
in power so therefore their
responsibility is to some extent diluted
by the fact that they don't control the
levers of power at this stage well I
want to ask mr. khureshi
dr. Gracie this question dr. grey what
can the Election Commission do in these
cases what what is the extent of the
power is it because so far we've seen
soft warnings being handed out but do
you believe there is perhaps merit here
for stronger action
I think so I think they because the all
the model code is not a law but its
moral authority is very high and coming
down heavily on any violation is
expenses of the Election Commission in
fact I would like to mention that in my
time all those were pardoned by talking
about myself
we touched he did not one not two but
three Union ministers including the law
minister of the land who is our
administrative minister who gives us the
budget who the answers Parliament
questions for us and since he well it is
the model code we censured him and there
is no appeal against the censure so we
went to that extent of course I made a
lifelong enemy which is alright but then
these are the kind of actions which are
expected of us we may be I sometimes I
feel maybe I was extra harsh on the
Congress because you know some people
might say that I am Congress appointee
must be soft on them they after all is a
human but at the same time airing on the
other that side perhaps was better than
being soft
dr. Qureshi when you say the Election
Commission has the ability to issue a
censure could you explain to us sorry
I'm not my audience what that would mean
yes centuries you know when you would
give a model code notice and the
explanation is received one is that you
just say no no there is no violation and
if you think that is violation there of
course all the action that you can take
is warning caution or very polite known
that you don't do it again or censure
censure also is actually conviction
there will not be a sentence there a
fine because that is what Election
Commission cannot do but then also at
the same time one is the model code
again under which we have to take action
but also most of the things also are the
sections of different laws if something
which arouses communal disharmony it is
153 a of the IPC so the parallel action
under the laws also is there very
necessary but finally I would like to
mention the importance of the morale
thority of the model code you know there
was insane sitting in my time when go
election was happening better Manohar
Parrikar was the Chief Minister we heard
that there was a by-election and he was
going to make that candidate a minister
I sent an advise to the 2 meter of the
Parrikar that please don't do this
because this will disturb the low level
playing field he called me up the next
morning very angry with me and he said
that this is his constitutional right I
said really I said yeah of course it is
your constitutional right but we feel he
filled it up the level playing field his
response was heartwarming he said I
sacrificed my constitutional right to
the moral authority of the model code
you know that is the kind of response we
expect from the politicians and don't
forget the model code was a creation of
political parties themselves in the 60s
those the people created this code for
themselves and today the our leadership
is bent on violating it I think there's
something to be concerned about do you
see in the list of you know nine
violations listed out by these civil
servants do you see or you know
violations there that merit censure from
the Election Commission in your opinion
there's no way I would not like to
become a parallel or a shadow Election
Commission that I sit in judgment on
each one of them I can only make a
general remark and in any case for me
particularly is very awkward to comment
on one institution which is the Election
Commission I can talk on any other but
not about it the Commission which I
chaired once upon a time fair enough
toxic Rishi we have Francis on the phone
line from Pune Francis go ahead - good
evening and evening to all the panelists
my only question is to the Election
Commission today it's basically if you
know somebody is doing one offence or
he's a repeated offense or I mean if you
could see that you know people are going
and breaking the code of conduct you
know in a case of mr. yogi Adityanath
you know he was given a very soft you
know warning saying that you know better
be careful the next time now this what
happens is he's doing this for granted
and probably you know he
very well particularly knows that you
know this is not going to you know
probably hamper is a rallies so my only
question or rather I just want to know
is whether the Election Commission can
put down policies or laws if you're a
repeat offender you will be suspended
for a particular one next time of 15
days time is it possible and if not why
can't this be implemented so that we
arrange would know that you know it is
going to maker an offense of a repeated
or similar nature yes so someone who is
a repeated offender could they be
suspended from public meetings or mr.
Gandhi just one will captain Jeff Paul
on the phone line from Rosa go ahead
good evening captain general thanks to
your channel for tapes where every once
again breaking up an issue so that the
conscious of the people is shaken they
know what the job they have to do the
topic that hill vehicle if the present
government is totally opaque and we will
the spokespersons is back to ask
grace and shame to come on the TV and to
give us a dose that we can't take
anymore please go and tell the party
that the people are highly offended
don't do it during the election yes yes
I understand captain Jeff Paul thank you
for calling us last word to shylack Andy
mr. Gandhi
I suppose you know people being offended
is is perhaps a good way to put it
because the Indian citizen at some point
is going to feel like our politicians
are not giving us any enough credit for
being intelligent I believe
Commission has a great moral standing
and it's my moral standing that you
stand out a censure from the Election
Commission in front of media would be so
harsh on any part or any political party
and if this was done once or twice the
message would go today just imagine if
the Election Commission were to issue a
censor you you will yourself be
reporting on that and every TV channel
in every medium will be reporting on
that yes nothing can be worse than that
it's a moral authority that you got to
exercise absolutely we have run out of
time on this conversation I want to
thank our guests specifically mr. Pandey
and mr. Manku Titian for making time to
share your thoughts with us and dr. Cory
sheet is always a pleasure to interact
with you and understand the workings of
the election commission I thank you all
for being so generous with your time
this evening in conclusion to my viewers
Lupita's put this in a nutshell for you
sixty-six retired bureaucrats very very
senior bureaucrats special secretaries
former secretaries additional chief
secretaries of state government's
principal advisors to the Finance
Ministry including the formula of tenant
governor of Delhi mr. Rajiv Jeong have
signed a letter 66 of them have signed a
letter bringing into question the lack
of action from the Election Commission
to the various violations of the codes
that have taken place and they have
listed out these violations and made
arguments for every single one of them
they believe and I quote that the
Election Commission's independence
fairness impartiality and efficiency are
compromised today they believe that
there is constant abuse and blatant
disregard for the model code of conduct
by the ruling party at the center and
the Election Commission is not coming
down hard enough on these violations
they have also said that the credibility
of the Commission is at an all-time low
and this will have grave consequences
for the future of our democracy we
appeal along with these 66 bureaucrats
to the Election Commission to take his
job more seriously because for the
period of the model code of conduct and
the election period which is unusually
long this time the entire democracy
solely in the hands of the Election
Commission and we rely on the Election
Commission to protect that democracy by
conducting free and fair elections and
by fair we mean you need to be able to
create a level playing field thanks for

worst cyclone 180 km/h huge trees right

there is no result purpose all right
this also happened soon Lisa we are who

not informed us lake house I won't cycle

came to know this is no secular so
office work is cyclone we were using

debate they are four o'clock traveling
the manifesto however stayed silent on
any targets for job creation but the BJP
sankalpa tro says they will encourage
startups and increase the number of
seats in educational institutions by at
least 50%
opposition parties have predictably
chunked the more the manifesto calling
it a Joomla Patra instead of launching a
manifesto BJP should launch an apology
letter instead of a Sun Calcutta BJP
should launch a mafia patter for
inserting or injecting a lethal
injection of unemployment farmer suicide
closing of businesses and putting the
youth towards picada employment mirror
now asks after 2014's weakest plank has
the BGP moved on to zero terror
tolerance for 2019
it's counter terror and strengthening
defense BJP is number one priority has
BGP is 2019 manifesto failed to address
the job crisis does BJP is 2019
manifesto - enough to address the
agrarian crisis let's debate
so with this manifesto the BJP has put
out its poll narrative what is the
narrative what is the message the BGP
sending to the country right now on
first sight of course the question of
nationalism that was front and center
and the first announcement made in that
manifesto also farmers traders and the
Hindu hasta with the Monday was a
largely continuing message sent out by
the BJP but consistently missing from
this manifesto well projects like smart
cities any mention of jobs and any
mention of cows we've put together a
panel that will help us analyze this
manifesto to decide if it is in fact on
track and if this is the right message
that will strengthen the BJP stand going
into elections over the next three days
on the show with me
melancholy for the BJP born guru Swami's
a senior economist nee cha-cha three
senior journalists Sanjay Jha for the
Congress Aman Agarwal
director Athenian issue of Finance DRAM
children is also senior journalist in
with me Vinatieri our consulting editor
at The Times Network I welcome all of
you to this conversation thank you for
joining us opening statements from all
of our guests miss Chaudhary I will
start with you it's a pleasure to have
you on the channel good evening your
reaction to the BJP is manifesto do you
believe it addressed the issues do you
believe it strengthens the party stand
going forward into the elections it's
played on you know expectedly it is
focused as you were saying on
nationalism fueling its agenda and that
is about conquering terror stopping
infiltrators and so on so on
nationalistic more muscular a policy
that BJP plans to pursue and part of
that is what it's reiterated abrogation
of article 370 and of 35 a which has
been added but that is part of its core
agenda so Kashmir the different handling
of Kashmir than the way it has been done
is very much something that the BJP is
now putting forth as one of its main
agendas but it's pursued its core agenda
also Monday though you know like last
time exactly repeat of last time
facilitating the Monday in cordial
atmosphere within the constitutional
framework you know incidentally I must
tell you if that's just then two trips
to turf adesh and I found not one person
spoke about man that not one so
obviously when the party makes it up it
becomes an issue when the party you know
brings down the temperature it is not an
issue but that apart also the
citizenship amendment bill is given a
categorical assurance that it will pass
it despite the despite in the in the
northeast of India so I would say this
agenda is worrying as far as the
peripheries of an India go whether it's
J&K whether it's a not peace whereas
it's really going for Heartland in
Heartland India in a major way through
what it's put out today I have other
things to say but for the moment it's
not that well that's very fair a minute
very interesting point all right raised
by nature Chaudhary that it's the
extremities of the country that ought to
be worried is there enough here for see
the south of India which is perhaps very
focused on farming and very focus on the
services industry there
not salaried people in the south of
India do you see this as Miss Chaudhary
said going for the heartland the Hindi
Heartland off of the country leaving
everybody else out are they very clear
about where their target is right now
yes very obviously not only that I think
they're also very clear about internally
I mean I won't expect mr. Tony to admit
that at all but I can tell you that you
can clearly see that there are certain
strokes they're playing on the front
foot and there are many many strokes on
the back foot yes the front foot stroke
of course is nationalism internal
security very important issue for sure
and it's very obvious they will go to
the spas with that but I think what they
have left unsaid or half said is perhaps
more revealing which is this the
complete absence of cows for instance or
anything to do with Kabul for in the
manifesto the absence of any emphasis on
Ganga for instance it was a big part of
the 14 campaign is not there at all this
is mentioned it's a small mention the
schemes aimed at appeasing the traders
the insurance scheme that they promised
for anyone who's under the under the you
know the tax regime the the GST regime
is a move aimed at knowing that there is
some amount of dissonance in that part
the farmer schemes that they've
announced the whether it is the end
scheme for pensions for farmers who are
over 60 years old or the credit card
loans that they've allowed obviously
suggests that they know there is a
distress plus a bit of reaction to what
the Congress has put in their manifesto
so clearly there are three or four
backfoot strokes there is one front foot
stroke in terms of nationalism and the
absence of few things very clearly
indicating that they know those issues
are not resonating on the ground well if
you if you're using the cricket analogy
which were they always does and you're
going to go with back fruit in front
then this then the you know the ball
that came towards them on jobs was
totally let just let to pass straight to
the keeper that was very very goes jobs
it has been a big issue and I think
every opinion poll that is being done by
every single net news network suggests
that people believe that employment is
one of the biggest issues right now to
find no obvious mention of it of course
there are derivatives office when the
government says they will invest a lakh
crore in infrastructure the derivative
is it will create jobs because that's
obviously if there isn't but that is a
derivative that's not a stated obvious
position that you've taken there's no
new formula or scheme or any promise on
jobs in that sense yes well let me bring
in Allen :
mr. Kohli you've heard the arguments so
far I'll keep bringing you in for
responses mr. Autry felt
373 5 a 35 a Mundell Civil Code there
was mention of Sabri mala citizenship
Amendment Bill this was largely playing
into the existing sort of religion
community based agenda focused largely
on central India Vinay rightfully
bringing up the issue of jobs cows Ganga
not being mentioned at all and even
farmer had a sort of passing mention not
really a plan so from your point of view
what is the messaging that we were
putting out that it's nationalism over
because this time you'll have to you'll
have to first I think look at what mr.
Jaitley said yesterday when he pointed
out the three themes there are the
driving themes for very comfy read by
Modi Sarkar is Amanda's circa which
means a government that has been honest
there is not a corruption scam on this
combined and you have to keep in mind in
contrast to the 2014 elections when
corruption was a huge issue and that was
the promise of the government and we
will give you a cleaner administration
but a near nail in a valley circuit
whether it's ayushman Bharath 50 crore
as the target 20 lakh beneficiaries as
update 35 crore people in the Financial
Inclusion
which is in the banking sector whether
it is 13 or 14 current people who have
taken loans under mudra for self
employment small maybe to medium sized
loans so therefore that's the next thing
we are saying and the third part which
we said is come Carmel Valley sell car a
circuit that has not been within
decision a government that's moved ahead
now when you look at an al pick up from
where when he left it on jobs I think we
need to understand the change that
earlier over maybe 50 years of the first
50 years of our democracy all after
independence it was always jobs will the
government being the provider and we
know what's the impact which has been on
the public sector units etc today the
whole push is on self-employment and the
manifesto is clear in terms of pushing
self-employment even in the last one so
I'll take jobs on first now there is a
whole set of people who would say
official data is not out and argue
there's a second thing which comes up
which is the derivative way of looking
at it you can't have a 7% growth you
can't have manufacturing going up you
can't have say mobile phones
from 3 to 120 or 525 units you can't
have airports almost doubling you can't
have highways doubling and no jobs it
doesn't make sense and the BJP winning
the vast majority of elections in this
period the second is when we talk about
the rights of our self for employment if
I take the CII survey of MSME they serve
it and that's their report not mine 101
lat 5,000 units and their estimate is
thirteen point nine to fifteen point
four million jobs every year so there so
therefore the job debate when you look
at it we look at the EPM data we look at
these kind of data and say yes jobs are
being created there are others who look
at only in your jobs in the organized
sector so it's an argument the second
part is to what Nietzsche says and I'd
like to also say if you are talking
about tapped pipe water for everyone or
electricity for all Opaka houses how is
the periphery of India kept out of it in
citizen amendment bill we are on record
I deal with the northeast I'm in charge
of three states in the Northeast we have
said it we are sensitive to the worries
that each state has that does not mean
we we are you know trying to bulldoze
something up there if you look at ramen
there I'll also leave Jaji and I say it
with humility and it's an honest
confession
I am surprised when I travel at 4:00 on
flights and I travel in and I am at
airports people walk up to me and talk
of Ram temple so I mean I I would also
have initially thought and it's an
honest confession that this would have
been a rural issue this may have been an
octuple issue but of airports across the
country and I'm not saying on a daily
basis but you're and they're on a flight
or at an airport someone does come and
talk about wrong but it's a colleague if
I offend you therefore I would not
accept that it's a non-issue if I may
just ask you one question you did
mention mobile phone units you know and
because mobile phone units have
increased let's remember that most of
the mobile phone units we buy in this
country I mean in China
also while airports have increased
airlines are shutting down and the
airline's really are the larger
employers and the airport's but that
aside D monetization for example found
no mention in the manifesto and we were
already monetization that it's an
ongoing process against black money sure
in that process have been ongoing now as
well saying this is how we're going to
take it forward but there was no mention
of it at all there was no mention
of GST tax structures or what your going
to do in that area so I just want to
understand why was the monetization left
out very simple I can answer all of them
let me first come the airline is a
business by a private entity it's not
run by government of India and you're
referring to jet so jet in fact if I may
point out SBI has taken a lead in trying
to see it can be so that's not and if
you're saying about airports more people
are flying 12 crore Indians have flown
that's the highest me they have
overtaken railways so where is that
coming it also points to affluence so
therefore you can't have an argument
that the country is going jobless and
the country is collapsing and people are
taking flights more than they take
trains so I mean everything has to be
seen in a context you have asked on D
monetization the fight against black
money is a continuing fight from the
first day when you had the first cabinet
meeting and the SI T that was formed to
the laws that have been amendment and
out of D monetization the data that has
comes on three and I lack fifty thousand
crores is under scrutiny now that will
follow due process of law as an advocate
I'm saying that you can't just simply
say that now the money is under
investigation we are going to seize it
Dave it will be at the AOS level and you
go to the CIT level and year after year
something or the other will keep getting
resolved and Ivana ties ation by
political argument that immediately
after D monetization was the
authorization election we got a mandate
that no party in the history of India
has ever got 324 with our ally no party
has got so much right after D
monetization you don't need to mention
the same things that are work in
progress the vision is about what all we
wanna do what we are doing we haven't
discarded that process continues it has
to that's how you build further and
that's what let me offer rebut let me
bring in rebuttals but I also want to
point out that as of this election the
cash seizure tally has now gone up gone
past 500 crore rupees this is 200 crore
piece higher than it was in all of 2014
selection so in terms of black money it
seems to be alive and kicking and
thriving at the point at this point in
the country but go Sanjay Sanjay Jha of
the Congress glory be to mr. Kohli and I
bring in the economists mr. J please
okay okay uh you know my friend mr.
Kohli
started by saying that corruption is not
an issue in this election well I want to
say that we have mentioned Nollan in our
manifesto that the rafael scam will be
investigated the Prime Minister will be
investigated and we will take it to its
logical conclusion in fact I thought you
will agree because ever since we started
the Chokey thought sure hey slogan you
responded by saying may he chocodiles so
you recognized it was hurting you
politically it's a big issue and we will
take it up
point number two nullius said that you
know you know there is so much of growth
and development so jobs are happening
the truth is say that the GDP number
itself has become questionable I mean
you you know that some eminent
economists have written publicly that
India's integrity of our data has now
become questionable our figures out no
longer you know deemed credible is
seamless suspect and people look at it
like it's being compared to China so we
have a serious problem that's one of the
reasons why joblessness is huge but the
GDP figure and the job figure have no
compatibility it's a serious problem I'm
gonna bring you back to the manifest
basically thing in our opinion yes that
I'm asking that if you look at this
manifesto it is a public admission by
Narendra Modi's government that as far
as jobs are concerned former distress is
concerned private investment is
concerned they have failed because the
truth is that at the end of the day this
is the slogan on which he won the 2014
elections but the back the ultimate
barometers of growth our jobs are you
know how is the economy getting
investments now let me give you one
example fair and I want you to ask this
question to mr. Kohli I wouldn't like to
do that his party questioned me and my
colleagues on all television shows that
Debbie announced now where are you going
to get this 3.60 lakh crores from I
would ask nilin Kohli today where is he
going to get a hundred lakh crores from
for India's infrastructure where is he
going to get 25 lakh crores to suddenly
invest in agriculture I mean these are
like numbers which are mythical
fantasies if 3 lakh arose was sweating
and you know was causing so much of
grief to the BJP for 20%
India's bottom of the pyramid for 1 lakh
corrodes and 25 lakh crores I want to
ask him where is this money coming from
so this basically man said let him
answer is such a clear in my opinion is
a hub bug it's an attempt to hoodwink
the people mr. Kohli Oh quick rebuttal
and I'll bring in the economist mr.
Kohli go ahead three statements of
course three statements I mean the
Congress is entitled to write fiction
also in their manifesto as they've done
with a friend who's stopping them
whether it's fiction or it's a fantasy
if they write whatever they wish to put
on paper the second argument is with
regard to about 12 and a half lakh crows
in my figures right is the total amount
that has gone for rural development
agriculture all put together doubling it
is a target and how why shouldn't it be
done you had in if I look at direct
taxes only they've gone up from six lakh
grows to about ten point or lakh crows
and we are talking about expansion and
we have seen a robust growth of the tax
base as also in tax collection GST
there's been ups and downs
one-thousandth but yes it still been
overall in the right direction
the third point was about three points
it about a hundred thousand this come on
Sanjay you also understand basically
called the it does not mean only the
government does it you also had build
operate owned or transfer bought you've
got different schemes you've got the
private player partnership that takes
place on roads infrastructure and all
that you can have investments in it it
need not be something taken from the
bank on a loan and self-generated there
are so many different models to it and
that's been how it has been globally why
should India be an exception we know
what we are talking and we'll do what we
are talking take up most of the time all
this panel but I would quickly bring in
whenever I do different arguments
but it's your panel but on on the
arguments that they are making on the
issue so on one hand are the things that
the BGP has brought up but the other
issues that we have been talking about
the farmer issue the jobs issue there
are there are various issues that are
very real do you believe you agree more
with mr. jaha at this point to mr. Kohli
do you think that the the BJP manifesto
does enough to say we've done so well
and we're now just going to take this
forward well look the trouble with the
ruling party's manifesto is that they
have to be defensive about certain
things that are continuing because if
they say there is a
they're admitting their failure in the
last five years and they don't do that I
mean no ruling party's manifesto
actually ever admits anything even if
it's a serious problem in 2009 the
congressman if Esther didn't really
admit anything which was had gone wrong
in the first five years and they were
only promising the moon for the coming
five so there is a compulsion that a
ruling government has in any case but
the trouble is that if you look at the
larger narrative that is being set by
the do parties that's for me is the
bigger giveaway now very obviously the
BJP has consciously decided that
nationalism is perhaps the only
overarching subject that can bring in
the kind of unity or the unifying force
that they need look sail them through
and remember me whether mr. Coley admits
are not the three reverses in the three
states of multiple deities can
understand have played a bit on their
mind because a lot of the missing
elements in this policy are a result of
that or a lot of the loosing emphasis
the reinfestation nationalism is also
meant to paper over certain problems
that are obviously there and by however
much we may say farming distress like
2022 farmers income being doubling is a
continuation of the last nicest to as
well it was mentioned in 2014 as well
objectively one could ask the question
in 2019 has it actually reached anywhere
close to double the answer is no so
clearly there is a problem and that
problem has not been addressed because
they can't address that what they can't
admit that openly guruswami senior
economist joins us right now mr. Goswami
do the numbers add up or are they enough
numbers in this manifesto to even do any
math on it I thought the Congress
party's manifesto the Malthus was you
know not sitting together but this one
just flies in the face of logic they're
talking of spending a hundred crores on
infrastructure in the next five years an
average of 20 crores 20 lakh crores
a year and you know how much they spent
last year five lakh crores that means
that next year is going to go up a 400%
now where is this money going to come
from you know so they're playing with
numbers you know they talk about you
know lifting 50 crore people from from
power T what is the party line in India
two hundred two thousand calories a day
it translates through to a ridiculous
sum of money if you go by the
international standards today where the
world
UNDP standard 68% of India is below
poverty you know this is a minimum
living standard index now you know
poverty lines have to change because
none of these governments want to change
the power Thailand because if you change
the power T line definitional party line
you will have to aim development
differently now the the BJP is talking
about giving money to landowners you
know farmers every farmer gets about six
thousand rupees but the problem is 340
million landless laborer
what are you going to give it apart
about connecting you were talking about
pensions for 54 million small small
small retailers where is the money going
to come from how do you identify a small
retailer most retailers small retailers
in India are part time retailers there
sometime retailers you know when this
exists amytal they sell tomatoes so you
know how do you identify all the Swiss
promising you know this therefore is not
a funcle' but it's a ghost nut but just
like the last one knows last one said
100 new cities I thought it was very
exciting because was addressing a
problem urbanization under new cities of
2 million each now that quietly became
100 smart cities what did it mean giving
Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi provided by private
operators so the government they didn't
even plan anything they said high-speed
railway network connecting all the
metros nothing happened you just got one
side line you know we still not even
began work between am the bus and Bombay
so you see all these businesses just get
this over and if you are serious about a
manifesto why do you lose it two days
before the elections does the electorate
have time to now read it and understand
it do you have time to get the message
across
it's just a motion they're going to
gather guy released a manifesto so I
have to really release it - Cisco and
you know and grassman Singh says we
consulted six crore people before adding
this manifesto it's amazing how do you
consult six crew people you know I and
he said you know we had 17,000 boxes
I was just computing that each box will
have over 90,000 suggestions tapped into
it ro this is amazing
rubbish you know this is written by a
committee which came out to design the
house and ended up designing a camel you
know which is typical of a committee
everybody got something in and then
finally you know it all boils down to I
will build a temple because I can't do
anything with this with this country's
economy now we will clean Ganges up this
is important in the next five years what
did you do so prior last five years the
coliform content of the Ganges has
doubled in the last five years and
you're going to clean it over the next
five years you want people to believe
that you want this nation to believe
that you want any serious minded person
to believe that you know I'm a good role
is with us right now he's the director
of the Union should of Finance mr.
Agarwal do you agree that the numbers
don't add up that none of the promises
made right now sure they show the
numbers that none of it is realistic you
see when I look at both the manifestos
first of all manifestos are not supposed
to be mathematical jargons or budgets
which I did with the numbers are
supposed to match up they're supposed to
be expectations for tomorrow this will
be forecasts or what we're going to be
seeing tomorrow and how what kind of a
road path are we leaving to now when we
look at both the manifestos I see you
know the Congress manifesto coming in
from like a heart and the immediate
peace manifesto more towards the brain
where it's talking technically and
talking about what are they wanting to
do phasing out both of them touch almost
a similar aspect similar issues
throughout the country but then the
emotional aspect the social welfare
aspect the spending which is going to be
more inflation in nature is being
touched upon by the Congress manifesto
whereas the BGP manifesto talks about
target which are going to yield towards
GDP growth numbers certainly if the jobs
and the employment comes in the
secondary by-product factor but then it
is what is it is targeting is the GDP it
is talking about not only internal but
is talking about the external growth in
terms of how we see India growing
internationally and with the country as
well so in my opinion both the
manifestos are interesting to observe
but then you know
issue is that they have to the BJP
manifesto had also projected something
but they have done in the last five
years again taking it forward so they
have to keep the timeline in place and
bring it forward so from that
perspective they've done a good job in
terms of projecting what area is what
specifics and they're given specific as
this seventy five target which have been
outlined their specific targets now how
much can you achieve how much can you
not achieve will depend on large number
of factors but at least they can they
have started bringing out those
objectives which are target oriented and
which I mean I feel with the five
trillion we are already a trend you know
trillion economy in terms of PPP numbers
so you know we're looking at going that
way is not something which is not
achievable it is achievable it's a
question of wanting to move forward and
the BJP is laying down those stepping
stones to move forward as soon as as far
as I see the movement talking to people
on the ground students and other
communities across different parts of
the country I see there's a lot of hope
and faith which the BJP still enjoys as
against the Congress despite the
emotional touch which Congress has given
in the last two weeks well I want to
bring in mister am sure there mister TR
up to the senior journalist you've heard
all the arguments we surround children
to be fair when the Congress manifest
who came out we are I asked the question
repeatedly on the show as well where
will the money come from where will the
money come from how can you promise you
know this minimum basic income without
showing us where the money is going to
come from to say today that this you
know that manifesto is needing to be
mathematical they just have to be
directional would perhaps be unfair do
you believe that the BJP manifesto does
justice to the problems that the country
is currently facing well I think there
have been certain certain aspects in the
in the budget that they have really
presented I mean the manifesto that they
have presented which speaks about what
they intend doing over the next five
years but there have lot a lot of things
in the previous manifesto which has not
been really taken upon or discussed in
this last four and a half to five years
and I think they have probably done a
fairly good job on the ground
in at least you know taking development
forward and providing aid to some weaker
sections including women I think certain
aspects of this cannot be denied but the
fact remains that if the cylinder is to
cost 500 or upwards of 500 to 900 rupees
each I I think we all understand nobody
is in a position among the women to pay
that kind of an amount to buy a second
cylinder so in very many cases the the
the plan as such is a good one but in
very many cases most people have not
purchased a second cylinder to run the
gas stove at home there are various
other issues which are essentially
economic which comes into big play when
you present a manifesto of this kind
the BJP on the one hand has really tried
to strengthen what it has put in place
by way of taking facilities to the poor
but they have also tried to game bring
certain others into the ambit for
pensions and so on and so forth the
problem of farmers has hit them very
late and sorry to say that but the issue
is real and I don't think they can take
it lightly and they are not I think will
be foolish to say they're taking the
issue lightly joblessness despite my
good friend saying that you know in
numbers may not be there out there in
the open for everyone to see but the
kind of development that has taken place
must have necessarily led to job
creation and there are people who have
got jobs but why aren't the numbers out
why don't we we are after all 70 years
old
somewhere along the line again have to
create the statistics how do you really
work on things and improve situation if
you don't have the statistics in black
and white before you I am NOT this is
not a an effort to find fault and you
know protects the world shame or in
whatever has been done but there are
gray areas we need to be sorted out and
that is one thing we are not willing to
do whether it is the BJP or the Congress
and those grandiose schemes for everyone
but when it comes to implementation
there are problems yes several of us in
this in this discussion I've asked where
are you going to get the money for this
one economist categorically said they
budgeted for this one it went about or
it went below and what has now been
proposed for the next five years and
tails a much greater investment than is
anticipated by anybody so I think
development of the country is really
good but the Prime Minister is also
spoken about 2047 how this country is
going to look and we are going to be a
developed country and we are going to
lay the foundations for developing this
into a developing country in the next
five years so there are lot of things as
factors of what was really said today
but I think the the effort of the BJP is
to preempt the Congress because they
have not taken any initiative to present
their manifesto before the Congress at
least is the last two general election
all right so I last kiss they presented
the budget on the first field of fully
this time they've done it I want to pose
a different question before the panel
which is this do you think that this
manifesto will help the BJP chances in
any way over the next three or four days
because the aim will really I mean the
impact would only last about three or
four days so the first phase happens now
on the 11th do you think this manifesto
will help in any way look I have a bit
of a completely you know opposite view
on this I don't think manifestos
actually help or not help any party
because unfortunately and I'm using
unfortunately because that's the reality
ninety-five percent of Indians don't
read don't know what is written in the
main manifesto they have no idea but the
manifesto certainly allows a political
party and his leaders to give
headline-grabbing talking points in the
field that depends entirely on the
capability of how much you can hype up
what you've presented as the talking
point in a manifesto clearly for the
Congress the challenge will be to go and
hype up the nice scheme that they're
talking about and to be able to
communicate it to the people because
that's the only headline-grabbing think
that will work in the ground level
similarly for the BJP their calling card
is going to be nationalism school of the
internal security is going to be
terrorism
 it's not it's really about that I
think all the other semantics that we
are discussing are lost on majority of
the operation there and they don't
really care about that we really care
about the headline-grabbing aspect of
any power money same question to nature
Chaudhary mr. Chaudhary do you believe
that this manifesto will help the BJP in
any way is it something that will
trickle down because there isn't one
massive clear idea that can be taken to
the masses like when I said I think
they're focusing on nice nationalism as
their main certainly you know one thing
I will say here faith just to digress a
little okay one of the very good things
of the Prime Minister's speech if they
know that appeal to me personally is
that he talked about of course 2047 but
a vision about water you know if you
look at the problem that may confront
India in the next three to five decades
water is going to be on top of the
agenda that's of the world over and
being our country we haven't stopped
think started to think about this so to
talk about a judgeship a month Raleigh
specifically optimizing the use of river
water you know really thinking of water
as an issue in a serious way that was a
very good note the Prime Minister struck
but the disappointing was on education
very little Congress said 6% of the GDP
on education they had only increasing
seats jobs well you know somewhere both
parties need to say we need to think out
of the box on jobs how do we do it we
don't know how to do it so the others
can really come up with ideas and of
course you know a portion is a good you
know the nutrition agenda that they have
committed themselves to but to answer
your question to answer your question on
with village health it is a continuing
debate it's something that the BJP has
started them it'll reinforce them in
their whatever they want to push forward
as a message Congress has to take the
debate back to the economic issues jobs
where the BJP has been weak but one
thing I will say finally in a sense
manifestos have come of age no longer
you know what somebody said that we
don't
seriously today the opponent is making
you take it seriously how many times as
the Congress said panda I'll not change
a bank account may dock rejewski bartkey
so they're on the mat on this and the
BJP will similarly put the Congress on
the magnet good for US citizens it's
good for our citizens not equally do you
want to respond to what both Vinay and
Nijo just said about the manifesto and
the fact that is just being put out
there for narrative at this point I
won't agree with it fully the manifest
was a kind of a vision document but then
there is just there are issues that that
do fall into the implementation so I
would not say that it's a paper exercise
with no meaning that would be very very
pessimistic and cynical just on an aside
I had mentioned about PA gas connections
be the usual up in ladies not going out
there for the refill 82% are is the
figure of refill yes
18% is the gap but 82% by itself is
fairly impressive and it is because of
the odd ha linkage and although the
subsidy goes directly in the bank
account but coming back to the main
thing what Vinnie and you are saying I
think the second part is it's not that
you know that conversation on the
manifesto doesn't take place if you
would hear the Prime Minister's speeches
he is talking his performance there is a
whole range of issues he speaks there
are political issues there are issues
that are attack on the Kirk on the
opposition parties and then of course
there's the performance issues they all
form part of that 30 to 40 minutes when
he addresses these very very large
rallies from as small as 4 in file
50,000 is fairly big but to maybe 4
lakhs as we saw in Kolkata so in all of
it that's also part of the agenda which
is performance and then talking about
vision so I think it comes in different
ways to sit down and just be speaking
only on the manifesto certainly I don't
think that happens maybe owner debates
like this on the day the manifesto is
released but I'm certainly not cynical
about the manifesto being only a prayer
paper exercise well I can see Mr Bond
guru Swami has a rebuttal mr. Swamy go
ahead mr. Chow I'll come to you after
this mr. Goswami go ahead okay
but and the proof of the pudding is in
the eating doulas scheme now today the
survey reports say that 85% of the
households which have a cylinder don't
use this the gas they use the other
stuff because gas is still too expensive
for them and given their incomes now
today also the data is out that out of
the 0.6 percent of GDP we're spending on
on water that has now come down to 0.2%
we'll wrestle when he was used to build
toilets now you say what is important
and where is the money why why didn't
you spend the money now
you spoke you're not talking about the
water resources in receiving we always
had a water resources and you know how
see this rumor was was evidenced by the
fact that you made uma bharti the
Minister and the first thing she did was
she had a meeting with hundred sons and
I said we will now see how are we going
to clean the Ganges oh and nothing
happened now you see you can say things
as I am going to do this whatever 100
new cities and we'll do all kinds of
things but you were to do it you don't
have the means to do it you don't have
the admin set of abilities to do it you
don't have you haven't got the
bureaucracy reform to do it
there's no decentralization there is no
government in half the villages of this
country there's no evidence of
government even schoolteachers the
solitary representative of government in
many villages in many rural in upcountry
villages in the tribal areas the forest
guard is the representative government
what do these people get from from this
from from from the state will actually
become a stateless nation a large nation
without a state
now that the Congress nor the bishop is
willing to address this man one thing
said we will reform the bureaucracy will
reform governance Modi said will reform
the raucous evil to form governs they
don't do it so you don't have the means
to do anything and that is your problem
you have grandiose plans and then you
address your your urban elite you
address your your audiences in
watching TV and then nothing happens to
the people down below even today's
manifesto you're talking about giving
6,000 rupees an acre to people would
land hectare what about 10 40 million
people who don't have any land you don't
even talk about yes yes in terms of the
narrative since we're talking about the
narrative an outtake the question to the
other yes yes mr. cha one moment the
question of pride and well you know
while the economists will talk about how
the numbers are not adding up and the
specifics are not here there are no
specifics at all if even if they talk
about if the BJP talks about making
India the third largest economy
there's no specifics of how we're going
to get there cleaning up the Ganga
there's no specifics of any of it taps
water in everybody's house how are we
going to get there we don't know but
what it is about is pride it's about
urban pride it's about national pride
it's about if you want to call it that
Hindu pride because a lot of it just
stays in that area it's strumming on
those on your heartstrings of pride of
some sort or the other so it's not about
mathematics the narrative here is about
reinforcing your pride isn't it
absolutely and I think that is because
in politics emotion plays a huge role
the parties Stoke up negative emotions
and positive emotions both to appeal to
the electorate and pretty obviously the
opposition will Stoke up negative
emotion because that's the only emotion
they can and they should politicians
also evoke emotions of fear they are
right now
fear could be the minority you know
politics in India is all about fear
policies after parties have exploited
that over the years and that's how they
have governed and ruled because they
instill that fear now the game has been
reversed you are now making the majority
feel a little worried because that again
is an emotion that appeals so emotion
plays a big role and pride in that sense
is another emotion that is being tried
and being used in this election and that
you will see this this the play out will
keep changing but the emotion will
always remain so we're looking at enough
of this happening in the West we've seen
Donald Trump's method of a make America
great again which is we will we will
sort of reinforce our pride and we'll
take control of our pride again and now
talking about how
he's going to secure the borders and
make sure that terrorism has no place
here as well I mean his fear is that
okay all the Mexicans are coming in it's
now a global formula it is I mean in
many ways the right-wing revivalism is a
global phenomena every country in the
world is now seeing that and we pretty
much seeing the same thing here as well
miss Chaudhary is it fear and pride
pride and fear that there are large
emotions that are playing right now I
think very much so I agree with that a
pride si you know there's a sense of
even if you look at Bala code Pulwama
and wala caught somewhere it made a
people that defeating them defeatism in
then was done to feel good people didn't
want to hear about whether actually the
strike took place how many people died
the fact that they gave it back to them
made you feel good so also they show
pride but you know this mommy mustn't
sniff at this completely how do you
arouse a nation how do you galvanize
people to do something good you know he
put the PM Proxima Jana and Andolan and
it can be called Joomla bossy on a whole
host of issues that have been
unaddressed but how do you galvanize
people to put their best foot forward to
bring the changes that are required
how does because become adjourn and all
done in the real sense of the word
you've got to play on both the pride
maybe also I hope not fair but certainly
on pride Santa chef Cora please oh hey I
think there is a very dangerous content
in the entire manifesto and I think it's
appropriate that we actually discuss
that I think that's the elephant in the
room
you know when the BJP talks about
abrogating article 370 or article 35 a
the question that needs to be asked of
them is how can they do it when the
matter is sub judice before the supreme
court of india these are very sensitive
issues and for a political party in
government to put it in as public
document as a commitment of the party
when the matter is pending before the
Supreme Court I think is a very very
serious issue
point number two and that's a very
simple and straightforward one I want to
go to you what Narendra Modi said in
2014 I will give you a report card at
the end of
five years and please judge me then and
reelect me I did not see any report card
and therefore no mention of those 15
lakh the MSP over fifty percent of cost
of production for the farmers the to
corrode jobs the smart cities the
multiple issues they talked about I have
the whole list with me so end of day I
think you know I'm glad that my party is
gonna make the manifest to a serious
issue
please hold us to it I'm we form a
government in May all right exactly
those questions and how we deliver
because I do believe mr. colleano
respond with your only document that
connects the citizen to a political
party where you can be held to task okay
okay mr. Kohli will respond to you mr.
Kohli go ahead please what was the first
foreign message I had made what card I
got which is the first point that he had
made he said that mr. Modi said that
after five years I will offer you a
report card and you can use that report
card to judge my performance and watch
me back that is the second point and
that it was a dangerous undertone of
article 370 yes thank you sir thank you
yes yes yes so thank you thank you thank
you because the two was so disparate so
I lost the track for a moment thank you
for it thank you thank you for telling
me
let me come on 370 first Sanjay I think
you would know that well the
Constitution by which also the Supreme
Court as a care is a creation and it
does look at the constitutional issues
does not put a restriction for someone
to have a point of view and on 370 we've
had a consistent point of view from 1951
from the days of the junsang before you
and I were even born that's from the
Johnson to the BJP and that point of
view continues there is no stop however
I would certainly say that if you do
wish to have a movement towards that we
shouldn't discuss this then perhaps the
Congress would do well to stop even
threatening Chief Justice's of India
with impeachment because they don't like
the way the court is running or the
judgments are coming so that would be a
good starting point to keep you know the
discussion in terms of that yeah that's
one that's the second point is on 3 7 th
nor dangerous thing that's our point of
view consistently and we stand for it
number two is your point on the report
card that's exactly what the Honorable
Prime Minister is doing or many of us on
TV when we point about all the work
that is the report culpa however if you
were expecting a report card like you go
to school
and you come out of the piece of paper
that has you know ABCD how much we got
maybe perhaps we've evolved a little
more than that but you are entitled to
have expected it alright we've
completely we have unfortunately we're
out of time here but I'll give I'll give
one last I seen a judge's hand up but
usually very quickly
your response and I give a last verdict
to mr. Armel quickly you know ah yeah I
would say you know what is worrying
about the agenda is you know in many
parts its divisive nature yes but you
know even if as I was saying even if you
want to rouse people to action it cannot
be done by a hatred fear and they are
treating some people as the other
opposed to you that is what the you know
the underline thing that worries you but
has that been perhaps an undertone in
this entire campaign mr. Raum children
hasn't spoken mr. I'm sure there is oh
he's making a fair point yeah mr. I'm
children I want you to respond to what
nija teachers just said creating some
portions of the country as the other
that we have to be protected from
creating a divide I think it's a very
valid point
this is the underlying fear of people in
most parts of the country particularly
the minorities and several others I
think it's very important when she says
that we need to instill confidence in
the white cross-section of people in
this country
having said that fair I think one of the
things that the country requires
immediately is a national doctrine on
national security experts on the subject
have been saying time and time again it
is time for the government to come
forward with such a doctrine now that we
have one on our nuclear weapons right
quick quick question to you as well the
divisive politics that we've seen play
out in this election and very late
comments being made by very very senior
leaders about this majority that
minority Hindus here
slums there that sort of thing in your
opinion has this gotten worse over the
last few elections it has for sure and I
think it has been done a little
deliberately nilin is in charge of to
Northeast states and he'll bear me out
on this the citizenship bill for
instance was put on the back allowed to
lapse in the right zebra because there
was a lot of problem the BGP is missing
to the allies AGP walked out some of
them have come back because it was
allowed to lapse but it is there in the
manifest story it's been brought back so
the obviously the party wants to go
ahead with it once they come to power
and there are many mean there is
actually it's it's there's an Easter egg
hunt of these things in the manifesto
Sabri Mela for example we were both
surprised when you saw it there but it's
there in it but it went some people I
came up it largely stoked you know the
difference between you know Hindus and
everybody against the language they've
used there is that if it's a matter of
faith we are open to the idea of looking
at a constitutional REE yes
looking in many ways that faith should
override certain things uniform Civil
Code again uniform Civil Code
categorizing only as far as it comes to
the rights of women so you're not
looking at dissolving the HUF for
example which would make you unpopular
among business communities that was yes
so that does seem like they was a
general sort of suggestion that yes you
should fear but don't worry we're
protecting yeah and also remember some
outside of the manifesto there is also a
narrative that is being built by oh by
constantly talking about why Rahul
Gandhi went to why not it's all it's all
ties in the constant refrain is he went
there because that's a minority seat and
and that's the narrative it's very
obviously that's the narrative is now
find space in manifesto it's also
finding place in speeches well that is a
narrative that we have to be mindful off
and we've run out of time on this
conversation well I thank my panelists
we will leave it here but we'll continue
to track this entire election remember
while manifestos and messaging aside at
the end of the day it's really left up
to you as a voter to choose what you
believe are the real issues of the
country and how you want to vote thanks

adventure superhero film from DC
starring Zachary Levi mark Strong Asha
angel Jack Dylan Grazer and Djimon
Honsou it is directed by David F
Sandberg the show is about a
street-smart P nature named Billy Batson
played by Asha Angel who runs away from
one foster home to the next in search of
his birth mother along the way he
encounters a mysterious wizard played by
Djimon Honsou who gives him the ability
to transform into an adult with
superpowers played by his actual Levi's
by merely saying the word Shazam DC has
clearly been working very hard on course
correcting its films which was quite
visible with Aquaman from its opening
frames
Shazam sets out to address the origin
tale pitfalls inherent to the superhero
genre it quickly establishes a comical
yet sensitive tonality which allows you
to get on board with an otherwise
outlandish premise this movie is clearly
inspired by big starring Tom Hanks and
it even references the film in a scene
drive from that director David F
Sandberg captures the imagination
enthusiasm and pure ghee of a little kid
playing with his or her toys he
maintains an irreverent and exuberant
approach throughout the film but that
sentiment wouldn't translate if it
wasn't conveyed so well by the cast
under sandbox direction they give the
characters the right amount of
self-awareness without veering too far
into camp - this is especially
applicable to Zachary Levi whose
playfulness as the title character never
gets old he is able to portray a sincere
yet
immature adolescent trying to take on
the big bad world and yet doesn't know
his own limits as a superhero it also
becomes obvious that Billy Batson played
by Asha angel isn't familiar with how a
powered individual works and that allows
superhero nerd Freddy Freeman
played by Jack Dillon racer to show him
the ropes these actors really draw you
into this boyish adventure of wit their
performances because of that some of the
best scenes include Shazam discovering
his abilities with Freddy and they are a
joy to behold family is a narrative
thread that binds this film even the
villain dr. thaddeus sivana played by
Mark Strong is forged by how his father
and brother treat him as a young boy
that along with Billy's search for his
birth mother and his inability to find a
home he can fit into is where the plot
finds its footing despite this the
screenplay never falls prey to melodrama
and the usual genre tropes are
acknowledged and then
comple downplayed the stakes are
relatively lower than what were used to
and yet crucial enough within this film
even the action set-pieces don't focus
on fight choreography and said these
moments are used to further character
development it's a risky move that
deaths falter slightly towards the
finish line
but that's excused because everything
else leading up to it is so much fun I'm
going with a solid four stars for Shazam
bolstered by Zachary liaise undeniable
charm this firm embodies the childlike
wonder associated with superhero and
comic-book movies in a welcome change of
pace it is undoubtedly the lightest and
most entertaining entry into the DC
roster seriously I haven't had this much
fun in a DC film and I think this is a
direction to go for with this universe

will be answer one crucial question that
will determine the outcome of the 2019
polls I'm Marta subrahmanyam and joining
me to answer this question is Marin as
consulting editor of inept owari Thank
You RTMP hope to answer another vex
question ahead of 2019 elections 6
December 1992 saw the demolition of the
babri masjid by car savings and he went
to change the political history of india
forever now what impact did that have on
the BJP is electoral performance 1991 as
we mentioned earlier there what share
was twenty point one zero now if you
switch to 1996 when the next general
election was it was twenty point three
zero that's a very very marginal
increase in their overall growth that's
a point two percent increase to be
specific now include the pradesh if you
just look at who the pradesh alone
between 1991 and 1996 it saw again a
very marginal growth in 96
it was 0.6 percent increase in utter
pradesh
so overall the BJP did not have what
many would think would be an obvious
rise in its performance or a growth yes
so the period where mr. Advani was
carrying out the ratha-yatra the
polarization helped the BJP but post the
demolition there were a lot of other
things that happened - there were riots
in many parts of the country Mumbai had
very bad rides as well we also saw the
emergence of regional parties like our
JD in Bihar and samajwadi party in U P
who actually effectively started the
process of counter polarization as well
because remember there was a phase when
the minorities and specially the Muslims
feeling very very insecure and these two
parties in many ways emerged as
so-called messiahs and saviours for them
and in that sense started the process of
reverse polarization so both those
things arrested this the BJP growth what
also recipe to peace growth was some
amount of agrarian distress which was
then being seen in many parts of India
especially in the rural areas there were
droughts patches or droughts that had
happened in many parts now and one of
the slope is most popular slogans then
was whenever BGP would give an campaign
in those states the farmers would tell
them book a print version in Ooty and
what it essentially meant was that you
can't be hungry and still be praying so
you really need to be well fed to even
pray and that was a very decisive reason
why the BJP is for sure didn't climb
more than what it had till the time the
revolution actually have
now post 99th was a decline in the BJP
performance and that really reflected
because the water reduce its seed share
reduce the BJP from 1991 when 1999 I beg
your pardon went down into a spiral
almost in the state now a large part of
that and that also perhaps resulted in
them putting the Monday issue in the
back burner because they had to appear
more inclusive and most secular for
other parties to be able to have an
alliance with them yes and that was the
face in India when we almost had an
alliance politics culture I mean there
was no dominant party and the BJP needed
the other parties as well and and
obviously those other parties weren't
very comfortable with the idea of Munger
being the main issue watch play was in
that point of time the face of the party
Govind Acharya was at that one a time
and I didn't know what the party before
he were have sent in the building is
called watch play the MU quarter for
principally this reason because he was
supposed to be the moderate face hiding
behind the hardline elements in the BJP
that comment itself was not very well
received within the party but that was
pretty much how it was being presented
that mr. Bosh bathing the moderate
leader would appeal to the alliance
partners and in that sense would help
them in the coalition air the situation
should the need arise in 2009 somebody
like in advance did have to tone down
the rhetoric they did because 2004 of
course BJP fought on India shining and
in do very well on that surprisingly
they were surprised in fact most of the
other people who were act from small
towns perhaps weren't as surprised in
2009 the PG peace campaign was very
confusing I mean there weren't very
short because the first it I know
everyone knows he was a fairly good one
India had shown rapid development in
many areas and they were not very sure
of what to attack them on they even went
to the extent of trying to attack mine
Mohan Singh is a person which backfired
badly because Manmohan Singh carried an
image of an elderly well behaved decent
gentleman it didn't really work also the
fact that at Ronnie himself was trying
to be an odd red face at that point of
time which was a big departure from his
Ravi authorities in any way so there was
a lot of confusion and the viewers are
the voters probably obviously didn't
find any merit in that kind of a
confused narrative 1/4 2014 whether
Ingram Modi wave hit India now the very
crucial factor that helped was that
moody replaced month eras most
polarizing factor in that election yes
because Musa Modi himself had that image
of a polarizing politician I mean he's
practiced some bit of that in Gujarat
for his ins when he was the Chief
Minister got huge literal dividends from
that and the obvious interpretation was
that if you pitch him as the prime
minister
as opposed to say somebody like a
nerdvana you would automatically achieve
that purpose of getting consolidation
behind a man who was clearly either very
well loved or completely not loved I
mean there were the only two emotions
with mr. moody at that point of time you
either never liked him at all or you
would like to him completely and the BJP
and the RSS realized it and that's why
he became the face of the party for 2014
and ironically a very went into the
campaign there was no mention on Monday
at all he actually went on the pitch of
development and and and new India as
they were calling it which was
completely fresh and different in terms
of corrupts corruption was a big issue
and development was the new issue now
2019 has seen a shift in narrative
because initially there was certain
rumblings about among their the fact
that the matter came up in the Supreme
Court is well it was timed very well in
the sense that it gave the BJP that
impetus but over the past couple of
weeks or maybe little more you've seen a
change and that's largely due to the
following factors the first very crucial
one has been this limited on wrong
traction with regards to the Monday so
till tup elections in 2017 assembly
elections the BJP believed that the
mandir issue would have a lot of
traction which is the reason why history
yogi Adityanath
was pitched as the chief minister
candidate much too many people surprised
because the earth nut was not exactly
the person who was supposed to be the
front-runner for being the CM he was
pitched because he also had a similar
image of a very divisive leader a
strident Hindu leader and somebody who
actually believed in using religion to
carry out his for the political agenda
in many ways so till that part
the BJP nurses were convinced that that
is the logic they carried on with that
for the next couple of years or so till
about six months ago when for the first
time they realized that on ground the
detraction that they would normally get
for something like this was not exactly
going the way they were looking for
there was a second very crucial feature
and this was of course the fact that the
BJP lost three crucial states in the
Hindi heartland
absolutely and the big thing that
happened there was this in chattisgarh
in multiple dish and in Rajasthan
Congress came up with a new reinvention
which was called soft Hindu too anyways
Rahul Gandhi went on a temple run in
many ways he was the display of
Rudraksha calling himself Shiva saying
on a journey of the hairy Brahman all of
those things were aimed at suggesting
that I am as much a Hindu in a in a you
know kind of a unifying factor as the
BJP that slightly blunted the BJP
attempt to polarize and the fact that
they actually ended up losing the three
states wanted them a lot because they
realized that the stridency that they
were showing so far was not working as
in the heartland as it used to value and
then of course a third most crucial
factor which is nationalism became the
new calling card now this is something
that you saw after the palma attack it's
something that you hear in every rally
of the prime minister and BJP leaders in
which they mentioned nationalism and you
know the Pulwama attacks the bellicose
strike as that being a primary calling
card oh yes and I think the BJP very
cleverly dovetailed nationalism
patriotism even I would say Hindu masala
Dacian into one in many ways and and
nothing unites India better than
Pakistan or hatred for Pakistan does and
Ballack would in that sense change that
narrative patent code and Barack would
pull woman but Alec would completely
change that narrative in many ways
because that gave them an opportunity to
go hell for leather for an issue where
there can be no real opposition you
really can't be seen to be opposing a
narrative which talks about nation first
it talks about terrorism which talks
about he Romney and he talks about
nationalism so that's in many ways if
you see in every speech now that mr.
Modi is making that's the only issue
that they are talking about well the BJP
has definitely changed its strategy in
2019 while the pudding the Monday on the
backbone or not is going to pay
dividends is something that we have to
see absolutely I mean twice they've
tried in the past whether this time they
will again work for them or not or
whether it will be a Liberty attraction
is something we'll find out soon well
we'll find out on May 23rd

has responded to Election Commission
over the question of broadcasting Prime
Minister Modi's maybe chocolate on
address for above one and a half hours
didi has told EC that PM's program was
not a political rally but a news program
with high news value didi has also cited
that other private news channels also
broadcasted the program well that's the
response they're coming in to the notice
that the Election Commission of India
had ratio DD News's has now defended its
decision to run Prime Minister Narendra
Modi's one-and-a-half our public
interest which is called maybe chokers
hour and this was the full address that
was done on March 31st and it has
defended its decision on the grounds of
its high news value remember the
Congress had earlier questioned the
decision to run the full address didi
said that various are the private TV
channels have also run the same address
in its entirety due to high news value
let me getting further inputs my
colleague Ayushmann joining me with
further updates Irishman Dee Dee seems
to have defended its decision of running
the one and a half hour Prime Minister
Modi's public address specifically
saying that the program had high News
value
well exactly poor wife you see the Dedes
response to the Election Commission in
which it has said that the Prime
Minister's rally in the Matty chocolate
program was not a public just public
address but it was a rally which was
being addressed and also been carried
out on several of the platforms and it
had a news value that's why the Election
Commission should note this fact before
should have noted this fact and that's
why it has defended its decision to air
remember the public broadcast can't be
used it's for the public address as well
as the Prime Minister's address
instructive was questioned and that's
why it does the this is the second time
in which maybe chocking our program was
has been questioned and didi has now
defended its coverage saying it has the
high value and at the same time it was
Prime Minister's coverage which was
being carried by other channels as well
so there is nothing wrong on DD's part
to display it also Irishman one more
thing that the dhih dhih dhih has said
in its response is how it was not just D
D which telecasted it also other private
TV channels have also shown the entire
address in its entirety because of its
high news content given the response
that the Dadd has given can we expect
Election Commission perhaps to now
looking at all the other TV channels as
well to see or to validate what DD has
claimed well if you see the question
first of all was from Gd because it's a
state broadcast and the question rises
because it is a state broadcast so the
question has been asked from D D while
the private channels they have aired
they'll have the Election Commission
will surely ask from them but the moot
question remains here is that D D there
which has defended its decision to air
these services has given the explanation
that it was because of the news value
and at the same time it was not a public
address as such it was the Prime
Minister was in a way addressing a rally
so it had to carry and and in a defense
they have also said that because other
channels were also carrying carrying the
same news you can cross cross they have
the commission that they can cross-check
with other news channels as well because
of the news value this this program was
carried there was nothing other than
this for what for why the DD should be
questioned in this regard all right so
do darshan they're putting out its
defense defending its decision there to
run the entire content calling it a
value of hi news content at this point
we'll have to leave with their eyes one

question ahead of 2019 elections 6
December 1992 saw the demolition of the
babri masjid by car civics an event that
changed the political history of India
forever now what impact did that have on
the BJP electoral performance 1991 as we
mentioned earlier there what share was
twenty point one zero now if you switch
to 1996 when the next general election
was it was twenty point three zero
that's a very very marginal increase in
their overall growth that's a point two
percent increase to be specific now
include the Pradesh if you just look at
who the Pradesh alone between 1991 and
1996
it saw again a very marginal growth in
96 it was 0.6 percent increase in utter
Pradesh so overall the BJP did not have
what many would think would be an
obvious rise in its performance or a
good yes so the period where mr. Advani
was carrying out the ratha-yatra the
correlation held the BJP but post the
demolition there were a lot of other
things that happened - there were riots
in many parts of the country Mumbai had
very bad rides as well we also saw the
emergence of recent parties like our JD
in Bihar and samajwadi party in U P who
actually effectively started the process
of counter polarization as well because
remember there was a phase when the
minorities and especially the Muslims

parties in many ways emerged as
so-called messiahs and saviours for them
and in that sense started the process of

also received you peace growth was some

then being seen in many parts of India
especially in the rural areas there were
droughts patches or droughts that had

the slogans most popular slogans then
was whenever BGP would given campaign in

who kept air it was your name of that
and what it essentially meant was that
you can't be hungry and still be praying
so you really need to be well-fed to

reason why the BJP is for sure didn't

the vision actually happened now post 99
there was a decline in the BJP
performance and that really reflected
because the water reduce seed share
reduce the BJP from 1991 went out 1999 I
beg your pardon went down into a spiral
almost in the state now a large part of
that and that well sir perhaps resulted
in them putting the monday issue in the
back burner because they had to appear
more inclusive and more secular for
other parties to be able to have an
alliance with them yes and that was a
phase in India when we almost had an
alliance politics culture I mean there
was no dominant party and the BJP needed
the other parties as well and and
obviously those other parties weren't
very comfortable with the idea of manga
being the main issue watch play was in
that point of time the face of the party
Govind Acharya was at that point a time
and I did know what the party before he
went in the buildin is called a vice way
the mikata for principally this reason
because he was supposed to be the
moderate face hiding behind the hardline
elements in the BJP that comment itself
was not very well received within the
party but that was pretty much how it
was being presented that mr. wash by
being the moderate leader would appeal
to the alliance partners and in that
sense would help them in the coalition
or the situation should the need arise
but even in 2009 somebody like in
advance did have to tone down the
rhetoric they did because 2004 of course
BJP fought an India shining and Hindu
very well on that surprisingly they were
surprised in fact most of the other
people who were at from small towns
quite but weren't a surprise
in 2009 the pita peace campaign was very
confusing I mean there weren't very
short because the first a tiny one known
Singh was a fairly good one India had
shown rapid development in many areas
and they were not very sure of what to
attack them on they even went to the
extent of trying to attack Manmohan
Singh as a person which backfired badly
because Manmohan Singh carried an image
of an elderly well-behaved decent
gentleman it didn't really work also the
fact that money himself was trying to be
an odd red face at that point of time
which is a big departure from his
ratha-yatra days in anyway so there was
a lot of confusion and the view was at
the voters probably obviously didn't
find any merit in that kind of a
confused narrative 1/4 2014 whether
Narendra Modi wave hit India now the
very crucial factor that helped was that
movie replaced Monday as the most
polarizing factor in that election yes
because Musa Modi himself had that image
of a polarizing politician I mean he's
practiced some bit of that in Gujarat
for isn't when he was the Chief Minister
got huge literal dividends from that and
the obvious interpretation was that if
you pitch him
as the prime ministerial candidate as
opposed to say somebody like an advance
you would automatically achieve that
purpose of getting consolidation behind
a man who was clearly either very well
loved or completely not loved I mean
there were the only two emotions with
mr. Modi at that point of time you
either never liked him at all or you
would like him completely and the BJP in
the RSS realized it and that's why he
became the face of the party for 2014
and ironically when he went on the
campaign there was no mention of Monday
at all he actually went on the pitch of
development and and and knew India as
they were calling it which was
completely fresh and different in terms
of character corruption was a big issue
and development was the new issue now
2019 has seen a shift in narrative
because initially there were certain
rumblings about a Monday or the fact
that the matter came up in the Supreme
Court is well it was timed very well in
the sense that it gave the BJP that
impetus but over the past couple of
weeks or maybe little more you've seen a
change and that's largely due to the
following factors the first very crucial
one has been this limited on ground
traction with regards to the monthly so
till the Europeans in 2017 assembly
elections the BJP believed that the
Monday issue would have a lot of
traction which is the reason why we
study I did not was pitched as the chief
minister candidate much too many people
surprised because the earth nut was not
exactly the person who was supposed to
be the front-runner for being the CM he
was pitched because he also had a
similar image of a very divisive leader
a strident Hindu leader and somebody who
actually believed in using religion to
carry out his for the political agenda
in many ways so till that part
the BJP nurses were convinced that that
is the logic they carried on with that
for the next couple of races so till
about six months ago when for the first
time they realized that on ground the
traction that they would normally get
for something like this was not exactly
going the way they were looking for
there was a second very crucial feature
and this is of course the fact that the
BJP lost three crucial states in the
Hindi heartland absolutely and the big
thing that happened there was this in
chattisgarh in multiple dish and
Rajasthan Congress came up with a new
reinvention which was called soft Hindu
20 anyways Rahul Gandhi went on a temple
run in many ways he was the display of
Rudraksha calling himself Shiva saying
on a journey of the Hari Brahman all of
those things were aimed at suggesting
that I am as much a Hindu and a you know
a kind of a unifying factor as the BJP
that slightly blunted the BJP attempt to
polarize and the fact that they actually
ended up losing the three states worried
them a lot because they realized that
the stridency that they were showing so
far was
working as much in the in the Artland as
it used to earlier and then of course a
third most crucial factor which is
nationalism became the new calling
cardinal this is something that you saw
after the palma attack it's something
that you hear in every rally of the
prime minister and BJP leaders in which
they mentioned nationalism and you know
the Pulwama R times the bellicose strike
as that being the primary calling column
yes and I think the BJP very cleverly
dovetailed nationalism patriotism even I
would say Hindu non-solid Asian into one
in many ways and and nothing unites
India better than Pakistan or hatred to
Pakistan does and Ballack wooden that's
in change that narrative pattern code
and Barack would pull woman but Ballack
would completely change that narrative
in many ways because that gave them an
opportunity to go hell for leather for
an issue where there can be no real
opposition you really can't be seen to
be opposing a narrative which talks
about nation first it talks about
terrorism which talks about your army
and he talks about nationalism so that's
in many ways if you see in every speech
now that mr. Modi is making that's the
only show that they are talking about
well the BJP has definitely changed its
strategy in 2019 while they're putting
the Monday on the backbone or not is
going to pay dividends is something that
we have to see absolutely I mean twice
they've tried to the past
whether this time they will again work
for them or not or whether it'll be
unlived attraction is something we'll
find out soon well we'll find out on May

pollution killed 12 lakh people in India
in the year 2017
the state of the global air report 2019
said that air pollution is the third
highest cause of death among all health
risks in India ranking just about
smoking the report which was released by
us-based organization health effects
Institute also found that China and
India together were responsible for over
half of the total global attributable
deaths from air pollution in 2017 Ashwin
Kumar joining us live irishman so here
we have a figure today that we are
bringing out to our viewers and this
number is huge if we just look at the
year 2017 12 lakh people have lost their
lives
owing to air pollution now how do we
interpret this number to understand
where things have gone wrong in this
country and how successive governments
have been ignorant about this hazard
laughter if you see there was a national
clean air program launched by the Union
Government to tackle the air pollution
in the country specifically in Delhi
days after the Congress party in its
manifesto cited air pollution as one of
the key aspects that need to be dealt
with and they have proposed that they
they'll be dealing with it if they are
voted to power remember it is very
important to see this report which says
that nearly 12 lakh people have died and
in the country because of air pollution
and this is not only limited the data is
expected to go up in 2018 as well and
and it remains a menace in all over the
South Asia while every tenth every tenth
person who is dying because of the air
pollution is an Indian according to this
report and if you see this report it
clearly says that not much has been done
what what was expected to be done from
the government and the air pollutions
Menace which was to be controlled by
different initiatives of the government
have really failed and we don't see that
impact on ground and that is why the
number is huge and it is only expected
to go up yes absolutely and we've
already covered a lot of issues around
how the cities the metros in the country
are polluted and how they figure among
the top 20 most polluted cities in the
country we've been time and again
raising those issues but clearly lot of
those pleas have gone unheard irishman
other issue here and that is extremely
important is the fact that the election
season is on the manifestos are out is
there a focus is there a thrust on
addressing this issue
Oh currently if you see the government
had lost the national clean air program
but most of the environmentalists they
said that it was not having those
stringent laws which was needed and it
really needed a revival and people
should have taken more stringent steps
to counter this air pollution at the
same time if you see the Congress
party's manifesto it has some where deal
with the air pollution we will remember
for this we will wait for the BJP is
manifest as to how it sees the air
pollution but this for the first time
that a political party in its manifesto
which is the promises that they do when
they come to power they'll implement
these things they have first time for
the first time they have promised that a
pollution will be a key issue for them
to be to deal with now it will be
important to see how other parties come
across and they put forward this issue
of air pollution in their manifesto as
well okay I have mr. KK Agarwal former I
am a chief who's joining me now on the
phone line good morning mr. Agarwal we
are looking at a very dismal figure here
and that's a figure of 12 lakh people
who have lost their lives oh into air
pollution in 2017 this should be a
wake-up call now as someone who's worked
closely around this matter
can you tell us where has the government
gone wrong what are we doing wrong that
we are having to lose so many of our
citizens to air pollution because
different lot they are basically coal
industry has been denying so far that
pollution can cause that the central
government has been taking up the issue
diverse approve diverse the evidence so
once you are in a denial board and you
are not going to get this problem solved
this should be a major manifesto of all
political parties absolutely because you
know the investigation on Rafael or the
say focus on unemployment all of that
can wait but can the air to breathe the
clean air to breathe is there an issue
that can wait
that is something that means immediate
attention is that what you're telling us
that the lack of focus and the lack of
understanding about how devastating this
could be now after we
pause these figures it should feature in
the list of priorities or do you think
that this is completely been missed out
and glossed over by the political
parties if you take top 10 decisions in
India directly or indirectly top 10
causes of death in India relates
directly or indirectly to position
therefore when we talk about health we
need to talk about not only air
pollution air pollution water pollution
and out Commission all three are
important to be talked about you can't
have India choking and and then not
having it as an election manifesto yes
and we still don't see it among the top
five issues for political parties from
whatever we have seen in terms of the
announcements that have been made in all
the election speeches but if you can
quickly take us through the hazard that
it is and how dangerous it is when we
are you know when we don't take the
necessary measures at the right time are
we you know dealing with the ticking
bomb here because even now in man the
mangroves in Mumbai for instance the
wetlands are being destroyed all across
the country we see pollutants the lakes
etcetera and Karnataka so if there has
been no awareness even after you know to
take the issues that you have pointed
out see what happens here is that air
pollution to talk about outdoor
condition and indoor pollution when it
comes to indoor pollution we have more
of particulate matter also of total
volatile compounds and formaldehyde I
will send it up about gases and we talk
about particulate matter both are
important heart disease is the
particulate matter is less than 2.5 it
can get absorbed in the blower it can
cause heart attack again confident that
in the last Commission season I saw a
series of patients who died suddenly we
have no evidence to say but clinically
we all label them as precipitated by air
pollution because it is asthma
precipitation COPD precipitation so we
need to talk about air pollution as a
major concern right remember that UN say
is that the mature failed solutions
lever should be less than 10 hmm
remember India is where we accept 16 but
16 is 10 times 6 times more than normal
but people are living in 300 400 500 and
during the pollution time preached and
1500 so that's not acceptable
right so clearly you know there needs to
be systems put in place and a course
correction required when it comes to the
clean air program that the government
does have but is not effective enough KK

on electoral bonds the government has
defended this scheme in an affidavit
filed in the top court by the Finance
Ministry it has said that bonds were in
attempt to bring greater transparency
into the system the affidavit also said
that bonds leave an audit trail in
comparison to cash donations the
government further dismissed ec's
concerns that foreign companies will be
able to influence elections claiming
that there was no legal or factual merit
to this argument
the affidavit also added that the
electoral bond scheme is a pioneering
step in bringing electoral reforms to
ensure the spirit of transparency and
accountability in political funding let
me go across to Irishman Kumar who joins
us with more information on the response
that the government has now given to the
Election Commission Irishmen coming
across to you I want to know that there
were serious issues that were raised by
organizations like the ADR which of
course in fact raised the point about
transparency in fact that there is no
way to find out who the entities are who
would who would contribute the big
amounts now here is the government now
actually countering each of those points
can you take us through those issues and
those points that have been made by the
government of India
well after event you see the
government's response on electoral bonds
into unions quite about the expected
payments on the expected lines
the government has defended this
decision both Election Commission and
the ADR has said that electron bonds are
anything but for the transparency of
electro defunding in the democracy and
the elections remember one can
contribute they can give the data to the
banks but no one knows as to who has
contributed far in the bank Thanks
give this the occurred to the RBA which
ultimately goes to the finance ministry
and that would be a idea has raised
objection to because the party in power
knows they have the access to the data
who has contributed and that is when a
DRS
that you can see the trail almost 90 to
95% of the contribution made through the
electoral bond goes to the party in
power that does that that will happen of
lately and this is why the Election
Commission when they submitted be
different in a Supreme Court they said
but they they felt that it was a
retrogressive
step and that is why it was not
necessary it was not bringing any kind
of transparency delay yesterday the
affidavit filed by the Finance Ministry
clearly reviewed the claims made by
Election Commission and they said that
the bonds were an attempt to bring a
greater transparency they said that
bonds leave an audit trail in comparison
to the cash donations and they furthered
the concerns that company the foreign
companies will be able to influence the
elections but ultimately if you see the
nodal board the nodal body the whole
body of the country fails but the
electron bonds are a retrogressive step
and they won't be bringing the
transparency in the pulley and the PIA
so clearly there is a contrarian
position taken by the Election
Commission and the Government of India
because one of the arguments is that it
will open the floodgates for unlimited
corporate donations and like you said
only the Finance Ministry will have
access to information about the donors
and that level of transparency is simply
not enough thanks very much for joining

years because the fee hike in Delhi did
not happen for past three years
the Delhi government has maintained that
they would be challenging this order and
they had challenged this so today the
division bench has given the order that
there'll be a stay on this single
benches order till Monday and this comes
a relief this comes as a relief to the
parents who had to pay at around lakh
rupee for one lakh rupee for one student
because these schools had threatened
that if the fee is not being paid their
results won't be coming so today the

given the ticket to Manoj
Kotick my notes Kotick will now contest
from the north-east mumbai this is the
same constituency from which he wrote so
my eyes already an MP he was seeking a
second term a second fight from this
constituency for these looks of high
elections a deputy news editor my
Eurasia getting us further details here
on this Myesha the the reasons what is
known on what really has happened behind
the scene here for BJP to be dropping a
candidate who is who is popular in his
constituency as well and also the
current sitting MP there so if we see
the last four years critics from I was
continuously making a personal remark on
hakurei and shiv sena and ships annex
basically and after this alliance got to
seal xu Senna was opposing to his name
and they were totally against giving
ticket to Oakridge so man that's why he
can somewhere say that that BJP has
succumbed to the pressure of xu Sena and
now they have dropped period so my and
they have given ticket to Monash cottage
whose a corporator and leading BJP in
BMC so this is kind of a big blow to the
kids over here because he was expecting
that after the mature protests which
issues and I was doing he will get the
ticket and from pasture one week or two
week he was just a rooming around his
area doing his campaign but now in the
list the Kuroko Tech has got the ticket
and now beat a kid it so Maya house will
wait till next
that's right but my rash is their
internal understanding could there be a
possibility could it sameas name could
be taken up for another constituency in
Mumbai or all all the vacancies for now
which was noticed in the elections that
was the only seat which was remaining to
get announce and which got announced
final today because just it's just a
matter of a three days that the the
candidates will be filing the nomination
the deadline is nearby and this was the
only seat which was remaining but today
BJP has made it clear that killed some I
will not be getting a ticket instead of
that they have filled a candidature of
Manoj Kota who is a corporator even
managed otech last time I did try and he
contested the MLC elections where he
lost miserably but now they have given
him a ticket and they have shown a
confidence in a corporator and somewhere
given a message that yes we are which
you say no she was in hell is with us in
this alliance and to make shoes and a
happy they have cut the ticket of
killing some I am Irish would that be
seen as a huge price to pay for the BJP
just to be pacifying its ally which has
been his strongest critic throughout in
these all these years that they've sat
together both in the BMC as well as the
state government what are they going to
be doing about a senior leader such as
Kira Samia then it's a big question that
how to pass if I carried so my because I
just two days back or three days back
when we saw that she was in her a local
leader Sonia now had gone on record to
say that if BJP gives ticket to carried
so Maya from the Northeast constituency
then he will be contesting as an
independent against accurate so man be
and somewhere visibly dozen wanted that
because in Maharashtra BJP wants support
of Shiv Sena and that's why they have
come again because if you see in a what
happened after last looks of my election
the BJP Shanna was in the government but
they were having a differences and even
the Fort advance of my elections
separately so this time we should be
somewhere or somewhere I realize it that
they want you sane and that's why they
made that alliance of amateur had come
down to Mathura he made adult Hakurei we
saw on an historic press conference
which happened just to a reminder we was
in that in that press conference also
just before Rama Chandra Delta curry
just before their arrival period so Maya
and other people
protested against issue Senna throughout
last four years or they made of some
comments about Shiv Sena they were asked
to awaken that particular hall where the
aware of each ion would hurt a Kurihara
had that press conference that's right
also my Eurasia help us understand what
exactly does Manoj Kota bring to the
table here a name from that particular
concert in North East constituency which
we are talking about his we can say
heavyweight in the BMC because he's
leading BJP in the Mumbai BMC also his
from the Gujarati community so the BJP
who is banking basically above on the
gujarat gujarati community which is in
large number and northeast constituency
so certainly there is they have just
replaced the face but it would be
interesting to see that what if what
would be the reaction of local BJP
workers because local BJP workers were
really supporting period samaya

a norm
we're not followed while at these dams
we're open and that is a reason why you
know acute flooding happened across the
state and it also adds that warnings
from the Indian meteorological

actions were not taken and it is in
light of these you know recommend it is
the light of these of views that today
Anika's foodie has recommended for a

remember when chills flush hit kala more
than 300 people lost their lives in this
disaster and now this report from the
immediate security has come as a major
embarrassment for minister of mint in
Kerala that Shilpa besides the
government essentially what this report
is pointing out that there seems to be
some sort of human error the fact that
there was mismanagement as far as the
opening of the dam is concerned and also
warnings by the Indian med Department
were ignored
so does the report actually mention any
particular officers or any particular
person or authority responsible for this
sort of mismanagement well what the
report talks about is the mismanagement
of opening of dance they say like a
warnings were not given out player to
opening these dance which is mandated by
the norms and I was not done and you
know there's several other norms were
also not followed and also added that
the Kerala Government did not follow or
did not consider seriously the warnings
that came from the Indian meteorological
department from June to August 19th and
necessary actions were not taken and
that is also one of the reasons why
there was acute flooding across the
state and that is and because of these
many reasons there are several other
points also that I think it has pointed
out in his report but considering all of

it and then they decide if the book has
to be only I mean I should be taking out
of the shelf or not but before that this
seems to be an unnecessary preemptive
strike here because it was just a small
program but in ROM of Hindu was the one
who was supposed to release a book
earlier they decided to go ahead and do
it again like so much but they could not
do it because of Election Commission and
then they when the publisher bar the
publishers they try to release it inside
their office even their ancient
revisionist
we come and they start started taking
away the books and not just we also
bought information that the publisher is
named Netaji's also there have been
taken by the police right now he's being
detained for questions apparently we are
not exactly sure why Election Commission
is behaving in this manner

confiscated a hundred and forty two

grounds that it violated the model code
of conduct after an outrage with ours
the books were returned and the event
was allowed to proceed right four
officers have in fact been relieved from
duty let's take you through what exactly
happened yesterday this was in fact a
book launch event that was slated to
take place in Chennai but was in fact
stopped by the election flying squad on
the premise that these books violated
the model code of conduct
now the Election Commission also blocked
this book slated for release by in ROM

blocked the release of the book on the

last month my colleague promote now
joining me on the phone line with more
promote take us through the latest only
this kind of letter after yesterday what
happened with the two flying's what
officers and two policemen entering the
bar with publications and confiscating
142 books the in civilian isms is that
like now almost 8000 people have paid
for the books to be out to buy the books
and to the same times interpreters ahoo
the chief election officer also
mentioned that there was no kind of like
directions from the ECI or CEO for
confiscating such books and this has
offered without their concern itself so
that's the reason because of
miscommunication and not informing the
election office these two four officers
have been removed from election duty and
ever served as through show cause notice
he has also mentioned that like further
investigation would lead to disciplinary
action if they are found out to have
acted over their power more thank you so

fDVc8BgT2HM,SHOCKING! Student shot and killed inside Benaras Hindu University,Chaos ensued at the campus of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) on Tuesday night after three bike-borne assailants opened fire ...,2019-04-03T06:34:51Z,MIRROR NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fDVc8BgT2HM/hqdefault.jpg,"a student has succumbed to his injuries
after being shot at inside the campus of
Banaras Hindu University he was rushed
to the hospital after being shot but
unfortunately passed away the student
was shot at right outside his hostel
gate in the phu campus Prashant Kumar
joining me on the phone line pressure
and shocking news coming in this morning
and we can already see those pictures
there in the bhu campus one student shot
dead now tell us more about who's behind
this why was the student targeted what
exactly happened well it seems an old
rivalry because this is not the first
time that this person's name has come
now the person who was short was Gaurav
and Gaurav was an experienced from the
second year SMC a close of course he was
expelled after his name figure in the
2017 infamous violence on campus that we
had reported really aggressively and he
was expelled after that but it was
yesterday when he was standing outside
the burglar was told that three
assailants came on a motorbike and shot
him pumped in at least three bullets in
him and what you're not getting is that
he succumbed to his injuries at around
midnight at a local hospital there which
obviously followed by a very tense
environment on the campus in which
foolish had to resort to several actions
there on the campus to ensure that
there's no further violence because the
friends and supporters also know family
members of Gaurav tried to do some sort
of evangelizing on campus and also at
the trauma center where he was initially
taken to well this is absolutely
shocking at various levels Prashant
because the fact that assailants can
come into a college campus a reputed one
at that and shoot a student in this
manner speaks volumes about the lack of
security and safety for students in this
campus an issue that has been of course
coming to the fore time and again and
you know now like you spoke about the
tension on ground now this is something
which will perhaps become a lawn order
situation for the administration there
thankfully the police have been able to
stop the tension spiraling into anything
else but yes I mean having said that the
kind of
arrangements on the HU campus something
it is always been the question now the
issue doesn't allow any police personnel
to come inside it has its own set of
security guards and we know the kind of
security guard that they have the kind
of if we saying she that they come up
with so clearly I mean on one hand the
beach is open and the entire block
toriel would say never have security is
absolutely top notch in the campus but
the fact is this sort of thing is
happening every day now not only this
after I think if I remember right over
the past four days I have got at least
four news of delivery boys food the food
delivery boys would actually be snatched
by the people there they just read the
people up and they just take the food
away so clearly I mean there is complete
guna hi Simon
good night them that today prevails all
of the hu camper and that's something
that needs to be taken care of and that
is very very strong II absolute
lawlessness and pandemonium there in
campus and like bhishan says there is
goondaism that seems to be prevailing
there and authority is not able to keep
it under check as of now thanks very

finance minister Arun Jaitley was quick
to hit out calling the Congress uncle
buttress impractical
out of ignorance he makes unimplemented
and dangerous promises I am sure the
country will not be in a mood to oblige
him we're now asks John Congress ended
the job crisis are the Congress's
promises practical let's debate well are
the promises practical or as a finance
minister has pointed out are the non
implementable and dangerous for the
country we're focusing right now on the
promises made for jobs for taxation for
the nice scheme and of course change in
the scope of the Supreme Court on the
show between Aled meta senior journalist
professor Don Kumar chair professor at
the Indian Institute of Social Sciences
he's an economist moon guru Swami senior
economist joins us as well yogi inria
the national president of suraj india
will join us through the course of this
conversation Shama Mohammed for the
Congress beneath the body consulting
editor for The Times Network I welcome
all of you to this conversation thank
you for your time
a quick round of opening statements for
our panelists as to whether or not they
believe this is practical and
implementable or do they agree with mr.
Jaitley on the fact that this is
potentially dangerous first question to
you Vinay
what is your appraisal of the manifesto
so far well I mean some of the schemes
that they have mentioned of course are
implementable specific to you know
having a separate budget for farmers
well that is possible to do without any
cost implication to change the liability
from criminal to civil in cases of loan
defaults of farmers you don't really
need money for that you just need an
amendment of the law in fact someone was
just telling us that a lot of times when
farmers borrow to buy a tractor they
have to hand over like most of us do
signed checks blank cheques beforehand
and when that check bounces they wind up
going to jail and that's tremendously
embarrassing as well it is and it's also
an issue that actually is quite
disconcerting in small villages in India
for sure it's an issue that resonates
now these two provisions don't require
financial allocations and hence are
practically possible to implement but
I'm afraid the lot of the other things
that they have been promised and I guess
manifestos the season
you can it's an open season for making
all kinds of tall promises I mean you
can say anything you want to in a
manifesto I don't want to use the word
15 lakh because that figure is disputed
but well the BJP is manifest 2014 talked
about black money coming back to India
it hasn't yes
so manifestos are open season and I
guess mr. Rahul Gandhi's manifesto also
has lots of promises for which there is
no real obvious answer on where the
money's going to come from and that's
the tougher bit the beef is manifest
while she talked about 1 crore jobs he
talked about the 15 lakhs over at bottom
whatever amount of money would be
brought back to India from you know
Swiss bank accounts specifically and it
talked about beating corruption none of
which is actually played out so we have
to remind our viewers that it costs
nothing to print it out in a manifesto
this is just a your perhaps something
this is an intention in the very least
it costs nothing to print it it's about
the political will to actually carry it
out its intention and I also suspect
that manifest excises have become
headline-grabbing exercises you tend to
write things because they grab headlines
they lot of things for this is the in
the manifesto are actually contradictory
nature each party I'm not saying only
Congress I can hear Congress's manifesto
also it's contradictory the provisions
in the same manifesto that they're you
can't have for instance I'll give a
small specific example if the government
if the party promises 22 lakh jobs will
be filled up that's floating your
bureaucracy further they really need of
there are actually is to reduce the
bureaucracy not increase it yes I point
out that I asked that question of mr.
Chidambaram and his response to that was
that these are already sanctioned jobs
they're already budgeted for they're
sanctioned they're planned for they're
just not filled
what we will do is make sure that
they're full so that's his justification
for it but none of Methos with us as
well Nolan when you looked at the
manifesto what's your first impression
of it with the disclaimer to our
audience that these are just promises
for now were you impressed would you
agree with mr. Jaitley tonight well I
think I agree with what when a was
saying that the that the manifesto
promises a lot of things from the
Congress this is an amalgamation of
essentially what all Gandhi even saying
in all his meetings and his public
utterances in the last month or in the
last month or two months I don't think I
political parties do promise the moon in
in manifestos are not sure how seriously
a lot of voters take manifestos per se
but there is a shift in this manifesto
Fay which is that the Congress is not
just talking about its usual rights
based agenda I think what I saw in this
manifesto is is also reaching out
significantly to industry and in terms
of health for example it is talking of a
shift from an insurance-based
kind of a prototype so far to a much
more universal health coverage kind of
approach now is is the question is is
the promise of 72,000 rupees in
everybody's bank account feasible or not
I think there are serious concerns on
all issues around the fiscal deficit
with that even Raghu Rama Rajan has been
quoted as saying in the last couple of
weeks that it is feasible but it's going
to be very difficult it is feasible if
you start putting together a lot of
other subsidies moving them aside and
putting them into one box and that will
require a lot of jugglery even the in
the current scheme of things without
making clear hard choices on what
subsidies you will withdraw and what you
will put into a scheme like this it's
going to be a difficult task right
professor Kumar do you believe that the
announcements made on health industry
and education are implementable and are
they reasonable so you know fair as you
rightly said these are intentions you
know and very good intentions but one
thing I think that's defining the
manifesto is that it's more inclusive
than what we have seen earlier you know
so in a sense the basic manifesto that
has been coming earlier you know from
Congress was not as inclusive as this
one is you know by bringing together a
lot of marginalized sections and making
specific provisions for these
marginalized sections you know but I
think the problem that will come is that
when you give so much to so many
different sections you need to raise
resources as well and that's where the
fiscal part of the manifesto where we
talk about the GST - and where we talk
about the direct tax code these are
probably very important you know but one
thing that is missing there is
how are you going to raise the extra
resources if you're going to increase 2%
of GDP on education from roughly a
little bit of 4% to 6% on health from 1%
to 3% roughly and on the kneei scheme at
least 2% of GDP so what you're talking
about if you count everything together
including the extra expenditure and
bureaucracy etc we're talking about 7 to
8 percent of GDP extra expenditure over
and above what is planned for now now
any good accounting process should show
where those resources are going to come
from you know so you know the question
of wealth taxation estate duty etc
should have been mentioned there but
that it does not find mentioned so in
that sense when we say will promises be
fulfilled what we have to ask is will
the government that comes if this go if
Congress comes to power would it be
accountable to the people and this is
where you know by and large what we've
seen is that government's once they come
to power parties when they come to power
in government they don't necessarily
fulfill the promises so it's not just
this NDA government which has not
fulfilled many of the promises as was
pointed out but I remember even the
Congress party when you know the 1991
election took place had promised that
will roll back prices within 150 days -
what Rajiv Gandhi's time prices in 1989
were but after coming to power mr.
Manmohan Singh was then the finance
would have said this is not possible
similarly you know during the junta
regime murajjab high as the prime
minister said that was the party's
manifesto this is the government's
program so in other words you know the
government is not responsible for
fulfilling the parties program so these
kind of things we have seen in the past
and that's where I would have been
happier to see you know I like many of
the things that I mentioned but I've
been happier to see if in the fiscal
part it had been said how are all these
desirable things going to be financed
whether it would be possible to do all
this within one budget or within you
know five years or within 10 years what
would be the timescale on which these
things would be implemented so there are
many good things but I think it falls
short in terms of you know the
accountability part of you know whether
these things would be fulfilled yes
Shama Mohammed these are very good
questions if we add up what the changes
in
GST gonna cost us which is bringing
petrol and alcohol under GST the farm
loan waiver that we mentioned but with
very little clarity then the ice scheme
that we understand will cost less than
1% of GDP in the first year 2% in the
second year had increased spending l
health increase spent in education but
no clarity of where this money is going
to come from is their understanding
right now what all of this is going to
collectively cost us and where the money
is going to come from PHA if today mr.
Narendra Modi had gotten me i esteem all
the journalists all the television
channels say Chanakya neat the Wow look
what Narendra Modi has got for the poor
Shama Marcos the Congress I've asked you
a question if you're willing to answer
that question I'm fine with it but I'm
not going to be open to you standing
here and telling us that we don't
question the government of the day you
are well aware of the fact that we have
questioned the government of the day day
in and day out for the last two years of
the existence of this channel we're
questioning you today do you have an
answer for the question that has been
asked now I did not say it is you Fay I
was just talking in general about and
you have to let me speak you don't have
to get hyperactive if we want to get
hyperactive I can leave but let me I
won't take it personally if you are on
my shoulder questioning the integrity of
the journalists there are three judges
on the channel right now and all of whom
have questioned the government for the
last two years do you have an answer to
the question I have asked you Shama
Mohammed there are many who don't
question then please ask them on my show
if you do not want to listen to me I can
leave you don't have to be all this you
know you don't have to be rude to me I
am going to answer the question I'm
coming to it but if you want to get up
every time and be rude to me when I come
to your show then you don't have to
invite me because I've noticed one thing
every time I come onto your show unlike
other people you start becoming rude to
me I'm answering your question I didn't
say anything I have to say what I want
to say and I never pointed out it's you
there are many journalists out there who
keep saying in many other channels that
this is China casualty binary level run
so the question area veracity and I
never said that it is fake so I'm going
to get to the point now when we started
when we did Monday
we had the funds people were at that
point asking where would you get the
money we waved off in 2008 farm loans
were at 70 thousand crores that and they
asked us where do you get the money we
had the money in 2012 we got in the food
security act we under at that point they
asked where you gonna get the money we
did it so Congress party is a party we
when we say something we promise
something we will do it and we'll find
the money and we have senior economists
we have mr. P Chidambaram who's got out
many budgets who says you know that
there are funds for Nia so and we are
not going to remove arm and rhaegar we
will have the other schemes as it is and
when we say something like this and he
also mentioned mr. Peter Dharma they
will be other economists from around the
world working with us so we are when we
say something like this we have looked
at it
we have worked for the past four five
months or a year on this and we have got
the budget for it and once we come to
when we form the government every the
clarity of it is exactly going to be out
there but yes when we have certain
things we have set certain things we
have always done it and it's an its told
that it will be 5000 crore families
there will be one person from the first
year it would be 1% of the GDP the
second year to be 2% of the GDP and it's
clearly set out there it will be 6000
rupees per month it will be 72 thousand
per year so there is clarity on that and
of course the funds will be there we are
clear on that that we will do something
like this and we had lifted from 2004 to
2014 145 million people out of poverty
and this is not what the Congress party
said this is what Oxfam said and the
independent bodies around the world has
said about the Congress party and the
UPA government what they have done so we
have always stood for the welfare of the
poor and we will stand and also along
with that we are creating jobs and we
have you've seen the manifesto I have it
right in front of me how we're going to
create jobs so it's just just not so in
on one side there is the poorest of poor
out there we need to uplift them and on
the other side we need to give jobs
because in the last four five years we
have lost 4 crore jobs in this country
with the loss due to D monetization and
various investments being taken out of
this
country construction is almost down we
have no exports our exports have come
down when we left the exports were at a
very high rebuttal phase billion dollars
last year the exports were at 160
billion dollars so that is manufacturing
sector is at the lowest of low MSNBC's
rotring and rebuttals please d
monetization we're going to bring all
those back in okay so I'm just gonna
bring in rebuttals only a couple of
these points one guru Swami senior
economist was also advisor to the
finance minister at one point mr. guru
Swami are you convinced with the
argument that the Congress party has
always fulfilled its promises and they
will find the money is that convincing
to you well that is certainly not
convincing but you know I've taken part
in about the writing of over a half a
dozen manifestos and manifestos really
collective efforts involving several
people and everybody gives a little
input and so it you know you just keep
adding saying that's okay this is fine
let's have this let's have this but look
at how the BJP manifest for 2014 was you
know 100 new cities of accommodating a
million to two million people high-speed
railway network connecting the whole
country when I total it up at that stage
it was about a billion dollars clearly
there was no ways and means for plans
for it so typically these people sit
without planning the ways and the means
for it you know where are you going to
get money and how are you going to
collect the money are you going to spend
it now they are all talking about
objectives these are laudable objectives
I think the near scheme is laudable the
increase in the education budget is also
laudable increase in health budgets is
also laudable all these are highly
laudable and some of them is fairly
doable like for us in the eyes do doable
I've been saying from day one that you
know something which costs about 1.3
percent of GDP is doable and sustained
and it'll be done I have no doubt it'll
be done it might have leakages it might
have all kinds of other things but you
can't have endless giveaways you can't
keep on saying that you know banks will
keep giving farmers money and farmers
were not repaid moneylenders give more
money than banks these days
so this guarantee of loan waiver goes
only to the large and medium farmer the
small farmer goes to the moneylender and
he doesn't give you an email so you know
the problem is you got to address those
issues so a part of this is populist
part of this is saying that we're giving
you mineral support prices we're giving
you this all that all that is fine but
the market will dictate all these things
and you can't keep giving away the
bank's money it's not your money the
government has to pay for it
where is the government going to get so
you have to talk about ways and means
who are you going to tax they don't want
to talk about these things because
they're at this movement they're all
locating all sections it was replicating
the CII implicating the billionaire boys
club everybody and the lowest low they
weren't who whose works they weren't so
you know I think you should give them
with a picture salt and run you know and
said because the tradition of writing a
detailed plan saying that very you gonna
get the money and how much you would is
not shed in this country you know when
when I remember when the out of the my
spying government came the question was
us what about the manifesto so I had to
write a speech at that stage they say
that we see government as a continue
that you know what when one thing left
behind will continue with that we don't
see it as you know spasmodic jerks you
know that we suddenly turn direction do
all kinds of things so even this new
Congress government if it comes or
whoever comes they will be government
and continue big nothing remotely
discovered that he couldn't do anything
he said my mall Singh said he'll reform
the bureaucracy Modi said he'll reform
the bureaucracy they didn't do anything
bureaucracy today is yet you're short of
bureaucracy but thirty percent but you
don't have the money because you've got
such a high cost bureaucracy higher
salaries in the country that you can't
afford anymore
yes so you know adding if you add fill
up vacancies in etcetera you will have
to fill up vacancies down the line you
don't have the money for it yes question
where the money is going to come from
and mr. guru Swami's right there's been
no clear
because you don't want to upset the
billionaire's Club by talking about tax
on rich you don't want to upset the
middle class by talking about increased
taxes on the middle class so where is
the tax going to where's the money going
to come from but then I already you
about and this has come up now not once
but three different members of the
Congress party is but you didn't
question the BJP act that type why are
you asking these questions now as
journalists it is our job to ask
questions and we have to ask questions
of everyone if this is not a valid
answer for anything we are asking today
no absolutely not I mean it's it's it's
look the only point I can make in
response to sha Mohammed's getting very
agitated is this well I mean I don't
want to sound condescending but look
we've been in this provision longer than
she's been in politics and I can tell
you we spent our life lifetime asking
questions to Prime Minister's to
government's we've seen many many Prime
Minister's and I think if Congress
really wants to stay different as a
party they need to stop getting agitated
when a question is put to them each if
he gets irritated all the time when
because they're not used to being
questioned but when we have every time
on our show they have got an irritated
and I think the Congress should not get
irritated because it's healthy in a
democracy to be asking questions the
trouble is when a question when when
there is a culture of everything
becoming very bombastic you know budget
I mean a manifesto has unfortunately
become a ritualistic exercise and the
biggest problem is that nobody either
goes out to vote with the manifesto in
mind nor do we just think of the
manifesto when we are trying to reelect
or throw out a government in 2009
Manmohan Singh was not related because
they fulfilled the berryfest promises in
2014 Manmohan Singh wasn't voted out
because he did not fulfill manifesto
they got voted in or out for completely
different reasons and the parties have
realized that this is ritualistic so
it's all become sloganeering you can put
any slogan you want to in the budget
with no clarity and no answer on where
it's going to happen I'll give you a
small example one of the points in
today's manifesto is about mr. Gandhi
making a lot of virtue and you cry about
for three years you don't need
permissions to start any business yes
there cannot be anything more absurd
than that and I'll tell you why even if
you have to open a restaurant in this
country you need 21 licenses from the
Municipal Corporation to the Health
Department but the police there is no
concept no permission in this country it
doesn't exist there is no concern zero
permission so to say that you don't need
permissions is wrong people get harassed
by BMC in Bombay
by MCD in Delhi by the Chennai Municipal
Corporation in Chennai there are
hundreds of levels of bureaucracy of his
a central government doesn't control at
all so you can't always say that
tomorrow morning there'll be no
permission required you can do what you
want yes similarly they promise they'll
repeal sedition for instance right their
own state government has booked people
under the NSA for cow slaughter or for
for cow smuggling you need to walk the
talk and there are contradictions
inherent in in manifestos depending on
which side of the divided city right and
also we have talked about bringing in
the woman's reservation bill as of now
from the number of candidates we have
seen the ticket tally to women is about
11 or 12 percent it's nowhere near the
30 percent that we would have if we did
have Women's Reservation bills if you
were to make that promise you should
actually play it out I I saw a man
Allen's hand go up not on Malthus
erosion of these questions just one
second show can I come on Singh sir I
will give you an opportunity not at meta
first please Malan go ahead no I was
just saying say say I was just saying
that on you know on the question of
women foreign language is actually
comparing the congress 2014 manifesto
and the 2019 manifesto on women for
example his position was to for 33
percent reservation value now it's moved
to two thirty three percent reservation
of all central government jobs and if
you compare the two manifestos III think
the the stream of reasoning is very
similar on many issues but this one is a
much better drafted manifesto it's much
more specific for example on jobs on a
number of our own employment for example
in in new businesses it earlier said
will make it easier to start new
business and encourage corporate social
responsibility this time it's saying new
businesses won't need permissions for
three years especially for MSM ease the
point I'm trying to make is that this is
a much more thought-out and more
considered document than earlier but
what's even more significant than that I
mean you can argue about whether they
have money to implement this or not
whether it's all a pipe dream manifestos
at the end of the day are political
statements about a party's positioning
and I think the this the Congress in
this manifesto has been less reactive
than earlier it is trying to create a
counter narrative
in a post bellacourt era to talk about
removing about reviewing a spa to talk
about a new dialogue unconditional
dialogue on Kashmir to talk about
removing sedition laws all of these by
saying all of these I think the car and
you know it's the manifesto will read
the fine print start with a very clear
positioning of a off the Congress's idea
of a pluralistic India versus very
clearly what it talks about the RSS the
ideological family of the RSS and the
Prime Minister and then goes into very
specifics but I think but it's not this
is not just a usual document the
Congress I think he's trying to create a
counter narrative and in that to that
extent this is a break from from at
least the last couple of manifestos
we've seen this is also very different
from the Congress manifestos in recent
State Assembly elections for example in
multiple dish where the Congress was
trying to be to be more Hindu than the
BJP if you like at least as far as
manifesto concerned so this is a this is
a this is a different kind of manifesto
I would I would think
Shema Mohammed II wanted to respond go
ahead please yeah I want you to respond
to the gentleman who spoke before mr.
Nalan is that it's not that I'm always
ready to answer any questions I don't
get agitated I started my sentence and
then faint errupted and say answer my
question nobody can tell you know you
can't just tell a panelist answer my
question yes I'm getting to that
question and I will answer that but
before that I was generally and not
pointing fingers at fate because I know
she always questions I've seen that I
was generally telling about how in
certain channels how they become one
sided after 2014 they do not question
the present government they do not
question the Prime Minister and they say
whatever the Prime Minister does is
Chanakya nithi so I was putting in that
context and not too personally to face
so I am NOT an agitated person but when
yes if a needle is put into me I respond
that is one number two you talked about
the Women's Reservation yes the party
president wants 33 present reservation
but you have to understand that we are
not a party like TMC or b JD which TMC
is mainly in West Bengal and B JD is in
Odisha we are all over the country so if
we have to also there is a PCC there
they have certain things to it they
might want
men sometimes so in order to get
everybody into the same picture it is
better to go and have that amendment
done in the Lok Sabha much easier now I
come from a state like Kerala where
there are more women to men but I see
most of the time more men in politics
and I questioned that true and I want
that a change to come about there but
that is because there is a part of
patriarchy happening in that part of
Kerala where there is in politics of I
sees what I see is patriarchy and that
has to change and if this bill gets
passed where and mr. Gandhi even went
and said that you know he wants even 33%
reservation and government jobs for
women so he is very very clear about it
and once we come to power this is going
to definitely get through this 33%
reservations in assembly and Lok Sabha
because we are dismal when compared to
the world we have just 11.5% compared to
the world where you know they're much
higher about 20% representation of women
in politics especially in the Lok Sabha
and I mean I'm sorry in the PI
assemblies and okay in the Lok Sabha so
that definitely will change and about
the other things in terms of like like
the mr. Nalan mentioned you can't there
is six percent going to go for education
we're going to put three percent in
healthcare we are going to get in more
jobs so this manifesto definitely there
is a lot of clarity in this manifesto
and we have also said that the GST is
going to be there in petrol I mean in
diesel and petrol they will be taxation
in you will have also in table alcohol
will be taxed tobacco is going to be
taxed so there there are changes which
have come about you know we are not
entered into all this and we have also
said that one second on that point there
already on that point in fact you know
this is something we've talked about a
lot and I see professor Kumar putting
his hand up it says that we will bring
petrol and alcohol and cigarettes under
GST and then it says GST will have only
a single slab of tax so that would
effectively mean that the price of
petrol and the price of cigarettes would
crash you know by nearly half of what it
is because a lot of what it is is tax
me yeah tonight one second let me I just
want I just want professor Kumar's
response on this when I come back to you
Muhammad professor Kumari satisfied that
what he means by a once lab is general
generally you will have one slab but
there will be few things here and there
which will be different but it is not
going to be like what it is right now
you have a 28 percent then you have
something at 40 then you have something
at 18 then you have something at 15 then
you have something at 2 then you
something at 8 that is if you can still
bring it Roland diesel under GST if
you're still going to have special tax
on it now we are not going to have
special b1 tax but there will be few
things which would be higher okay all
right okay night know one second
professor come on I'll go ahead I think
yeah so you know you know the point
about keeping petroleum out and liquor
for human consumption out was because
the states were worried that they will
not collect enough taxes and they could
collect enough taxes from these and
that's why they were kept out now you
will have to convince the states because
it will be through the GST Council that
you will collect enough taxes so that
they don't lose the revenues you know
their deficits are already quite high
and if you take them out so you have to
show how you'll plan it you have to
transfer more resources to them from
somewhere else
so unless GST begins to collect a lot
more taxes you will not be able to make
this change you know that the states
will protest if they begin to lose taxes
so I don't think it's going to be that
easy to do that change within two years
because at the moment GST is not
collecting as much taxes as it was
supposed to collect and therefore I
don't think this change going to be easy
but I want to make a larger point and
the larger point is what I said earlier
this manifestos more inclusive than many
other manifestos that you've seen where
the state will take responsibility for
the marginalized sections this is change
from the 1991 policies where the state
was taking less and less responsibility
for the moduli sections so now large
number of sections who are marginalized
are going to receive something from the
state so this is in a sense going back
- the nerubian policies that used to
exist before 1991 and that I think is a
big break that is taking place but to
finance that you may have certain
problems because how would you tax to be
able to do these things so in a sense if
you want to make a consistent whole yes
you need to show the resource base
whether you'll tax wealth tax whether
you tax the other state duty gas etc and
another point is if you're going to give
more to the poor and state is going to
take wider responsibilities you'll need
a much larger bureaucracy because at the
moment our bureaucracy is very small for
one lack of population the number of
police the number of judges the number
of bureaucrats is very less compared to
most other countries in the world
so therefore the expenditure and
bureaucracy will have to rise if you are
going to take a number of schemes that
you have in mind
so in a sense if this is where you know
they're good things but you need to put
together the whole thing in a holistic
perspective and also it's very important
to say whether they will achieve these
policies in two years or five years or
ten years because everything cannot be
achieved all at once so this time gap
also is very important you know how you
will structure these things so that you
can achieve more employment and more
other you know benefits to the farmers
etc well you know I do want to put out
this piece of research if for everyone
who's asking about you know farm loan
waivers and how if we forgive the farm
loan rivers and you know if farmers are
going to continue to borrow and not pay
back on latest count agricultural NPS
which have loans that have been borrowed
and not paid back over eighty seven
thousand nine hundred crore rupees and
in comparison the top twelve
cooperating peers in India four times as
much which means that corporate India
has borrowed and not paid back far more
then our farmers could have ever so when
corporate India is getting massive
restructures all the time and by a
restructure we mean what happened with
jet airways but jet was not able to pay
back and the government of India then
decided that we will give them even more
money to keep them from going bust so
when we're doing that why can't we also
make sure that we're keeping our farmers
looked after mr. Goswami do you ever do
you have a point or response to whether
or not we should consider
a farm loan waiver or a complete or a
partial farm loan waiver across the
country at this point well you know last
year this all the stage together gave up
one hundred and forty thousand crores as
founded on waivers you know the state
covers said that they will make good and
at some places you know the central
government didn't make good so that is
actually the NP R you're making good so
you know I don't think these kind of
comparisons are going to work thing is a
credit system has to function credit
system to function means you've got to
pay her back as simple as that
if you breach that and Raghu Ram rather
than a lot of people have been talking
about this to breach that covenant then
you get into this mode for into answer
riding a tiger from which you can't
respond which is maybe a snack for every
government now is a tradition to
announce a farm waiver found loan waiver
so you can't keep doing this you know
the point is that you need to get a
consensus across the land to say how are
we going to address this issue of you
know getting NPS back yes amperes are
you know there are there are now these
mudras have become NPS how are you going
to collect that from the average voter
alone is about twenty eight thousand
rupees where you going to get that money
from so you know I think I think I think
you know we need to get a sense of
responsibility in these political
parties get them to think things through
right now it's all you know a
competitive sloganeering you know and I
think the Congress like I don't said
Congress manifesto points to a direction
which is quite a lot of us quite good
but I think this they needed to do more
homework because it's a sudden switch
direction after 1996 maybe and something
which needed to be done you can't have
these kind of disparities between
reasons income inequality and continue
with it because that will lead to social
breakdown direction which is very good
yes the direction is good but the
details perhaps lacking with your heart
says does the Election Commission have
any prerogative to question political
parties about in practical
Paul promises absolutely not in fact the
Election Commission already has enough
foreign split it ought to be questioning
people about when it no no of course not
I mean I guess this is I mean actually
that's for us the electorate to actually
be more mindful I think yes people need
to start reading manifestos they need to
start understanding what it means and
perhaps questioning the government going
forward I mean I think that's it's more
on us then on the easy the other joins
us right now national president of
Swaraj India mr. Yadav good evening
thank you for joining us your review of
the Congress manifesto just to bring you
up to speed of the conversation that's
happened so far they have been questions
about the details of where the money is
going to come from that are missing will
it be taxes will it be tax of rich tax
of middle class if we're you know
rationalizing GST then it won't be an
increase GST collection so where will
the money come from for an increased
education health nice scheme and a
couple of other promises that the
Congress has made but from your point of
view are you impressed with the
manifesto afraid these are absolutely
valid questions we must be asking these
questions this country has seen one
joomla's a car for five years because
when they made all these grand promises
no one interrogated them and the last
thing that this country needs is another
Joomla set car that they promised
someone no it not something that is not
interrogated so I think you and other
colleagues in the media when they pin
Congress down they when they interrogate
they are doing what the media ought to
be doing and my own sense is that
Congress is not fully forthcoming on
this especially on the issues of revenue
the simple fact is that if you promise a
nice key if you promise six percent GDP
on education three percent on health if
you promise that no other subsidies will
be withdrawn then obviously you generate
resources from somewhere I would have
wanted any party to be more candid and
say alright this is how we would
generate it but I guess I now country
we've not reached a point where you can
be so honest in an election thing now I
look at this document in two ways one as
a policy document the other as a
political document as a policy document
I must say it's a serious document it's
not a Joomla document for at least to
begin with it raised and the reason why
I
would welcome this document is not
because I agree with it there are lots
and lots of questions I have lots of
disagreements I have but this allows me
to raise the right questions I may
disagree with me I think there are
design issues with Nia but it reminds me
that there are very poor people in this
country who need to be address that they
need a stimulus not just the
industrialists on the farmers issue not
all the demands farmers organizations
have made have been met here so I have
acquired I would raise the question but
at least farmers question is right in
the focus on employment when Rahul
Gandhi says we will get 20 lakh jobs
from the government's all over the
country I would like him to begin with
his own governments to do that but at
least the issue of jobs is at the center
RPE is recognized as an issue that you
need second Asha worker is an issue that
we need health is an issue so I like
that as a political document however I
am not entirely sure if this document is
the kind of document we need it at this
stage of the election to shift the
narrative and I don't know if any
document could have done the trick the
problem is it's only 10 days to the
first round of polling Congress's
ability and capacity to amplify and
communicate is very poor mr. Modi can
sell things which don't exist in his
shop Congress cannot sell things which
are lying there on the counter
and three Congress like mr. Modi suffers
from a credibility problem when Congress
says we have done it we will do it again
there are many in this country who feel
a shiver down the spine Congress will do
it again so while Congress wants to give
this country a break from mr. Modi's
last five years Congress doesn't promise
us a break from the kind of Congress
this country had seen five years ago
that is what we have turned the table
but we don't yet know but at least I
would say all right we've begun
discussing the right issues oh we see
either before I move on to the rest of
the panel quick question to you your
Asif ologist you've studied elections
for a very very long time when you
consider the power of the Congress party
now with this
manifesto and everything else that has
been said the alliances that haven't
have not worked out
do you believe they're well placed given
that there is only 10 days to go before
the first round Fay I used to do it in
my previous birth and these days I
wonder why people do this election for
cars and why does any exam seriously so
honestly no election forecasts but I
would I would simply say this much that
if this election comes back to its
fundamentals that BJP is on a very very
tough wicket but as we can see every day
something happens to take it away from
fundamental what were we discussing
yesterday how many Muslims do we have it
why not
for heaven's sake is that the real
question of this country
how many chocolate ours and who is not a
chalky dot and I'm afraid a large
segment of the media with honorable
exceptions like your channel are
complicit in this so this is one of the
most critical elections in the history
of this country and the entire election
is being hijacked so I do not know if
that kind of hijacking succeeds then
what happens I do not know but coming
back to the manifesto I I did see you
know I didn't want to go back to my own
guru Swami mr. guru Swami when we talk
about in we've had several conversations
on the channel about GST about bringing
prices of reasons of bringing prices of
petrol and diesel down to a more
reasonable link to do global you know
prices and of course now mr. Chidambaram
in his manifesto has resurrected the
famed deep their direct tax code that
was talked about for a very long time
but completely abandoned by the UPA -
after a couple of years do you believe
that these are all possible because
again given that the GST council
involves all states it's not a promise
that a union government can make because
they can't keep that promise you have to
bring all state governments on board are
these reasonable promises to make no
no Union government or no state
government can afford to do without
petroleum taxes they are hooked to it
they addicted to them because it's easy
money very little leakage and collection
is very easy so they can do it you can't
reduce taxes on bull because that's also
easy money liquor taxes are easy to
collect the single source taxes you
collected at the Fed did outside the
factory or the important level or
wherever so it's easy so you can't do
without it if you look at any state
budget 30 percent to 40 percent of their
money comes from excise so they can't do
without liquor taxes without petroleum
so without petroleum with petroleum is
about 70 percent they hardly connect
Lear the revenue so you know all this is
nice talk but you know like mrs. damrell
is writing for a national party
essential budget and you know this he is
not the only player there are 25 other
players there they all have to come on
board and they're not going to come on
board we're running a state governance
bad enough as it is and without this is
impossible
there are central camera to give so you
know these taxes cannot come down
whatever the Congress representative
says or whatever mr. moody at one time
said that you know he'll bring it down
he couldn't bring it down you can't
bring it on that's how things are like
you know you can't cut taxes on
cigarettes these are all taxes which are
there forever yes so so I think we need
to now change gears on the conversation
the important
yes Rajesh Singh has asked us this
question how much will today's manifesto
help the Congress in terms of votes in
this election and quite rightly is miss
together was pointing out this is an
attempt to change the narrative or
change the conversation back from
whatever back from what the Prime
Minister introduced into the public
narrative unconscious yesterday about
religion but bringing it back to what
the Congress wants to talk about have
they been successful really I would
agree with you again completely one is
it's it's a little I mean narrative
building has to be done a little more in
advance that's one - I completely agree
with them on their ability to amplify
their point of view I think the BJP is
very superior in terms of amplification
even on things as he's rightly said
which probably probably do not even
exist
they're able to create a narrative order
something which doesn't exist itself
Congress is not as strong with that and
that's where my big problem is because
the intent of the manifesto may be right
that they want to very obviously this
Mara Fest is about farmers it's about
jobs which should have been the
discussion in the first place it says
but if you want to pitch this election
as as one between nationalism or
Pakistan versus some jobs and in reality
culture you need to make a lot more
noise about it and you need to have
perhaps started way earlier than what
you've done now now do you agree do you
think that this would have managed to
change the conversation or would this
change only lasts one day well I don't
think I'm not sure if a manifesto can
change the entire narrative of an
election but just judging by the sheer
vitriol and the sheer and the reactions
of several of the BJP leaders to the
Congress's manifesto they seem to have
hit a bit of a raw nerve I mean just the
kind of language that's been used and
the bombast we are hearing from the BJP
today on the manifesto it seems the
Congress seem may well be on the right
track on this just learning from that
reaction and now now now now now whether
that's going to be enough or not on
weather like Dogon the other was saying
whether the issues of focusing on the
issue of jobs and and agriculture and
all of the deep underlying issues at the
heart of the structural problems in our
quality whether we going to just talk
about bar code or no or nationalism
narratives away from all of that that is
the big question over this election will
be decided but I think by focusing a
round Gandhi is trying to recover some
you know in the last two or three weeks
because of not getting some of the
Alliance's rights Rahul Gandhi had been
losing some of the early momentum they
had I think that they're recovering some
of that in the last week tendons in
marriage manifesto is a step in that
direction very well so a couple of
people on the phone Ram Prakash on the
phone line from Bangalore and go ahead
good evening good evening to a reason go
ahead what would you like this is visit
to the Congress panelist on your show
this is regarding today's manifesto I
guess I was alluding to your member
Westy program yes my question is for the
past 50 50 years when the Congress was
ruling and the poverty couldn't be
removed at all but all of a sudden well
the polls is when the poll comes near by
people say you didn't remove the poverty
okay but the 72,000 of the pieces yes
why not well to be to be fair mr.
Prakash the poverty numbers during
independence and what they are now are
drastically different
India has developed a great deal for for
those many years Anthony on the phone
line from Pune and she go ahead Yaffe
actually I'm pretty confident about this
manifesto and there are a couple of good
pointers to it at the oversight let me
say it is a good manifesto removed by
Congress and the good thing what
Congress has done is they've covered all
the areas of progress which is required
so they have not stuck to one one point
they've covered all the points if you
look at the manifesto so interesting
mixed response coming in I see a
professor Kumar has his hand up and his
baby he's waited to speak for a while
but I so go back do you believe that
this manifesto is enough to change and
at the end of the day it's about the
message trickling down to rural India is
there enough steam here to trickle that
message down to Little India to make a
difference to the party in any way so
you know Fay economic manifestations and
political perceptions often differ so
you may have a very good economic agenda
but you have to create a political
narrative about it and that's where BJP
has shown that BJP is very clever in
creating agendas and you know
perceptions it's up to the Congress to
convert this it's a very inclusive
program that they have a worked out the
details may not be there but the people
are only looking at one or two or three
critical issues you know they don't look
at the entire gamut of issues that are
covered in a manifesto so the question
is on one or two or three things if the
Congress able to create you know like
the nice
when it was announced suddenly created a
change in perception you know now
whether there's enough time to take it
to the public or not that's a separate
question whether they have the
organization to do it but you know if
they activate the youth organizations if
they're women's organizations as rubbish
I'm sure they must be doing then I think
certain amount of the message will go
through but how much you know and
whether they'll change the people's
perception in the next 10 days and let
let's be clear BJP will also try and
change the narrative once again you know
BJP is already you know attacking this
you know manifesto in a variety of ways
they will also come up with certain
things so I think it's a game where you
know Congress has to stay one step ahead
if it is to succeed in converting this
into a political perception all right
we're gonna have to leave it here
because we've run out of time in
conclusion as I thank my panelists for
that time obviously there is going to be
a series of manufacturers that would be
released by various political parties
we'll take a close look at all of them
we will question all of them we have to
understand of course that manifestos are
just poll promises the job of
journalists will actually also begin
once the election is done to make sure
that these parties actually keep those
promises as we have done for the last
two years Merida will question any
government of the day any government
that is in power thanks for watching",True,en,9492,86,206

good evening over the new year I'm Sara
Zama this evening with the election
focus we have with us in our studio a
very special guest actor turned
politician playing a new role there is a
room Ella Matondkar who's running for
the Congress on the Lok Sabha ticket
here from the North Mumbai constituency
misma Tonder thank you so much for being
with us taking time out for Mira now in
this hectic in the thick of election
campaign thank you so much thank you my
first question to you or Malala with
respect to expectations of course we've
seen you reaching out to people meeting
different people on ground the
expectations are high because what has
been observed that you've been pulling
huge crowds this time not for the
release of a movie but for an election
so what are those promises here that
you're really making to people for
people who are coming out to see you to
listen to you on why you switch to
politics right now well it is because of
the changing face of the society
essentially because over the last five
years I don't recognize my country
anymore and if I didn't get up and wake
up and just took a step ahead and just
stood up for many such people who trust
me are coming and meeting me every
single day in smaller or bigger bigger
groups because of the extreme
intolerance are secular fabric of the
country getting every day completely
tarnished those were some of the issues
that has literally pushed me into taking
this step and now that have taken it I'm
just trying to I mean get into my people
understand their problems which are not
new to me being a boom biker and I think
one of the biggest ones being their
housing issue which is largely so in the
north region here in Bombay because
there are lots of slums and the slum
redevelop
is going to be essentially the first big
step if at all I'm given a chance okay
that of course you're mentioning this as
your focus area you were also there to
meet with the union of auto drivers what
have been their demands specifically
because these are in reaching out to
people in pockets that belong to the
constituency that you're contesting yes
that particular constituency as I said
over there in one of my meets like it
was an informal meet but um is that you
know it is very much a part of Bombay
but completely cut off from Bombay in
many ways so it's a promise to them I
mean to have kind of gotten get to get
them connected to the beautiful
glamorous city of Pompeii in many more
ways of communication and transport as
well and the richer drivers particularly
you know being a part of such a large
part of Bombay's you know transport
system almost like a lifeline again
there is a huge problem of housing and
that is what we are you know under the
some redevelopment scheme of Congress
for Bombay looking at giving the minimum
of a five hundred square feet a house
upper family and that is going to be the
most interesting task to follow up all
right but but or Mila how different is
this going to be from what the current
state government per se has already
promised and built upon when you say
it's about the slum redevelopment in
giving housing to people a lot of that
what the state BJP also says has already
been worked upon no but
well they see a lot of things but
reality is out there to see to come and
see which I'm seeing and it's really in
a pathetic state so a lot has been said
why only on that particular front on
every other front but the only thing
honestly they've kept us busy with is
discussing and deciding you know about
different things about you know religion
and caste and this and that and keeping
us busy with all of that and if possible
for more time than keeping us busy with
what can you meet one should eat or not
and if you still have time then trying
to struggle and wonder what to make with
our unemployment issue so I think there
is a lot that was said and there is a
lot different picture that is out there
so I think lesser set is better the
results are out there to see there was a
tremendous discontent in people
I mean being my my mobile number which
was of it a few people till a few days
ago is literally with so many people
today I'm getting messages calls from
people pictures from people giving me
the you know the conditions in which
various things are so that I can talk
about them raise an issue and bring it
forward
so I think that itself is showing how
much people are dying to come out and
speak about all these issues and that's
exactly what I'm doing as a starter all
right or Mila from your personal
experience did did you expect this or
how mentally prepared really you were to
to face scrutiny on your personal life
with respect to what religion you belong
to or whom you're married to or how
you've chosen to conduct your personal
life did you see this coming the day you
decided to enter politics honestly I did
honestly I didn't I didn't think I was
so big enough for important enough for
people to troll me down so mercilessly
thus just showing that how important I
must have been to them to us you know
they're already spending so much money
on their IT cells to bring people down
and to troll them whoever is raising
voice and raising issues it has happened
in the past and it has been shut down
because of you know people
just backed off maybe that was the
intention that I'll back off I get
scared and I shut up or I'll run away
all together but I wasn't really
expected for it to go this far it has
really gone too far and it's sad because
it also involves my husband and his
family and you know they have nothing to
do with all of this and with my one
decision a lot of nonsense has been
spoken about me and that is precisely my
point that what my religion is it should
be strictly my matter and how I'm
following it up and how I'm committed to
is it's strictly my personal choice and
freedom it is for no one to judge that
and ask me questions on that or any
other part of my belief or my conviction
in life right but but do you see this as
an as an orchestrated attack because
you've said that one of the reasons that
that you join politics because people's
voices are being muffled they're their
personal choices are being questioned
personal choices with respect to with
which religion they belong to with
respect to what they wear with respect
to what they eat so do you feel this has
been an orchestrated attack or were you
really taken aback there is no iota of
this trolling that you were not
expecting absolutely not because I
didn't go I didn't think it would go to
these levels I mean I have been on
Instagram two years ago since two years
I never had a single negative comment or
maybe it was on a choice of a dress that
maybe somebody didn't like or my hair
color or something that trivial you know
something this are basic it's something
that um that I have not given anybody a
right and my Constitution has given me
the right to choose that and to follow
that and therefore nobody else has the
right to question all of these things
but when the party in the guy in the
government in the central government
allows all these things allows mob
lynching allows people to be killed on
the name of religion or cause why what
else do you expect but these this kind
of uh tremendously hate oriented
politics yo
tender then your constituency bJP MP
Gopal Shetty today had made a very
derogatory memo a remark against you of
course wanting to sound respectful about
it saying that she's just an actor yay
holy-moly Lurky hair she doesn't know
what she's getting into she's gonna be a
huge crowd puller because she's a star
but it's not going to be translating
into votes how would you respond to that
well according to him he is just
fighting an ideology a suddenly a point
that I have spoken about seems to be on
everyone's mind
I hope my positivity and my freedom or
my freedom oriented talks and spirit
also reflects in their thoughts and
actions and about apart from that if
that is what he thinks about him well
good for him and making his life easier
am I not
I just intend to write over here the
Congress sadly and I don't need to kind
of keep on going on and on okay right
the I&C the International Congress of
course released its manifesto earlier
this morning which which is being
scrutinized on several fronts and
they've spoken about they have raised
this issue of freedom of expression
particularly the youth or those who have
been outspoken to be able to speak your
mind do you feel that there is going to
be this is going to be your continued
focus apart from what you feel would be
requirements of Mumbaikars in the
context in the constituency that you're
contesting freedom of expression freedom
of speech freedom of living eating
talking how you want to is also going to
be a parallel focus here for you know
that they kind of go hand in hand where
I'm concerned to be honest I feel a
society which is constantly you know not
allowed to talk it's constantly
pressurized on these all these basic
rights of their which has been given to
us and the our democracy is one of not
only one of the largest ones but it is
the most studied democracies of the
world and
has been then adopted as for the Indian
culture and people and then made into a
kind of solid democracy that it has um
you know over the years evolved to be so
therefore I feel that and this cannot be
two different things they're kind of
interrelated because only in a society
where there is positivity where there is
good feeling towards each other you know
there's a feeling of brotherhood which
are even our Indian pledge talks about
only then this is the kind of society
which is capable of moving towards the
progress and the society which is
constantly pulling you down and making a
push you're thinking push backwards ask
you questions about your caste and
religion in need and this and that it is
constantly going to put you and you know
keep you busy with the petty issues of
life and never going to let you rise
above all of these things and together
as a nation take a step ahead
probably a few steps ahead which we need
to take alright we appreciate you being
with us spending these many mere minutes
with us in in the thick of campaigning
as we said also in the thick of the
heatwave
what many politicians are facing in

sent a notice to the railway ministry
this is with respect to the teacups that
were being shared with passengers which
had the slogan written maybe chalky Dodd
the Election Commission has demanded a
report from the IR CTC officials here
for the tika prow it is also called for
action to be taken against those railway
officials there for this lackadaisical
approach this is a big breaking input
that we are getting in on this
controversy we have with us a
correspondent Irishman with those inputs
here
Irish lon at the start of it of course
there was action taken against the
contractor who was in charge of
distributing these cups
but now the Election Commission wants
action taken against the concerned
railway authorities well sir if UCD
notice given by the Election Commission
it clearly mentions the fact that there
was a different kind of approach adopted
by the railway and the consent of fishel
whosoever was in charge of it and that's
why election commission feels that since
there was a clear violation of the model
code of conduct there should be there
should have been a clear approach from
the railway and that was not there and
that is where the Commission feels that
the in that the concerned railway
official should be taken to task and
that's why I notice had been served to
the railway officials in this regard on
the other hand railway has also served a
notice to the chairman of IRCTC as well
as the chairman of the railways saying
on April 4th by 11 o'clock this entire
report should come to the commissioner
so how the vendor served the tea in the
cups which had the Prime Minister's
image it was a Sankalp NGO which was in
charge of this and they have demanded
the complete report to to be submitted
to the Commission by April 4th by 11
o'clock sir this is the note there are
two kinds of notice being sent one to
the IRCTC they are to the railway in
which the they have demanded okay the
action on the railway officials who have
not taken the commission's notice
seriously sir right
ayushman what more is known
about this NGO because these are of
course and update on the information
that you're getting are sad this NGO
that you've made some cult which has
been connected to this controversy what
more is known about this NGO works was
working with the contractor who was
supplying this the NGO is involved in
some kind of work which is being done
they claim that they are working for
this society and they are doing some
charity work right now this has been
known this this and help NGO works in
coordination with a few of the groups
which works for the people who are lying
living below the poverty line but right
now this NGO has come in line of fire
because they had printed this info on
the their own info about their own
websites and the Facebook handles on the
tea cups it also had maybe chalkida with
the Prime Minister Modi's image which
was a clear violation of model code of
conduct and that is why you can see
these notices being served to IRCTC as
well as to the Ministry of Railways in
this regard sure right I used non stay
on with us because these are of course
various instances here coming in with
respect to the violation of the model
code of conduct here is concerned this
now directly concerns the Indian

where we answer one crucial question
that will determine the outcome of the
2019 polls i'm artis or ammonium I'm
joining the unexplained is Marin as
consulting editor of inactive Ari
Thank You Artie pleasure to join the
show now since the Supreme Court will
take that a lot women of all ages to
enter the Supreme alight temple the
state of Kerala has seen protests
violence and a lot of political
bickering surprisingly the BJP and the
Congress find themselves in the same
side of this debate with both of them
opposing the entry of women into the
temple they turn against them is the
left government which is actually back
to Supreme Court verdict on today's
explained we answer will Sabri malai be
the crucial factor that determines the
outcome of the kerala elections now
before we answer that question is very
crucial to look at the political
landscape of Kerala and it has largely
been a bipolar race across yours now if
you look at the Assembly poll results
it's always alternated between the LDF
and the UDF and the BJP really has been
nowhere in the picture if you look at
the locus of my elections interestingly
in 2014 Karos one of the states that
saved Congress the blushes they actually
did reasonably well here and the BJP was
nowhere in the picture but this has
largely been a bipolar race between the
CPM and the Congress yes two complete
blocks of alliances in the state which
have governed if the last almost 30
years in spite of the fact and very
interestingly significantly rs is having
a very strong present in Kerala it's not
it's a state with RSS has been present
for a while it's been almost three to
four decades they've have the highest
highest number of chakras in the state
and they've actually got a very good
ground presence and despite that these
two blocks have kind of doubled over in
the state ever since
also remember interesting lis Carol eyes
also the last surviving common is
Bastion in this country so in many ways
after three powerful and BJP did well
there this is one state we're not
counting this number yet but yes in well
TMC in many ways is like a carbon copy
of left but technically it's not left so
the last left Bastion in that sense and
that's now the new battleground the left
versus right politics now when and where
do the BJP make an entry in the state
let's just look at the BJP based
performance across the years or if you
say specifically the Lok Sabha polls in
2014 they reach their peak now with
10.50 percent of the work share they
really dominated and hit the peak
they've never done so before if you even
look at their assembly polls results now
2016 is a landmark here for BJP in the
state of Kerala because along with ten
point six zero percent of the woods they
actually got one seat in Kerala now this
seat was actually won by row rajagopal
who's contested 15 elections he's
actually contested 15 elections finally
managed to win just one a lot of people
are seeing this are wondering so on its
one seat how does it matter
but the word share' tells you a very
crucial story it does and this is the
overall state watch chair in fact if you
drill this vote share down further and
you see there are about 10 C 8 C's out
of the 16 looks overtly or 20 looks of
at least where the BT peace would share
raised actually between ten and twenty
eight percent so they will play selected
Surat arrum inform they got our church
is much higher than the state average as
well and that gave vjp a bit of a hope
in the sense of finally making a dent in
etc but they've never ever done well and
in that sense or odd co-pilots victory
notionally speaking was the first foot
in the door for the kerala for the BJP
in kerala it was something that even the
Prime Minister - II didn't congratulate
of the state BJP for their performance
but how does the BJP convert these warts
into seats because they just got one
seat so what is the BJP strategy going
to be now to understand this let's just
first look at the breakup of the state
now Kerala is largely in the dominated
state fifty-five percent being
55% of the population comprising Hindus
now if you further break that up the two
largest thoughts are the arrows and the
knives members have traditionally been
left supporters while liars have been
Congress supporters now the BJP is game
plan essentially is to ensure in the
consolidation that's right and also to
increment Libre a chip away at both
these blocks because without doing that
they really won't be in a position to
win seats the first part of that was
nice service society which is a very
influential group amongst a nice
traditionally always Congress for the
first time are showing a probe Egypt
English in this time and I think their
efforts have paid off to that extent
with that subject that we're talking
Chablis malai was one big factor in that
and unless they actually chip away the
two things you see in the screen from
the air
and the Neyers the PJ peace dream of
actually having more seats in the state
will not work and that's why they're
working assiduously they were chipping
off from both the blocks which is really
wasn't came changer and the inflection
point in state politics was you to see
now let's just look at why Shabri Malay
played this whole role of a game change
of now it converted Sabri Mullen when I
say this is the BJP a game plan in the
state of Kerala they converted Sabri
malai into the idea of the South they
used faith as a calling card yes and in
the north for instance in UPN in Bihar
there had a huge change role in the
change the BT of peach appease fortunes
all over the 90s and then even later as
well and in that sense
Shabri malay word it gave them a godsend
opportunity what also going through her
guts and opportunity was the way in
which the other two parties handled the
fallout of this now the other crucial
factor that helped the BJP was the
Congress and its ambivalence now there
was a lot of discord within the state
leadership and the central leadership
where you saw the central high command
actually backing the Supreme Court
verdict but the state saying no we're
actually against this that's right and
that didn't go down very well with
certain people I think they got a little
confused about what where the position
is I think they underestimated the
importance in the strength of the faith
especially connected in connection with
shabarimala is an incident I think
that's where Congress slightly played a
role a game which didn't work to the
advantage and the BJP was very quick to
seize on it in fact all the protests
that you saw was the verdict were in
large sense being led by the RSS
Carter's on the ground they were
actually planning it out they were doing
it very actively and that's where they
seized that vacuum that Congress was
leaving behind by giving their anguillan
position that you're talking off on the
street and the third crucial factor that
helped the BJP was the fact that the LDS
position was such that they insisted
that they're going to implement the
Supreme Court verdict now this LDF said
that this is a law enforcement pitch
that's all it's about this is not about
faith now the BJP and show that this was
a matter purely of faith so as you were
mentioning pitted against the position
or the ambivalence of the Congress and
the strident position of the left the
BJP really stood out lent that's right
and the left again slightly misread the
pitch at the start and they took a very
strong position of implementing law in
order which again didn't go down well
with their traditional supporters so the
arrow was also not very happy even
though the lower casseras were very
happy but no but not that unhappy but
there are other groups as well which
were not very happy with it because as
we said repeat
the shrubbery mullah is a very very
strongly emotive issue in the state and
both the parties kind of slightly
misread it in fact if you know last few
weeks or so the catalog I'm gonna
slightly pipe the stridency down because
they see that the GOP has taken moved in
and taken advantage of the dissonance in
the booth if you're the left you look at
this as an opportunity because you have
both the Congress and the BJP fighting
for the similar fight for the same pie
and you have a large minority population
as well that is looking towards you and
saying what decision you're going to
make in this issue that is true but the
beach the BJP is playing a different
game they're not exactly playing the
game as of now to win the Lok Sabha
seats per se they're also playing the
rim there are local body elections of
three years from now there's gonna be an
assembly election the BJP is game plan
has been very simple in state after
state they've tried to replace the
Congress as the principal party they're
doing that in Bengal yeah where the left
is now being wiped out in many ways and
BJP is taking that space of the
operation party and they're trying to do
the same in Kerala they know it's going
to be a long haul but the RSS strategy
has always been to go for the long haul
that's what they did in through power
we're finally left at Bastian fell and
this is much the same they're doing in
Kerala
well Somali is an emotive issue it's a
polarizing issue and unsurprisingly then
it is an electoral issue now politics
and faith have always gone hand in hand
in India but it depends on whether the
BJP can cash into that or not yes and
they've done that in the north in all
the in these speaking states faith has
worked well for them through the 90s and
later as well
can they repeat the same thing in the
South with riding on this of Rama Lake
is something we'll find out soon well we
find out on May 23rd

welcome to the special election coverage
from West Bengal we are in Kolkata
outside the beautiful Victoria Memorial
for the first time the BJP has emerged
as a formidable opposition in the state
they have their eyes on the 42

government claims they will sweep all of
them election strategies apart what are
some of the issues on ground which
affect people and are likely to
influence their vote we travelled across
the state to figure that out

Mamta Banerjee had been in Bengal
politics for decades but shingle marked
her rights she agitated for weeks
against what she claimed was possible
acquisition of farmland for a Tata
project in Bengal her success later on
to be projected as a pro farmer leader
but currently most farmers and shingle
are not really happy with the Chief
Minister we visit shingle to find out
why

come across shake looked for Emmett and

of lands which had been acquired by
Tatas for the car factory after the

lying battered

the land is filled with boulders rocks
completely uneven making it impossible
for the farmers to tell it farmers in
the area of single had been promised by
the state that their land would be
evened out and made worthy of
cultivation this promise had been made
for close to 1,000 acres of land the
land which was stopped out for the Tata
project and then returned but even ten

the citizenship amendment bill and the
National Registry of citizens have both
dominated the national debate of late
and these issues resonate in Bengal
because a large chunk of Hindu refugees
from Bangladesh live here and are
awaiting their citizenship something
which has been promised to them by the
prime minister himself they are an
influential vote bank in Bengal and both
the BJP and the TMC are wooing one
family to win their favor a photo-op
which can draw huge political dividends
with the citizenship amendment bill and
the National Register of citizens being
part of the national debate ahead of the
elections the motto community is back in
focus and it's one family in Bengal
which leads the moth was settled in
Assam and Bengal which called the key
Brina pani Devi the matriarch of the
community in Bengal is no more she
passed away at the age of 100 this month
but her presence looms large in Bengal
politics as we travel three hours away
from Kolkata taco Nagar posters with the
image of the Bengal Chief Minister
controlling her demise are strewn all
over the incumbent TMC MP from the area
Mamta Haku is also from the family the
matura community originally from
Bangladesh had fled to West Bengal as
they faced religious persecution after
partition but they are seen to be hugely
significant in Bengal electoral politics
we want the only citizenship without any
condition nothing more but this central
government now his dominating power is
imposing so many condition to acquire
citizenship we protested in 7470
constituency's and seven parliamentary
ones the Motta's have a strong influence
it's not just the state Chief Minister
the BJP has also ruled the community the
Prime Minister visited the lady Nepali
Devi both in 2014 and as recently as
February this year he addressed a rally
from taco Nagar
during his February visit and promised
citizenship to the community under the
new act being rocked by the government
but matters have gotten more complicated
since then the matriarch is no more and
the house is divided here in Takenaga
the Tucker family is hugely significant
and influential but also politically
divided we are just standing a few feet
away from the residence of the TMC MP
candidate from the area
Mamta bala Tucker but again just a
walking distance away if we can move our

from panchayat elections to national
level looks of elections there are
always reports of political violence
from Bengal this time around the center
has raised an alarm and the Chief
Election Commissioner has pronounced
elections in the state but is there
really a cause for concern and is only
one party inflicting political violence
in Bengal flag marches being carried out
in beer boom district of Bengal last
year very few from the Congress or the
BJP could file nomination papers for the
panchayat elections in the area as
political violence got out of control so
now the EC and the government are being
cautious at least 7 companies of central
forces have been deployed in eight
districts of Bengal the entire Bengal
during this election we declare a
sensitive with 42 parliamentary seats
elections will be held in seven stages
in Benghazi political violence is
nothing new to Bengal in fact there have
been a spate of incidents under the CPM
rule of poll violence and both capturing
now the BJP is gaining ground in certain
pockets of the state and there are
victims of political violence on both
sides

the jungle malaria of West Bengal
largely houses its tribal population
until just a few years ago was
completely Mao is dominated now it's
much safer and there are a few tourist
destinations as well but as the Chief
Minister claims is jungle model really
smiling why is it that the BJP has been
gaining ground over here steadily
despite the TMC government having
successfully curbed Maoist violence
watch this report
we are around four hours away from
Kolkata and entering an area which is
known as jungle Mahal in West Bengal now
this is an area traditionally known to
be Maoist dominated but ever since
Muktha Banerjee came to power she has
consistently worked over here to push
back the Maoist and bring in more
development now what we can see over
here is that there are some roads which
have been laid and some developmental
projects which are going on but will
speak to people over here to understand
their issues and their expectations from
a new government
[Music]
the jungle mile area is inhabited by
tribal communities in Bengal over the
past decade
Trinamool had managed to build a
stronghold here but that's all erosion
in 2018 for child elections when BJP won
28 out of 79 seats in charge am alone in
char gram we travel to santipura village
and within minutes we can see what ails
the villagers
a clean drinking water project has been
set up for Santa Paula and surrounding
villages but it's barely functional we
are at Bill Bihari village in charge am
area and this is one of the water tanks
which has been created by the
administration here in order to provide
clean safe drinking water to the locals
but what we found about here is that
this is completely defunct that work is
not functioning in this area and despite
complaining to the local MP the

villagers in bail Bihari area of char
gram are struggling for basic necessity
like water a foundation has been laid
but there is no one to run it
the char Graham district in Jungle model
is right next to the charcoal border
while the town has seen some development
the story is different in villages here
we go further into belper hurry to
village Daraa but to reach the village
this is the only path we had this is the
only path the villagers have to connect
them to the main road
dhara is a small village with a
population of 150 people consisting of
members of the sheduled caste and tribe
they all have a job card under the
government scheme which entitles them to
hundred days of guaranteed work at a
minimum wage of 183 rupees per day but
when rejected there weren't any entries
forced 2010
we're here at Schiphol para in Belper
hari area of char gram and what we can
see over here we go to one lady here and
her job card is essentially showing that
she has more or less worked only three
days and her husband has worked three
days of the year they are entitled to
getting 100 days of jobs but that has
not happened as for the government
husband

almost 30 percent of the population in
West Bengal is Muslim it's 20 percent in
Poltava alone and just like 2014
first-time voters will play a huge role
in this election we spoke to some young
Muslim voters to figure out what are
issues they will keep in mind while
casting their votes
[Music]
we are here in outside Victoria Memorial
in Kolkata it's a beautiful sunny day
and we are here to talk to some young
people who will all be most likely
first-time voters they are from the
Muslim community all of them live in
Kolkata in West Bengal and we'll discuss
with them what are some of the issues
which affect them which they will keep
in mind while they are going to cast
their vote this time around first let me
just have a quick introduction your name
my name is Amin
my name is Hannon I'm Alma
my name is ayaan I'm saying sir so
thanks for talking to us firstly I just
wanted to ask and any one of you can
choose to take the question to begin
with what is it that affects you as the
first-time voter the thing that affects
me is what my present government is
doing at the moment and whether I would
like to reelect it or not okay if I am
not happy with my present government
then I would you know think of choosing
other parties you know as a better
government even before we think about
GDP or employment or education the
person that comes to my mind as a Muslim
woman is my safety and when your house
is on fire when you're not safe when you
as a person that you're not safe you
cannot think about economy you cannot
think about jobs education is the first
and the foremost priority is to be safe
everyone is a part of this nation if
something affects my brothers and
sisters in another part of the country
it should affect us because that is the
sense of nationality that we have been
taught the narrative is completely
changing the government that is in power
and the opposition parties also when you
look at the election campaign it's
basically more on issues that don't
concern us that concern the politicians
then the issue that concerns the
ordinary citizen unemployment hunger
electricity jobs issues unfortunately
because it shows the politicians to talk
about something else
the local agenda and the national agenda
are the same it starts from the local
people so I've just graduated from
college so what I look for is employment
in safety and issues that matter most in
the last four years of my of our
government of the employment has been on
a 40-year low or the environment has
been the worst in the world what we have
seen from the central government is also
pushed that they are saying or we would
want to be more inclusive
triple thalaaq bill you know citizenship
amendment bill these are things that
they're doing to try and be more
inclusive
do you think that that is a right step
to be bigger on one hand you banned the
triple talaga bill okay you do it for
the Muslim women who are in distress
I absolutely agree with it what about
the other women of other communities who
are abandoned by their husbands it is
not about choosing the best government
it is about choosing the lesser evil so
what we see in as I have I'm a
first-time voter so what I want is a
peaceful environment one particular
message that you would want to send out
to your leaders to politicians what
would that be one from each of you the
one thing that would be and the only
thing that would be is to change your
divisive politics I think that they
should realize that the bar is really
low as the largest democracy in the
world we shouldn't be talking about
freedom of speech and freedom of
movement and you know this this should
not be our issues there are more burning
issues that need to be spoken about
India is a diverse country there is a
diversity in there's a basic unity in
diversity let it be that way don't
divide it it's actually childish if we
keep on fighting over issues that are
important and there are other issues at
hand please like I'm not supposed to be
saying this it might sound disrespectful
but it's time for us to grow up just
that go into the villages opening food
cams opening medical shelters these are
things which actually bring a change
when and which will want us to vote for
them again so that is what I want from
my god very young idealistic people over
here who are of course the first-time
voter is essentially talking about what
matters to them here from Bengal here
from Kolkata these are some of the
issues which are going to affect them
when they go to that polling booth
[Music]
Rebekah's Alta so it's going to be a mix
of national and local issues but the
politically aware vote will be learned
which will determine which party gets
the maximum number of seats from the
state it's going to be a heated contest

These pages were engaged in coordinated inauthentic behaviour ...,2019-04-01T15:09:29Z,MIRROR NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lNHgdJYysJ8/hqdefault.jpg,"now we're getting in an official
response here from the Congress the
statement that has been released on
Congress's official Twitter handle and
here's what this says there are no
official pages run by the Congress taken
down these pages run by verified
volunteers are unaffected and we are
waiting for more details there from
Facebook of all these pages here that
are taken down so the Congress of course
making it very clear that there are no
official pages here that are run by the
Congress that have been taken down with
age this is the kind of response here
that I was referring to when I asked you
that question here earlier on how easy
is it for Facebook to directly link
these accounts which they say were being
run by the Congress I T self oh well I
wouldn't see it very easy also because
you know they have like two types of
process to do this is what I understand
from the chief of cyber security at
Facebook now what I understand
over there is number one that there are
a lot of people involved who go and who
authenticate these accounts and try to
find out the network and then pools also
which also observes the behavior of
these accounts now using both these
things they have been able to identify
touch pages maybe Congress is right in
saying that these are not very on
official accounts but these would also
be an official account but the bigger
question remains is it only of one
particular power case or there are many
more parties that's right it is because
this is just the first list here which
is out and and largely they say that
these are accounts connected to the
Congress IT cell the Congress denies it
of course - and how a digital footprint
in this regard can really be tracked
here the explanation for that rotation
also coming in because most of these
accounts that were running were anti-bjp
so is that conclusion enough to connect
it directly legally to the Congress
official i t-cell oh well you know this
is somewhat three-way just because it
was like on tv JP so you're just putting
it down I mean not technically if you
are really talking about a coordinated
oh you know I mean these are the terms
they have been using
book has been using if it is coordinated
and inauthentic behavior they should be
able to find this from many many more
such pages it just cannot be 700 pages
there are many more pages of many more
parties and of many more other
organizations also so if we are saying
this is just the first this then I mean
you see what more action they take
against other people move all right so
with age what you're clearly saying here
is that from your observation from your
expertise there are many more such
accounts that are operative and not
necessarily directly connected to one
political party there should be far many
more pages connected to other political
parties here as well and we know that
pretty well that you know the other
national parties are also having many
main source pages to go down to the
south the regional parties you go to go
up to the east also you see many more
such so clearly as of now the 687 pages
may be their first this but I don't
think so it should be their last place
that's right
much more should come out in that case
okay and whether or not Facebook has
really indicated that yes with a stay on
with us because our correspondent
Irishman is getting us further inputs
here on what Facebook is just announcing
the release here of these list Irishmen
Facebook of course makes it clear that
this is an ongoing process
systematically removing accounts which
are showing suspicious behavior
controlled by BOTS perhaps not run by
real people genuine people here has
there been an indication from Facebook
that this is since this is in the
build-up to the general elections this
is perhaps just the first list there
there could be more coming well exactly
sir the people at signal Facebook say
that this is just the beginning Facebook
will be cleaning out the entire the fake
news content as well as the bots which
are present on the social media network
this is just the beginning what they say
right now the Facebook in its statement
has clearly mentioned the amount of
follow that these handles had the amount
of the followers as well as the present
their presence if you see on the Khong
whatever they claim that these are the
accounts the presence on the Facebook
was 138 pages on Facebook were there and
549 of Facebook accounts was there on
the 687 pages that have been removed
over two lakh followers were there and
the advertising was on advertising
around 39 thousand US dollars was being
spent on Facebook and these were these
accounts were first ran in 2014 and most
recent ad was there in March 2019 so
these these are the details that
Facebook has got given us at the same
time Facebook maintains that this is
just the beginning in the coming year in
the coming time there will be action
taken across the platform where they
feel that these are the handles which
don't have the authentic behavior these
handles will be taken down sir okay
that's right I wish man this we've seen
this happening earlier as well
particularly as far as Twitter was
concerned sometime mid last year they
had done away with a lot of fake
accounts a lot of prominent politicians
and Indian celebrities had also lost
suddenly many followers because of these
fake accounts which had suddenly been
done away with officially by Twitter but
has Facebook here in this case written
conclusively on how these fake pages
have been connected to the IT cell of
one particular political party
well the Facebook has clearly posted the
images you can see if you go through
their statement it clearly has posted
the images and the samples on which
these actions were taken there said that
it was not the content that was being
posted but the concealing identity the
people who were posting this they had
concealed their identity and the page
admins and the account owners were
typically posting the local news and
political issues including the upcoming
elections as well as the views of the
political opponents while these people
behind his activity attempted to conceal
their identities they found the Facebook
found that their reviews they these
individuals were somewhere connected to
the Indian National Congress and that's
why these these accounts were suspended
the
the larger point here is said that these
people these Facebook people are
continuously monitoring the entire
process and this is just the beginning
as the what they say and in this entire
process they are going through these
handles and whatever they find
suspicious they take them down that's
true absolutely and that's that's
exactly the information here that I was
looking for your sh man which you just
stated here this is a vigorous process
here which is followed irritation as far
as Facebook is they're concerned and
concluding that to whom exactly these
accounts were connected to they were
showing suspicious behavior they were
concealed identity but Facebook was
aware of their identity so under no
circumstances can the Congress here
refute these charges then when they
don't you know you know if basically I
think using artificial intelligence and
using their algorithms their studies the
particular patterns and behaviors here
so with that they have come to a
conclusion
I don't think so even Facebook will be
able to probe it down right that it is
this because as far as that particular
Congress party is concerned they are
saying okay all our official accounts
are intact but my other question is how
come like Facebook is also allowing
people to create such pages you know you
first allow like hundreds of pages
should be created you make $39,000 from
them and then you say okay we bring it
down because it was free what aren't you
observing it while these things were
happening that's also something that
Facebook should like listen I look into
it that's right however of course are
trying to get in a word a response here
from the Congress as well but let's
let's get in the BJP with us over the
phone line mister nila Singh of the BJP
thanks for being with us Anila your
first response to what has just happened
I think you've done a right thing and it
is the recommendation of the Election
Commission as well or I can say
instructions from the Election
Commission as well that the social media
has to be used in a responsible way and
if any of the political party I mean in
today's date my facebook has removed the
pages off of Congress or I can say all
the pages who which I
Congress linked and they were being used
for in spread speak news and other I can
say it was used as a rivalry tool
political rivalry to these pages so
today this book has removed them I think
it is a good thing and other political
parties should also follow the
instructions of Elections Commission I
mean yes you have to use social media
use it responsible otherwise definitely
Facebook or the Twitter or the platforms
they are going to take action because
the Election Commission wants to do that
but that's right Adila did you feel that
there would be other political parties
here as well that could come under the
scanner because Facebook has made it
very clear that this is now an ongoing
process its respective of which
political party here nature of these
accounts which are showing suspicious
behavior would be pulled down maybe in
coming days or the political parties may
have to speak and these accounts which
are linked with different political
parties and they are used as leftover
cookies to demean or ridicule other
political party I think even they have
to face best thing and this is being
done on the instructions of the Election
Commission I mean it is a political war
indeed and don't respect that everything
is there in war and loss but that we
have to do things with the dignity also
and read some ethics as well I think I
mean social media should be used that's
right to follow the rules to keep the
ethics right anila stay on with us
please as we try to get in more
responses from cyber experts other
political parties our correspondent
ayushman has been getting us further
details he Irishman given the fact
Facebook has of course clarified that
these accounts have been pulled down
with respect to inauthentic behavior
have they also commented on the nature
of content which was being
circulated through these accounts yes in
fact sir they have they have given few
of these samples in one of these sample
if you see through this statement it
says that the Congress Party's claim of
nice scheme in which it says that 7000
will be given to the people who 6000
will be given to the pupu people now in
one of the pages this screenshot that
has been shared has said that the
Congress party maintains that people who
are lying below the living below the
poverty line their accounts would be
given this much amount of money and
there are several other screenshots
which says that the these are the
following claims being made by the
Congress party in lieu of the ahead
upcoming looks of high elections so
clearly in this statement also Facebook
has said that it was not the content but
the kind of behavior that was being
shown by these handles Facebook Facebook
was forced to take down these handles
and these handles what the Facebook says
that categorically targeted the OP the
ruling party in power and their behavior
was suspicious and that's why these
accounts have been taken down we still
await a confirmation from the Congress
party they have tweeted that these
accounts don't belong to them their
officials the handles are working and
they have demanded a list from the
Facebook on this part sir all right I
use mine many thanks for getting us
those inputs they appreciate all the
voices that have spoken to us this is
without doubt coming in as a positive
development to crack down on fake news

from their platform now or what they say
in their statement is that these groups
engage in a coordinated in authentic

pages are linked to the Congress IT cell
that have been removed so 687 pages have
been removed by Facebook for the kind of
content that these these pages were in
fact posting let's in fact go across to
'the anima who's joining us right now at
anima if you can explain to us exactly
on what basis it has facebook decided to
remove this these 687 pages and what is
facebook stay in its statement that's
right a very clear statement coming from
facebook about the fact that there's no
doubt that they have on the on the the
people who are actually behind these
pages the pages which have been removed
from both facebook and instagram let me
first point out two the first set of
pages that they have removed as you said
a huge bulk of pages 687 facebook pages
which have been pulled down by by the
social media giant they have essentially
said that the individuals behind this
activity were using fake accounts in
order to disseminate the content they
had joined various groups in which this
content was being pushed out and they
were in in a way had tried to hide their
identity behind layers but the page
admins and account owners according to
Facebook were typically posting local
news and political issues and including
topics which were related to the
upcoming looks of her elections in fact
Facebook also goes on to say that the
people behind this activity were trying
to it was pretty clear that they were
trying to conceal their identity but the
but the Internet giant actually did find
out through several reviews that it was
connected to individuals associated with
the I T cell of the Indian National
Congress also in another separate set of
pages which have been removed by
Facebook it says that we have removed 15
pages again related to groups
accounts which were again posting
content about looks of elections this
one specifically related to BJP and
alleged missconduct of political
opponents including those of the
Congress and again there was an attempt
that Facebook points out to hide the
identity of the original page admins and
page owners but what has been found out
through their investigation is that the
activity was linked to individuals
associated with the Indian IT firm
called silver touch so as you can see
that they have we have of course seen
prior to this as well that there's been
a crackdown on fake news through the
Election Commission and what we can see
over here is the Facebook which should
also mention that they were preparing
for key elections in certain countries
including India and the fact that they
are going to get into this war of
fighting and curbing fake news they have
clearly taken action with just two weeks
to go for the first phase of looks of
high elections we can see that they have
actually pulled down close to 700 pages
from Facebook and Instagram in order to
curb fake news where they feel that
there was an effort to disseminate this
and the identity of the original page
admins were also being concealed but
they are found out and a large chunk of
this let us point out once again around

Ajay Sharma your first thoughts when you

bank nifty already taking out the record
higher levels it's that big FII buying

are also doing very well on reports that
China slowdown actually may not be as
accelerated as people were fearing
well globally there are central banks
which have already indicated that this
is the time to be dervish and not to
hike rates and back home this is also
the week when the RBI would be meeting
for its policy decision and widely the
expectations are there would be a rate
cut coming in so all these factors
putting together is fueling a big rally
as far as Indian MA
second son right there is like you said
a positive global sentiment and you know
in terms of Indian equities you think
there's going to be a spillover effect
of this we are seeing part of it play
out today and in all likelihood if
global markets remain benign that's what
the strategists keep on telling us
globally that there would be a pause
from the US Fed other central banks like
China European Central Bank have already
announced indications of stimulus if
that's the case it pans out then then

cup of chai closely it has the slogan
maybe chalkida printed on it went back
ported that he was being served in these
paper cups with this slogan written on
it the image of the paper cup that was
tweeted by a passenger and this was at
the Cardinal Shatabdi this image went
viral the railways said that it has now
withdrawn this Cup and has penalized the
contractor now this issue just comes in
days after the railways was once again
found in violation of the poll code for
issuing tickets that had Prime Minister
Modi's pictures on them a correspondent
Irishman getting us further inputs in
once again you have the Indian Railways
really caught on the wrong side of the
model code of conduct largely Irishmen
the question being asked the Election
Commission are not being able to keep up
these are MCC violations that are coming
in on various fronts in each given case
you have the violation already having
taken place before it could be reined in
well if you look at these these
instances for the incidence if you see
the boarding passes of fair India as
well as the but the cups of the Indian
Railways in both incident instances you
can see this Election Commission has
said that they only took the cognitions
of the matter after it was reported this
is something which is not really
directly connected to the Election
Commission the matter when it gets
reported the Election Commission takes
action on it yesterday in the press
conference also the Election Commission
made it clear that on MCC violation they
are very much alert and they have said
that after hearing to the party within
48 hours a very short span of time they
are taking action at the same time there
is a see vigil app and Election
Commission also cleared the fact that
around 23,000 application campaigns they
received on CVG lap and also that 60%
cases were found - and they have acted
on that so Election Commission directly
saying this fact that okay these are the
incident instances where these these
instances are not clearly associated
with the Election Commission but ever
since these facts get reported the
Commission takes a cognizance and action
is being taken like in the Air India
case if you cieariy the Air India has
taken back the boarding passes also in
this contractor matter the contractor
has been fined and the cups have been
rolled back but it is it is the
Commission says that they are pledged
right and they are taking just the
violation the amount is ayushman as far
as as far as the measure of penalty
goals for having violated the mortal
code of conduct does this nature of a
violation play a big-enough deterrent we
are looking at multiple violations on a
daily basis and it's not really playing
a strong deterrent with respect to what
the measure of penalty is exactly sir if
you see the violations across the
country of MCC take place and that's why
Election Commission has said that they
have developed this app called C vigil
even when this matter was brought in
light to the Election Commission
officials at the first instance that the
Election Commission official said the
person who has done this he should go
through the CVG lab they can directly
clean this to the election commissioner
following which the Commission will
issue the notice so the the area is so
huge the foundations are so large that
the Election Commission officials say
that it is not really possible to to
maintain a check and balance every part
of it so that's why the power has been
given to the citizens this C vigil ad
which has been developed now what the
Commission of you shall say that it
impart this which is citizens if they
see something that is possible violation
of model code of conduct people can
report that fact to the Election
Commission Commission will take an
action on it and if you see the record
what the Commission claims is that they
have received over 23,000 complaints on
say vigil happens 60% of them a whopping
60% of those complaints were found to be
true so this is how the Commission this
for the first time that is happening
okay the Commission views to empower the
citizens because ultimately it's a
citizen who has brought both the
incidences if you see at the railway or
the Indian Airport both the instances
have been brought to light by these
citizens only sir all right so very
clearly ayushman what you're reporting
to us here is that these these are
matters that are taken into the hands of
citizens as having been given the
go-ahead by the Election Commission of
India itself which is the C vigil app on
which you report a matter and immediate
action here is taken but but I use man
we're looking at other aspects as well
because currently not just discussing
this one case of the chai cup which has
the maybe chalky that our slogan on it
there are other instances as well there
is the matter of the Modi biopic which
is being heard which the Election
Commission of India still has enacted
upon saying that they're waiting for the
internal assessment report to be out
there are other such instances here as
well when it seems that the procedural
time to analyse bigger complaints is is
precious time lost because we were just
about weeks away now from the elections
and these are MCC violations that
continue to happen or should there be
faster action then
well sir we when we try to talk to the
officials they obviously maintain the
fact that once the Commission gives an
instruction after looking over the
complaints it becomes it becomes a
mandatory thing and that's what they
take time they hear both the parties
that's what was maintained from from the
Election Commission officials yesterday
that did take time because diligence is
to be is required it's not that the one
party goes and the Election Commission
goes and gives of gives juristic gives
the order it hears both the parties and
then the Commission is cross-checking of
facts there absolutely H Mon let's let's
get in a word here from the Congress we
have mister son judge how with us of the
phone line thanks for being with us
Sanjay I are you in agreement with the
workings of the C vigil app which has
been introduced by the Election

complaints such as boarding passes being
issued with with the photograph of Prime
Minister or chai cups being served with
the slogan of maybe chocolate are all
having been reported by vigil citizens
and the Election Commission of India
acting in in enough time well I can tell
you that you know there is no being
development that's it you while this is
an abuse of your money the taxpayers
money has the skink machinery
how can a political party which is in
the ruling dispensation finally knowing
of the Election Commission and do it
without any compulsion you think the PGP
doesn't know is the first detection that
we keep easy right so you feel that the
penalty is not a deterrent enough the
penalty to violate the code is not a
deterrent enough I told I let you few
examples there is a novelty I was told
it's a TV channel called amo TV
apparently that is playing on does
anybody care I mean there is so much of
publicity going on and about that do you
think that is body comes in television
frankly speaking I don't know what to
see view of the Election Commission on
that but interface these are all
terribly controversial but you know what
that lesson is at the PGP doesn't care
why don't we ask this question why
polity gravy jockeys are which is a BJP
political party slogan why was it put in
the in the trains anyway before we say
that it should be stopped can you quit
that's right but the
action absolutely to begin with itself
it's a huge flaw but action having taken
contractor haven't been penalized
already on that Sanjay I'm afraid we'll
have to leave with that really running

I was Ron is joining us with more on the
story iris one you have you know that
response that has been sent by the
Election Commission to see that I am
actually who was one of those who raised
an objection and filed a complaint take
us through the details well tell me if
you look at the Election Commission's
explanation that has been sent to
Sitaram Yechury it clearly mentions that
there were three meetings which took
place on 27th the Election Commission
officials did send a notice to didi and
a All India Radio in which it was asked
as to what are the facts which led to
this situation but for the first time
the transcript of the meet the message
to of the Prime Minister was demanded
from the Election Commission it was when
they went through that they find that
they found that there was nothing which
was violative of the model code of
conduct then they contacted the didi and
the All India Radio officials in the
written reply to the Election Commission
the didi mentioned that it was not a
live program it was the feed was taken
from newswire from there it the audio
was given to the art to the All India
Radio the officials met including the DG
of All India Radio and the do darshan
met the Election Commission officials
and they they explained them that there
was no use of state machinery in that
remember if it would have been live on
those darshan it would have been a
violation but the Commission was
explained by by the officials of dual
darshan that the speech was not live no
of the DD or dai our staff were involved
hence the Commission found that this was
not a violative factor for the model

been given to the prime minister for his
message to the nation on mission sacked

do darshan and a and I were more under

are official government machinery that
would have been used but as our viewers
know that the Prime Minister's speech
was actually beamed wire a youtube link
which is what most media channels
including in I cut to and then the ni
feed was actually used by the other

the Supreme Court pulled up election
commission for not complying with this
previous judgement on candidates with
pending criminal cases
in September 2018 the Supreme Court gave
out a verdict stating that all the
candidates who are contesting this
election should declare their criminal
cases in newspapers such candidates were
expected to put out this declaration at
least three times before the date of
election in a wrap for the Election
Commission the Supreme Court has today
asked its response on a contempt
petition which is saying that the
Election Commission is not cracking the
whip on enforcing the past orders of the
top court which said clearly that
candidates against to criminal cases
have been slapped need to disclose this
by way of an ad in newspapers
the Supreme Court making it clear that
the people have the right to know whom
they are voting for in the elections
criminal record work Robert almost naked
and II believe a mother [ __ ] a I'm go
to swatch new touch I wanna covering
every should water
similarly corny but other than how can
we can see the most of the political
czar they're criminals H Anika got ham
sub-zero and Amiga to home the attack or
to build up our case a case to hit about
any time today shekhar kapur casita
[ __ ] other war criminal who got oh
during the 2014 2019 parliamentary term
alone there were 230 MPs with criminal
cases against them 134 MPs had serious
criminal cases against them
Miller now asks why did the EC flout the
verdict of the Supreme Court isn't it a
fundamental right of the water to know
the criminal background of the nadar
they're voting for let's debate oh the
reason why we're bringing this up is
because several tainted candidates have
been reissued tickets this year to
contest the elections again and that
should be something that really worries
us here's some lists of people who have
now filed their candidate in spite of
having serious criminal cases against
them Hans Raj are here is with the BJP
with it 11 cases against him Gopal
Shetty Mumbai North constituency of the
BJP has 10 cases against him this is
actually like a Hall of Fame at this
point kirats samaya Mumbai not East
constituency of the BJP 10 criminal
cases against him has now been handed a
ticket mister Shashi Tharoor silver
anteroom constituency of the Congress a
bet went to suicide charge against him
pappu Yadav of the Mali poor
constituency is now contesting as an
independent 24 shocking criminal cases
against him oh they are Najib Bhosle of
the Satara constituency of the NCP 23
criminal cases against him
rom Shekar cataria will contest as an
independent he has 21 cases against him
and other Chaudhary of the vamp or
constituents of the Indian National
Congress at the Congress party 16 cases
raju Shetty of these five and Parker has
12 criminal cases against him MB Rajesh
the poly card constituency CPI M 11
cases against him and this is a drop in
the ocean because if you look at the
data of the
or and this data came up some time ago
but basically they were a total as of
March last year of 1786 for either in
Lok Sabha Raja Sabha or in state
assemblies who have criminal cases
against him so that's one thousand seven
hundred out of roughly about 4,800
altogether and that should worry us a
great deal now why are we bringing this
up today because in September last year
the supreme court instructed very
clearly that Parliament are thought to
form laws that prevent people with these
kind of cases against them from
contesting elections and from becoming
members of the houses of state and
centre the Parliament has done no such
thing
the Supreme Court also instructed the
Election Commission to insist that all
of these candidates with criminal cases
against them must publicize the cases by
putting advertisements in the newspapers
and on television channels telling us
clearly what they have been accused
often what charges they're facing
Supreme Court today has held the
Election Commission perhaps pull them up
for not doing as instructed and what are
we left with
criminal latest because the Election
Commission hasn't followed the Supreme
Court's rules Parliament hasn't followed
the supreme court's order we have
criminals in Parliament what kind of a
country will be run so they sink for the
BJP Vinayak Dalmiya for the Congress PDT
Acharya former Secretary General of the
looks of our Shailesh gandhi former CIC
Dinesh 3d is the senior advocate to the
Supreme Court and kingship Naga is a
senior journalist I welcome all of you
to this conversation thank you for
joining us mr. Acharya my first question
to you the Supreme Court a pulling up
the Election Commission for not
following orders and not being stricter
with politicians how worrying is this
for you for someone with your experience
we are discussing this issue in the
context of a petition
while in the supply boat yes what
contempt of court know what discipline
go ahead sir in that particular case in
2018 and is that Election Commission
they should prepare that form 26 we
should contain the required information
about the criminal and dissidents of the
candidates so that is what the Election
Commission was supposed to do
I think the Election Commission has done
that the form has been amended so that a
candidate who is standing for election
can fill in all these details about the
criminal antecedents now after that the
Supreme Court has actually directed that
the political parties and the candidate
should put out in the website and the
candidate of course should tell the
political party to be see batons that
about his and his criminal antecedents
and the political party should put it up
on the on the websites of the party and
also they should publish this in the
prominent newspapers three newspapers of
that area so these are basically the
directions issued by the Supreme Court
in that case forgiving I'm going to drop
do I have to interrupt you because
there's a problem with your audio and
we're just gonna get that fixed in a
second I let me take the question
forward now to mr. Shelley shouldn't
even certainly if you can hear us and
while we get the audio fixed for mr.
Acharya this is a very worrying trend
Parliament has not followed the
instructions of the Supreme Court the
Election Commission has not clearly
followed the orders to the absolute
letter and we continue to have criminals
in our system it's almost like we're
doomed to have to live with this I think
looking at the problem from a wrong
perspective let me share with you and
this is data have gone Supreme Court in
2014 proclaimed that all criminal cases
against natha's should be settled in
less than a year only 16 percent was
settled the Supreme Court is not even
able to get its courts to listen to it
and we are talking of others not
listening to it but more importantly is
everybody who was charged as criminal a
criminal I think it's it's a fundamental
thing which we are not addressing and
we've had this declaration of people
giving their assets giving the criminal
charges against them and I don't think
it's changed anything
these are cosmetic things the only
solution is a proper trial and then a
convicted person can be called a
criminal
our entire judicial system my entire
legal system works on the fundamental
that you are innocent until proved
guilty for the sake of natha's by a very
peculiar kind of logic we've said no no
you are criminals unless you are proved
innocent how fair is this system and
it's not able to work nothing will
change we keep on making these cosmetic
changes and I be aware that only 6% of
the datas are actually convicted so are
we saying we want to brand 100 people as
criminals out of which only six get
convicted I think we need to look at
some fundamental things ports must
decide this fast and it is possible it's
not at all difficult the courts are not
doing their jobs with due respect and
saying and the courts do their jobs will
not have criminals in the assemblies and
Lok Sabha no but Mr Gandhi why do you
think do you think do you think the
problem is not enough convictions do you
think the problem is not enough evidence
what is the problem I don't know who
knows no my worries will get converted
to a banana republic if we keep on
saying everybody who's charged as
criminal is a criminal tomorrow there
will be a leader who will ensure that
everyone in the opposition has a
criminal charge and that's
very difficult that's fairly easy to do
after 10 years people get released and
therefore I'm saying our whole
perspective our hatred distrust of
political class is now leading us to an
extreme situation and I think we should
reconsider so let me bring in mr. nog
who is a senior journalist mr. nog
here's my question there is a difference
of course between just filing a
complaint and a charge sheet a lot of
these people have been chargesheeted and
that is this and the charge sheet is
only filed after the police have
conducted an investigation and they've
found enough evidence to bring in a
charge it I understand what you're
saying mr. Gandhi there until it court
calls you guilty you are innocent and
then you apply then you appeal to
another coat on another coat and then
finally to the Supreme Court I
understand that why is it that we have
the Supreme Court today and I could read
out some portions from the September
judgement but the Supreme Court says
very clearly that our democracy is at
threat because of the criminal nature of
the people who occupy important
positions let me just read this out it
says it we recommend to Parliament to
bring out a strong law whereby it is
mandatory for political parties to
revoke the membership of persons against
whom charges are framed in heinous
crimes and grievous offenses and not to
set up such persons for elections for
Parliament to state this in our
attentive plausible view would go a long
way in achieving the decriminalization
of politics so Mr now here's the
question the court has said and this is
a supreme court that says charges framed
in heinous crimes is that in some way
our rebuttal to what mr. Gandhi said
you're asking me yes I am well I've done
a lot of study on this subject I can
tell you let us let us go back to the
fundamentals your actual system is all
flawed and you are not making
fundamental reforms don't look at
Scott's weight in nineteen hundred and
seventy one when I was a young boy in
New Delhi the electorate of my
constituency of New Delhi was just about
one lakh and today the electorate is
about twenty lakhs the number of seats
in looks of I have not gone up there 543
see aids in 1971 even today there are
5'4 diseases in the meanwhile the
population of the country has increased
by so many times as a result each
candidate in a parliamentary
constituency has to appeal to a huge
number of more voters so more money is
required and along with this because the
need for money more criminals are coming
into the play so fundamentally instead
of looking for what courts are saying
and by the way I also had filed a case
in on the position I quote you have to
change your electoral system increase
the number of seats in lakhs over from
543 why not to 1500 so that the
constituency sizes are less the
electorate are much lesser but that
nobody is paying attention to if you
have got only 543 seeds and your
population has gone up three times but
the number of seeds have not gone up
what will happen people who are more
resourceful we have got more money who
can kind more money will come to in the
system and most of this money is
collected from Laura water sources
including business illegal businesses
and that is the fundamental reason why
criminalization
in politics is increasing so instead of
looking at what Supreme Court said or
any High Court has said let us go back
to the fundamentals and try to do some
reform faith but let me tell you
politicians are not interested you've
got guys who have gained from the system
are not going to change it and let me
also tell you how that fact in 1998 I
sustained Delhi and at that time in 1971
the number of seats in Lok Sabha had
been frozen till 2001
therefore I attempted to hold a
conference where we got all political
leaders and they had come from Pranab
Mukherjee - just one saying -
then homeless to enjoy eat a goop that
but all of them a said yeah you've said
is a good statement what why will we
change so so long as you don't make the
system more democratic and allow don't
allow any changes and not increase the
number of saves this sort of problem
will arise so let's tackle it
fundamentally and not look at what
Supreme Court has said in our courses
but my opinion fair enough in the
meantime let me just put pappu Yadav
back on the screen and we'll understand
why this is a this is a problem give me
put that back so pappu Yadav who used to
be with the RJD who's now cancer
contesting as an independent has various
charges six of the charges against him
six of the charges against him are
attempt to murder three charges criminal
intimidation theft kidnapping two
charges of dacoit Rhee voluntary causing
hurt with dangerous weapons sheeting
dishonesty trespassing extortion
kidnapping one charge relating to
dacoity mischief murder forgery
voluntary causing hurt to deter a public
servant from doing his duty undue
influence officer Arad influence in an
election and he trespassing and breaking
into a home at night this individual is
contesting elections in our country
finish the VD is the senior advocate in
fact who is currently fighting that case
which everything why did you decide to
bring this up and what is the thought
process behind the case that has been
filed
now let me correct I am NOT in this
content matter but the earlier matter
where the the issues were broadly
decided I was there she the problem is
I'll begin with what mr. Gandhi Silesia
and he said I suppose I am right I am
right and calling him Celica yes yes you
see it is the principle of criminal law
that no one is a criminal unless proved
guilty or convicted but then this is the
principle of criminal law what we are
dealing with is a civil right a
statutory right right to contest is not
a constitutional or any other right but
a civil right now
which can be regulated by the statute so
a parliament wants it can regulate but
then I am very clear about it that there
is absolute lack of commitment because
this kind of these kind of
recommendations have been given for last
25 years
by the Election Commission by the law
commission but no one has bothered
therefore we were compelled to file a
public interest litigation in Supreme
Court and argue the matter out
eventually
what was found was that be it this is a
area which is exclusively reserved for
Parliament and therefore Supreme Court
can at best recommend now when Supreme
Court says Parliament may do so it is
merely recommending nothing more a
Supreme Court cannot compel legislation
it is Parliament's prerogative and
Parliament comprising of politicians of
whom 34% are criminals will never do it
that's the problem that we are facing so
far as the question of a trial etcetera
is concerned the for trial you require
courts as it is the subordinate courts
are clogged with work now you require
more courts many many courts but then
the fact is when the petition was filed
the government sanctioned funds for only
12 courts in the entire country now just
imagine how can how can 12 courts in the
entire country look after the criminal
cases or a thousand and more politicians
currently involved post charge it this
is not mainly a fire but charge it so
therefore the point is it in the absence
of funds there are no courts there are
no cords therefore the matters can't
proceed in the courts there is a
complete stagnation so we've been
pressing for that courts have been
trying but they can't really situation
cannot be held and cannot be solved
until unless you have this political
commitment and the political commitment
commitment is wanting when their
sanction funds for 12 crores you can
imagine the commitment absolutely so I
just wanna bring in the politicians at
this points where they sing off the BJP
on the screen right now if you can
see are the members of your party who've
been handed tickets who have serious
cases against them let me do us all a
favor and you know place before the
panel that you will say that they
haven't been proven guilty but consider
the charges against mr. Hans Raj are
here who's contesting Jen's report for
the PGP 11 criminal charges against him
Gopal Shetty Mumbai North 10 cases
killing so Maya ten cases Mumbai
northeast why do these people have KITT
Achatz from your party look fear first
we have to see what kind of cases are on
them first
this is good that they have declared in
front of common map people that that
these has we have these cases on us and
now we are coming to you whether you
vote for us or not there are hundreds of
politician faith those who have not
declared that there as its properly
those well mr. Singh mr. Singh let me
point out to you nobody is doing us any
favors these are rules of the Election
Commission that required these people to
declare on these are rules of the
Election Commission that require these
people to declare the cases against them
they're not doing us any favors no
brownie points for this declaration I'm
sorry I won't allow that please tell us
why has your party handed out tickets to
these individuals is this the best you
could do you couldn't find a person in
Mumbai north or Mumbai northeast that
didn't have a case against means one
okay tell me what are the cases against
hands Raja ladies eleven cases we are in
politics and definitely bullets can have
cases against honours so this is very
much possible as shell is Gandhiji was
telling us that in politics it is very
means opposition parties can have cases
on you at the right point of time so we
also see that how seniors these crimes
are if there are eleven cases on hands
now the energy or the policy ATT so what
what what is the seriousness of these
cases whether it was just is coupling
between the between two group or it was
attempt to murder charges and one thing
I want to clear here that there are two
thing criminalization of politics and
policy
son of criminals the problem with this
current issue is there now many
criminals have entered politics in 80s
and 90s
criminals for helping politicians and
now these criminals especially from
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and other states
if you see suggest a booty
you took one name pappu Yadav and
Mukhtar Ansari if you see they were
criminals in 90s and they entered
politics and because of introduced
introduction of these EVMS and all that
number has reduced and they are also
trying to become a good people and
they're pouring at means themselves that
that there is no booth capturing on
polling booths so this criminalization
of politics and polarization of criminal
is the bigger issue and now you see that
whether BJP has given more tickets to
criminal or a VJ PL even given tickets
to criminals BJP has not given a single
ticket to criminal having case is
another thing you'd give in ticket to
criminals is a different thing these are
caricatures of RT zanta parties those
who have cases we have to check how
vinius these crimes are well let me read
out of the declaration that was made by
mr. Hanh sahaja Hale in 2014 to the
Election Commission one charge relating
to concealing with intent committing you
know a betterand of assault criminal
intimidation abetment to mutiny being a
member of unlawful assembly wrongful
restraint obscene acts punishment for
rioting assault of criminal force to
deter a public servant from discharge of
duty and this is from 2014 the 2050 the
2019 declaration we're still waiting for
do you want me to check on all of your
other candidates as well and let's also
not be ignorant about the fact that mr.
Singh in jean-louis Sabha and lawful
gathering of people having unlawful
gathering of people a power politician
who is in a position before 2014 and
sahaja energy was in a position at
centre and State Board so what do you
expect from him means any public servant
can have a case that he means they have
made me so you these are two cases so
you can see that
to murder any problem with women
so what so definitely a position is that
equal to a solid about when to assault
that that is relative concept there is
not a trial to murder how much do you
believe one second mr. square they sing
do you believe one second one second one
second mr. sing listen listen listen
listen do you believe that Shashi
Tharoor of the Congress should be given
a party ticket and allowed to contest
given that he's defending charges
against him for a bed pin to suicide of
in his wife sir death let me tell you
one interesting thing I'm sure a voter
is in jail he has no right to vote but
if person has is having any criminal
case against him that person can contain
selection on this land and that is what
that is part of our law so he has all
the right to contest election the
problem is with our rule if you are
behind the bars and if you are a voter
you cannot vote but if you are behind
the bars but you can contest election so
we have to check our system and we
should come up with no but there'll be
something mr. Singh as a member of the
party that has run this country with the
full majority for the last five years
you had the political will for D
monetization for GST for actually
backdating and changing the laws of
political funding since 1976 to today
which you did and rammed through
Parliament why didn't you make this
change if you believe that it is this
unfair you were fully within your rights
and the supreme court instructed
Parliament to make this change why
wasn't the change made why don't your
party bring in that change if you
believe it is unfair I want to give
definitely I want to give three things
here first only the leader who
introduced political reforms in Indian
politics that person was Lankesh at 1eg
station you are talking about the
Supreme Court case you know without his
own consent mr. Singh recheck your fact
you take credit for his work introduce
we introduced mother of all electoral
reform that was one nation one election
we try to make a consensus on that but
we were not able to people
mr. singer she's giving birth cutting up
this kid about there please Sochi what
region our lobbyist we deeper prepared
it but that was mother of all electoral
before I tell you what the mother of all
life-forms one second mr. Singh mr.
Singh the mother of all electoral
reforms was the electoral bond that you
released and you introduced in spite the
fact that the Election Commission told
you that it is bad for transparency and
it will actually increase for you know
opaque funding you went ahead and did it
anyway you actually removed all caps on
foreign funding for elections you
removed all caps on corporate funding
for elections despite the fact that the
Election Commission had serious
objections you went ahead and did it
that is the kind of electoral reform you
brought in so that you can bring in the
dirty money into politics and we will
never know about you know what is this
an opportunity the Supreme Court asked
you to make the change and you didn't
make the change and what should that
tell us about you funding transparent
miss about a fourth wall to me I've
already had two hours discussions on
this I'm not going down this rabbit hole
one second Vinayak doll me off the
Congress please tell me mr. vanayya
thermia you have let me see other
chaudhary of the Indian National
Congress sixteen criminal cases against
them he was the ex-president of the BJP
of the Congress in West Bengal why has
he been given a ticket again couldn't
you find anybody else in West Bengal who
didn't have 16 cases against them than
me let me start by so let me start by
telling you my name is major Sosa I'm
the editor of the channel introduce yes
go ahead yes
I apologize okay let me start by saying
that we have a the Congress party is
extremely serious about cleaning up
politics and trying to give as many good
people and clean and honest people a
chance in politics if I was to read from
the judgment that you're referring to it
says very clearly for democracy to
thrive we need as many good people and
politics as possible and I'll say
further if you read Peres 116 point
number four
it talks about the political party's
obligation to start a website and
release names on this website I can say
this with confidence and conviction the
Congress party is intending and planning
to do so we're intending to list down
the names of candidates who have
criminal charges against them on our
website and I believe we are the only
political party in these elections who
are going to do so if any other
political party was so serious even if
it was the BJP this should also come
ahead and do so because the people of
India deserve transparency there is a
fine line between somebody being a
criminal and certain criminal charges
being Spurs against a particular person
there is a fine line I completely agree
with you however that the severity of
the charges are important the
seriousness of the allegations are
important while everybody is innocent
till proven guilty the seriousness
matters and therefore we are very very
determined and committed to publishing
these names on our website and no other
political party has the courage and
gumption to do so we're not telling
anybody - are you aware of the cases
that are the govt has against its
supreme court judgment mr. Tommy are you
aware of the cases that are the
chaudhary has against him right now may
I read them out please only we can look
at specific individuals and you don't
need to read them out to me I'm aware of
the charges but I would I would request
you to get my name right I'm going to
ask you a second time my name is Fay
D'Souza the charges are mr. Arthur
Chaudhary of the Congress contesting
from West Bengal to charges of murder
IPC three zero two one charge related to
a battement of offence punishable with
death or imprisonment one charge related
to criminal intimidation two charges
related the punishment of criminal
conspiracy two charges of criminal
trespassing two charges of acts done by
several persons in furtherance two
common intention one charge of being a
member of unlawful assembly one charge
of wrongful restraint one charge of
voluntary causing voluntarily causing
hurt one charge of mischief causing
damage to property
not serious mr. talmann to charges of
murder very serious they're very serious
charges however they have not been
proved and I was trying to explain to
you the Congress's mechanism but let me
let me elaborate the Congress has a very
stringent process of checking balance
and if there is a serious allegation
against any particular candidate he is
he or she is compelled to give an answer
to up to the Congress president and give
an explanation a serious detailed
explanation as to why these charges were
levied against this person and if there
is any merit in these charges and only
after the Congress senior leadership
including the party president is
convinced is the ticket given to the
individual city mr. Miyagi's tell all
the team would you please tell us out of
curiosity what was mr. other charli's
explanation for his two murder charges
I am not in a position to explain to you
the detail because I am not privy to
those details but I can tell you that we
go through a rigorous process the
candidate is put through a rigorous
process he has to explain it's almost
like a show-cause notice he has he's
been given a show-cause notice by the
party that please explain to us why
these charges the charges were levied
against you and is there any truth to it
and I am saying again we are the only
party who is following the Supreme Court
judgment paraone if you read power 116
it talks about putting the names up on
the website because we believe the
people of India deserve that
transparency we are going ahead and
putting these names up on the website
all right let me open this up to the
rest of the panel and also point out to
our audience on the website actually we
also point out to our audience that the
information has to be declared as soon
as it's declared it's public information
it's available on any number of websites
also the Election Commission has a rule
and the Supreme Court has instructed the
Election Commission to have a rule that
this information be published not just
on your own website mr. dharmaiah but in
three local newspapers and
on television channels and a prominent
time of day and page so that everybody
can read it but I do want to go back to
mr. Devaney for a rebuttal to what weird
overnight Dalmia said and I want to
point out that we are talking here about
cases of murder we are talking about
very serious cases and these are charge
sheets these are not fi hours or
complaints mr. barrini see these
statements of a particular party
representative itself demonstrates their
commitment but I'll keep that aside for
a moment mm-hmm
they will always cling behind this
principle of until proven guilty you are
innocent but that is the principle of
criminal trial in criminal law and
conviction but that's not the principle
applicable to civil rights civil rights
can always be regulated for instance in
service jurisprudence which is a matter
of civil right
they always regulate some of these the
service and rights and they say if you
are charged with this crime then you can
be dismissed from service so this kind
of a kind of clinging to this principle
itself demonstrates their lack of
commitment to the whole concept of
decriminalizing politics Supreme Court
may keep on saying it until unless you
see the basic problem is until illness
we as citizens realize this problem and
until unless we as citizens tried to
ward them out nothing will emerge
because for the political parties
nowadays vulnerability is the crime main
criteria and vanilla tea comes with
criminality see they the study has
indicated there the criminals have felt
percent more chances of winning the
election then the normal candidate now
if in ability is the factor because each
and every vote counts in the legislature
so they will always go for it the
commitments will never come and that is
what we are noticing for 25 years what
the Election Commission and Law
Commission have been asking for it but
they don't do it the obvious reason is
that the effects dependability and
manipulating is the chief criteria now
for yes giving tickets to the
candidates mr. vanayya as I said the
criminal can return he's coming on this
as a young person myself who is entered
politics I completely agree with the
sentiment and I agree with what you're
trying to say so please don't don't make
no mistake about this if you look at the
percentage of candidates with criminal
records which political party is ranking
number one from 2014
it is the BJP if you look at the list of
the people who got tickets not there in
four legs for the 19% of them and there
was these are currently serving in
Parliament they are currently serving in
Parliament sir 19 percent of them have a
criminal record 19 percent that is the
highest number of criminals in the list
so far declared so far - so far so far
of the dualistic led 35 of their
candidates have a serious criminal
record including sitting cabinet
ministers you have Nitin Gadkari ji on
one side you're Shakti Mirage on the
other side you look at the allegation
levied against them
you know if the Prime Minister was so
serious as you rightly said he had the
political will for all sorts of other
decisions right or wrong Dee
monetization and GST electoral bond we
can debate those decisions but he had
that political will why did he not have
the political will for actual serious
cleaning up of politics he had a golden
opportunity he had the mandate of the
state governments he had the mandate at
the centre he had a majority government
not even a coalition government if he
was serious about cleaning up politics
he would have started with his own house
he would have started by putting his own
house in order and then looking at
reforms through laws of parliament but
he did neither sunder stand your
argument and we will take that forward
to the BJP representative but I have a
question for you why wouldn't the
Congress party then attempt to hold
itself to a higher standard if you do
believe the problem of people with
serious cases against them is
criminalizing politics as said and I'm
quoting the Supreme Court at this point
wouldn't you hold yourself to a higher
standard and just decide that we won't
allow someone with serious cases like
murder against them chargesheeted in
heinous framed charges framed in heinous
prank why wouldn't you just do that but
you've given the ticket to someone with
two counts of murder against him the
Congress party is actually holding
itself to a higher standard as I keep
saying to you we're putting the name on
the website we go through a rigorous
checking balances and there are many
cases where people have not been given a
ticket if we find evidence that there
were real cases against them or they
were real allegations against them and
even if the candidate was venerable the
senior leadership and the senior
executive committees of the party has
refused people has refused candidates in
multiple instances even if the candidate
are internal so a service may have shown
was potentially a venerable candidate I
don't see the BJP doing that I don't I
have a question when I call me up did
you believe and did you personally above
morality yes
did you believe and did the Congress
party believe that when MJ awkward was
accused of so many counts of sexual
harassment that he should have stepped
down from his office of power absolutely
because he's holding a high office like
a cabinet post if he's an mos yeah and
there are allegations against them yes
then he needs to step away till those
allegations are clear and it is very it
is not apples to apples I know the
analogy no no I'm just trying to
understand because I completely agree
with you and I argued alongside
mg awkward should be removed from his
position of power because as MOS you
know he he has power to influence
witness's power to influence evidence do
you not believe that a member of
parliament has it also has power
absolutely he has power and he has he or
she has responsibility to disclose that
power then to assume that when you talk
about the laws and there is the respect
to this chair that is being occupied and
the service that is being
to the country when we find a manager or
a CEO or an MD of a bank in violation or
accused of violation we ask the person
to step down until investigation is
complete or just on accusation
same thing with MJ awkward he was
accused we asked him to step down until
the investigation and the case was
complete until his name was cleared why
can't we expect the same from political
parties who hand out tickets to
politicians step away from the power
until your name is cleared and I'm
quoting the court again charge is framed
in heinous grievious offenses charge is
framed so this is not a nuisance suit
that someone will come and file against
you the police has to investigate and
file those charges in front of a
magistrate so let's not pretend that
this is what opposition parties do to
each other that's not the same thing I
want to understand why we don't hold our
politicians to a higher standard
challenge man this is my question to you
when we find something like this in the
private sector that person is removed
from office immediately and then you
fight your cases on your own time these
are the rules of service like mr.
Devaney quite rightly said in a private
in a private company the inquiry or
investigation is done in a very short
while and a decision is taken it is not
left like that as PR in India and in
fact I was very amused what miss allow
me I was saying he seemed to suggest
that mr. Rahul Gandhi is a super judge
he gets all the explanations and then he
judges whether a person is guilty or not
and then he takes a decision let me
invite him to put all the explanations
on the website itself I would still
submit that we are looking at the wrong
end of the issue 20 percent sanction
positions are not filled in the
judiciary if we do that we can get rid
of all these problems the only solution
is a fast judicial system which can then
decide whether as person is guilty or
not changing this is one of the most
dangerous things for this democracy
because please understand and
this person or untrue police government
in power can put charges against lots of
people anyone who opposes them seriously
can be seriously charged we've had
people who have been charged with
terrorist acts who are probably innocent
and have got released ultimately
therefore let's not forget this in our
enthusiasm to say we want better
politicians let's not forget the rule of
law which is my submission and I am
hoping miss allow me I will put up will
agree that he should put up all the
explanations on the website or he must
say that mr. round Andy is a
supercharged of sorts who can decide
whether a person is guilty or not well I
did see that Suresh Singh put up his
hand mr. Singh do you have a rebuttal
yeah do you want to come how could you
answer yes I'm happy to answer it let me
sing go ahead yes if you see that in the
case of an Jaguar where he was charged
he stepped down and taking
responsibility and he was stepped on but
what happened in the case of a Raja
Supreme Court endured intervene supreme
court endured intervene in to GK then
only it is seen you are not only in a
position to brag about his out on bail
mr. Furst stepped down after intense
pressure from the media also because a
lot of his victims were members of the
media so no you that's not something you
can take credit for saying mr. Singh mr.
saving you because because of Supreme
Court intervention only a Raja resigned
we are not taking we are not taking any
credit we are saying that it m Jake but
resigned
what said it is done it is a massive
time mr. Singh I have to I have to leave
this here but I'm just going to I'm just
gonna say it before we wrap up the case
what one second I'm just gonna say that
finally the the judgment is left we just
said it was finally the judgment is left
with the voter
all of this information will be made
public there are websites called mine
calm this EDR they all do excellent work
there are websites where you have lists
of every single candidate in your
constituency and the criminal cases
against them this is how we solve the
problem don't vote for someone with a
criminal case against hold that person
to a higher standard just like you would
expect the person who's leading your
organization or wherever you work
someone who's in service of this country
should not have 12 14 16 serious heinous
crimes against them now what for these
people
this simple is that it will actually
list out what these crimes are no
brownie points for any political party
for handing out these tickets to these
accused criminals we will continue to
bring you this information because this
is the information I believe there will
be most important to our audience most
important to our voters we will bring
you information of who has cases against
them what kind of cases there are in
which parties are handing out case
tickets to people like this thanks for

by Tim Burton if you're not familiar
with the story Dumbo is a baby elephant
born into a circus he has long flap ears
which allowed the fascinating gift of
flight this is exactly what the circus
needs as it is struggling under the
leadership of max MIDI she played by
Danny DeVito the circus is also home to
the farrier family with the children
Millie played by Nico Parker and Jo

father Holt

the flying elephant gets out it catches
the fancy of the entertainment
entrepreneur VA van Devere played by
Michael Keaton along with his bow Khaled
Marcia and played by Eva Green they take
over the struggling circus and attempt
to use Dumbo as a star attraction of and
Revere's massive entertainment park
called dreamland and that's when things
go horribly wrong for Dumbo and the
farrier family I'm just gonna say this
right away this was a bit of a
disappointment for me before I get into
what didn't work let me talk about what
did the CGI is absolutely incredible
there's not a moment when any of the
scenes involving Dumbo looked unreal or
faked in any way maybe the certain cover
surprise from Disney but it certainly
didn't go unnoticed in my eyes also the
trademark quirky look and feel expected
from a Tim Burton film is also very much
intact so the film looks great in the
acting Department there's a certain joy
to see Danny DeVito and Michael Keaton
together in a Tim Burton production
Batman fans will know what I'm talking
about and that's about it it wants me to
say that this live-action remake is
divided the magic and emotional impact
of the animated classic there's nothing
intrinsically wrong with the
performances or direction or overall
presentation of this film it's just that
every scene merely felt like it was
simply moving from one beat to the next
I largely blamed this on the screenplay
which doesn't allow me to feel a connect
to any of the main characters at any
point in time throughout the film the
only connection you feel is towards
Dumbo and even that angle doesn't pack
the punch it should because the focus is
shifted back to the humans and what they
are up to the relationship between Dumbo
and the humans is an explore as much as
it should have been a lot more time is
spent on Dumbo as he takes flight and
yes those scenes are structure for
maximum impact which you
do feel so at least there's some sense
of wonder and astonishment that you feel
from time to time but that's all that
the rest to it while there's nothing
wrong with the performances per se Eva
Green Danny DeVito and Michael Keaton
definitely stand out from the rest of
the cast Alan Arkin is also delightful
in a small scenes I'm going with three
stars for Dumbo
despite its presentation and the cast
doing what they're supposed to this
feels like a clinical film from Disney
that doesn't quite deliver the emotion
it should there are ample opportunities
for those but they don't quite take off
although I'm sure that kids will enjoy
it for what it's worth a visual
spectacle with a cute flying elephant

story is about a family on vacation in

attacked by what seems to be their
doppelgangers the soon turns their
entire holiday upside down as the family
tries to survive while trying to solve
the mystery of who these look-alikes
could be and what they are out for now
before I get into the review of this
film let's address that this isn't your
typical horror scare fest yes there are
ample scary moments and those might
probably make you jump out of your seats
but if you're looking for a typical
mindless scary shock fest this isn't the
one what that means is this film
requires your attention from start to
finish you need to focus on the
dialogues scenery and of course the plot
that's because nothing is a throwaway
line or scene there's a lot going on
here in his previous film get out Jordan
Peele prove that he sees and understands
the horror genre from a fresh
perspective that perspective is used
here to create effect to make us a high
concept film about a lot of different
topics nevertheless the writing plot and
most importantly the acting is what
keeps you glued to the screen throughout
this is Lupita Nyong'o swim as much as
it belongs to Jordan Peele her
performance is incredible and if she
doesn't get an Oscar nomination for a
role as a delayed Wilson it will be a
damn shame
just like Toni Collette was ignored for
her performance in hereditary yeah I'm
not letting go of that anytime soon
Vincent Duke as a husband Gabe Wilson as
an element of humor which serves as a
breather to the otherwise tense film
there's another aspect to note about the
comedy here it's intentionally not meant
to be laugh out loud funny but instead
just to show you that even Jordan Peele
is aware of how far-fetched his premise
is watch out for Elizabeth moss in a
minor but extremely effective role the
background score is also noteworthy and
how it dictates your emotional response
to the scenes as they play out in fact
one of the funniest and actually Satta
scenes comes in the form of a song it's
one of the many genius moments that will
stick with you then again chances are
that you will leave the theater filled
with questions that might not seem to
have answers right away how a lot of
those are likely to be addressed on
second viewing there are some weak
elements are unfortunately become
apparent during the film's climax
when an entire exposition scene is used
to explain many apparent plot holes but
those are minor grouches in an otherwise
gripping and entertaining film that
makes commentaries on the way we
perceive ourselves how we perceive
others who are different from us and the
general condition prevalent in the
United States at the moment after all as
also stands for the United States I'm
going with the solid four stars for us
again this isn't your run-of-the-mill
spook fest I thoroughly enjoy films that
make you think about what they could
mean beyond the visuals and us is
definitely one of them whether you think
it makes sense or not in the end is
entirely up to how you interpret some
elements but it's undeniable that writer

and it's election season one of the big
battles that our authorities will have
to fight and the media has to fight also
is the Menace of fake news vo at Mira
now have been constantly bringing you
updates we've been telling you the kind
of fake news that is out there of the
way it is circulated and how you can
actually try and even spot this fake
news now you people is in anticipation
of the fake news intensity strengthening
as the elections get closer has now
decided to set up a special whatsapp
helpline a special social media
grievance cell with a special team of
top cops who will look into this matter
and on a daily basis people can now
write in report fake news ask their
queries in the you people ease will look
into it and carry out investigation but
is that really enough that's the big
question because let me give you an
example just a few stories that I picked
up within 15 minutes as I searched
through the internet and I got just
these many examples hundreds of stories
every day on your whatsapp on your
Facebook on your Twitter everywhere
these stories are doing the round
circulating and while you yourself may
not believe it there may be many in your
friends and family circles who are
believing it in fact I have often told
people that this is fake news don't
believe it
so what is the larger solution do we
have a plan in mind
during election season so that innocent
naive voters don't fall for this
narrative and don't make the choice for
what based on this now here are a few
examples just recently there was a
Facebook live video that claimed that
the poll vomit attack was the handiwork
of the BJP this video actually in that
audio clip said that this is an alleged
conversation between an unidentified
woman and our home minister raj not
saying and Amit Shah and that this audio
clip if you listen to it is proves that
they actually plan for Rama for their
political benefits that's the level of
fake news that is doing around most of
it of course on whatsapp on the other
hand there was another one which I did
picture of a young woman
was wearing a headscarf and she held
this placard which had that said that I
support Prime Minister Modi but actually
that video and that picture was from a
Muslim lady in Washington and there are
series of such facts that have fake news
that are being corrected every single
day you must remember a few days ago
there was a video of two Kashmiri
vendors in Lucknow who were thrashed
when this entire in the light of the pol
bomb attack when this entire hate
against Kashmir ease was catching on
across the country and there were news
reports that said you know those accused
who got arrested for attacking the
Kashmiri are actually people linked to
the Samajwadi Party wasn't true then
there were videos and news reports that
said oh they are linked to the - right
right wing group so how do we separate
this and what action can the government
and the police and the Election
Commission take that is a big question
tonight rock history party of the BJP
joining me this evening Vikram Singh
former DGP of Uttar Pradesh and Nicola
power editor for media nama always a
pleasure to have you Nikhil let's start
with you the challenge is big let's just
you know and I was trying to just give a
few examples there are hundreds of these
examples are we really in a place are
our authorities in a place to tackle
this menace in election season well I
don't think it's possible for the
authorities to be able to deal with the
scale of this menace because you know
let's face it that they are outnumbered
there are political parties have almost
call center like operations that create
misinformation that creates jokes about
the other candidates that create you
know false claims about their own
candidates so it's it's politician
versus politician his party was his
party and this is only going to increase
with time let's the other thing to
remember is that this is that fake news
is not new what happens is because of
the speed with which messages can be
shared and the reach for the messages
have the scale of the problem is much
bigger and now technologies move to a
where them where photos are not only
modified but now you've got deep fakes
coming up where videos can be faked
videos can be created of of individuals
allegedly saying things which are which
no one can detect these are very very
difficult to detect and with improvement
in technology it's only going to become
tougher I'm not sure what the solution
to this problem is but at this point in
time we're fighting a losing battle
against fake news
let me ask mr. Vikram Singh this that
are where can the police come in today
they have said we've set up this
whatsapp helpline number and we have a
special cell but you people is mr. Singh
has enough on its plate when it comes to
regular crime are they really in a
well-equipped place to handle fake news
and social media challenges this done.we
is a very honest attempt by the you
people ease to address the problem of
fake news you'd be surprised to know
that the largest number of B Tech from
IITs and M Tech varieties are there in
the U P corner of the IPS and they have
it in depth au p 80s in the STF are the
best in the country because of the
technical prowess of the IPS officers
there well yes it is like having paper
boards to cater to a tsunami of fake
news because the vested interests the
special interest groups and also the
four stakeholders the government the
people and those special interests who
generate fake news for a devious purpose
and also the intent of service providers
I don't think they have it in them to
contain it in the first place our laws
are absolutely not a witness we only
cater and all the cases that I would
analyze and bring it back to just for
Sections 120-b 153 a and section 60 of
the IT Act
apart from this I really don't think if
we have any other section it is like
archaic locks those who were perhaps the
cavalry were trying to fight the main
battle tanks today I think we need to
pull up our socks and improve our
technology indeed we are told that there
are 16 Carew's WhatsApp users in the
country 15 curves facebook users and
Carroll's twitter users and not to
mention the YouTube users but the fact
remains that we are hopelessly
outnumbered when it comes to pitayas
compliment do you people east for a
brave and a gallant and understand to
adjust this problem and I'm sure if
they're able to counsel check and the
cyber forensics would have a long way to
go I don't say that you can address
every morphed at every photoshopped
picture or a video but yes you can make
an honest attempt guide and tell them
what is fake and what is right and once
you do that you may recall that in the
most of undergirds a video originated
that was responsible for confederate in
the violence subsequent to when the
rights were controlled and that video
clip originated from afghanistan but yes
the cottage industry that has emerged
and irresponsible journalists who
generate fake news for the purpose for
devious purposes for the laws of
economics i will stop at that but yes
you people he has made a very honest
attempt and i would compliment them for
this honest attempt and i'm sure they
have it in them to at least make an ark
make it in attempt to curb and address
and educate the people education is very
important our part addressing this
problem okay so mr. Bachus no party the
challenge at hand is huge and actually
not just for the pradesh but for the
entire country and for the election
commission and for the media
organizations to try and tell people
what's right and what's not and for
political parties and and I think all
political parties have now been also a
victim of this kind of fake news so
where is your party stand on battling
this fake news rather than you know
being silent and a blows that we they
can do but there we become syndicated

you quixote ajar hola : que paso
information chinese appear
ake example BJP confirm a congress
committee amid Malviya head of BJP zai
t-cell tweeted
refreshing to see Prime Minister where
is faith on his sleeve he is the first
head of the state to visit come in all
these years now while it is a say for
phrasing of sentence because he sing in
all these years
it sounds like Oh Prime Minister Modi is
the first Prime Minister to visit the
Camela and take a dip and do the RT work
for their vote bank but the fact of the
matter is as far as head of states are
concerned our current president Cove in
the ROM not covent also went a first
president also visited
Camela our first prime minister
Jawaharlal Nehru was present there made
the arrangements personally
and so it could be misleading when the
head of the BJP ID cell tweets like that
here is an example from the Congress
sent several workers of the Congress
parties information technology cell
tweeted image of a classroom for
government school in Delhi that was
constructed in 2017 under the are meant
but they all tweeted this to say
Congress president Rahul Gandhi will
kick-start looks of a campaign of Delhi
Congress by addressing booth workers
convention to that in the gandhi stadium
and then they highlighted how booth
workers are actually studying here and
the hashtag was dil manga congress the
photograph was taken by Bernanke no 4hd
in a school in Delhi which was obviously
created air and is functional under the
app government so for IT cells of all
political parties are equally guilty of
perpetrating false news misleading news
and deaths a dangerous part this
election season Nikhil you wanted to
make a point go ahead please yeah see
certain way I think one thing that's
really important to remember is that
incorrect information is not illegal
something that that is disturbing public
order inciting violence is a separate
thing there is mass polarization mass
changing of opinion of particular
candidates or around particular issues
that is happening not just from within
the country but it can also happen by
external forces external factors like we
saw in the u.s. in case of chemists and
analytical so we have to be very very
careful at least when it comes to
coordinated activity where I t-cells are
themselves creating this this kind of
information
I think the Election Commission needs to
hold political parties to greater
account then they do citizens or people
who create misinformation you know
Twitter handles official pages official
groups of political party that share
misinformation I think they need to be
taken to task by the Election Commission
but we have to remember that incorrect
information is not illegal and so under
what law under what was jurisdiction
will any government authority act
against someone who's spreading some
misinformation they
always come back and say oh I thought it
was true how do you hold them legally
liable for that then correct here is one
more example there was a tweet a picture
of a screen grab of a tweet of Arun kids
Duvall that went viral and that said if
Wing Commander Debenham gun takes VRS
that's voluntary retirement from
services we are ready to offer him a
looks about take it from any
constituency he wishes to Kontest from
this is a fake tweet this wasn't real it
was nowhere on Arvind Kejriwal's
timeline mr. Vikram Singh like we only
kill is pointing out when you there is
false information and then there is
obviously you know communally inciting
hateful propaganda information divisive
information where you have sections
under the law to act against people what
do you do when you when somebody just
turns around and says oh sorry I got it
wrong and we it is simply a matter of
Investigation Nikhil is a scientist and
I have an ex-police officer reverse go
rego reverse engineering and go
backwards there is a fake news and there
is a malicious news when you have a
malicious news nobody can get away and
say that I am sorry because you had the
sense of purpose in an intent and if you
are a total investigator you will go get
into the intestines of the person and
find out who paid who and how much and
what were the words that was supposed to
be uttered by that person or write in
that person a skillful investigator will
get into the Juvenal of the person the
mischievous person the mischief maker
and get to the bottom of the whole
episode you in Macedonia then we would
realize that there are 200 people in
Donald Trump's fans Club and they are
just generating fictitious stories like
this day in and day out we are fast
learners and we have also replicated
this experimented India people are
gullible people are emotional and all
these stories that you have narrated
play into the emotions of us Indians now
is the time and the you people each has
come out with a very healthy practice
and the best practice I would say a
proactive measure to educate the people
educate the investigators and understand
that you have algorithms and use
artificial intelligence big data
analytics you can get to the bottom of
it if you choose to so
directive five cases in every district
and I'm sure you will have something to
be proud of 15 days my quickness wants
from Nikhil on that nickel can we can
reverse engineering and you know taking
those following distressing those steps
get us there especially even today as we
speak in this whole government was a
social media giant face office taking
place are they giving us that platform
to find out where the whatsapp message
came from no and look they can't do that
because frankly it'll do in order to
provide disability for users they will
have to disable into an encryption which
basically makes everyone vulnerable if
you if you remove encryption all
messages will be accessible their people
private messages can be potentially read
by hackers or even by the government and
that's a disproportionate response the
with whatsapp the really the problem
with with with misinformation is the
velocity with which it is sent and the
expanse which it is created and this is
an organized attempt on whatsapp where
political parties have millions of
groups and they start feeding these
messages into those groups I think the
problem has to be addressed at the top
political parties themselves have to be
held accountable as originators of this
there are ideas that have call center
like operations we do these things yes I
it's hypocritical almost for the for for
you know for political parties to
criticize fake news when they have
themselves got machinery that creates it
I don't think it is it is it's possible
to trace and I don't think it is even
rational to disable encryption to help
tracing the originators of these
messages because that will compromise
all of our privacy
yes you know what I think though will
happen I and I completely agree with you
it is hypocritical for any political
party to point fingers and the others or
say oh we should all be responsible a
fact of the matter is it's a race who
has a more active IT cell who has a more
malicious IT cell and an army of trolls
and an army of these supporter groups
who are mushrooming by hundreds on
social media on Facebook and on Twitter
and it's a race between the Congress and
and the BJP and the Samajwadi Party and
the aam aadmi party in every other party
in their own small ways are trying to do
this now what you can also do is set up
a department or under your police and
say that you're going to crack down on
fake news but do it only selectively on
to the groups that you know are working
against you politically speaking fake
news generation or content while
speaking it will be great if we actually
see crack down on those whatsapp groups
where this malicious news is
manufactured and spread and then from
there on it just multiplies and goes
viral within minutes and all our family
groups will actually be getting those
messages but will the crackdown be
honest and genuine and fair and not
selective that is the other big question
I just want to give you two more
examples before we wrap this up here is
another example a video that showed a
group of men roughing up this man who
was wearing a burqa in Goa went viral
and it was being shared with the post
that said a burka clad sangee is
attempting to tarnish the image of
Muslims now if you look at that video
and it gives you this narrative you
might as well believe it but here is the
truth the incident happened on February
16 this year when a burqa clad man
actually was only attempting to and it's
a it this is horrifying to at another
level he was attempting to enter the
ladies toilet this did happen in war but
the narrative is completely different
and the narrative that is being pushed
now is meant to divide you is meant to
incite you there is another one a video
circulated on social media claims that
Pakistani flags were waved at a Congress
rally in Tumkur cannot calm and then
their video you can see that this is
there is this green flag with white
things on it the fact is that it was a
green colored flag flag which is not the
Pakistani flag it was in fact the banner
of the Indian Union Muslim League a
political party which is based in Kerala
but who's going to really watch
carefully and try and identify that most
people will just look at it say Oh
okay and share it and pass it on don't
do that
if you cannot verify it if you do not
know for sure that it is true do not do
that especially not in election season
but things are any which is very
sensitive and this could actually begin
to influence what US will bring so lots
more or such stories to you and then run
up to these elections but thank you so
much for joining us right now

xVCtg1hIo7s,H D. Kumaraswamy on protest after raid of Income Tax department at his house &amp; 10 other locations,Karnataka Chief Minister H D. Kumaraswamy and H.D. Deve Gowda protested against raids at their houses and 10 other location.,2019-03-28T13:50:51Z,MIRROR NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xVCtg1hIo7s/hqdefault.jpg,"and she's Minister HD Kumaraswamy and
JD's chief Davey gora protested outside
the income tax office in Bengaluru after
the tax department Department raided ten
locations in Karnataka
this included the residents of Karnataka
Minister CS potaraju the Chief Minister
had also tweeted and I quote all raids
conducted since morning are politically
motivated to target PG P's opponents and
their sympathizers unquote and also
remember the income tax department had
also released a statement questioning
the Chief Minister's
earlier statement in its release in fact
the income tax department had also said
that searches were being carried out on
the basis of credible information and
that the tax department also added in
the statement that the their activities
should not be politicized personalized
or trivialized I'm joined by my
colleague deepak who's tracking this
story the book so there we can see
actually visuals of the Chief Minister
along with his supporters outside the
income tax department office in
Bengaluru essentially saying that the
raids are politically motivated
[Laughter]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
right Deepak they're getting us more
details essentially you can see over
there visuals where the Congress has
also in fact joined the protest in
solidarity they're standing by
besides beside the HD Kumaraswamy and
the GDS supporters who are currently
protesting outside the income-tax
Department in Bengaluru remember as we
said that one of the ministers in the
Karnataka government she has put - Raju
his residents had also been raided ten
locations in which raids were carried
out in the districts of mondaya and
Hasan in Karnataka today the income-tax
Department of course is maintaining that
their actions are based on credible
information and that it should not be
politicized I'm joined by Deepak once
again over the phone line Deepak there
we can see that there's a large
gathering outside the income tax
department there in Department office in
Bengaluru and even the Congress has
joined in sub in solidarity standing
next to JD s over there
right so these are live visuals which
are coming from outside the income tax
department office in Bengaluru and the
chief minister Karnataka Chief Minister
kumara Swamy had in fact tweeted about
this just a short while back saying that
the raids conducted since morning
according to him were politically
motivated and he streeted saying that
this has been done to target beach
appease opponents and their sympathizers
the income tax department of course has
rebutted that they had also said that
they were noting the comments being made
by the Karnataka Chief Minister and they
said that their information the raids
were being carried out only after in the
after they had credible information and
that their actions should not in fact be
politicized I'm joined by mr. British
caliper with a phone line mr. kalapa
thank you so much for speaking to mirror
now there you can see that these raids
are being carried out by the income tax
department in Karnataka in several parts
ten locations in fact what the Chief
Minister there is saying is that this is
a part of political vendetta that this
is being done to target the opponents
video these openings what is your first
reaction to that names off for the BJP
kada and the BJP supporters whom they
have actually raided today and if it
means that they have waited nobody then
what about the ten o'clock mr. Yeti
repose offering to BJP to Congress and
jTA's never needs to buy them where did
he get that money from the income tax
department not worried about that where
does he get the money from as his own
pakodas does he sell tea to get the
money or is mr. Modi salty or pakoras to
get the money now huge amount of money
is being offered to Vijay recovers in
GDS a minute now where to greater
specificity as money I think these are
all very important questions which they
must answer in the income tax department
is saying that they have
information following which they are
carrying out these rates and that their
actions are not political people it
assists at all so they are in fact
saying that they will get some sort of
information
more evidence rather through these raids
and it is only to eat their
investigation and what they feel is that
the comments which are coming from the
Karnataka government over there is
objectionable to them objectionable in
sobriety actually no not you know
conducting raids with neutrality if if
there were raids conducted on BJP
supporters nobody would have raised an
issue but the fact is that only to
accomplish in JD s leaders are being
targeted and supporters are being
targeted and this is only to give BJP
that the advantage of contesting
relations so this is certainly something
which will oppose and consistently we
will oppose this right so what we can in
fact see is that there are rates being
conducted here in Karnataka and what we
are of course seeing live visuals from
Bengaluru there of the Chief Minister
the Karnataka Chief Minister GDS
supporters are standing outside the
income tax departments office
essentially even raising slogans and
saying that the all the raids which have
in fact been conducted since morning are
politically motivated that's a statement
a tweet rather which has been made by
the Karnataka Chief Minister just a
short while back I'm joined by mr. sighn
out of the BJP mr saye thank you so much
for speaking to mirror now what we can
see is that in fact you you must have
been a must must have read the tweets
which have come out from the Chief
Minister today following the raids the
latest tweet he's saying that this is an
attack which is being made against BJP
opponents that this has some political
vendetta behind it how do you react to
that and they are also protesting
outside the income tax department office
right now in Bengaluru see ma'am
basically writes on our own Ian's piece
have taken place mr. C days of the
honoré and I should not on our a million
from Malaysia ROM his family was this
one he does nothing to do
and what I find it strange is Kumar saw
me and others protesting when government
is doing the right thing you cannot stop
the government department from doing the
right thing to the people if these
people have not cheated they have
nothing to fear why are these peoples
protesting that means they have lot of
money accumulated in those houses which
they want by a threat or this one they
want to get it out I think they have got
a very ulterior motivation in this to
sort of threaten and get out of the
whole problem what they have got in to
see the problem is that they are
fighting a very high-level election they
want to bring to bringing their
grandchildren and for that sake they are
in a policy they are looking at buying
out of village lies water so if now is
there is some information with the IDI
or the income tax department there is a
lot of money accumulated in somebody's
places that would certainly should go
against you go behind it and think the
culprit should have a book and anything
wrong and doing it please ask the
congress spokesperson is it not right
why all the departments working for the
three months of the election and
although all illegal things to happen is
it what they expect right mr saye thank

YrrtkMzljrc,Jean Dreze detained for organizing meeting with locals without permission in Jharkhand,Economist and activist Jean Dreze detained with two other activists in Jharkhand for organizing a meeting with locals without ...,2019-03-28T13:23:54Z,MIRROR NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YrrtkMzljrc/hqdefault.jpg,"these are braking inputs coming in food
right activists and economists Jean de
Rais and two others were detained today
by the police later released and this
took place in Garvie district in shark
on this for having organized a meeting
without permission from district
authorities sure there is and his team
they were allegedly detained because as
in fact they met with locals they have
now been released and are conducting
that meeting
our correspondent shamisen they're
getting us further details the basis on
which they were detained this is with
respect to paperwork that was not
available for permissions that should
have been granted for this meeting help
us understand this further organize a
meeting at the poor crotch or he village
which is the comfort of the mission
falou station in Theravada state that
he's a noted economist and the food
rights activist will be working several
districts off charcoal now today he was
holding up a meeting there and you
clearly said that this was the frequency
and he had obtained permission for that
and all of a sudden when they were
holding the meeting there at the coconut
rocky village a large convenient
policeman arrived there and they
forcefully took over again along with a
few of his colleagues via Kusa and Manoj
and they were forcibly taken local
police station and the question pool
police station where they were kept for
around three hours detain for 34 seconds
and three are being said that they also
asked to fill in some bonds by the
policeman after which there was a lot of
jobs there a large number of people were
gathered there rush to the police
station around the police station and it
was only after the phone call perfect
coming and a localization from around
eating from the idea and from Debbie
that after three hours the printer
supposed to release them together police
has also taken was written bond from
them
God knows what has written the what is
written in the bond but certainly
elements and then get back because
gender age we all know has been working
has been working in several districts
hogs hearts and is also a visiting
professor at University and
or the past few months they've been dead
due to starvation in jargon and he was
working in the sector and that reason
why it referred that he was detained by
the police because the law and the
fishermen did not want him to hold such
meetings there and showcase that there
were debts due to salvation in charcoal
but now he is reason they're holding up
meeting added bishop or village day
certainly everyone has been condemning
this act of this so there he's now been
released given the go-ahead to conduct
that meeting there with people that's an
important input charm that you're
getting us it is with respect to shah
starvation deaths that were reported in
Jharkhand John there is of course
wanting to check on the right to food

water scarcity early November last year

an elite space club by becoming only the
fourth nation in this entire world to
have an anti-satellite weapon system in
place Prime Minister Modi earlier today
made that announcement that India shot
down a live satellite in the low Earth
orbit families also said that this feet
with this feet we have now become a
super space power and also that we have
sent across a message to the world that
while we have the capabilities we
believe in peace we are not looking to
promote a war like situation now part
from India this USA Russia and China
three other nations who have similar
capabilities to run and operate an air
sight missile that will shoot down
satellites in this space tonight we are
going to try and understand what does
this really mean what does it mean for
our country what does it mean for our
defense assets for our overall defense
and security strategy we will also look
at the larger picture there's Mongolian
this Gurgaon yon we have about 102
different spacecraft missions currently
active our space might as obviously
strengthened significantly in the last
few years there's Mission Shakti proved
that we can now also safeguard our space
assets and as it also helped us bring
down any satellites of any of our
enemies who may be trying to spy on us
all of that explanation on the other
side of this basic report
a big moment for India Prime Minister
Modi today told the nation that we had
shot down a life light in space in just
three minutes
making India the fourth nation in the
world to have this capability

Marga the intent of dr-dos mission
Shakti was to show that we have the
strength to defend India's assets the
use of a sat in the mission is seen as
crossing new frontier in three minutes
from the time of detection of the
satellite at a particular location to
the extent that to the moment it is
given an order for launch the entire
process has been automated now this
entire automated process is the legacy
of the ballistic missile different
systems
reports suggest that India may have had
the basic capability since 2012 but we
successfully tested it only now sending
a big message to the world today India
has become one of the four nations in
the world which has this capability of
destroying an active satellite in the
space and led to within a matter of
minutes today we have achieved a great
technological feat but be japaese rivals
were quick to question why Prime
Minister had to make the announcement
and take the credit for last five years
Prime Minister did not even once address
the nation on a single satellite launch
what happened that now in the middle of
the election a prime minister facing
imminent defeat and running
helter-skelter looking for an issue is
now muzzling the voice of dr do
scientists on their achievement
however the BJP and former DRDO chief
put Congress itself in the dock key job
agony v launch whathe
k dr v k Saraswathi a kaha we now have
the capacity to develop and the desire
to develop an auntie satellite missile
but the government is not permitted us
to do so easly a Jo up legal at speeds

Nicole you either a hickey on kiddo
kahani hellscape footprints bot lumber a
few others question of this announcement
was against a mortal code of conduct
with India entering the list of elite
club of Nations today's announcement by
Prime Minister confirms our proven
weapon capability
minun our report
[Music]
the market related to the address by the
Prime Minister has now been brought to
the notice of the Election Commission
and the Election Commission actually has
issued a statement saying that we have
asked a committee of officers to examine
this matter and see if there has been
any violation of the model code of
conduct Minaj's on the phone line when
actually of course multiple political
parties have raised this question that
when the model model code of conduct is
in place why should the Prime Minister
be making any announcements will reflect
us and we will see the left
predominantly left eye we can actually
issue a statement saying as to how was
the police believes this is a blatant a
disregard of how the model code of
conduct which has kicked it and on the
other hand we have also heard from a top
sources within the government to express
a lot of confidence that this does not
really fall but is the realm of any
violation of MCC because this is an
ongoing project which pertains to the
security of the country and therefore
they feel that they are confidently
placed but that being said Election
Commission statements and we is a big
display about the seriousness that the
Election Commissioner displayed with
regards to any complaints that are put
forth by any political parties and
therefore this committee has been
constituted you know but you will go on
to examine with great detail whether or
not with the address that was made by
the Prime Minister today falls within
the realm of violation or the model code
of conduct or not
alright Meenakshi thanks so much for
bringing us that update let's introduce
our guests for tonight left and general
Raj Karthi on defense and strategic
affairs expert Rehman Malik of the BJP
Salman so spokesperson for the Congress
party gaara's are scientists with us
this evening dr. Chaitanya Giri fellow
for Space Studies
gateway house and Maru fruss our
strategic affairs expert in the
consulting 802 the times network let's
get to our experts first and let me
start with dr. Givi dr. Gary can you
help us and our viewers understand why
what
has happened today is very significant
and puts us in that elite club let me
start by saying this mission Shakti has
put India an elite club of space powers
with anti-satellite capabilities why I
say that it's a rarefied Club three out
of the five p5 members the permanent
five in the International Security
Council have anti-satellite capabilities
which means to don't and apart from
these three India is the only country to
have demonstrated such kind of
capabilities so it's a big treat for
India the D idea has been possessing
building blocks for anti-satellite
weapons for a pretty long time almost a
decade or so and it was it was very
important and it was very it was very
important for the country to bring about
geopolitical prudence and a political
will to carry out or to bring in these
building blocks of ASAT weapons and
demonstrate it and this has been shown
today Chuck T is a continuum of efforts
that have gone undergone tremendously in
different programs particularly the
Pretoria missile program the Agni
missile program and what you see today
in the in the screen next to you the a
set weapon is a culmination of several
military projects that have come
together it's a big feat it's a big feat
for India yes in between identifying a
target and actually initiating and
getting results it says the whole
process roughly takes about three
minutes a lot of these components are
indigenously developed so whether it's
you know the lock and load the error
correction all of that the calculation
of what is the precision strike all of
that has been developed by our own
scientists gaara's if I can come to you
to help us understand in what scenarios
can this be used I mean one thing that
obviously comes to mind is if we you
know
enemies satellite is spying on us and
trying to pick up important information
from our space we can shoot it down is
there anything else that this can be
useful t once you develop the
capabilities of this order then there
are a large number of spin-offs you
master the technologies of material you
master the technology of control system
you master the technology of fuel you
master the technology of how to achieve
excellence in all almost all areas of
science and there are always spin offs
when you achieve such kind of excellence
in any one area of science which means
that there is a base bedrock which is
science in the country and on top of
that you build all these capabilities
whether it is true whether it's atomic
energy commission whether it's DRDO CSIR
all these are dead rocks for me the only
problem that I see in today's debate
since morning is high level of
politicization of Science and Technology
in the country let's also very clearly
know that science and technology is not
built in one day or two days the
decision you take and these are
political decisions that you take
seventy years back we took the decision
that we will develop space sciences and
today we have reached a stage now
whatever decision we take today will
affect and influence younger generations
of scientists in the country I am very
scared of politicization of scientific
community Science and Technology and
since morning that is the only thing
that is happening we are not talking
about how we have achieved it what has
been achieved what kind of science has
gone into it scientific community today
in India has confidence that we can
achieve such a thing which is par
excellence now building
blocks of such a technology as just now
told by my colleague are numerous this
is not one technology for an outsider
somewhere before
before I do not television said the
details of what technology has been used
in what all has been done should be
debated on television this is not for
public for nobody is debate no let him
finish mr. Dominic I don't know why
you're jumping in between but let me get
our experts
let our expert scientists of this
country make their points first please
again reiterating the point that our
experts are making this is not about
politics or rhetoric so mr. Malik if you
can hold on for a few more a few more
minutes
let mr. Bazar finishes point please yes
I'm sure whoever has intervened must
have been a politician they don't want
people to know anything they don't want
people to know how we have developed
over a period of time but what I am
trying to say is that it is science and
technology which is respected all across
the country and each and every survey
has confirmed this how people love
science and technology and scientific
community in the country
now politicization of scientific
community Science and Technology is a
problem in in five years we know that
GDP percentage spent on science and
technology has reduced which is not a
very happy situation yet our scientists
have been able to achieve based on what
they have acquired in 70 years now that
is what is scientific community we are
stable we don't get swayed by political
upheavals in the country we have done
our job in fact I have been very
disturbed when first time Prime Minister
sidelined
heathrow chairman and addressed the
nation when we had the
launch okay just after he assumed his
his position and again this has happened
this is what a good prediction so let's
focus on the technology let's focus on
our achievements to do the same thing
he's not the first Prime Minister to do
the said to this this either and for
important space missions even even when
it came to Indira Gandhi she was the one
who came out and made statements and
took the limelight so I think
politicians across party lines and
political politicians because I'm like
the different thing is different but
like you said tonight let's talk about
the technology and so let's talk about
the achievement walls line because I do
not know about taking the limelight when
you acquire something like this it is
about putting your position clear in the
international community so please do not
put limelight kind of words into it it
is made in why currently Israel chief
and the DRDO chief make the announcement
the international community would have
given equal amount of respect to the
achievement DRD achieve no goal
statement and the ma'am the diplomatic
political statements cannot be made by
scientists can I know what was the
diplomatic India one more point I wonder
is mr. Rehman Malik what was the
diplomatic political statement we were
making today I thought it was talking
about our achievements in the field of
science and space research going to use
this okay I I will tell you I will tell
you can Vijay it is about that India is
not going to use it for any aggressive
purpose it is a deterrent this statement
had to go to the international community
which we will see the statement what it
does till tomorrow morning
otherwise you would see what it could
have done otherwise if this can we make
about go
well let me mister I would have been
condemnations mr. Raza let me just go
around the panel once and I will come
back to you sir Manzo's do you want to
respond to that
yeah you see first of all let me just
say that we should we should all
congratulate our scientific community
for this great great achievement this is
no ordinary feat yes indeed the basic
building blocks for this technology were
ready by 2011-2012 and yes the the
leader of the mission at that time mrs.
Ellsworth's said that we could fine tune
this technology using simulations
because conducting a test has the
potential of creating debride that could
actually damage
you know satellites that are not really
threatening india at that time we that
is it may you know we have we are where
we are and that is all very good the
problem occurs I think when the Prime
Minister of the country and the BJP try
to politicize national security matters
I think on national security we should
all be together we should not try to
politicize the Armed Forces or our
scientific community we should at least
on these kinds of occasions let those
who are researchers who are working
behind the scenes let them come to the
forefront and say you know this is
explain it to people explain it to the
world and actually get some get a little
bit of credit and unfortunately I think
the Prime Minister cannot countenance
that and just two or three weeks before
two weeks before the elections the first
phase of the elections he violates the
model code of conduct with impunity and
by the way these are very bad what I
just asked you this is very bad let me
just finish it is a very bad example
leaves a very bad example for other
politicians and by the way for the
younger generation what are they
learning form from the Prime Minister
that if you're a powerful person you can
flout norms you can flout rules that is
not good for indeed I think the EC will
decide if new norms or flout it I don't
think there is anything wrong with the
prime minister of a country talking
about such a big achievement of course
one would have liked to also see the
scientists who were behind this also at
the forefront to know them to understand
what they did and to hear from them as
well and at some point one will
hopefully get to that point but some
answers I have a question for you do you
agree with this change in policy because
what is also emerge and become
is that we've had this technology and
this capability now for many years but
we never move to put it together to test
it and send that message to the world
that look we can do this during UPS era
we have this technology but we didn't
act on it does your party I'll grieve
with this change in stance well first of
all I mean this technology yes it wasn't
development for a while basically it was
pretty much ready and by the way this is
this is one more fine example of what
the indian space organization has been
able to do over the years we've had so
many important missions and important
technologies come out now well what
you're saying is should this have been
done now the question is for all of us
you know
these are of vital national security
interest these are of very high
strategic interest the question is you
know one question to ask for the other
panelists is you know why do it when
there is no international pressure on
say for example negotiations which would
say let's ban a Sat technology there's
nothing like that going on so I think
giving up this car just like that I
don't know maybe the the defense
establishment has some more information
on that I'm not privy to that but
frankly of course the Defense Minister
did not show up today of course it was
the blog Minister mr. Jay okay so yes
and we have we have two scientists on
this panel we have two strategic experts
also on this panel I'm going to go
across to them now my roof-tree do you
agree that on the question of why now
and the shift in policy do we need a
bigger trigger you know why did we need
to show this deterrent right now it can
be I'll come to your question just a
little later but let me because the
moment I say something on the date and
timing it will get a lot of noise from
various people so let me make one or two
other important strategic points the
first thing is that you know India has
being repeatedly denied and ring-fenced
as far as access to top end technology
in Satellite missiles and things of that
nature go it is part of the various
control regimes that the world has set
up like the MTCR where India doesn't get
access and the good thing of that is
that it has given our scientists the
opportunity to show that the Indian mind
is no less than any other and it is
today of course a huge milestone with
the ASAT but we have in the past
satellites on Mars at the cost of
Hollywood film we have set out various
other satellite programs some of our
missiles are world-class like the
BrahMos the Agni and even the Akash
missiles and all the credit really goes
to the scientific community which like
the armed forces continuously a feeling
a cut in their budget for a variety of
reasons but they are going on
relentlessly achieving milestone after
milestone having said that the same
countries that deny us access to those
technologies want us to buy top end
technologies of defense systems because
a lot of their economy benefits from
that and people and workers and
factories benefit from that so there is
an irony here attached the second thing
is it is for some years now that the
armed forces have begun to set up
strategic space commands the Air Force I
know for a fact has been having that in
place for at least 10 to 12 years so
there is serious thinking that space and
space related technology of this nature
is going to seriously influence the
outcome of future conflicts and not just
the numbers and quality of your tanks
aircrafts in ship is aptly the third and
most important thing is that if mr.
saris worth as he is gone on record to
say that on 2012 they were ready to go
ahead with the test now this is a bit
perplexing to me and the only counter
explanation to that that has been given
by some people to say that maybe some of
the military arrangements that we are
going in with the Americans are putting
a deadline on us to get our act together
with you know these kind of missile
technologies before like the CTBT we are
put on a sort of timeline that you can
not test after that that was one of the
reasons we didn't sign the CTBT in 1995
but the fact is that if that not be the
case then if in 2012 the everything was
ready in place yes why were we not able
to exercise the will and the decision to
do it in 2015 16 17 18 and why have we
done it now I mean I I have not come
across as yeah I I have actually spent a
considerable amount of time since this
announcement came out and since the
former DRDO chief Mr Sallis with who you
are referring to made that claim and we
started digging a lot and and there are
a few dots that have managed to connect
but I will come to that in just a bit to
the earlier point that you made general
Cardon thank you for joining us always a
pleasure to have you weigh in on that
aspect going forward this is going to be
the new form of warfare isn't it it's
less of tanks and guns on ground and
more of cyber and space you know
strategies and warfare that the
countries will look at some way it's a
great day for India we all need to be
very very proud of our scientific
community and all those who have gone to
bring these tests to fruition if India
is to become a superpower which we are
aiming to be and which we are proceeding
towards then I think national security
is the prime requirement all your
economy or political development your
strong diplomacy follows from the fact
that you first are a secure country
you're secure as a nation and one is
happy to know that in addition to making
a sacar on the land air and
the seas India is also today secure in
space which may be the future a now
battle as Maru was also said it's a
well-known fact now it has two aspects
one is the achievement on the scientific
level no doubt it would have taken a
long time for the scientist to bring
this about it cannot be done overnight
you need to track you need to identify
you need and then you need to engage a
target flying in space so all this takes
a lot of time and it's a joint effort by
many other agency the second part which
i think is more the causing controversy
that if in 2012 we were ready with this
development but we were not able to
carry out the test because we did not
feel strong enough to face the world
criticism which is inevitable when China
went for this kind of technology in 2007
the world led criticized it in a major
manner so India perhaps also is
apprehensive that we will be under
criticism but today the country feel
strong enough to take that decision
which it is what is it required I think
the the credit should go to the
political establishment for taking this
decision to do a test openly and let the
world know that we have this technology
so I think the credit should go to both
to say that why the Prime Minister
should not announce it is not a
scientist he has given credit to the
scientists I heard his speech is even do
credit it is he spoke that sherry goes
to them there is no doubt about it but
it is a political decision to carry out
the test it is not a scientist
scientists cannot take the decision to
do this so that for that the political
leadership deserves credit and who else
other than the Prime Minister can't
announce it I don't know if you know
frankly I think that's just taking a lot
of time general Cardon I agree with you
that's just taking a lot of airtime in
media coverage time unnecessarily and
like our experts said in the beginning
we should be talking more about what the
science is and what it really means
but because the issue has been raised
about whether or not we had
capability den and why didn't we do
anything about it till now now I I dug
out some of the older courts of dr.
Sarah saw who was the DRDO chief at that
point of time in 2010 he said when ugly
3 was tested he said with the successful
texting of acne 3 we have the propulsion
system that can be used to propel a kill
vehicle in the orbit we have the
capability for the interception but we
do not have to test it because that's
not our primary objective and now this
is a code that I am reading obviously
from a media report in 2010 of the same
man who went on to say there are
repercussions or settle satellite
interception like debris flying in the
space now to this I now understand that
that problem was solved and maybe our
experts can help us on that that debris
problem was resolved because we decided
to use the low-earth orbit
from which the debris will disintegrate
and fall back to earth so that problem
that dr. Serizawa is raising then is not
an issue anymore with that would I be
right you know doctor give me a few of
you can shed some light on this yeah
so by hitting a satellite that's located
300 kilometers above the Earth's surface
you have a very good chance that the
debris created falls back into the earth
at Earth's atmosphere disintegrates and
is completely nullified but if you look
at the Chinese test these tests were
conducted on satellites which were at a
multitude of 800 kilometers that's where
the debris issue arises now what I will
say what I'll add over here is this that
we have done these anti-satellite test
at the end of missile base anti
satellite systems the world is slowly
moving towards laser-based
anti-satellite weapons the three anti
satellite pass again China Russia in the
United States are focusing on laser
based systems and it is time that India
or probably India is already in the lead
amongst these three countries in
building such kind of technologies now
what what are the advantages of laser
based systems the first advantages you
are actually not disintegrating as
satellite you are just frying the
electronics on which the satellite is
based upon and when you fry the
electronics you you are rendering the
satellite useless you are not
disintegrating that's where the space
deputy problem is avoided and that's
where India should really take its anti
satellite capabilities okay interesting
point oh and you know that thank you for
telling us about the newer technologies
that we are looking at and then one
should be focusing on going forward as
well now in 2010 that was a comment and
obviously at that point
DRDO and maybe the government believe
that we shouldn't be carrying out this
test because there is no need to send
out at this kind of a message to the
world and that debris that will be
created will be a problem in 2012 again
mister v Casares worth after the Agni 5
launch spoke and he said no now we have
these building blocks that we are
talking about and the the ballistic
missile defense blocks are ready we can
work on this to a to develop a kill
vehicle that can be propelled why are
the ugly five missile that we've just
launched but at the same time media
reports also caught top different
scientists to say that India does not
believe in weaponization of space we are
only talking about having the capability
there are no plans for offensive space
capabilities so perhaps that's where the
change may have happened some answers
the Congress is not giving us any
specific answers yet officially on why
they didn't use it but do you think
largely that would make sense that as a
strategy you didn't want to step into
that space race or be on the offensive
well if you listen to what the
says today even today the India's policy
is not to actually just go ahead
weaponize space but it is basically for
defense so this technology so you know I
don't really think the policy changes
that much I think the technology existed
at that time and the government at that
time felt as Mr Sallis what also
indicates that we can keep on
fine-tuning this technology with similar
you know through simulations so I think
today perhaps mrs. Highsmith has a
different recollection of what he said
what he said at that time but you know
the record as you already have kind of
dug out and others have pointed out as
well that he made certain statements as
did other senior scientists who felt
that we were on course now you know one
thing we must keep in mind is that these
technologies as India's capabilities
improve over time this is built on the
work that has been done in the past we
have achieved so much whether it's
Chandrayaan whether it's mangalyaan
you know these are the kinds of things
that India's been doing and this is one
more important hugely important
milestone and that should be celebrated
what we should not allow our politicians
to do I am a politician what we should
not be doing is trying to politicize
this especially at a time when we have
an election season coming up not just
coming up with in the middle of the
election season the model code of
conduct is in place there is you know
the same kind of message you know people
our scientists had come out and said
that we could I can I can I can I please
finish I mean I know you know today I
think BJP spokespersons are very
frustrated because they can they can
tell that you know they want to take
some credit from this this is
nationalism and all that stuff okay a
lot of other things also so I just wanna
I just want to make sure I I just want
to make sure that you you keep in mind
that when we have the model code of
conduct
okay all right point taken
Salman chose himself the people they
shine dot in in South the people of
India the EC will decide if the code has
been violated but
Malik after you to respond and no
personal comments from either side
please
he first of all mistress no no mr. Soze
stand is very clear and I think it's not
something which is a personal thing it's
about in the public domain so leaving
that aside my simple point here is that
you have a problem by saying that why
mr. Modi came out and stated it
mr. Modi happens to be the Prime
Minister of India till the next
government is elected whether it is BJP
or any other government but for your bad
or for your you know think people have a
mind and they want mr. Modi to be the
Prime Minister again any less having
said that it is up to the Prime Minister
to convey the right message into the
international diplomatic arena in the
international community as well it was
the well of the political dispensation
to go ahead with it as you go on to take
credit of the 1971 war well for your
information I may tell you and please
ask this to your party maybe you are not
aware of it go and ask why was mr. Manik
Shores Field Marshal Manik Shahs salary
stopped in 1973 and it was later given
by a person who happened to be the same
person who mrs. Sonia Gandhi opposed for
becoming the prime President of India
again and that was dr. Kalam is for know
this is what they stand for man
separately on a different platform
please don't waste the time of my
viewers right now with all of this
rhetoric can you for example let's have
a concrete conversation mr. Amin Melek
you've responded to what the Congress
said I gave you the time to respond to
what the Congress said about Prime
Minister making this speech now answer
my question let's talk about size and
the
what is that we are giving to science to
sign this coming back to you I have a
question for you let's talk actual real
policy that what you are doing and what
capability that you have acquired today
is that you can make your opponent blind
and stand still ok because once their
satellite systems are down you're making
them blind and their infrastructure
their electronic and communication
infrastructure finishes off so that is
what you were doing today ok ok now tell
me this the Standing Committee on
defense in 2016 2017 projected a demand
for Defence Research and Development
Organisation which is the DRDO for
roughly about eighty thousand seven
hundred eighty two crore rupees but the
budget estimate that came out was
thirteen thousand five hundred odd crore
rupees similarly in 2015-2016 the
budgetary estimate allocation itself was
fourteen thousand three hundred fifty
eight crore rupees but the revised
estimate it went down further to twelve
thousand nine hundred forty ninth for
491 crore rupees as about Reza earlier
raised the issue Robin Molly can you
tell us why if they are giving so much
importance are we not gonna giving
enough funds to our own research
organisations and scientists do you
think that's not necessary the we are
conducting all the areas and me at the
right time it is not that we are not
doing it but and but it is also the
responsibility of the government inquiry
in question to fulfil the requirements
of the people who are needy the poor and
we have run the entire schemes which
were benefiting the poorest of poor and
we made sure that they have an elevation
in this level of living and that with
continuous effort whether it is defense
whether it is research we have been able
to do far more okay yes I do accept that
limitations are always going to be there
there is no endless flow of money we
have to generate definitely No
used to have more funds a finitary not
maybe we can stop spending so much on
statues and use it elsewhere and give it
to a scientist no no missus so let me
just go back to warez on that point
because my roof also said I knew that
will come yeah constantly we are seeing
reductions in budget for science for
defense research and for defense Carazo
do you agree or do you accept their
argument being given by BJP that we also
have to look at other purposes for
example we have to look at how we take
care of the welfare of the poor is it an
either/or situation see I I just want to
I just want to respond to this and
before that I want to say that remember
that in 2011 when Saraswat made the
statement that we have conducted six
tests out of which we have succeeded in
five only one did in one test we did not
succeed so the capability to to hit the
target by a set was there today we have
tested it that's all we have tested it
it's a big leap in my opinion it's a big
leap when you test it it's a destructive
test number one number two there is no
scientist in the world who can believe
that the debris can be destroyed by
completely destroyed by such an act this
test would have created debris because
you hit the target and where these
splinters will go you can never know
science scientific method is available
for that no computer can generate so
much of data and process it that it can
predict which way the debris will go so
I personally as a scientist do not
believe anybody who says that debris
will be destroyed completely unless and
until you use laser laser is different
thing but when you hit a target then
debris is generated and you don't know
what is going to be the trajectory of
each beam
that is involved in the whole thing the
second point that you have raised is
extremely important for future it's not
important today because what the
decision you took 70 years back has
resulted into the test today today if we
are starving scientific community if we
are starving our technological
institutions then the impact will be
felt maybe after five years maybe after
10 years when two more governments are
gone though somebody is saying that we
have other priorities today India is
aspiring to be a world power but when
this decision was taken that will build
Science and Technology structure in the
country we were poorest of the poor in
the whole entire world we were at that
time had many things to do and many
mouths to feed we had so many priorities
at that time but at that time we took a
decision that will invest in science and
technology any government which reduces
Science and Technology budget is playing
with the future of the country it is
making it weak it is not making it by
doing a test which scientists say
perform very well and I congratulate all
my colleagues who must have slogged for
achieving this whatever we achieve today
but any government which takes a
decision to reduce our budget is playing
with fire it's making the nation weak in
times to come
point well-taken and I hope the
government of the day and those hoping
to be in the government tomorrow are
listening to you let's quickly also go
across to one of our viewers Govinda
Rajan on the phone line from Chennai
good evening Govinda what's your view on
this achievement yeah is it good evening
Lee all my panelists and yourself man
tell me man then I'd like to me I'm very
happy that we have a deal they were
carried out such a big achievement but
you see
not appropriate the priam p.m. along
with him carried out the other official
tiwa officials along with him at the
time of addressing the nation it is only
indicates that the cultural knowledge he
tried to avail from this if at all you
want to really honor the DLT officials
the scientists of the country he should
have carried they say you should have
carried them along with him in the
studio along with them you should have a
destination not as a political person
the political speech has been given by
the Prime Minister
I watched him the activities actually
assistance and up and down like to
fulfil party meeting yes at restoration
that is the ulterior motive we are
really happy our different persons are
very capable of bringing so many harness
realization yes but but this kind of
politician is not fair any for any
honest politician any honest politician
will not do this even at this department
like that absolutely you know actually
you've raised a very good point mr.
Gowens Rajan and I think that's the
point we should just wrap this
conversation on I'm going to thank my
panelists but let's hope that the
government in Diageo take note of what
people of India are also saying we want
to know these scientists we want to hear
their stories tell us who worked on
Mission shock they tell us who put how
many years you know the challenges they
had their stories because these are the
scientists these are the actual people
who deserve this credit and they must be
brought out tell us their name show us
their faces let's give them the do
credit let country come together and
tank these scientists the project heads
and each and every single member of the
team who walked on this so make it
happen not just today and not just as
part of mission Shakti that carried out
the test but everybody else was being
part of this anti-satellite our weapon
system and developed this in the last
10-15 years a big thank you to those
scientists who irrespective of what the
environment is what the city scenario is
politically and otherwise the amount of
funds in the amount of resources that
may be given to them just continue
because for the love of science and for
love of their country so it thank you to
them for this massive announcement
politics of course will continue one
can't really do much about it but we can
definitely choose to focus on the real
issue thank you so much for joining us

first came the big pre-poll announcement
from Congress president Rahul Gandhi
Tomica Patanjali bees protected
subsidiary peravaram KO Horsell dr.
lazaar
Roop a teenager he Hey but what the
so-called Tamaki our scheme lacked was
clarity which left many questioning
whether the minimum income plan was a
mere pre-poll doula or could it be a
game changer today former finance
minister and senior Congress leader
Peter Dharam defended the scheme we have
consulted enough economists enough
experts in the subject and all of them
are broadly agreed that India has the
capacity to implement the scheme of this
kind he added that there was enough data
available to identify the poorest of the
poor or the beneficiaries of the income
support plan there is data gathered by
state governments and distributing
ration cards there is data farmers
collected for the crop insurance schemes
of the UPA government and the NDA
government and we have enough talent in
this country to analyze the data and
identify the bottom 500 families but
even the form of violence minister from
Congress party has left many questions
unanswered
so tonight Meera now asks how will the
scheme identify the poor can India
fought Congress near scheme can India
foot the bill for the nearest kiemce and
other government subsidies how will
Congress ensure the scheme is corruption
free is Congress pushing a half-baked
scheme to win votes let's debate
[Music]
well this was a much awaited clarity
that mr chidambaram offered reporters in
Chennai today but it hasn't really
answered a lot of the questions we've
been asking about this scheme since it
was announced on the show with me today
Gopala girl for the BJP bomb account for
the Congress professor hoon Kumar chair
professor of the Indian Institute of
Social Sciences we also have with us cm
valve asked a former finance secretary
moon guru Swami is a senior economist I
welcome all of you to this conversation
thank you for joining us we are
expecting the congress spokesperson to
join us shortly but opening statements
from each of our guests in the meantime
mr. guru Swami we talked about this a
couple of days ago when it was announced
by Rahul Gandhi mr. Chidambaram has said
he's offered us clarity but there isn't
too much clarity the question for
example how will you identify the poor
in this country wasn't really answered
he said and I quote there is enough data
there is the SECC data data gathered by
state governments on ration cards data
collected on farmers for crop insurance
both by UPA and NDA and data collected
for the universal health care schemes of
both governments we have enough data and
talent in the country to find the bottom
5% are you convinced mr. Goswami i I
agree with them you know one of the red
Sun I agree with you Tamara but I think
it's the data is there it all has to be
put together and then there would be a
little effort involved but it is there
so it's wrong it's not an insurmountable
task we have ration cards there's yellow
cards EPL cards you have we give
kerosene on on on PDS we give rise from
previous wheat on previous dollar on
previous dose only there's of
identifying people below the parlor the
the estimates of the government always
based on you know reducing party so
obviously government knows number of
people who are below the poverty line so
there are lots of ways of doing it I
think it calls for little effort and
rather than saying that it can't be that
can't be done it can be done you know
and we should be prepared to put in that
effort to give these people
identification cards and you know
when they're going to be it's fixed the
upper limit of six you're only going to
have 15 million people so it can be done
and should be done okay
same question to mr. Bosley mr. positive
do you believe that this identification
this information is enough are you
convinced and we go piece by piece so my
first question is about identifying the
poor has mr. Chidambaram answered the
question we were asking two days ago
no I don't think he has left many
questions and saw unanswered and
probably whatever he has said has raised
more questions for example he says it is
going to be jointly implemented by these
the center in the States it will be
implemented in stages and then till the
other day we were told that this is a
top up scheme that if it is 12,000 if
somebody's earning less than that it
will be topped up now we are told it is
a flat thing for anybody who is earning
who is below in the 20% category but of
the poorest people what about the person
whose 21st or you're saying you're going
to give him twelve thousand rupees if
somebody is already nearly 30 years for
six thousand what do you do so there lot
of questions which I left answered so a
lot of practical problems identification
north of Bell of the prospective
beneficiaries that is going to be
difficult it is going to open so many
issues for corruption and this and that
and for what
because after all practicality is only
one aspect we I think more important
question is certainly is affordability
and desirability yes and I think on both
these grounds there are so many holes in
the scheme that I I don't really don't
know why mr. Chidambaram who in his
period as finance minister I had the
privilege of working with him was known
as a fiscal purist there was a pro there
was no cohesion when there was a Pay
Commission award and some ministers in
the cabinet wanted that award to be sort
of topped up by some extras the
for the staff he refused he said I will
not attend the cabinet meeting if this
is put up so he was such a fiscal purist
and coming from him I I think maybe
politics is again driving a lot of
economics and and when he says we have
consulted enough economists before
framing this scheme I don't know what
questions are posed I heard her today
mr. Raghu Rama Rajan saying that he was
consulted he said that fiscal space can
be created now how can it be created can
it be created by giving up some existing
subsidies but the scheme says nothing
will be given up so how the physical
space is going to come become created
and a physical space is created without
school eliminating any other subsidies
then there are no free lunches so what
will this is now what investment is it
going to be at the cost of growth so I
feel that instead of of removing poverty
it may perhaps make poverty more
entrenched because you are not making
people be productive and earn what they
want the goals have not removed poverty
anywhere in the world so it is the only
sort of antidote to poverty is growth
and if you are going to squeeze out
money for consumption expenditure and
leave less and less for investment and
without investment you cannot have
growth so and without growth you cannot
eradicate poverty these palliatives can
be given but then you are postponing the
process we've done strike right over the
yellow nomic growth having grown up so
yes
allow me mr. Bostic to bring in
professor Kumar as well professor Kumar
mr. Vasudev saying that this scheme
announced by the Congress party and will
try and get more Muslims attention as
well this scheme announced by the power
Congress party he said is anti growth
and the question of affordability and
desirability were not really answer by
mr. Chidambaram and it leaves a lot
still a gray and an under understood do
you agree with him that this as it
stands right now is not clear enough for
us to understand it
you know there are a lot of gaps in what
has been announced is undoubtedly true
however let's look at the basics you
know because of D monetization and GST
the unorganized sector was damaged very
badly and that has aggravated poverty in
the country and that's why you see a lot
of farmers protest youth protest for
employment etc going on because a lot of
jobs have been lost as the data seems to
suggest you know farmers have lost
income because you know they are not
getting the price they should get
whereas the cost has risen so in other
words poverty is aggravated and that's
why all parties are trying to appease
these sections of the population this
because politically there's a lot of
discontent that's building up in the
nation so I think it's good that we have
some such proposal being discussed
across all parties you know in a
democracy we must discuss when there's
distress you know and we must do
something to rectify it the question is
how to do it now the the present
government is trying to do it in one way
by proposing that we'll give six
thousand rupees per year to the bottom
12 crore people in the rural areas but
then they don't cover the urban areas
you know they do give something to the
unorganized sector but that's only for a
period after you know they retire that's
after 16 so nothing much now so I think
what the Congress has done is it has
said that we will cater to all the poor
whether it be rural urban you know and
therefore the question is how do you
identify them that's certainly a problem
there is no because we don't have income
distribution data in that country so we
don't know who's below a certain poverty
line you know and what should be our
poverty line because the figure of
72,000 that's going to be given to any
families so that they can get at least
twelve thousand rupees per you know you
know per person you know that figure
actually would say that's much above the
poverty line figure so in that sense
maybe you'll have many more than five
crore people who would actually qualify
for that and therefore the that the
amount of money that may need to be
spent may be more than what is being
asked for five crore seventy two
thousand rupees per family you know if
the number is much more than five crore
because you're going above the poverty
line figure you know so that's one issue
that identification is a problem
the next issue will be resources
any economy when we think about the
budget they are thinking of expenditures
and revenues
you know the deficit is the difference
between the expenditure and the revenue
if you are going to increase
expenditures then you must try and find
resources of revenue now the sources of
revenue that are possible in today's
situation where the disparities are very
high where wealth is getting
concentrated in the hands of very few as
the oxford austin report showed nine
people have more wealth than 55 percent
people at the bottom and the earlier
world inequality report showed that 1%
of the population has 70 percent of the
wealth in white economy know if that is
the situation then a wealth tax is a
very eminently doable thing where you
can raise almost professor let me let me
ask these questions of mohammed connor i
want to bring in Gopala girl as well
moment can't a couple of questions that
have come that will bring to you from
our panels we have moonboy swami we have
cm+ and professor kumar whom you just
heard speaking first question is the
question of identification
now mr. Chidambaram has not really
answered this question he said that we
have the talent and there are various
databases that we can go through but
when you say the bottom 5% the poorest
of our country what is that definition
how do we define the poorest of the
country are you going to go by income
what is the definition what is the
definition what is the definition of
poor in the country and how will you
arrive at this bottom 5% you're talking
about
yes fee yes so identification of the
poor has often been a challenge
especially while dividing socio-economic
policies but in this case there are
three things that I would like to
present to your viewers the first is
this exercise of the identification of
those at the very margins of poverty has
been done by the Suresh Tendulkar
committee and they have arrived at a
certain formulations which is if you if
you recall the head set
I think 6000 rupees as the average
income below which someone would be
classified as absolutely poor in
addition to that arun kumar saha then I
were on a debate the other day and I
pointed out in 2013 we embarked upon an
exercise to collect data in this regard
called the SECC survey the
socio-economic class census it was of
course meant to acquire a greater
of information not just income but that
the results of that survey were very
illuminating and I think that Devin also
be used to arrive at a conclusion as to
who will benefit from the scheme and who
won't
thirdly I remember in 2012 and 13 the
UPA government was working on the food
security act in the exact same plot
problem arose I was fortunate enough to
be a part of the drafting committee and
I remember renowned economists like John
ray Sahab and Radhika ecology pointed
out but to identify these people come up
with an exclusion criteria which is what
we did now what does an exclusion
criteria the idea is that if you possess
certain items or you are say in a
government job you have a scooter you
have a certain amount of land you will
be excluded from the scheme so you
develop exclusion criteria to arrive at
this of course these three things that
are presented before you face this race
then Dulquer committee report the SECC
data and the experiments with the FSA
these are just ideas at this point which
will be used to build upon this scheme I
hope that is a fair answer to this
question
effectively you said you don't know or
it has not been decided yet no I haven't
said I don't know
well okay I would say that there are
much smarter people than me who are
actually working yes but those people
are not the ones announcing schemes
before election so okay let me ask you
another question now mr chidambaram and
the Congress party who's been a critic
of this government with this scheme yes
okay let's move on to the next one
otherwise we're going to spend the whole
one hour just disguise deciding that mr.
Chidambaram then went on to say that the
2% of the 1.8 percent of GDP which will
which would be the total expense of this
will come from the growth he did say
that right now we have you know we have
a certain 200 lakh crore rupees which is
our total GDP he expected that to go up
to 400 lakh crore rupees fairly soon he
said we're a country that's growing at
about 7 percent now this is the this is
a party that has constantly criticized
the current government for the lack of
growth for the lack of encouragement of
industry for the fudging of GDP numbers
which he said in his press conferences
well
so on what growth estimates are you
basing this assumption that's correct
so what you're saying effectively that
the B chip is done such a fantastic job
that you now will have Indians now in a
position to give away 2 percent of the
GDP well aren't you then through this
acknowledging the BJP economic policy
over the last five years okay that's a
fair question
now the truth is of course we have an
issue with the way this government
presents its figures we know for a fact
that the government revised the base
year not once but twice fail to project
higher figures while delivering lower
growth of course there is growth it is
an economic truth that there is a
certain amount of growth but what we see
is you squandered the growth potential
there amount of growth the pace
education is growing under the UPA is
nowhere close the poor the the per the
pace at which it was growing under the
UV is not matched by you and it's not
even close to the figures put up by the
UPA it is a very different argument to
say there is no growth and to say that
the growth that you put out is far below
the potential of our economy and the
latter is our argument our economy is
driven not just by mr. narendra modi it
is driven by the people of india who
produce goods and services that is the
very definition of GDP and these goods
and services are irrespective of the
government growth head mother just start
a whole secreting behind him for chief
it and easily they put out false data
revise the year so that the base year so
that the base effect appears higher and
present these leaders before you
nonetheless there are other things as
well I noticed that you had interviewed
mr. Raghu Rama Rajan yesterday and I was
fortunate when you know I caught a
little bit of that I wanted to point out
that in his book the third pillar on
page 323 he actually presents various
options for how you will find a
universal basic income scheme for
example he talks about the
rationalization of subsidies he talks
about the fact that it can be a hymen
harmonization of indirect taxes he talks
about what Arun Kumar was talking about
earlier that you could conceive of
something like a wealth tax for a very
select elite few now all of these are
very good measures and again they don't
knock it until it is out because again
remember and this is very important on
is my job okay I understand
send your argument but it is my job to
knock it every because the audience
needs to know if this plan is good
enough to vote on now go for another
round will will go for another one very
badly the following day yeah that's fair
but let me say the polling then let me
just say the following let me just say
the following let me just say the
following one sentence in 2005 the exact
same arguments that we hear today with
regard to percentage of GDP where will
the money come from etcetera were raised
against MGNREGA as well we found the
money frame we've done it before we've
done it several times before we will do
it again all it requires is political
will alright so ok then tell me
something in the 10 years of prosperity
that the UPA you know actually brags
about why don't you look us then yeah so
hey that's a very good question
and I'm so glad you brought it up
because today I mean Express publish the
story that we've been talking about
since September of last year in
September of last year or the Oxford and
United Nations of the Oxford University
in United Nations published a report on
multi-dimensional poverty say dick they
studied the years between 2004 and 2015
and you know what they write that as a
conclusion they said that the most
number of people across the world had
been lifted out of poverty by the UPA
schemes 271 million a figure that is not
matched by anywhere else in the world
these are amazing findings and they're a
testament to the ups pro-poor policies
so again this is we don't take my word
for it as a congress spokesperson read
the report read the Indian Express story
let me let me allow let me allow gopal
'gopal agra round to come in he's been
listening very patiently and then my two
experts will provide will will bring in
their rebuttals Gopal are the wrong go
ahead your rebuttal to Mohammed Khan if
you have one no fair we got very good
questions from you but very bad answers
from the congress spokesperson the same
thing was mr. Chidambaram press
conference we were all expecting some
steps on the whole scheme what I want
but I agree with mr. Chidambaram is that
he said that we have the talent
we had the talent in 2007 for with DRDO
but it
we had to wait for 2019 and mr. Modi to
take decision that we were able to do
such thing today I would like to restate
the issue is you were asking no no no
yeah yeah the issue is we are all asking
he can be do we have that talent to
identify oh we'll be able to identify
them before question before is that what
we have to identify the issue is not
clear whom they want to give the schemes
what will be the criteria the basic
question everybody is asking mr.
Chidambaram mr. Rahul Gandhi mr.
Surjewala is what is the scheme what is
the basic structure what is who will you
give what is the amount what will be the
criteria if they are not clear they
themselves are not clear so how will
they say okay we will identify and they
are saying that we took six months to
think on this we have discussed with all
the economists if mr. Raghu Rama Rajan
has such a talent that after discussion
with mr. Raghu Rama Rajan and six months
of brainstorming they come out with a
press conference as useless as mr.
Chidambaram
today mr. Surjewala and mr. OWL Gandhi's
day before yesterday then I have
extremely sorry does this country if
left to these economists so-called
economists it will neither progress in
the economic field neither it will
progress in the nationalist field know
that it can fight the terrorists all
there is a failure okay all right I
understand your argument mr. Agarwal I
just want to understand what is the
national issue you know I patiently
picture say I patient least let me
finish the whole occupationally heart
everybody the issue is that the issue is
that if you want to give benefit of
anything you have to identify the
beneficiaries they have not identified
they are not clarified the scheme the
second important thing is you also
pointed out is that they on the
implementation of the scheme they are
banking on two or three main important
points that is one is the direct benefit
transfer and the bank account that has
been established over patiently and
focused way by mr. Narendra Modi over
these five years
they are banking on that system which is
likud through which is corruption free
which is leakage proof so they should
appreciate that mr. Modi has implemented
an ecosystem where there we can transfer
government benefit a scheme to the
common man without corruption and to the
targeted person
second thing is you also pointed out and
I also want to put before everybody is
that they are also depending on the
economic growth that we have brought
over five years we were in 2014 in the
fragile 5 economies inflation was high
deficit was very high corruption was
high Ease of Doing Business was very low
so from there now we are the sixth
largest economy in the world fastest
growing economy in the world four
highest results of foreign exchange
globally we have a very strong reform
agenda that the world is appreciating
and financial inclusion program of mr.
Modi has been appreciated globally by
the World Bank and everybody we have
seen over five years all right all right
I want to bring in my experts for a
rebuttal I've given you more than your
fair share of time and made a big
difference yes both these things when
the Congress and UPA is depending on
these two things good economic growth
okay put your nominal ain't good
delivery system they should appreciate
if we will use mr. Modi's okay okay mr.
Gura
okay mr. garage so here are the
questions we're asking I'm going to
traverse a point about again we all want
to see yes yes we are not against any
scheme if they want to do good for the
poor we appreciate them but tell us how
you will tell us how you'll do it
absolutely so I'm just to reiterate the
questions we are asking this evening how
will the Congress identify the poor what
is the definition of poor how will you
arrive at this bottom 5%
second point how will you make sure that
the scheme is corruption free and
leakages of the money that you are
transferring and you it's going to the
right people and finally can India
afford this scheme now chubu savant guru
Swami you first said you agree that
there is a there is talent and there's
enough data to identify do you first of
all believe that India can afford this
scheme at 1.8 percent of our GDP and we
know mr. Chidambaram argued that this is
Dharma and this is something we must do
but is this the way to remove poverty
from the country do you believe that we
can afford it mr. guru Swami we give
away almost 18 to 20 percent of our GDP
on subsidies the various kinds of
subsidies direct subsidies indirect
subsidies military subsidies unmerited
subsidies when you power companies make
a loss that's a subsidy when energy
makes a loss that's a subsidy the public
sector companies make loss of their
subsidies so all these are subsidies
milky substance sugar a subsidized way
to subsidize PDS is subsidized through a
lot so subsidies there so this is good
amount of the GDP now we are talking
thought of 1.8 percent of GDP we don't
know at one point 3 percent of GDP that
is the amount which will go for this and
that can be easily accumulated you know
after all if you put a 2 percent cess on
on people with you know with the death
of about about 2.5 crores you will get 1
point 2 percent of GDP in Texas these
numbers have been a time please
it's not cross it was coated by mr.
Ogami finish your argument please the
question that I'm fundamentally asking
is this I don't believe there's anyone
here who says we shouldn't be helping
the poor we shouldn't be seen
children from hunger how successful do
you think this scheme will be on the
ground or will it just be another half
big scheme that you should support the
poor absolutely everybody believes we
should support the purpose the guru
Swami will it work on the ground you
good good you agree good you agree good
you agree of course it will work on the
ground there will be some leakages on
everything there's leakages but it'll
work on wrong it'll make you know people
will be empowered to ask it people have
this right to information they're their
you know their bank accounts and you
know all these things are there and the
money will go directly
so the leakages of mondragor will not be
there so I think you should give it a
try
rather the idea is not a bad idea UB has
been around in the air for a long time
Arvind Subramanian had written to the
economic server in 2007 why did this
govern put it in this array and I said
you know we should be looking at this
they didn't do it because you know they
couldn't someone the political will and
courage for it because you know they
have been brought up in such a way that
you know all this is this for money this
is a state which gives its employees 23
million employees eleven point four
percent of GDP salaries every year the
generous allowance increases by 1 point
2 percent of GDP chopped and that's it
that's about 10 percent every year okay
rebuttal mr. Vassa people sit here and
say this is bad this is great ok
rebuttal for mr. Bostick was to Asif
since Monmouth can't quote a dragger
Rama Rajan Raghuram Rajan also has
written in his book that are pure that
socialism doesn't always work that you
have to skill people you have to educate
them you have to provide them with
health care you have to provide them
with jobs and opportunities now this is
not a solution for any of those things
do you believe this will work on the
ground and you have a rebuttal for
Mohammed Khan mr. versi call you back
you know we are we are focusing a bit
too much on the practicality and the
affordability issues of course there are
a lot of problems and practicality in
implementing the scheme everybody knows
and it is not going to be easy
and so far the foldability is concerned
of course and everything can be
affordable in that sense what Mohan is
saying but then what is the cost of that
affordability are you what are you
squeezing out in the process if you want
to run a scheme of this type and reduce
the expenditure on education and health
and on infrastructure and and other
investment of course you can do it but
then are you serving the objective for
which you are doing all this that is to
eradicate poverty as I said earlier in
up to the 1980s up to 1991 we had a
growth rate of Hindu rate as it was
called 3 to 3.5 percent and 40 to 50
percent of the population was was below
poverty line 91 that was the Congress
government at that time dr. Manmohan
Singh was the finance minister when the
economy was liberalized the energies of
the private sector were Unleashed and we
reached this 7 to 8 percent growth
trajectory and look what has happened
the poverty numbers have come down to
20%
so the real antidote to poverty is
faster growth that is the way to take
people out of poverty not by giving
doles have you seen any country in the
world which has been able to eradicate
poverty by giving those every country
which has eradicated poverty has done
through the growth process so we have to
do everything which which can be done to
accelerate the growth process of course
there are there are marginalised people
who are being left out of the growth
process we should try to identify them
and give them some support which we are
doing through various government
programs but now if you want to do this
type of a door and say all other
subsidies as mone was saying need to be
rationalized and this and that then then
what are we doing so I think we are
really asking the wrong questions by
only focusing on practical we should
really also focus more on the
desirability of this 1% of the
population
1% of the population has Flores 79
percent of the growth that is the growth
you're talking about
you certainly become a socialist mindset
no no I'm not well you will have to
answer what what mr. vasudeva said and
he basically said that this is
anti-growth because while we may have
the money in the system it is not the
right use of that money and it is not a
use of that money that will project
growth professor Kumar I see your hand
go up but as soon as mark on his answer
to this question raised by mr. positive
MOA thumb go ahead
of course he as far as I understand it
and of course the senior economists on
the panel can correct me there are
competing schools of economic thought
there's developmental economics which
believes that the state has a larger
duty to take care of the poor
there is the leases fair School of
Economics which requires minimal
intervention by government and believes
that the market will correct itself in
fact your panel is a perfect example of
schools of thought playing out in a
wonderful manner of speaking if I may
say so however I want to say this look
at min Subramanyam I want to go back to
the 2016 and 17 survey what happened
Subramanian proposed and remember fail
this report was presented in Parliament
by mr. Jaitley so it is endorsed by the
government he proposed seven thousand
six hundred and twenty rupees to 75
percent of the population I don't
understand why they have suddenly become
Luddites and are saying that no six
thousand rupees which is almost fifteen
hundred rupees cheaper is almost sixteen
hundred twenty rupees cheaper is
suddenly an anathema to them I don't
understand why the second thing I want
to point out is leakages yes leakages
were an issue especially with
engineering I remember the problem of
ghosts in the system and how we worked
overtime to combat it
that is how the idea of direct benefit
transfer was born in 2012 implemented by
the UPA conceived by the UPA and
unfairly and intellectually dishonest me
appropriated by the BJP government the
DBT is the method by which to ensure
that there are no leakages in the system
again which is perfectly good if you
have to get it there so I am certain the
Congress which has a record of
implementing the food security ID the
Land Acquisition Act the 72,000 Carollo
and waiver to farmers the MGNREGA I am
certain if there is any party that will
find a way it is us and I am certain
that you know we will present the
mechanics of this in the days to come in
more detail hey professor Coburn
professor come on go ahead yeah so you
know we must understand that the present
crisis is a result of the fact that the
unorganized sector has been very badly
hit and that's 94 percent of the
employment and when 94 % of the people
tend to lose their purchasing power then
the rate of growth of the economy comes
down and that's why the rate of growth
of the economy today is not 7 percent
but less than 1 percent with the
unorganized sector data is not
calculated in the government's growth
projections now when the rate of growth
comes down demand comes down and when
demand comes down industrial growth
slows down so if you are able to pump in
3.6 lakh crores into the lower levels of
a purchasing power then the industrial
begin to do better so in a sense this is
something that's global and that's why
globally people are talking about
universal basic income because people
are realizing that when unemployment
comes then people lose income at the
bottom and there's a lot of social
discontent and demand comes down and I
remember Warren Buffet is saying 6 years
back that I pay a lower percentage of
tax than my secretary because I have so
many concessions you know he said as I
earned 2 to 3 billion dollars a year my
secretary earns only 100 thousand
dollars and I pay less percentage tax so
he said the rich should pay more taxes
you know and that was supported by the
German rich the french rich and the
italian rich also and therefore i wrote
a piece in the hindu at that time saying
what about the indian rich now the time
has come where we can raise resources
through wealth tax
because 1% Indians have 70% of the
wealth and that growth is so
concentrated in the hands of a few
people that they're doing very well
the others are marginalized so in a
sense when demand rises and when
production Rises investment will also
rise so I think this kind of a scheme is
worth looking at so even though there
are a lot of problems this problem or
identification how will you identify the
people and then the way it is structured
it's not going to be just the bottom 20%
there's going to be more set of people
so more funds may be required then as
you rightly said that if somebody is at
eleven thousand rupees then will it also
get twelve thousand and therefore cross
the poverty line much beyond the poverty
line so there lot of problems but I
think it's worth considering and as mr.
Chidambaram is rightly said it'll go in
phases we'll have a pilot scheme and
then we'll have others ways of looking
at it and the sec survey can be the
starting point where we identify people
who are houseless etcetera start with
them and spread it further so I think
it's a possibility and as I said we
don't have to have a higher fiscal
deficit to do this because I think
growth will take time to pick up so I
don't think they're certainly going to
go from 200 like grow to 400 lacquer or
we are going to go slowly over there so
we need to identify resources now so the
fiscal deficit doesn't rise so that the
investment on education and health
doesn't fall investment and capital item
doesn't fall so I I think it has to be a
balanced budget situation where we raise
resources and spend ok yes yes Mama's
had the Congress has spent the better
part of the last three months talking
about Oh even more than that talking
about the farm crisis and the job crisis
and the crisis of growth in the economy
what is your solution for the farm
crisis what is your solution for the job
crisis now this is a quick-fix method
but where are your long-term pitches why
is it that you're going through the
lowest hanging fruit here just before an
election actually
I know it would be tempting to call this
a low-hanging fruit but it isn't it is
actually given the sheer size of the
scheme and massaged it would be a
gargantuan task it would involve levers
and mecha it would involve levels of
government that of hitherto not existed
it would require a mammoth deployment of
resources and individuals so it's hardly
a low-hanging fruit again the idea is we
must tackle poverty and we have to treat
it as a priority something that we feel
this government doesn't do now this is a
solution that at best brings them out of
the red zone that brings them to a point
that they can actually survive for the
very basics they don't have to hanker
after the basics right it is after that
that we build the additional tools no
one is saying that this is in derogation
of or in obliviousness to other measures
for growth they're going to be coming
out with our manifesto very soon
there'll be multiple sections on
economic growth for reviving the economy
for handling the farm traces we are not
exonerating ourselves of that
responsibility we will be providing
solutions to those as well and if you
like I am very happy to discuss those on
this debate as well for example I'd love
to talk about the fact vector we would
want to build cold storage facilities
for farmers bring MSP up to a point that
was originally promised you would like
to talk about the fact how we'd like to
restore the Land Acquisition Act to its
original formulation we'd like to talk
about the fact that we want the API to
procure food grains like it was it
supposed to enter the food security I we
can talk about all of this and so far as
jobs are concerned of course we we can
you know have a larger debate on jobs as
well we could talk about the fact that
you know we would invest in large public
employment programs like my generica
which is what happened in the New Deal
under FDR after the Great Depression
there are multiple ways to proceed on
this and the Congress believes in
putting these ideas forward we don't
believe in putting forward joomla's
which I which look good on posters and I
promptly forgotten by the end of the
election so I promise you this is
something that we will look at very
seriously mr. Coppola garage do you want
to rebut I would like to say only two
things issue is that all the ideas great
ideas that mr. Muhammad Khan and mr. OWL
Gandhi are talking they had every time
for since independence to implement them
they had 60 years out of that all 70
years of since in
and they should have implemented all
these great ideas second thing I would
like to tell you is the mr. Khan is
saying that we have done this we have
done this we have done this we have done
the direct benefit transfer we are
talking of manraja everything but if the
four credit they are saying that but for
poverty for agriculture distress for
corruption for slow growth in economy
they are not responsible how can this be
here that they have to take
responsibility for the problems also the
third important thing is and nobody is
saying that we should not bear give
benefit and take care of poor we are for
that we our every 219 schemes are with
the focus of benefiting the poorer
sections of the society across geography
across various segments across caste
everything and we have done those
schemes through that we have done the
got no benefit for them people what is
the issue is how do you uplift the
people poor people they have not is
something I am believer that you do not
just by giving out doles no we cannot
give just doles to the poor and give
them like these slogans and lift them
out of poverty if they these kind of
slogans would have helped them and
brought them out of poverty 1951-52 mr.
Nehru gave this slogan 1971 Indira
Gandhi gave this slogan
1985 Rajiv Gandhi Gary B itaú then in
2004 Soniaji said that they see their
manifesto they are talking of minimum
guarantee schemes and in there and
electrification all these things in
their manifesto in 2004 why they tend to
do it it is our government which has
brought electricity to have ríos so the
issue is that we have ideas in India the
question is who will implement the will
power it is mr. moody respond who is
working day and night and working for
the in strength of power and their
parameter here at finding the results
into it the issue another important
thing is yeah
that if you want cabal recognizes
something then you should give the
roadmap and if you are not giving the
organism merely a slogan one more per
last point I would like to say he said
mr. Kahn said that scse data we have
brought we had done that survey I tell
you that was clearly for vote bank and
dividing society on cosmic politic
politics to get votes it has nothing to
do with their upliftment they have
divided the country on minorities they
have divided the country on caspases
they are okay you know what you want mr.
mr. Gopala that well you know it is a
little rich coming from you to be saying
these things where where was the where
was the the blueprint to what you have
promised a quick rebuttal from your from
Mama's kind of I want to go back to my
experts quick rebuttal we - what will
struggle innocence go behind my deep
personal affection and respect for your
side the fact is you are literally the
last government that can lecture us on
economic growth and I'll tell you why
you inherited a growth rate of 7% you
performed so badly that you to revise
and the do window-dressing on the
numbers to present a higher number
number to you benefited from the lowest
oil prices in 30 years at $13 our
battled by be-bopping one hundred and
fifty dollars a barrel you got a green
fall green of lakhs of crores a figure
you have concealed and people still
don't know how much you made of that and
third you had the global economy was on
the rise and yet you shot yourself in
the leg with the monetization and a
poorly implemented GST if anyone you
wiped out one crore jobs according to
CMI anyone economic growth is so
completely flawed religion k prism say
they explain so your jaundiced thinking
compels you to think like that surveys
have been conducted in this country and
every
establish it was true despite we'll only
need you to believe that it's for
religious purposes it was a
socio-economic car by citizen thousand
14 our economy was in the fragile 5
Sarah
alright gentlemen just in 2014 economy
was in the present should you be
answered by the other two yes okay okay
let me let me just I think that on the
panel everyone is off the agreement on
point one that the poor should be
supported that part that the minimum
income guarantee must be considered in
order to give the poorest in our country
the dignity of being able to sleep
without you know with with a meal in
their bellies so the children are not
malnourished and they can then move from
there forward the question to ask is
this is this the scheme to do it do we
have enough evidence from the Congress
party that they have in fact thought
this through and it is a scheme that
will succeed and it's not just something
half-baked they've offered to the people
of India in sort of a lieu of bribery to
votes yes or no answers really from my
three experts mr. Goswami do you have do
you believe we have enough evidence from
the Congress party to suggest that this
is the scheme to solve the problem and
this is the scheme that will work yes or
no clearly the Congress party hasn't
given its full talk hasn't got the
details worked out and it's an election
pants off you know so clearly like all
politics are so you know that part is is
true but clearly there is money there we
give away last year this government gave
away six point three eight lakh crores
has revenue for God tax concessions to
large corporations to rich people I
think there's some of these things which
can be looked into
and cut a new fun money found for poor
people for jobs for them for a friend or
life lots of things can be done but you
know Congress partly has to work out the
numbers I don't know if they have the
skills right now and the time right now
to do it and whether the mood in the
country is willing to have a serious
discussion they should have probably
come out with the scheme six months ago
absolutely but they didn't
and so you know now it has been tossed
around on a street like this absolutely
mr. Vasudev same question to you do you
believe that this is this is the scheme
in fact to solve our problems of poverty
and do you believe that the scheme would
work you know whatever we are discussing
I think it's a classic case of politics
driving economics almost 90 percent or
so in framing of Public Policy you
talked about the poor having dignity and
being able to sleep with food in their
stomach this should be done and that's
why you have food security act and you
have to thank the Congress government
isn't that time to put the food security
act but I am tempted to say that this
particular idea I hope it does not
translate into a scheme this idea is
instead of Gary be hurt ow it may lead
to Gary Bieber how so I am very
skeptical about the economic
consequences of giving tools by
borrowing money for fiscal deficit and
creating problems for the government and
we're taking the government
macroeconomic indicators will get upset
you will get into a debt crisis so you
are squeezing out resources for growth
and without growth there is no poverty
reduction so instead of instead of very
bahut ow
it may lead to very bitter how all right
professor Kumar very quickly do you
believe the scheme would work you know
it has to be made to work because the
poor are really suffering how long will
we keep telling the poor that you wait
till the things improve for you you know
they've waited long enough and the D
monetization and the GST have added to
their miseries so we need short-term
policy measures and long-term policy
measures this is quite a short-term
policy measure designed for the election
purposes but in addition we'll have to
do more so if the scheme is launched it
has to be launched over a graded period
of time with experimentation to begin
with in a pilot scheme then where it
begins to work it has to be extended so
it has to be done in a fiscally prudent
manner and growth will increase because
the purchasing power at the bottom will
increase that is what happened in 2007-8
when we gave you know a lot of money at
that lower layer
so Indian economy continued to grow at
5% whereas the rest of the world the
economies were in recession so clearly
there's a role to play for increasing
purchasing power at the bottom and
taking care of the poverty at the bottom
but we will have to continue to invest
in education in health and increase
investment in capital items and for that
wealth taxation would be very necessary
so the fiscal deficit doesn't rise and
the macro balances don't go out of order
so it's a perfectly doable thing
provided the political will is there all
right I'm going to leave this here
because we've run out of time but
basically while I thank my panelists
this is very boils down to should the
idea of minimum income guarantee be
thought about in worked on in our
country yes because we must work on a
system where we give the poorest in our
country the basic dignity that they
deserve
is this the scheme to do it does this
scheme give us enough information on the
table to have the confidence that it
would do it
not yet no it doesn't we don't know how
the government in off the day will go
about identifying the poorest in our
country we haven't successfully been
able to do it up until now and the
Congress party did not answer mr.
Chidambaram did not answer that question
today even if he's talking about ration
cards or BPL there has been evidence
around the country of people who are
fairly well-to-do who retain their
ration card or retain their cards that
say they're below the poverty line
because they want stops from the
government how will you make sure that
this actually reaches those people who
are really four who have no you know
rights now no bank account they have no
land or their name they have no homes to
their name how will we make sure that
this reaches them the bigger question of
course that has been put forward by the
panel is this what about education and
health and problem solving in terms of
jobs and skilling people and making sure
that our farmers get their due those are
the long-term harder problems to solve
and those are the solutions that we
would like to hear at this point as far
as this scheme is concerned there needs
to be more information handed to the
general public in order for them to
understand whether or not the scheme
will really work thanks for watching

8HaRXNU89qk,Has Government weakened the laws of political funding? | The Urban Debate With Faye D&#39;Souza,"On the debate tonight, we will talk about why the Government of India had brought some changes in the rules of political funding, ...",2019-03-27T17:04:44Z,MIRROR NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8HaRXNU89qk/hqdefault.jpg,"[Music]
good evening and welcome back remember
last week we talked about the changes
the government of India had brought to
the rules of political funding now these
changes have been made over the course
of a couple of years they're
fundamentally three important changes
made by this government one the
introduction of electoral bonds that
allow for anonymous donations of a great
the large amount of money the BJP has
received donations worth a thousand
crore rupees the Congress about two
hundred rupees
the second is a change in the definition
of foreign companies which allows
fundamentally money to flow in from
sources overseas and the third a change
in the rules that used to allow only
companies that were at least three years
old to donate only a fraction of their
profits both of these caps have been
removed and as a result shell companies
or fake companies can be set up to fund
political parties and funnel money from
unknown sources the Supreme Court is
currently hearing a case on the matter
and the Election Commission has filed an
affidavit a the Supreme Court in
response to the PIL it says shockingly
the Election Commission had written to
the law ministry not once but twice to
say that the change in law will impact
the transparency of political party
funding the Election Commissioners also
said that the new laws will allow for
unchecked foreign funding and this will
lead to policies of India being
influenced by foreign companies this is
worrying because the big question to now
ask is this why did the government of
India go ahead and change the rules in
spite of the election commission's
concerns and objections that's the big
question we are asking tonight joining
me on the show at this point I have big
nut who's a journalist who has been
tracking this entire movement very
closely he's the associate editor at
News laundry Major General Anil Varma is
hara ddr now major Terrill Varma has
filed the PIL that's being discussed in
Supreme Court he also filed a case a
couple of years ago about the fact that
both the Congress and
the BJP had received illegal funding
from a company called Vedanta and a lot
of what has happened has started with
that first case I me Brainiac nick is a
member of the Rajya Sabha with the
Congress party Bhaskar go spokesperson
for the BJP Carlin Andy is a law of the
Supreme Court and will also have
Prashant Bhushan
senior advocate join us through the
course of this conversation I welcome
all of you good evening my first
question of course is to Major General
Allen Verma this proves to us and now
that the Election Commission has put
this down in court in front of the
Supreme Court that the government
changed the rules despite concerns and
objections by the Election Commission so
there is nothing legal about these
change in these rules
Major General Verma just quickly go over
certain background information one is
that we had filed three petitions one
was against the electoral bonds and the
second one was the FCRA case and the
third was that the political party
should come under the RTI so the Supreme
Court finally after a couple of years
decided to hear them so they were
clutched together and the hearing was on
26th March and then the bench comprising
of the Chief Justice and others they
decided that they would hand it over to
another bench and therefore the hearing
has now been fixed for April the second
now the Election Commission is afraid of
it we've just got to see it in the
evening and I'm happy that they have
confirmed the stand which they had taken
earlier in writing with the government
regarding the electron bonds so since
two of these cases are linked the FCRA
case and this electoral bond case which
we had discussed earlier also in a
discussion it is important that we know
the connection which we can subsequently
learn but I want to highlight two three
things one is that one of the mps sri
inaudible Huk
on 18 December 2018 had
raise the question regarding the
knowledge of the Ministry of law and
justice as to whether they had got
anything in writing from the Election
Commission of India pertaining to the
electoral bonds to which the Minister of
State I think in the parliament had said
that they had not received anything and
this thing was brought out by RTI
activist he had asked for the documents
and it was very clear that these two
letters which the Election Commission as
referred to in their affidavit today had
been given there and the Ministry of law
and justice had sent those documents to
the Department of economic economy
Affairs yes and they said that we
haven't heard from the economy of
reading so on the last day of the Rajya
Sabha mr. Haack had even filed breach of
privilege in the parliament now coming
to the question of the affidavit of the
Election Commission we are very happy
that they have taken this stand because
the government's stand on this issue
which also we have seen just now the
reasons given them given by the
government don't hold any water in any
way firstly is the question of
transparency when the donors identity is
hidden so what type of transparency are
we talking about the digital part is
fine that the cave I see is there and
all that but the issue is that having
amended the Income Tax Act the Companies
Act the RBI Act and all the other the
representation of the people's Act you
have removed all restrictions which were
there earlier that 7.5 percent is the
maximum limit on which the profits the
company should be a profit-making
company there is a specific thing in the
RP r is a representation of the people's
AG that you cannot accept foreign
funding now after having removed all
that nobody knows that these companies
which are donating what is their
background they may be shell companies
the money may be routed from foreign and
laughter David this can open the root of
foreign funding and foreign companies
can control our policy now isn't that a
dangerous thing
I mean after having a amended all these
act so basically the area had filed the
petition asking for yes the government
to do away with the implementation of
all these amendments which had been done
and secondly for scrapping of the
electric bonds yes but my let me just
bring in some some points of view here
Bhaskar Ghosh with the BJP mr. Ghosh
it is now obvious after our last
conversation now that the Election
Commission has submitted this to the
Supreme Court that the government did
not have the consent of the Election
Commission the Election Commission had
objections to the changes you were
making but you went ahead and made them
anyway what is this level of corruption
that has come in what kind of funding
were you looking forward to why did the
government make changes to political
funding rules despite the fact that the
Election Commission did not want these
changes to be made see first of all let
me answer you one thing that I do not
know in detail what Election
Commissioners fund has replied or
submitted consent but let me put some uh
tracks in front of you which which will
yeah we which will will will unveil a
lot of truth a lot of facts number one
let us see the issue of the bond and
purchase of the bonds issues of the
bonds is strictly through the RBI
because I will read out to you what the
Election Commission has said to the
Supreme Court and I want you to respond
to what the Election Commission has said
because you yourself have said on this
channel that the only voice that matters
during the election is the Election
Commission and nobody no government
nobody can stand in the way of the
Election Commission this is what the
Commission has said that amendments
carried out to the income-tax
representation of people's act and the
Companies Act will have sea
repercussions and impact on the
transparency aspect of political finance
and funding of political parties that's
one point a second point and this one is
more worrying it says it cannot be
ascertained where the political party
funding will be taken in donation under
this act of representation of people's
Act which prohibits political parties
from taking funds from foreign sources
this will allow unchecked foreign
funding of political parties in India it
will lead to an e to Indian policies
being influenced by foreign companies
now this was sent in a letter to the law
ministry and the law ministry has
ignored the letters of the Election
Commission now please tell me why is the
law Ministry of the government ignoring
letters and warnings from the Election
Commission while changing its rules yeah
hey I can answer this first of all that
prehension that prehension of the
Election Commission's that there will be
a free flow of black money into the
election process or into the electoral
process I personally don't think that it
is a flow of the black money because
before these new electoral bonds in
induction there was a flow of I mean
this is a so I have no one to III have I
I have no that's what I'm telling you
that what is the objective of this
literal bonds it is not in actual
reforms it is it is just to I wouldn't
like mr. Ghosh
are you aware of the fact that it was
not just electoral change the funding
laws for foreign fling flows into
political parties you've changed the
funding laws for coming allow me to come
one by one if I'm if I'm if I'm if I'm
cross talks then I cannot answer you
either allow me to answer then if it's
something wrong please contest that
first of all
the government of India's objective was
to make an greater transparency of
electoral funding as well as trailing of
the black money now now these electoral
bonds are essentially issued by the RBI
and it is been totally trailed by the
respective banks because they are
curious find out how many have gone to
the BJP and who has donations to the
public let me finish
I will Eadie you want transparency I
want transparency who donated related we
are concerned that we have got a
legitimate we are concerned that we have
by the bank first of all India I want to
stop you there I will bring in the rest
of the panel let this be cash here we
are not going to argue mr. election
coalition calls this method non
transparent the Election Commission
calls this method non transparent why
did the government go ahead in spite of
warnings from the Election Commission
that's the question we are asking today
because if it's non transparent to the
Election Commission that's good enough
for me I'm not going to argue with the
Election Commission you've told me
several times over the last two weeks
that what the Election Commission says
is true karenann 'they do you believe
that the government should have paid
heed to what the Election Commission has
said essentially what
interfere and when it came out it was
somewhat surprising that the entire
media and you know the entire opposition
was not in huge uproar at the time right
and when I saw this because what it does
is that it takes as mr. Gore says the
money gets sanitized right the money
gets disguised and sanitized so what
used to be suitcases that went to
ministers houses in order to fund the
party have now become so-called
electoral bonds because now any company
whether its foreign where there is a big
Indian company whether they dirty where
they clean will now fund the majority of
the election so whoever wins and now we
know that elections run very much on
money so for example in the last
election we saw on one day the current
prime minister on every single front
page right so therefore what happens
when you get the money from you you're
beholden to those companies what happens
when you are beholden to those companies
there are changes to environmental laws
which have happened in the last five
years they are changes to and this is
before even the bond system came in
there are changes to pro-poor policies
there are changes to policies that would
benefit the citizen in favor of large
companies and therefore the result now
is the kind of crony capitalism that
suffers also from a complete lack of so
now nobody knows where the you know if
there is a anti citizen policy happening
nobody will know whether that anti see
anti citizen policy is happening because
the party in power was funded by the
company that it is benefiting now this
is something that was done in a money
Bill and so therefore it was pushed
through the looks of high doesn't have
to go to the Raja somehow the money Bill
there was no reason it had to really
happen like that and the second thing is
that if you look at or if you look at
examples around the world for example
there was a lot of outrage in the United
States because of super PACs because of
political action committee yes yes and
which are you know where companies can
give
money and the you know both can be
funded through the super black there's a
lot of outrage around it however even
there there is transparency nowhere in
the world as far as I know is this kind
of dark money allowed under cover of you
know complete blanket secrecy yeah and I
think this is possibly the most the
biggest problem yes in one of our the
biggest problems in our polity today and
I really really hope that the courts are
able to intervene in time to to deal
with it it's not that true you not be a
anti citizen a solution joins us right
now I was able to shine but you should I
will come back to you mr. Bhushan here's
my question miss Cara Donnelly just said
that she hopes the Supreme Court
intervenes in time but the money has
already arrived into the accounts of the
political parties what would that
intervention actually be can the money
be returned can the guy can these
parties like the Election Commission has
said encouraging transparency can they
be required to declare the sources of
the funds would that be the transparency
that the Indian water deserves at this
point Prashant Bhushan yes that's
something that the court can do that is
to make an order saying because the
banks would know and therefore the
government would know but other than
that you see the amendments which have
been made in the Companies Act in the
Income Tax Act and the representation of
people Act are all for ensuring that
there is complete anonymity that neither
does the company have to declare in
their accounts as to that they purchase
the electoral bonds and who they gave it
to nor do they have to disclose it to
the income tax nor do they have to
disclose it to the Election Commission
so these are just like notes like bank
notes of one crore rupees or 10 lakh
rupees because all that
electoral bonds that have been purchased
so far are only in these two
denominations of 1 crore or 10 lakhs and
about 2000 crores have been purchased so
far and given to political parties and
95 percent of that have gone to the BJP
alone so we have been saying that this
paves the way for straight kickbacks
being given to the ruling party by
companies who are beneficiaries of that
of various favors for example if the
Dassault company wanted to give a
kickback to the BJP for their a file
deal they would all that then would need
to do would be to open a subsidiary in
India and through that by electoral
bonds and give it to the BJP and nobody
would know that a thousand two thousand
five thousand crore kickback has been
paid to the BJP for securing the raphaël
contract because they have
simultaneously with this electoral bond
scheme they have also amended the
foreign contribution Regulation Act to
allow subsidiaries of foreign companies
also to donate to political parties and
simultaneously they have also removed
the limits on the amount of donations
that companies can give to political
parties earlier the limit was seven and
a half percent of the annual profits yes
now that limit has been removed so
therefore this has this all this has
paved the way for kickbacks being paid
and we are seeing that because the
ruling party is now getting 95% of the
funding through electoral bonds and we
suspect that most of this would be by
companies Bhushan who have been given
various are the benefits from the
government how this money will come to
India from the foreign source money will
come to India so if hey I just want to
also a subsidiary is giving you the
answer no even even
of the bank because of the FCRA
amendment mr. Bhushan mr. Bhushan is
answering the question mr. donate mr.
Ghosh listen I get income tax rebate
80cc they'll get the benefit of eighty
CC okay so I just want to point out just
one second I just want to point out to
mr. Ghosh mr. Ghosh the problem here is
not that the RBI or the bank account is
not tracking the problem here is that
the citizen the voter who's going to go
out to the booth in two and a half weeks
- what doesn't know who's giving you
money so I don't know when you come to
power if you come to power whose favours
you will be returning now it is my
democratic right to have that
information to know whether it is a
foreign company or an Indian company or
someone buying an electoral bond who
bought the bond who gave you money who
gave the Congress money whose favours
are you going to be returning when you
come to power it is my democratic right
to know that information that is what we
are talking about whether the money came
in a suitcase or in a bank account makes
no difference I need to know who gave
you money
now answer the question where is the
transparency mr. Ghosh exactly by
default by default if there is any there
is any heavy amount of donation you are
thinking that it's a it's a money for
favoritism or it's a money for for
bribing like mr. Prasad Bushnell's told
the bribing for the song after all these
are all you formatic and Alby tree
that's because a political party it runs
on donation the donation could be of
different variants and so if somebody
donates me doesn't matter that I have to
oblige no somebody donates me if you go
to any of the religious religious
personalities they also receive lot of
donation compared your God a favor or
they have to give a counter favor to
those don't know doughnuts
all right no there's not always God not
always God even there are millions of
rupees donation they are not God but
because this institution runs by the
donation of funds this basically the
institution is a non-profit earning
institution they're run by the donation
and the size of the size of the entire
population of India hundred fifty five
crore if you have to serve you need
money mint of India which are different
from the accounts of the blue team you
don't need money to serve the you guys
don't know this has my audience and we
have given favor to anyone okay I just
want to point out to our audience that
there is a difference between the money
and the budgets of the Government of
India after the citizens of this country
and the money and the budgets of
political parties so what we are talking
about is funding that has gone to the
BJP headquarters and not to the Finance
Ministry which is used to run the
government so please don't think that
this donation is being used in any way
to feed the poor and to look after the
sick amia greek of the congress party of
the world one second occupies the
largest party of the world till you
should still do you should still
disclose where your money comes from
imean trick of the Congress party is it
not true that back in 2016 area had
filed a case with Delhi High Court in
Delhi High Court found the BJP and the
Congress party guilty of violating the
foreign the FACA Act the act of foreign
donations to political parties from a
company called Vedanta the Congress
party was found guilty it was only after
that that the Parliament then went ahead
and I'll say this slowly so my audience
can all pick it up the Parliament went
ahead and amended the foreign
contribution Regulation Act
retrospectively to 1976
making all of those dealings legal and
the Congress supported the BJP because
what's good for the goose is good for
the gander and everybody is happy is
that not true miss yang make you are
part and parcel of this
you support the BJP in this changing of
laws for political funding referring to
the Delhi High Court judgement yes the
Delhi High Court had come very heavily
on both the BJP and the Indian National
Congress and has given a lot of
observations about the funding that
happened to both the parties during that
time when you're talking about the
earlier situation before the amendments
I think there was a disclosure clause in
the Companies Act and all the donations
that came to the political parties by
way of corporate funding was disclosed
but you see in September 2017 when the
four amendments came as earlier
mentioned by mr. Bhushan under the
Finance Bill because it was introduced
as a money Bill and it came before the
Lok Sabha and it never went to the Rajya
Sabha because it was a lot of protests
and those objections were never taken
into account because it was put as a
money Bill and all the amendments came
through so thereafter I think you can
see what has happened that the
ninety-six percent of the donations I've
gone to the BJP of the electoral bonds
and there's practically no transparency
anywhere and the Companies Act has been
amended the FCRA has been amended the
Income Tax Act has been amended and so
you can see what is the result yes of
course the Election Commission did point
out to the government but even that was
not taken into account the opposition
parties also raised the voice but
because it was a money bail antico the
Lok Sabha had the majority of the BJP I
think it just went to and you can see
even of the YouTube that we have all
been protesting and been asking for a to
be heard
yes I I know that the Delhi High Court
is happy but then it was at that time
you know the amendments were not there
and if I may ask because Parliament for
us but Missy Agni my question to you is
this the Congress party has received a
little over 200 crore rupees or 2
billion rupees by electoral bonds if you
object so fiercely to the lack of
transparency why don't you make it
public make the names of your donors
public
yes of course our hours is I think
absolutely public and transparent I
think you are asking to the party which
has made everything quite public you are
not asking the BJP a power why don't you
let us know where your photo piece and I
you're not even talking about these
several loads well you'll find it on the
by I NC website I think no idea here
about all this but I do not understand
why you are not asking the BJP any
question about the 96% of the bonds
taken and why it has not even bothered
to be estimated democracy is concerned
if the BJP is worried no no if it is
responsible party and poised to come
onto the show and accuse me of not
questioning government officially don't
finish me
don't forget holding 44 number of seats
you are attracting 200 crores and
holding 284 we are having at least 1000
crores we we used to we used to serve 21
states okay
serving more than ageing all the more
reason why you should tell us where the
money is coming from mr. Ghosh you
thousand crore rupees tell me who gave
you thousand crore rupees give me the
names that's what we are talking the
moment it is coming wrong it is not what
we know that is not a wise he complained
money make not make now this is a is a
journalist who tracks any of the answers
why for mr. Ghosh convincing right - no
I suppose you'd want to listen to this
may not really know so I have I have I
have a few things to add basically can
you hear me yes now don't hear go ahead
yeah so I have a few things to add
basically the first thing is that what
what the Congress spokesperson said
about how like we have to point out two
things one the FCRA was amended twice
not once first time when it was amended
they retrospectively said that the tooth
from 2010 the donations will be valid
and that is because we danta had made a
donation in 2010 so then they had had to
amend it in 2010 then the Congress and
BJP go together to the Supreme Court
saying that the FCRA rules have been
amended so this case should be thrown
out then in the second phase they
amended it from 1976 onwards that's 42
years so it happened twice not once and
I would strongly oppose to the point
that Congress could not talk in
Parliament or could not oppose it in
Parliament because they didn't they had
two opportunities they did not do it and
it's obviously Parliament record is for
everyone to see the second thing about
about electoral bonds and transparency I
highly object-- to the point that the
BJP spokesperson saying that it will
make bonds big donations more
transparent because let's buy their
argument that you know white money is
coming in and you know through our legit
channel and whatever but then it doesn't
make sense to amend the foreign
contribution Regulation Act
retrospectively then because when mr.
Kiren Rijiju was asked this question
about why they allowed foreign funding
to political parties he said now CSR
funds will come into India and you know
they will become a part of donations but
then it doesn't make sense why did they
do it retrospectively they could have
done it from that point forward which is
2017 onwards so there was definitely an
element of hiding something there and
the transparency thing that the BJP has
been saying that we have brought in this
electoral bonds to protect donors from
getting harassed now if you are saying
that you are trying to protect donors
from getting her ass then you are also
sort of raising a question on law
enforcement agencies
where you know if your donor is getting
harassed why are they a donating to
political parties at all they should be
scared and to if you are saying that
they are harassed then why aren't you
stopping it by the use of you know law
enforcement agencies you have state
governments who do that you have you
have the national law enforcement
agencies to do that but no you are not
protecting them and the third and the
sort of the most important thing in this
whole scenario is the accountability to
the people right so now as you said that
you know we should know who is donating
to political parties now I'm completely
and I'm saying this on air I'm
completely okay with corporates donating
to BJP or Congress or whoever it is as
long as they are telling us I'm okay
with that because fine you need money to
run as the spokesperson from BJP said
yeah up to a limit definitely
but I mean transparency should be there
we should know who should who is
donating to which party and at the same
time we should we should be able to also
ask the companies why they have donated
money to a political party because it is
our right as citizens because if a
political parties beholden to a company
and not their voters then what's the
point of a democracy even well I want to
ask mr. Prashant Bhushan this question
and like was raised by Major General
London one man the beginning of the show
member of Rajya Sabha Najib Razak has
written a letter to a Venkaiah Naidu
pointing out that the government
misrepresented or effectively lied to
Parliament saying that it had not
received any formal communication from
the Election Commission but now we know
that the Election Commission had written
numerous letters to the Ministry of law
and the Ministry of Finance telling the
both of these ministries that it had
concerns about the changes does this
qualify as brief of a breach of
privilege mr. Bhushan and what would
that mean for this government
well that's certainly a very very
serious matter and there is no doubt
that they lied because I have seen that
question and answer in Parliament where
they said that the Election Commission
did not object to these electoral bonds
which turned out to be totally false
because they're after the letters of the
Election Commission came out in the
public domain which showed that prior to
that question and answer in Parliament
Election Commission had raised very
serious objections about the non
transparency involved in these electoral
horns I'm not sure whether it will
qualify as a breach of privilege or not
but it's certainly a very very serious
transgression of of parliamentary
behavior now there is another thing that
I want to point out faith there is
another petition which is also in the
Supreme Court along with this petition
challenging electoral bonds and the
retrospective amendments to the FCRA as
well as the removal of the cap on
corporate donations there is a second
petition where we have said that
political parties must disclose all
their income which includes all their
petty cash income because even before
electoral bonds there is a route which
has been allowed to political parties to
just say that 95 percent of their funds
are coming from petty cash donations of
less than 20,000 rupees each which has
now been reduced to 2000 rupees the
reduction from 20,000 to 2000 makes no
difference because the political parties
do not disclose are not obliged to
disclose how much donations and what
denominations they have got in cash they
just say that we received 1500 crores in
petty cash of under they used to say
under 20 thousand each
now they say under two thousand each now
our petition says that this has allowed
non transparency of political funding a
lot of black money comes in to political
parties and
through this route and therefore they
should be obliged to disclose every
rupee that they get from which source
they have got etc when the Prime
Minister said that he hasn't introduced
the monetization to make a cashless
economy I can understand that every
citizen cannot become cashless because
many of them are illiterate also they
can't do everything through bank
transactions but at least political
parties can be made cashless they can be
obliged to take donations only through
banking channels they can be obliged to
spend money only through banking
channels but that has not been done and
instead of that a a non transparent
instrument of taking funds even through
banking channels like electoral bonds
has been introduced I mean they have
gone absolutely the opposite way instead
of making political funding more
transparent they have gone the opposite
way in fact there is another problem
with our election law that there is no
limit to the spending by political
parties there is a limit to spending by
candidates but no limit on political
parties yes it's high time that limits
were introduced on political parties
spending for elections also absolutely
up kirtanananda quick question to you
you would you hope that the government
or that the Supreme Court at this point
when you say it it does intervene do you
hope that the Supreme Court would then
instruct political parties to make all
of the information on donors public you
know I strongly hope that it not only
will it be possible to make the list of
donors public but that also that there
will be a way with some kind of limits
not only in receipt but also in spending
can be instituted
of course it sort of depends on the
technicalities of the prayers that are
currently before the court but in terms
of a democratic hope I think that is
something quite important because you
know what we have our case coming
in possibly in April it was directed by
the Chief Justice that it came up in
April this is the Popol case the
curative petition to look at the
compensation to whether the compensation
is to be increased or not now some time
ago there was money from Dow Chemicals
that is the new entity of UCC Dow that
is now merged with DuPont Union Carbide
taken by the BJP now they say that it
was not a large amount and that it was
given back today
if Dow and DuPont have given large
amounts and they would have an incentive
to give large amounts to the ruling
party or whoever they think the ruling
party is going to be then that would
directly affect the government's stand
in such a case I'm just giving an
example in such a case and some of the
worst of citizens in our country would
therefore would thereby then suffer
these are the kinds of in justices that
have the risk of getting deeply
perpetuated in which is electoral bonds
be allowed to flourish in the way that
they have which is and we have run out
of time but I just want to point out to
a me been Yagnik there is no information
on the Indian National Congress website
about where your money is coming from
and who your donors are so you are not
any more transparent than the BJP for
that matter and we have seen like may
not pointed out that you all went to
court together and you fought against
ADR together you fought against
transparency together proving that when
it comes to money and political funding
you all see completely see the same side
of the coin it boils down to this the
Supreme Court is going to hear all of
these petitions in a couple of days on
the 2nd of April right now there are
huge large sums of money flowing into
our political parties donors who are
anonymous we will not know who these
people are
corporates foreign companies and Indian
nationals we don't know who these people
are we're talking of upwards of a
thousand crore rupees what is the risk
for you and me
when a political party accepts a large
amount of money from an individual or a
company or a foreign entity it will be
obliged to return the favor in changing
laws and making laws that suit these
people when they come into power
that's called crony capitalism you may
or may not be able to stop it but we
should know about it when we go into
what we should know where the money has
come from and which corporate has helped
her is helping his political party fight
the election by knowing that information
it will put us in a better position to
make our decision when we worked that is
the very basis of democracy we appeal to
the Supreme Court to intervene and make
sure that as citizens of this country we
have access to the information that
tells us where the money is coming from
who is funding our political parties and
whose favors are they're likely to be
obliged to return if and when they come
to power

the season it's already creating
headlines first big IPL controversies
yeah thanks to Ravichandran Ashwin now
what he did yesterday are on the crease
has clearly sparked a massive debate I'm
sure by now you've already heard the way
he carried out that run out of Butler
now the fact is is it's a term that is
called man caring which comes from a
player in a win among card who actually
first did this kind of a smart way of
running out a batsman so the batsman was
standing on the non-striker end if he
begins to walk outside and get outside
of the creased line before the bowler
has actually thrown the ball the bowler
does have the bandwidth and is allowed
to hit the bills and run out that
batsman and that's exactly what our
Ashwin did yesterday the captain for
King's lemon in the game against
Rajasthan Royals but that's triggered a
massive debate and a lot of people are
very very angry with our Russian for
doing the Russians actions were actually
this is the first such incident that has
taken place in the IPL ten years after
IPL started so it's obviously not
something that happens very very
commonly but why the outrage and is it
justified if it's not against the rules

evening Kishore Romani cricket
commentator Allen Sippy former cricketer
in Southeast Wichita a senior sports
journalist Allen let's begin with you
what did you think of assurance actions
Danby good evening first of all I was
extremely extremely disappointed very
disappointed because I was actually
watching the game I was in my home
watching the game and it was an
interesting game I wasn't even citing
any team in particular it was I was just
a neutral spectator and all of a sudden
I saw this because Josh Butler was
batting very well and as a cricketer I
was enjoying the game but then all of a
sudden I saw this action this thing that
what
Ashwin did which totally I mean I was
totally disheartened as a cricketer
because I felt that it wasn't in the
spirit of the game today we're going to
be talking about the laws of the game
spirit of the game but as a cricketer I
was absolutely disheartened because I
felt that why would somebody do
something like this for me only Ashwin
can answer this point because for me it
looked it was completely intentional
Ashwin might say it was instinctive his
words when he said to the media it was
instinctive as a cricketer and I was
watching his action I looked at where he
stopped when he was bowling for me it
was completely intentional I'm not going
to sit on the fence and say that it
wasn't because I it looked intentional
but he's the person who can actually
explain to the world that it wasn't
intentional because if it is intentional
it's as horrendous it is absolutely
disheartening as a cricketers decided
the whole world's talking about it right
now because you you want to win you want
to win a game you want to win it in the
spirit of the game ok but you don't want
to win in this manner because this was
just it was just not acceptable ok yes
and I you know that's largely the debate
the rules and the cricket laws versus
the spirit of the game Ashwin on
Ashwin's behalf this is what he has said
I don't understand where the spirit of
the game comes in naturally if it's
there in the rules it's there it wasn't
planned or anything like that it's there
within the rules of the game it was
pretty instinctive I actually didn't
load and he left the crease and that's
why I decided to do this at that point
of time it came instinctively Satish
Mishra do you understand this outrage
and what you know even Allen sippy is
saying that he shouldn't have done that
because it goes against the spirit of
the game yeah very much
I was in one Kadesh cerium covering them
match and what we have seen and what we
all discussed about that is was that key
why this hue why we once one way we are
talking about that game should be played
within the rules combat occur to hang in

idea okay listen we can't a monarchy
able to say yes yato loki according here
up spirit of the game key back you up
here just because was it because it's an
indian cricketer who's doing that I just
want to also point this out of course
all of you will know this but for our
viewers as well that when we know man
card who was actually
first person to run out somebody like
this and which is why this entire action
is now called monk cutting after him but
he did this in 1947 it was actually Don
Bradman who came out in his support and
Don Bradman that at that point said for
the life of me I can't understand why
the press is questioning his
sportsmanship service Turkish owed me
money why are we even now these many
years later questioning his
sportsmanship if the law allows it you
know the game of cricket is not only
played according to the law it is the
British game the British have an
unwritten Constitution for their
politics they also have an unwritten law
in this matter I am surprised that
nobody has brought up the whole underarm
bowling action under our bowling was
legal up to the time that Greg Chappell
asked his younger brother Trevor Chapel
in a triangular series to bowl an
underarm ball to McKechnie of New
Zealand for one reason only because he
needed five runs of the last last ball
and he should not get it the whole world
came down on him I was also on TV and I
was asked what I thought of
I thought disgusting I said there is no
question of and you could have said that
it's within the rules
no man kidding we know very well that if
you start it I could counter forget
about yesterday I could tell you about
today there were at least six times
once when Harbhajan was bowling and
Harbhajan stopped to look at the batsman
it's all in context of what happened
yesterday but he didn't knock the bales
off
I have seen a thousand matches in my 45
years of cricket and it's a very rare
very rare case where people resort to
marketing to get the opposition out
cricket is a game that is played
according to traditions the traditions
say marketing is against the spirit of
the game
it also says bowling underarm is against
the spirit of the game there are lots of
other things for example
incident I remember now this particular
thing was I was watching a match in the
Caribbean
when Tony Gregg and Alvin Kalicharan
were involved Gregg what he did was last
fall of the day and Cal ichirin played
it played forward to it and started
going off the field
now the technically dumper had not yet
called Stubbs now what happened was Tony
Gregg threw the ball at the stumps stood
there appealed mysteriously and said
he's out now he was given out according
to the umpires but the whole done a riot
blew up they were going to be killings
that night it was so bad so violent that
I I remember I felt very very scared to
be there but the thing was that the next
do you know what was the result the same
ICC was consulted and I see she said you
will continue the match tomorrow and
Kalicharan is not out and the result was
reversed now let's go let's be pretty
clear on this there are certain rules
that that may exist in on the statute
but it doesn't mean you quote them I
mean if somebody had said in the
beginning of the IPL if one of these
gentlemen had said the in the IPL rules
committee that you can do this and we
fair enough sate I don't say it's in the
rules when it suits you
dr. Soni let me come to you do you agree
we must Sony with what we sure will be
money is saying because the fact of the
matter is it's in the rules the rules
were really looked at in fact there was
a change made to this specific rule in
2017 that redefined at what point of
your bowling action at the beginning of
the end can you still you know run out
to the non striker so obviously it's
people know about it it's in in in their
mind they have reviewed it as as V
Sanders 2017 so why shouldn't it be used
well I am very
I am NOT with Kishore ji on this issue
I am absolutely clear if it comes in the
rule you have a legal right to do it and
with a t20 game which was so closely
fought yesterday if Jo's Butler was one
carried out is part of the rule and it's
a it's a tough game it's a very close
game I traditions have to be there in
Test cricket we have direct many
etiquette but with this kind of games
you have to play that tough game I am
very clear I also know that Jose McClure
has been migrated out earlier on also
yeah and I think in the team strategy
they might have discussed it that if
this guy does it again please run him
out and if it has been done it is in
that nick of the moment okay you said
that he had instantly done it but I
think technically is right but if you go
by traditions of cricket then we don't
play today's twenty20 like that even we
are playing you know 10 over games now
so in these kind of games you should
know your rules you should play the game
as per rules and if I do something which
is within the rules I think I am right
oh yes you know gentlemanly game and all
things are there I agree but let me add
to this dr. Soni let me add to this and
let me take the point that you're making
across to Allen sippy another GP so if
the bolo during that action even you
know goes beyond the crease of by half a
centimeter or even less than that their
thought and power goes back and forth to
look at that and take a call on whether
it's a no ball or not if the batsman
crosses and the wicket keeper gets hold
of the ball then you can always go for
the stump option and the batsman is out
whether knowingly or unknowingly he's
gone a little ahead and gone beyond the
crease line so why is the rule different
for the non striker and why is an extra
courtesy let's even forget about the
rule let's talk about the courtesy and
the spirit of the game why is it
different for the non striker Anna well
I can explain I mean I will stick with
the doctor solely on this where he says
that it's in the law of the game he's
absolutely right there's no argument I
don't I don't intend to argue with him
on that point but if it's in the Lord
again that's fine but he should have as
a cricketer I'm saying
we're playing sport and as mr. Beebe
mummy has said we are playing sport in
and in the in a in a manner that we
should be good with people it's a spirit
that what he should have done what
Ashwin should have done he should have
warned Josh Butler and said listen you
know if you do this again I will I will
do this to you if you look at him
Josh Butler is not trying to take a
singer he's not trying to steal a single
he's just walking and he's done this in
the past I agree with the one of them
days he said earlier he's done this in
the past but he's actually taking a
stroll he's just walking very casually
out of his crease so he hasn't he's not
trying to steal a single in my opinion
if you ask many cricketers today we all
divided today on this panel we are
divided we are saying that in the laws
of the game it's right and in the spirit
of the game it's not right if you ask
cricketers who have played sport I mean
I've played the game of cricket they
will be embarrassed to do this they
might agree with Ashwin they might say
yes he's in this in the laws of game
he's right
but if you ask 10 cricketers I'm telling
you this can be with the bottom of my
heart if you ask 10 professional
cricketers would you do this would you
drunkard
Josh Butler would you take this decision
to run him out nine of the 10 will not
do this because it's embarrassing it's
very embarrassing for people to do this
type of thing everybody wants to win
it's a winners it's today it's a sport
where winner takes all
I understand that winning is everything
image winning is everything but winning
there is the way of winning this was
very embarrassing I am as is neutral I'm
not against Ashwin and neither I'm
against I mean in favor of Josh Butler
I'm just saying as a neutral it was very
embarrassing today we are talking about
Josh Butler tomorrow if just imagine if
we're at Kali was batting and somebody
from somewhere some other country did
this - Brad :
in random out this way we would go
ballistic in this country I mean it's
not argument about law or spirit
it's embarrassing to do this that's all
we're seeing
I'm just sticking to the point that what
Ashwin did was as a cricketer it was
very embarrassing for me to watch
that's all I'm trying that's my point
Mississippi's Mishra do you want to
respond to that yeah we're at Coley Coco

there you know traditions in the spirit
of the game as it was when Test matches
were actually the trend of the day are

kept in mind thank you so much for

they have been asked to ask to remove
the pictures of the Prime Minister Modi
from their real ticket and is a or their
boarding passes remember that attend the
week off or March when the model code of
conduct was imposed in the country
because of the election date so the
Election Commission had clearly asked
the all the departments to do not to not
to do any kind of advertisement of any
political party so that is the main
reason that is why that they have issued
notice and since then they have not it
removed the big names and the
photographs of the Prime Minister Modi
that is why that they have been asked to
remove it
they have also asked to remember to give

Mallya who has now accused the NDA
government of having double standards
and he has posted on his Twitter saying
that he was slammed even as he invested
4000 crore rupees into his Kingfisher
Airlines but the same PSU banks have now
allowed India's could unquote finest
airline to fail he also said that he has
placed liquid assets to pay off the PSU
banks and questioned the banks for not
taking it
Neha Kulkarni joining us on the phone
line Sonia
primarily what Vijay Mallya is
questioning is that why such benevolence
shown to Jet Airways where a similar
treatment was not given to Kingfisher
Airlines on the other hand even his best
efforts to retrieve and to actually help
the airline was slammed so these are the
questions being raised but what
significance does this have at this
point in time Neha 1 makes an important
link with Mallya through Twitter account
attention here is how the banks are
actually playing a blind eye to the
situation of births and alleviation
prices in the country on one example he
has said that even though he invested
over at least four thousand flows into
the airline to save the company the bank
is a and B same case new banks here in
the case of Jet Airways which is the
consortium of lender banks led by State
Bank of India they are playing a blind
eye they are not trying to loan money to
this and at least give it some
operational start spread the operation
to the aircraft the operations of the
flight can take the restarted what he is
trying to blame the banks here and in
terms of government for saying that why
can't the old pump with some initial
money initial set of funds into this
aircraft so that it would not feel this
distress situation and for a jettison
sir we know right now that the
government access has not given any C or
the lending money but we have seen an
initial input of rupees thousand five
hundred crores being given from the
lending banks here so this isn't
statement which Mallya is making that if
this was the situation which was
similarly for a Kingfisher why can't
they save debt now which was considered
to be one of the best
in Airlines of the country but the
finest of workforce of 23,000 employees
so he's trying to point out the same
situation of what happens with the
Kingfisher here

the party says the money will be

what we're planning to do is ensure that
a minimal threshold level of twelve
thousand rupees a month should be every
family in India should be entitled to it
and those who are not the government
would step in there and ensure that they
get that kind of money
meanwhile the BJP hit out saying Rahul

AHA user now okay number chalica para hi
no one can stop you from showing a false
dream to the people of India but they
are not going to believe the inclusive
development of then Modi government for
the poor schemes like July or na for the
farmers for inclusive Digital
development this Irishman Bharat for the
poor all are game changing size while
the people promised aim to who the
poorest of the poor sounds promising
mirror now has a few basic questions
from mr. Gandhi
how will the Congress's new ice scheme
identify the poor
how will the scheme verify proof of
income
how will the scheme assess individuals
with varying income what will the new
ice cream cost the Exchequer will the
Congress do away with other proper
subsidies can India afford Congress's
new ice cream and how will the Congress
ensure the scheme is corruption free
well very simple questions we're asking
and these are the same questions we
asked the BJP when the BJP announced
that it would put six thousand rupees a
year in the bank accounts of all farmers
how will you make sure it gets done on
the show with me right on top mr. Salman
Khurshid former law minister External
Affairs Minister senior Congress leader
who's also contesting the upcoming polls
mr. Khalid good evening and thank you
for joining us a couple of questions
about how this plan will actually play
out Rahul Gandhi was not very clear he
in fact said your question should go to
mr. Tamra mr. Chidambaram has been
unavailable to answer those questions
but I hope that you'd be able to help us
understand my first question to you is
this how will the Congress when it comes
to power if or if it comes to power and
has to bring in this plan what is the
plan really to assess income because if
you're talking about the poorest of the
country people who work on daily wage
they may or may not get work their
income differs from day to day from
month to month and they have no proof of
the income they have made how will you
assess whether someone makes less than
twelve thousand rupees a month or no
well that's quite simple I mean I've I'm
not in in the loop about the details of
of this decision this decision is a
far-reaching decision I would want to
say that this is a decision of great
courage and great foresight and great
sensitivity but the details of how you
would
plan it out the details of how you would
ensure that it works effectively are all
details will obviously have to be worked
out some of the broad parameters have
been discussed have been considered
mines which are outstanding economic
Minds have have pitched in and given us
inputs that is that they could have and
I'm certain it's certainly clear that
mr. Chidambaram will have a lot more to
say than I can at this moment but I can
assure you that this is this is
something which very seriously had to be
done
you cannot just which way and cannot
look away from abject poverty in our
country there are many ways of
addressing poverty this is one extremely
significant and courageous way of
addressing poverty and I hope and I
believe that people will support it and
we will then be accountable for what
we've said and we will deliver mr. Koo
she does the Congress party have an
assessment of what this would cost us as
a country and whether or not we can
afford it well certainly now the
question of whether you can afford
something is a matter of your
ideological commitment your human
commitment you you might say that giving
free medicine is is very it's very
expensive and you can't afford it you
might say that health insurance
insurance for agriculture you might say
that food for all these are things that
are not possible for a country at the
cusp of of being a developed country but
which has many dimensions of under
development in it cannot provide but
then you will never break out of the
poverty prop poverty syndrome we have to
break out of it we've attempted other
other things in the past and I
and I do believe that mr. al Gandhi did
speak of Mann Riga which was at that
time an outstanding far-reaching
impactful scheme now we want to move
beyond now they may be they may be
implications that will have to be
considered as we go along it's something
that we will learn from it is something
that we may discover impediments that we
will have to overcome but we are very
clear that this has to be done and it
will be done well let me let me ask you
this does this promise include retired
people people with no income people with
no pension let's assume I'm unemployed
would the government then give me the to
a full twelve thousand rupees every
month that you believe everybody needs
to have in order to live with dignity
how is this a ten I don't believe the
question is a mr. Chidambaram is just
tweeted saying are you for it or against
it are you with us
do you support it or oppose it the
question is isn't it unfair to expect
people to support or oppose without the
details we don't know how this is going
to be implemented you don't know we
don't know how you are going to identify
no no the people who deserve the money
is going to reach their bank accounts
how do we support it without the
information mr. Kashi
absolutely absolutely
si absolutely you're right you're right
and more information is going to come
please don't forget that our manifesto
hasn't yet been issued please don't
forget that we are going to branch off
into the entire country we will span out
into the entire country and we will
bring more details out people will be
specifically briefed they will be given
details they will be told to go out to
the country and tell people and we will
ask we will be asked questions as we go
and as we go forward you are asking us
questions today when it's just been
announced and I'm sure there'll be more
questions as we go along there will be
experts there will be people who are
skeptical about what we are trying to do
and they will ask us questions we will
be fully prepared we will answer those
questions we do realize this is election
time and we do realize that election
time you must not mislead people and
therefore we will not we will give them
as much in
nation as we readily can at this moment
but before a scheme is finally
implemented when you're in government a
lot of other things need to be done and
they will be done but the broad
parameters of how we will achieve it how
we will ensure that this is not a pipe
dream is something that we will
definitely tell the electorate but
sukoshi work back of the envelope
calculation mr. Rahul Gandhi announced
that this money would be would reach at
least 5 crore families and they would
get a up to 72 thousand rupees per year
per family now this would mean a total
expenditure of 3 lakhs 60,000 crore
rupees at the upper end do we know where
this money would come from mm-hmm well
where does money money come for anything
I mean money does come from the
Exchequer which is then funded by by
income tax which is funded by indirect
taxes which is fund fund fund funded by
export export says etc so all that has
to be presented in a budget if you need
the money you've got to show it if we
were able and we want because we didn't
have time if we were able to implement
the food security there would have been
a larger amount than this required we
would have still done it so we do a huge
amount we went all the way up to 72
thousand like crows as far as as far as
Mon Rica was concerned but we did it
nobody could have imagined that
something of that size could have been
implemented there were glitches there
were places where things were things
things were a little spotty but I
believe it was an outstanding program
and if we stayed in government we would
have gone much further with it mr. Joshi
it is fair at this point to say that
India's fiscal deficit perhaps cannot
afford a scheme of this nature without
giving up perhaps spending on other
things my question to you is this will
the government or will you in government
while importing this plan we draw other
subsidies from the poor in order to make
this possible or will you have to
withdraw other program
in order to make this possible because
the money has to come from somewhere
it's not it's not an unending supply of
money I know that's that's very that's
very fair
and I I think it would be it will be
uncharged tubule for you to ask me today
will you do a cut here will you do a cut
there we've also made commitments that
the six six percent of the GDP that we
want to provide for education is is a
commitment that will remain and
therefore that six percent will not be
touched but there are many many areas
where hopefully hopefully we can tighten
the belt where we can squeeze the money
out there is hopefully ways in which we
can raise more money and ultimately to
say that there isn't money in the
country would be wrong we've gone
through a very horrific exercise of D
monetization in which everybody assumed
that money was limited to a certain
extent but the money that finally flowed
back into the banking system was much
larger much greater than what people had
suggested of people had imagined so
babies forgive me for interrupting you
I'm very good system let's work out the
sums
forgive me for interrupting you you did
say it was unchallengeable of me at this
point to ask you where the money is
going to come from and where the cuts
will be made you have from a 6% spending
on education you've criticized the
current then by you I mean the Congress
party you've criticized the current
government's lack of spending according
to you on health their government's cuts
on defense you've said that there will
be no cut on other subsidy programs
available for the poor and that this
plan will be in addition to that so
isn't it being far too charitable of the
Congress party to make a promise at this
point when you don't know how you can
fulfill it or whether it is possible to
fulfill because you haven't seen all of
the numbers did see I I didn't see it I
didn't see that we were we wouldn't be
able to fulfill it we wouldn't have made
this promise if we weren't going to
fulfill it we've done broad sums now I
am saying that when you do brought some
since the experts you sit in and do it
now all of us sit in that place it's not
like Parliament sitting down sitting
around and
taking a decision but whatever has been
finally worked out the formulas that
have been worked out the contours of
this scheme will be told to those of us
who are going to go out to the country
and explain and we will explain I mean
this is really an impromptu response
immediately after the announcement has
been made but I can assure you it wasn't
made as a wild you know pipe dream that
was given to the country country it's
certainly nothing like what was promised
by the present government 15 lakhs in
your bank your accounts all the black
money coming back this is not that kind
of a wild scheme this is a very well
thought out remarkable social welfare
scheme things of this kind have been
attempted in places like Brazil we are
not the first country to be doing it but
I accept that this is a tough call
I accept that this is not going to be
easy but then when the chips are down
you stand up and be counted and say we
will deliver we will do it and we will
take okay whatever it takes to deliver
we might whatever it takes to deliver so
please trust us all right basically many
thanks for giving us time but I you must
die you must allow me here as a
journalist I never give in when a
politician says please trust us I will
continue to ask questions and we will
continue to ask tough questions and well
well you might we might change we might
change your mind we might change your
mind
you were very welcome to try mr. cushy
thank you for joining us on the show let
me open this up to up our panel of
analysts at this point but at Komara out
senior journalists suffer islam for the
BJP challenging sopra for the congress
you again the other will join us is well
Mohan guru Swami's are senior economists
on the panel and cm Vasudev is the forum
of finance secretary I will go to the
economists first mr. Goswami I saw you
smile well now I was having that
conversation with mr. Kashi he said very
vague things about weather how they will
identify these pick up these people how
they will actually make sure that makes
sure that the poor get the money and
where the money is going to come from so
as far as I'm concerned zero detailing
there and as a result we can't assess
this this program this is an empty
promise mr. Gerson
you know Salman spent many years in the
foreign ministry and it shows he said a
lot without saying anything the fact is
that you know the 2017 economic survey
of the BJP government had universal
basic income as a recommendation in it
and this is not a universal basic income
this is a identified basic income for a
certain class of people and that son of
ppl is concerned the government has
enough identification of people who are
below the ppl because there are ration
cards there are yellow cards and you
know the prayer the NSSO collects data
so there's very good identification of
people who fall below the poverty line
now that shouldn't be much of a problem
there would be some leakages here in
there but that will be can be sorted out
and in other with the these new
databases we've got on other and the
bank accounts or not this can be easily
sent down the line without much leakage
unlike mondragor which is a huge
boondoggle you know lots of leakages
take place and all local level
politicians are helping themselves with
it but this could be much more safer and
we also as to where you gonna get the
money every responsible political party
or to do a reason means exercise if
you're going to spend some money where
are we going to get it
Salman should say you know they're going
to increase taxes because already a rich
in this country are among the lowest tax
people in the world and that is
evidenced and and you know we have a
huge income inequality built up despite
this yes of 67 you have to pay the dues
yes but oh come on out and I'm getting
messages from my audience saying why
should hard taxpayer money be used to
distribute in this manner
this sounds communist almost these are
freebies you have to teach your man to
fish instead of handing him a fish every
day so what is your reaction to this is
it another job in
I'm not getting into the reaction part
let me first put it this is a very very
poetic thought very very romantic
thought to give seventy two thousand
five crore people in the year he's a
very very romantic thought I don't think
it is a practical thing it is going to
be a non-starter I am NOT an economist
however let at the simple calculation
show as we were discussing three point
six zero lakh crores will you spend on
this I was just looking at the India's
financial annual outlet yes and that
comes to five point nine seven lakh
crores so out of ISO nine lakh crore of
financial outlay for annum
we were spending three intend to spend
three point six that on on this scheme
then only two point three seven to that
crore they remain for the entire and
nation-building worth the spending of
the nation how do you do this and what
happens to the other other schemes
running of the nation day in and day out
before fires I am NOT saying that the
Congress it comes to power will be able
to do it in year one no but even if it
does it year two year three year four is
it possible the after saying this should
should it be so should we promise people
to pay for their poverty yes does this
mean that we want people remains power
is this is this going to encourage them
or important to come out of poverty or
you always wanted to give the crutches
from the government to so that they
remain poor and so that they remain your
slaves what does the government want it
is very serious question or is it a
tsunami Joomla well I was I was point
out that total outlay is about twenty
seven point four twenty one point four
seven lakh crore out of which we are
talking about three point six so it is
it is a large chunk of that's the total
outlay of the National Union budget let
me just bring in mr. cm+ as well mister
vassily
do you believe like do you agree with
mr. Balcombe
this is a pipe dream this is poetic but
completely impossible to execute in its
current form yeah but I want to just
preface my observations by saying that
it is really a very sad reflection and
how competitive policy populism really
is shaping the economic policies of
course in democracy politics has to
drive economics but there has to be some
balance where if you have a situation
where ninety ninety-five percent is
component is politics and only five to
ten percent is economics I think we
really need to sit up and think what we
are doing now on coming to this
particular program that has been
announced I think I would like to really
analyze it from three stand points
desirability affordability and
practicality as far as the desirability
is concerned I think people can
certainly argue that if you are going to
have income transfers to the poorer
sections of the society below poverty
line it is a good thing but then in
economics there are no free lunches
there are always trade-offs there are
other expenditures which are also
directed at the poor whether it is big
leap on ysera
investment and all those things and
education and health they are bound to
get squeezed out and if that happens
also the world over I think the
experience of other developing countries
tells us that the only antidote to
poverty is growth so so for growth it is
known that you must have investment and
for investment you have savings if you
are going to use up our savings for
consumption expenditure and giving those
of this type then what is left for
investment it is going to be anti growth
in that in a larger sense so the
experience we have to learn from the
experience in rest of the world how to
eradicate poverty we have not done too
badly today the numbers down to 20% when
it was 40 50 percent of the population
was below below poverty line so I think
desire
ability there is a question mark in
terms of affordability I feel that when
you got a scheme which is talking about
3.6 lakh crores when your fiscal deficit
is about six point seven lakh crores yes
it is almost 50% of the fiscal deficit
then what is it going to do fiscal
deficit means that you have to borrow
from the market to finance this
expenditure and if you are going to
borrow from the market for consumption
expenditure what is going to create the
capacity to repair those borrowings are
you not going to squeeze out the private
sector from the market by borrowing such
high amounts from the market so I think
affordability is a very big problem and
practicality I think it is so difficult
to implement the scheme this to this of
this type when you're saying that if
somebody's adding four thousand rupees I
will top it up by two thousand rupees or
eight thousand rupees how do you
identify it in an organized sector and
as somebody actually said what about
pensioners how do you do that so there's
so many questions on the practablity
only no I don't feel that it's a very
reasonable type of a program maybe it's
politically it is too close to the
elections so people may be feeling that
by the time people see it really see
through the finer details the elections
would be over and maybe the electoral
benefits would have been raped or
something like that but I think it has
it is not a very responsible yes and
that's an excellent that that's an
excellent statement about response so
how responsible is it to make a probe
make a promise like this and I want to
bring in the two politicians at this
point this is often Islam and charities
are a fraud yes let me stand corrected
yes I think I made a wrong calculation
or in the figures on these what I was
talking about it firstly actually is -
indeed lakh crore yes and out of which
we are spending 23.6 yes on this
it was one-tenth more than one cent will
be spending only on this one scheme yes
how responsibility is that and that's
the question we are asking all right
Zafar Islam your opening statements and
charity things are probably respond to
you mr. Salam go ahead
say there's a proverb in English old
habits die hard and bad habit never goes
these words Congress has attempted time
and again just before the election to
reap their total benefit but this will
not happen because it is India of not
1970 India of 2019 and they all
understand what is the real dynamics and
what exactly goes into it so everybody
like being ill is questioning how they
will be able to get this money from
where they will get this resources to
implement this scheme which is actually
three point six percent is 2 percent of
GDP which is 13 percent of the budget or
clay which is 58 percent of of income
tax received 68 percent of the corporate
tax 58% of yeah so it's this large
number it is not that a small number
which is which we are talking about and
we thought I mean I heard mr. Salman
Khurshid I have been on Channel with mr.
Gerron samsara with other senior
Congress leaders
I mean I was so amazed the way mr.
Salman Khurshid was responding it was I
mean as they're contradicting each other
he was speaking something else I wasn't
CNN and speaking somebody other coke
person is speaking exactly taking a
different view than what mr. Gerron
supplier was taking taking a stand and
what was a Salman Khurshid means they
are absolutely clueless like mr. Rahul
Gandhi is today what is important that I
important for all of us to realize that
this kind of doles is not important this
is a country where they had ease they
had come up with a Mandrake ice cream
which was unproductive this dole they
were distributing we came up with with
modified mangria where this was create
to create employment where physical
infrastructure what is the difference
between this and the 6000 in your bank
account scheme demeanor field announced
no I'm coming to that I'm coming to that
see it will be very inflationary
this is 72,000 what is talking what is
inflationary unless you create a job and
fit 8 it is where it is productively you
this money if it is not productively use
it means that it will only increase
inflation and the entire nation will
fund this scheme not the government and
this is something wait they must realize
that's why mr. Salman Khurshid was
coming it was not giving any number
because he himself was the BJP announced
that we said we'll give you six thousand
rupees a month the Congress has said we
you said six thousand rupees a year
they've said six thousand rupees a month
no what is the difference tell me other
than the fact that these are empty
promises six thousand a month which
translate to a certain number which
actually when you see the when you see
the calculation of fiscal deficit you
actually take into account and yet the
fiscal prudence what you are maintaining
you will be able to maintain with minor
adjustment but let me tell you what he
wants to do they will actually let me
ask two things let me ask very simple
thing today what is the total budget or
level how much is the committed cost how
much money goes into servicing their
debt if you start borrowing more debt
means you will have additional burden
for the future generation you know this
is a first and we just came out of a
discussion where we were talking about
how this government is given Jet Airways
another 1,500 chloro peas with no hope
of getting it back at all so there is
blame on either side but Sharon Singh
Safra so far let me put into a nutshell
what the panel has said it's not
granting at one time it's not is not a
one time cause fair second second to
challenging sopra chancing Zara Rahul
Gandhi's announcement is not practical
it's not implementable it's not
responsible its
anti growth and it's harmful to the
country and these and and this has come
and I'm not counting what suffer Islam I
said these are all independent voices
who have said that my question to you is
this is this simply mass electoral
bribery what you are saying is this what
for me I will give you money
in your bank account every month this is
the kind of thing the Election
Commission should prevent political
parties from announcing mr. Chan's
examiner no no not at all say I don't
agree with you because chagawo Gandhi
has said that we have walked on all the
modalities of this shows that having
bringing in front of the public
in the days to come know that you have
worked on that you're not sharing with
us
I mean Rahul Gandhi in his press
conference says if you have further
questions asked
Chidambaram the mr. Chidambaram has not
been reachable you've got the entire
media running around in circles looking
for answers
that nobody has for us what is this if
you have the answers announce it when
you have the answers and when mr.
Columbo is in town and available to
answer the questions how can you see at
a press conference ask mr. Chidambaram
and such Adama was not available
everybody else says we don't know the
answers will tell you in a couple of
days if you don't have the answers don't
announce it for a couple of days
what is going on here why can't the
Congress be more responsible with the
kind of announcements that you make if a
hey hey we are very responsible party
and you should not be impatient we will
definitely tell the country let me tell
you whether you rightly ask the BJP
spokesperson now that YB when BJP is
implementing that 6000 rupees scheme
what is the difference between the
actually I tell you the difference
between the two and why BJP is under
tremendous pressure because they have
they have addressed please don't
interrupt me let me answer you never
interrupted anybody else listen so so
BJP has got a scheme which was only for
the rural population of for the farmers
whereas Rahul Gandhi has brought in a
scheme which is also for the which is
also a risk and deficit number here the
be calculated this is a scheme Baba see
see similar apprehension superior a
similar apprehensions you bought in when
I got rented by when I
mr. sopra mrs. opera I have a couple of
questions for you one second one sit
don't tell me about the BJP I don't need
a lecture on the BJP from the Congress
representative mr. Sabourin here are the
questions
how will the Congress identify the poor
mr. Chopra suffer Aslam will talk mr.
actually let me let me just I'm sorry
you can ask me you can ask me hundred
questions miss together thank you
actually so we have a lot of questions
on this channel and nobody's been able
to answer them miss together the
questions are how will the Congress so
how does the Congress intend to identify
the poor in the country they've said
fundamentally that they believe that the
ideal income for a family should be
twelve thousand rupees a month anybody
making less than twelve thousand the
Congress will give the difference or the
government at that point we'll give the
difference of six five four thousand
three thousand interest rate into the
bank account first question how will
they identify the people who deserve
this help second question daily wage
laborers who make three hundred on one
day two hundred on another day and
nothing at all on the third day how will
they show proof of that income or the
lack of it how they make sure that there
is no corruption in this and there's no
wide-scale leakage in the system and
finally where will the money come from
to see other I've had no luck whatsoever
in getting answers to any of these
questions have you had any luck fail let
me begin by saying that these are
absolutely well heed and vital questions
that they must be debated and the fact
that we are debating these questions is
the biggest positive news of the day we
are not counting how many people died
how many terrorists died in balla court
we are not counting the number of
aeroplanes we are counting we are
debating and discussing how poverty
should be addressed and that to my mind
is the singular contribution of this
announcement that debate on election is
back to basics this doesn't mean that
Congress has answered a single question
of these the questions that you've asked
let me try and say what I understand so
far from public
because that's the only way I think it
is not a stop of skin in the sense that
in each individual family's case that
income will not be assessed to my mind
it's a straightforward simple slab flat
declaration scheme which says by some
mechanism the bottom five crore families
will be identified the poorest and then
each of them will be given six thousand
rupees a month seventy two thousand
rupees and a year that's going to be
this flat scheme the question as you
correctly asked is how do you identify
how do you target now mind you this is
not the first time we are facing this
problem
ayushman bharat after all is a scheme
that targets the bottom ten crore
families how do they do so not quite
efficiently but we are slightly better
than we used to be ten years ago in
terms of targeting the cause of SES the
the the survey that took place in 2012
the semi census that took place so we
are slightly better but we're not quite
there
so targeting will be a problem leakages
will be a problem corruption and
misidentification is bound to be a
problem as is the case in almost all the
schemes of targeting the poor in this
country this one is not going to be an
exception the two other questions we
should be asking is whether this scheme
will replace some of the existing
schemes for the poor for example food
distribute fuel subsidy house subsidy
various other kinds of subsidies or will
it supplement if it replaces it is
something we should be concerned about
if it supplements then we should ask the
final question where would the money
come from the approximate cost would be
3.6 lakh crore rupees a year it is
doable please remember way that this is
approximately 3 lakh crore rupees is
approximately tax forgone for the
corporate sector every year which is to
say the government says to the to the
corporate you owe us this much text but
we you know forego it so yes if you can
forego this much for the corporate for
the rich then you can probably take it
out for the poor as well but it is
important that we should ask where would
these provisions be made from would it
lead to greater taxation if yes the
Congress should say it open
publicly honestly I'm very happy that we
are asking these questions questions
that were not asked to mr. moody when he
said 15 lakhs of k account me questions
that were not asked to mr. Modi when he
said doubling of farmers income for
which we have zero mathematics even
today questions that were not
sufficiently asked when they said six
thousand rupees to every farmer but we
ought to discuss it we ought to
interrogate and to my mind this
interrogation and serious discussion is
the very heart of democratic elections
so I'm a little happier today than I was
yesterday simply because we are debating
something real and substantive we've
unfortunately set the bar in that case
very very low base together that we
should be demanding more from ourselves
and from the political discourse but I'm
going to take this back to Bhuvan guru
Swami and and cm+ mister vassily I see
your hand go up do you want to respond
to you again three other that this is
doable and hence it is something we
should be considering mr. Vasudev first
no you know it's a certainly a good
thing that we are discussing but as long
as the D it was a proposal on the table
for discussion but here something has
been announced so it is a little
different from discussing a proposal in
that sense no I was trying to say that
when somebody was trying to compare the
scheme which the government has
announced with regard to these small and
marginal farmers that 6000 rupees scheme
and what is the comparison between the
two I think that scheme is I think
directed at small and marginal farmers
who are easily identifiable who was
names are there in the land records and
I to my mind the idea of that scheme is
that small and marginal forming in India
has become unviable and therefore this
little amount of money can shore up the
viability of farming by the small and
marginal farmers don't have viability is
unaffected
what about landless farmers the really
poor farmers are the ones who don't have
land you need to need to you need
covered they get nothing yeah there
should be somewhere some mechanism to
try to yes yes mr. Rostov sorry no I
know I was saying that in the
agriculture sector the real problem is
arising out of the fact that we've got
60 percent population dependent on
agriculture which is today contributing
to only 17 percent or so to the GDP so
this is certainly not sustainable that
sixty percent people are dependent on
something which is contributing only
seventeen percent of the GDP so this is
basically unviable operation especially
for the smaller marginal farmers okay so
therefore anything which can be done to
shore up the viability of this formula
to the scheme announced today minimum
income support this is a totally
different concept yes coming back to
this came on guru Swami please mongrels
for me do you agree with your gain three
other that this is doable and we should
consider it you know of course it's
doable if any government sets up his
mind to do something which is laudable
like this it's doable but you know
consider the fact that we spend eleven
point four percent of our GDP on
salaries for government employees twenty
three million people who are employed by
the state at all levels account for 11.4
percent of GDP and it's quite rich that
you know my friend was who they who what
we work together says that you know is
unaffordable when when twenty three
percent wage increases announce but
Jaitley he said consider the pump
priming for the economy these guys will
get more salaries they're going back
more refrigerators more cars is good for
the economy now I think by using that
same logic if you put five million
families you give you give them 72,000
clothes certain four thousand rupees a
year not all will get seventy two
thousand some might get less so you I've
got a figure of about 1.6 percent of GDP
on this then you know consider a bomb
they'll buy more soap they'll buy this
and that'll to give a boost to the
economy when you give government
employees who are the highest paid
income earners in this country you give
them a wage increase of 23% then you say
that you know this is too much I find
that very rich and you know tax for God
is not 3.6 like cross tax for gondol
exemptions given to corporations is
almost 6 like crows I think we can get
some of that money back rich people also
get lots of exemptions they don't pay
taxes a lot of leakages collect more
taxes set more targets with income taxes
by books and you know go chasing after
them I think texts we under collect but
almost 50 to 60% so you collected money
you know so you get a more efficient
government more streamlined and as far
as identifying poor people we have
enough records in the country to
identify possible we've been giving
subsidized rations we've been giving all
kinds of subsidies to poor people
through housing all kinds of things for
a long time we have enough data there
now the question is how do you figure
where a man is getting six thousand
rupees and therefore is entitled to six
thousand rupees or how is he going to
get you know whatever what that is
something else which has to be worked
out and I'm sure with with with other
and all the modern systems we have now
we'll be able to work it out it might
take time but we'll be able to work it
out but doesn't mean you don't try it
don't give it away like as you know I
give away like you did for McGregor you
can you should work hard on this
you should decent to less government and
do it it can't be done it shouldn't be
done
I already give it one second saying
surprised if you have an answer to how
these people will be identified and if
it will be a flat transfer not income
linked yes II like mr. guru Swami gave a
couple of examples that various schemes
have been continuing and also the
ayushman bharat scheme they have
identified people likewise let me let me
bring to the state level where we have
lot of pension hugeness
now in these pension eugenia
whether that is the sanjay gandhi
pension huge now maybe pradhan mantri
pension huge nah they have already
formulated a pattern where the people
have been identified
now people when they are there have been
already identified the same parameters
can be used for this scheme so I feel
where there is will there is way we have
a will to do we had a will to bring in
Monica is the actual modality of the
scheme or are you are you making are you
are you guessing here mr. safron you get
it is this the actual modality of this
scheme or you just no I'm not giving us
an exam giving you the names also yes
I'm I'm saying yeah no no I'm not giving
an example as far as the identification
is concerned now the state governments
as well as the central government
agencies have already identified a big
chunk of poor people they have been
identified under various pension schemes
under the ayushman
bharat scheme or various other schemes
so similar parameters it's not a job
which we have to start from zero from
ABCD it is you you agree that the
identifications already been done and we
have enough data I'm saying that you
even if the if identification has been
done you should come before the public
you should come before the people what
I'm asking turns in separa is a good
friend of mine is that if this car if
this bird had come from anybody else I
would not have taken it seriously but
since it comes from the probable time
mister candidate of the nation then one
has to take it seriously if he makes
this step of say announcement like
Caribe a talk announcement of Indira
Gandhi if he does this now then he it
has to be coupled with the skin yes some
detail details some of the thing has
come and how would you think that people
there to keep as a serial bottom doesn't
meet you what is that do you believe how
irresponsible jaren Singh chakra is a
prank guy
on the screen and if a charity suffers
going to come and give it a give us the
information at nine o'clock why didn't
rahul gandhi announce it in the evening
when he announced it why this shying
away or does he I was deemed auto-adjust
yes should his mouth out but I am NOT
ready to believe that because he is the
tight end of of Prime Minister
smoothness to take this more serious way
of reading I thickness were to take more
seriously
once one second months I can i I just I
just wanna okay very quickly siphon
Islam very quickly please I've almost
run out of time go ahead yeah see I'm
not overly concerned at this point at
this point of time I am not overly
concerned about they whether they'll be
able to identify or not identify assume
let's assume for a moment that yes they
will be able to identify the poor but
more concerned about the statement made
by congress spokesperson and mr. Salman
Khurshid that mr. Salman who she said
that we will ensure that some of the
expenditure will be reduce so basically
they are saying the revenue expenditure
will be curtailed I don't know how much
Headroom we have he didn't say that he
actually said but it's unfair to ask me
if we will make cuts because we are not
in a position to answer that question I
just want to give the final word to yoga
in Riyadh of misty other specifically to
do with identifying the poor at this
point and most of our poor our rural
poor we have open for there might be
easier to identify drew rapport and to
make sure that they get the money let's
hypothetically assume that what what
we've been told in patches so far is
true are you convinced with what you've
heard so far that we have enough data in
the system and it predict it can be
useful a fee we need more details Fay we
need more details you are absolutely
right to demand more than we know when
mr. Romm Gandhi announced it first time
towards the end of January there was not
even a figure there today we have a
figure we don't have mechanism
should demand it and that's what
elections are all about to my mind in
terms of model justification this kind
of a scheme is certainly morally more
justified in mr. maan guru Swami pointed
out more than seventh pay Commission to
government salaries to employees it is
more justified than the scheme for
farmers because it actually did not
address the landless in terms of its
practicability in terms of
identification identification will
happen it can happen because their large
number of schemes where identification
is happening it will be imperfect like
all schemes are most economists have
pointed out the targeting and
identification of poor has been very
uneven in this country so this may be
one of those schemes be quite accurate
yeah
is it something we should look at cash
transfers remember this is an idea which
has been discussed by very serious
economists for the last 10 years
including our own chief economic adviser
has been Subramanyam these are very
serious ideas so we should have more
debate and yes we should demand more
details from the Congress party oh very
quick yes or no answer because we've
almost run out of time do you believe
this will help the Congress in the
elections perhaps yes because this is
the way the again I am saying this is a
tsunami Joomla and even tsunami Joomla
it was but it is a non-starter we are
will be fooling people another the most
serious issue is that if this type of
work goes then you are actually helping
encouraging a rift between poor and non
poor these people will resent they
distort or social and culture of every
I'm more concern about diet okay you'll
get the rather seems to disagree but
while we've run out of time I'm simply
it's simply going to boil down to this
while the Congress has announced today
it's nice scheme a scheme that will
provide to people a minimum income of
twelve thousand rupees a month so what
this means basically in their and the
minimum income guarantee like our panel
was pointing out has been studied wise
very senior economists the idea is that
you believe that a family needs to have
a certain amount of money in order to
live in dignity
which means not to starve to death to be
able to afford food to be able to afford
clothes and to be able to afford human
dignity and if you give a family that
money that they will then be able to
feed themselves and so nobody's starving
in the country and then they can start
to fight and to work for higher things
while this is a noble noble sort the
Congress party has given us zero details
as to how they will make this happen
how will you identify these people how
will you make sure that the money is
reaching the right people
will you check on someone's income if
you're checking on someone's income what
data are you using to check on that
income someone who works as a daily wage
laborer will make a certain amount of
money one month and none at all on the
other if you're going to say people who
make more than twelve thousand rupees a
month will not qualify how will you
check that and how will you verify it
how will you make sure that this plan
like all of your other schemes doesn't
leak and there is no corruption in it
and finally where will the money come
from without giving us these answers it
is irresponsible to make the
announcement because the economists in
the country and the experts in the
country cannot assess your plan and they
cannot educate the waters and to whether
or not it is a good plan or a doable
plan or a responsible plan good for the
country and good for the citizens to
announce something today and say we will
give you the details five days from now
it's not very convincing give us the
details now until then it's just a poll
promised that we shouldn't take
seriously thanks for watching

on the debate tonight India's aviation
industries crisis is now out in the open
cash-strapped Jet Airways chief nourish
coil and his wife forced to step down
from the company board very spoiling any
type of oil both has stepped down from
the board also there were two nominees
of every heart on the board now there's
only one in nómine which is left one
nominee has agitated the board now Linda
also will also go ahead and infuse
naming nominees on the board almost two
nominees or lenders who will come on the
board the creditors most of whom are
public sector banks have kept a
legitimate self interest and public
interest in mind the self-interest of
the banking system is that the company
must survive so that their investment
remains as many as 40 Jet Airways
aircraft have been grounded salaries of
employees have been unpaid for months
but now lenders to the airline have
thrown it another lifeline bankers will
loan fifteen hundred crore rupees
through debt instruments to help jet
restore normal operations however even
with this money the 25 year old airline
will still struggle to stay afloat as it
is saddled with more than 8,000 crore
rupees of debt Mira now asks what's next
for Jet Airways why is India's aviation
sector in such a mess
all right so this is where we are with
jet airways right now more than 1
billion dollars in debt delayed payments
to banks to suppliers to pilots to
employees who have not been paid their
salaries and to the leases of a crafts
aircrafts are being repossessed by
leasing companies only a third of the
fleet of jet isten in the air jet has
canceled hundreds of flights most of its
international flight has been canceled
several of its domestic flights have
been canceled leaving passengers
completely stranded and terribly upset
the Airlines pilots union which is
throwing the the the largest tantrum at
this point is decided to stop flying
from the 1st of April April inject does
not have a plan going forward to pay
salaries before the 31st of March PSU
banks have given the airline an
additional 1,500 crore rupees Nilesh
coil has stepped down so his his wife it
currently lives in London by the way
that's something to think about
SBI has taken over the board because the
F er represented in for stepped away as
well
so effectively SBI which is a bank that
was set up as a public service to lend
money to the poor has now lent so much
money to Jet Airways that it cannot get
the money back so in order to keep the
airline from failing it is lending more
money to Jet Airways now we have to ask
ourselves whose money is this yours and
mine this is taxpayer money is it fair
and necessary for the government to be
using our money to bail out a private
airline that has not paid back its loans
what is the difference between the Jet
Airways case and the Kingfisher Airlines
case government didn't bail out
Kingfisher Airlines why are we bailing
out Jet Airways incidentally Kingfisher
Airlines at the time when things went
south owed banks 6000 crore rupees Jetta
whistles banks 8,000 crore rupees and if
the government had to work at to some
point to discover that they was foul
play that they was in some way misuse of
money Naresh Goyal is already safely in
London
which means that it is going to take us
a lot longer to get him back two
questions were asking to that is Jett
Avery's going to survive this because if
you have a hole of 8,000 crore rupees
and you're going to put 1500 rupees in
it it's not going to do too much of work
offer you too much of a solution other
than to just manage payroll for the next
couple of months secondly why is this
different from Kingfisher and why are we
paying for it on the show with me
tonight were raised the money at the
former director of Kingfisher he had a
front-row seat to what happened with
that airline Abhishek Mishra leader with
the BJP Bijan Mishra consumer activist
harshwardhan is an aviation expert
energy department senior editor at the
economic times gentlemen thank you for
joining us on the show
our ji they want to start with you
should the government be using our money
is this this is effectively our money
that is now that the PS use have now you
know actually given Jet Airways again
according to the finance minister mr.
Arun Jaitley this is to make sure that
it doesn't go completely bust and the
money is not completely written off
should the government be doing this for
a private airline for any private
company for that matter no I don't think
so more so because you had the civil
aviation minister suresh prabhu who said
sometime late around october/november
last year that this is a private company
there's a board why should the
government get involved in the affairs
or the mishandling of a private
enterprise yes and then six months down
the line you have literally as you said
a bailout from the PSU banks and now you
have a banker who's going to be in the
cockpit so I don't know whether you know
how feasible that is and at a time when
your rivals indigo SpiceJet are
expanding and they have tasted blood so
it's not going to be any easy way out
you can get 1500 crore of cash injection
that's short time short term and but I
don't think and generally this is enough
for you're not you're not convinced that
SBI the bank will take over this airline
and hire a CEO
run it you know it could mean said
that's that's a good enough solution no
it's not because airline is a
specialized business so what's going to
happen is they're going to sooner or
later run an auction process and where
they're going to invite bids so if had
it been in America it would have gone to
chapter 11 a bankruptcy court we have
seen a number of American Airlines go
you know file for bankruptcy many of
them have gone to the bankruptcy court
more than once recovered then we've seen
consolidation in India we've seen
consolidation but largely driven by egos
and not so much by business logic and so
here we sue nur or later we are going to
see an auction and somebody is going to
perhaps take it a take the entire
company or whatever's left of jet it
still has a strong brand it still has a
significant or a scale frequent flyer
program and it has some international
routes which will be of some use which
is why the Tata had explored so perhaps
somebody will take it maybe a thirty
cents or forty cents to a dollar the
banks will have to take a haircut so you
were saying basically what's gonna
happen is gonna get dismantled and
there'll be a garage sale in a way yes
so the airline as it stands today is
unlikely to survive yes it's unlikely to
survive the the sprawling operations
it's already shrunk by a third I really
don't see you know somebody you know the
jet story is already gone I mean on the
twenty I'm rolling back to that same
question the extra 1,500 crore rupees
that we've we have and when I say me we
I mean our taxpayer money has gone to
the this airline today that's just gone
down the drain now hasn't it very fast
yeah it has got another tree there's so
we've actually effectively put more
money down the drain and we very little
hope of getting any of it part Perez
what is wrong with Jet Airways because
for most of the people who are watching
right now ordere customers who may be
flying this airline it was flying full
flights it was flying around the world
it had you know it had a staff it had
aircraft it was India
most successful airline it won all the
awards for about a decade it was a good
airline I must admit that it was I think
very little of it is left okay
people have to realize that airline is
not a factory or plant which can close
down you know on off a line see already
Jetta is closing down the processes on I
would say already sixty five percent of
the airline is closed it down
you see if today 65% the fleet is gone
grounded or taken back by the leasing
companies if the leasing company say ok
we do not believe that the State Bank of
India is capable of running the airline
I want my craft back I don't want to
take a chance I don't want to keep the
aircraft in India getting a clubs from
India is a difficult job we lost
aircrafts in Kingfisher we had a problem
so State Bank of India Government of
India cannot force the leasing company
no no you have to keep the aircraft
there's very high possibility still the
leasing companies might take the across
back there's very high possibility that
the pilots might feel uncomfortable and
they think the airline will not serve it
and the pilots would leave if a large
chunk of pilots left and a large chunk
of aircrafts left what would be left to
do I mean I don't understand somewhere
it says the government is giving 1500
crores against assets I'm not sure which
assets are we talking of I'm not sure
which assets this 8,500 crore was given
against again I want to understand were
there any personal guarantees by the
promoters were those guarantees revoked
were their assets attached how is the
government gonna recover the money the
promoters nourish Roland's family of
already left from London tomorrow they
find if there's a major financial
mismanagement money was siphoned off
money was diverted like we found in the
case of Kingfisher after Mallya left how
are we going to recover that money how
are we gonna charge them how are we
gonna get these people back on board the
government should have absolutely
stopped them from leaving India there
should be some kind of check and balance
system some time ago Jetta offices were
raided I'm sure government at the reason
to raid the
offices government must have found that
there was something wrong something not
proper and these checks should have been
put in place now we are we have suddenly
woken up made them resigned today if the
government had the power to make them
design today they could have made them
resign six months back there was a race
between jerrybreeze as it is today and
Kingfisher Airlines when it was when it
over to the bank 6000 crore rupees in
which if there's more money than
Kingfisher Airlines and the other sad
part Kingfisher the stuff about five six
thousand people jet as a stuff about
23,000 people I people keep talking
pilots not getting self I'm not worried
about the pilots - pilots are a very
commodity in great demand they will get
pilots I'm worried about the trafficker
system the duty manager the security guy
the reservation subway so this is
government didn't bail out Kingfisher
the employees at the time the employee
shouted cried shouted cry the
predicament the government didn't do a
thing
the airline closed down nothing happened
and he's right I remember distinctly the
minister of civil aviation made a
clear-cut statement about 3-4 months ago
we are very clear we are not going to
bail out to support any private airlines
they have to manage on their own the
government is not going to interfere
right now still the government has
jumped into it completely see the
government may have the best possible
financial directors on the board but
they may not have the knowledge of
running in a land the government already
has an airline is already too expensive
for me as a citizen I have no interest
in Air India and I have certainly no
interested in Air India part - that's a
sad sequence why is the government using
our money to bail out database what is a
special interest in jet airways please
explain to us what is the justification
hey I am very much shocked by the lack
of knowledge of your panelists and the
question you ask really betrays that you
are interested in speculation more than
hard facts so first fact number one
Government of India has nothing to do
with this the bankers SBI and VNV so
I'll give some facts
to your other two panelists were spoken
before me the two banks SBI and PNB have
almost 8,000 CR to take back from jet so
they have 8,000 crows Depp dead now they
are the primary lenders and all the
minor lenders have agreed that yes
priety shall be given to SBI and P n
beer they can restructure the depth in a
manner or in or create new promoters
wherein they can take their money back
so P n BN s bi should get the money back
is the first priority now this has been
done by the board of SBI and p ND on
their own to get their money back
today's honourable Firenze mr. mr.
Jaitley also said that the primary
interest of the bank is self interest
which is also public interest so the
bank is preserved the money the bank is
taken back it is also the good of the
people of India
try to understand flavin Europe
deliberately will last 20 months are
kept using that array what does
government window got to do it people of
India's 8,000 kuroh which is given to
jet during the time of Congress
government is right now with the jet
with the the SBI p.m. we are going to
take back I didn't interrupt you
interrupt
no no fee let me complete say let me
complete fill it be complete I don't
know how much do you know about how a
restructuring or corporate depth is done
obviously what happened now the next
step is Naresh Goyal was as no faith
Naresh Goyal was asked to resign because
they wanted a new promoter the new
promoter this 1500 is the just - in
order to sustain the new promoter will
have to you know get fresh cash into the
company he will be done a responsible
for getting investment into the company
is generally short jet remains and
eventually when new promoter comes he
Dugger the people's monies is taken back
by his B and P and B from jet so this is
a corporate restructuring process where
a new promoter will come he will bring
fresh investment which is then the
double the the board meeting today
I wish officials don't mislead a country
now this is a corporate restructuring
procedure
the BJP has repeatedly accused the UPA
everything Minoans
and rolling over in order to make its
corporate brands comfortable process
here and SBI P will get their money back
so buffet please tell the people the
right yeah the BJP has repeatedly
accused the UPA government of
evergreening row loans or rolling over
loans in order to make their corporate
friends more comfortable how is this
instance between JJ rays and the current
government different Yaphet good
question the thing is when Congress give
8,000 Carosa to jet did Congress check
whether jet is repaying it to the banks
when those phone-banking been done to
the bank's who did did congress take
responsibility now what is happening
right now is SB npnp to get their money
back
the a town car oh they were forced to
give I had phone banking we all know who
invested in jet it was which lobby which
was supporting jet from last 25 years so
to get the money back we are 1500 crows
a to take a repay the depth back are you
sure congress spokesperson asked him why
he gave 8,000 Carosa if you are not
going to listen I'm going to stop one
second Abhijeet Burman otherwise known
as the et get a shake word run you've
been tracking the aviation say RPGs by
rigid bourbon you've been tracking the
aviation sector for a really long time
this 8,000 crore rupees obviously was
not all given during the UPA regime and
I don't the N I believe then it's really
unfair for mr. Mishra to assume that
when the UPA was around then the bank's
answer to the UPA but when the BJP is
around the banks the same Bank doesn't
answer to the oh you walked into this
one okay
mr. Mishra why is nourish girl sitting
in London if you're doing Chokey dari
yes good question
it was all planned out this issue you
see and contrary to the Vijay Mallya
issue I have nothing to do with jet and
there is coal a clear answer for them
what they do but at least Government of
India proactive the banker Falls him to
resign already the jet board is sitting
but why resolution from leaving
Billy settle all the accountants revoke
all this guarantees why did you let them
leave the country SBI and you you are
aware that the solvent is not with
defaults now leave the country why would
you just not allow knowledge to leave
the country till you did a forensic
coordinate of the accounts now let me
ask I reject this question the the
problems of the fact that the loans were
not being paid back is not something we
discovered in the last two weeks this
has been building for a while hasn't it
yeah it has it's mean the problem
started almost last year i mean sometime
around august september last year for
long there's been negotiations then the
tata
shona had shown interest there were some
private equity options that were you
know who had shown interest but
everybody wanted just one thing
get the Goyal family out then we are
coming in and willing to start a fresh
sea jet you can still revive jet you
need but a the banks will have to will
take I think so
ten weeks back you are saying it cannot
be revived now you understand what is bi
is doing good et editor you know what
that's not what we said we said it will
be can be revived at 30 cents to a
dollar or 40 cents to a dollar the new
person who will come in will will not
pay top dollars which people were
willing to six months before if this I
for decision were taken sometime last
year then perhaps the banks had a better
chance money do you believe that the
government should have ensured that
Naresh Goyal cannot fly out of the
country absolutely yeah absolutely
absolutely I am a hundred percent sure
of that fact the government could have
easily stopped and I will tell you one
thing I'm telling you now the bank's
chairmen have the power to directly
write to the immigration authorities to
stop people from the they don't know the
whole ministry rule just one letter they
would have short out and it could have
been done and what is it you are not
arresting somebody you
asking some in not to leave till you
know that there is no money and brought
this up until Abhishek Mushaf the BJP
said we are doing chalk Atari if you're
doing Chaka Darian a rich girl shouldn't
have been in London Bay John Mishra
represents citizens and consumers paid
homage to go ahead do you believe that
we're being with different rules apply
here different rules for Kingfisher
different rules for Jet Airways well you
know Faye there cannot be any
discrimination but we have to learn
lessons from the past we have to ensure
that a mistake which would have happened
in the past should not be committed
again so in my view you see what the
government realized in terms of you know
Kingfisher episode that it is always
good to understand the issues and the
challenges and see if something can
could be done to help the private sector
not to close down because it actually
directly reflects in to social causes
you know unemployment that is a lot of
you know I would say you know
degradation in their business growth so
what I feel is that let the banks they
know their business they know what to do
what is the best to be done and I'm sure
you know again we have redone about a
year back I write or earlier is being
done today no no no one minute let me
finish let me finish so I I strongly
feel as a consumer policy person that no
stones to be left unturned we must look
at all the options possible in a
business model as per business viability
and if supposing the bank has to take an
haircut then they have to forego their
profit they have to understand that they
have to do without profit so what we as
citizens have to understand that and the
cost of public good sometimes certain
decisions might be strong might be seen
to be not in favor of the citizens but
in long run
it will do good to the citizens you know
that consumers want competition I agree
I agree I agree
I say III understand from where you come
I do understand from where you come we
are all very pessimistic because we have
seen the government's not performing in
the manner we desire but let's give them
a chance both of the rest of us here's
my problem the public sector banks were
set up to to actually lend money to the
poorest of our country to service the
poorest of our country that the private
sector would not service the public
sector banks have been lending money to
people like given Kingfisher Airlines
and jet airways one doesn't know against
what assets they have lent money on what
conditions they have lent money and why
they were lending money to Jet Airways
in spite of the fact that it was in no
position to pay back now we've lent more
money at the end of the day the public
sector banks are owned by the Finance
Ministry of India they are accountable
to the Finance Ministry it is a Finance
Ministry's job to make sure that these
banks are run with responsibility 10
lakh crore rupees worth of NPS and FY 18
and the public sector banks who's going
to be accountable for the fact that that
much money of us has just simply been
lost mr. Harshman aviation expert mr.
baracs well done can I come in just one
second one second it's a harsh Vardhan
here's my question to you yeah are we
repeating mistakes of the past with this
case should nourish go l have been made
to stay in India until people got to the
bottom of why Jay Davis has lost as much
money and why public money is not being
paid back well I
direly agree with you principally
allowing a promoter to have a freezin
you have actually made him free because
you have taken over all these
liabilities and responsibilities and he
is now a free man you cannot hold him
accountable for what has been done where
is for 25 years he has been doing
whatever people are accusing him of it
could be mismanagement it could be other
ulterior motives also but principally
they are going back to the earlier
principle of seventies when they've been
the Tri wetland promoters would create
web and make it unit sick and the
government will end up taking over those
units and nationalizing them and then it
is the rightist parties which was the
most critical of the end government
policies because that time also the
question was employment question of
employment was the primary employment
then then we talk of a free economy when
we talk of deregulation you have to
realize that survival of the fittest is
the rule if if you are interfering with
the survival of fittest you are
interfering with your own policy on one
hand this government for last four years
have been a crying horse trying to
privatize Air India trying to find a
strategic investor now situation of
where India is more or less the same how
do you expect the Jet Airways would be
able to interest in English efficient
example you can't find it and west over
here and we are now able to administer
Bourget me tell you case we shall try it
you say Kings we shall kept on trying to
find investors at all that times you
know here the banks are saying we will
give you freedom Kingfisher promoter
himself was trying to offer it to
anybody and everybody nobody came
forward now coming to this injection
1500 crores it's a very small investment
because please understand that their
quarterly losses are more than thirteen
hundred crores which are only going up
now with the company which is 13 to 1500
close quarterly losses with virtually no
internal generation you know man if you
look at their depreciation and all those
things internal generation is less than
hundred crores so it's all investing or
is all like covering up the losses to
continue to survive so unless you are
looking for a good investor the only
thing here I would make a difference
between Kingfisher and jet and that is
the internal team of management the
internal team of management of jet is
very far superior than what Kingfisher
had you know Kingfisher actually was run
by virtually people who were assembled
from here and there is a long history
even in the last few months has been is
is that what the government has done is
taken over the mess and said how give it
to me now you go you go you go up Joey
I've learned in Geneva uh-hum managed
cuddling it is is that effectively what
is happened in this case yes yes no no I
think that there's the there's the most
heinous act on the part of government
government on one and they are bringing
accountability on everybody and anybody
and keep reminding people of the mistake
is narrow did 50 years or 60 years ago
and today you are allowing people who
are committing the errors are bright
under your nose and allowing them to go
scot-free how can you justify it mr.
Schroeder then you will agree with me if
there are 119 aircrafts and out of that
35 of flying it's impossible that 1500
can crore can do anything it cannot make
a dent you are on a path to disaster
humongous refunds off cancel my joke I
thousand kronor look one pilots I mean
1500 crores won't even last a few days
and with the bank running
narcissism is why I think we actually
getting impossible okay I've seen you
tell me how is it good what is the need
but we fail curated what is the cost of
getting 198 does the government have a
calculation worries they might be coming
to make the airline a saleable product
guess that nobody is lambda calculus at
1500 words it puts in a wet kiss not
possible what is the main idea each
aircraft very very very roughly very
ballpark bigger is ten thousand dollars
a day three hundred thousand dollars a
month that I'm talking about general 737
I'm not talking about that three thirty
two hundred and the larger aircraft if
hundred and ninety not sixty seventy a
class on grand performance what does the
kind of accumulated losses okay what are
you going to tell the leasing company I
am staying I'm going to I am a good
person forget the losses forget the
listen they are gonna start filing suits
of the day they realize our money's not
gonna come at they all gonna file start
filing winding of the suits how does the
staff I wanted to add to what you were
saying mr. Ashworth can go ahead I'm so
to eat leasing companies will say my
fault I love look like thing IIIi think
per ways I think no no no I I think per
ways you don't have the Apple you don't
have the knowledge and the experience of
turning around Airlines or any corporate
for that matter I want to tell you once
the promoters a change they market faith
overnight builds up the jet to be fair
has a first-rate team and I have
complete operational slaves locally it
would I am a very long time to put it
drying operations if if that is the if
the question I don't think you know you
cannot compare Kingfisher with jet you
know Jay King Fisher was a cannibalize
fleet literally no EPS were there and
you even with your efforts you could not
put it back to the operations to say for
one with the minute you start earning
money you start taking with spare parts
of other aircrafts if you have no money
to be a pilot
you mean to say they must let me just
stop you for a second obviously
obviously just one second mr. Mishra
obviously energy it is too early at this
point to know what's happening inside of
Jeremy's because parish goal has been at
the door up till now nobody's had a
chance to take a look at the books
nobody's had a chance to take a look at
the aircraft
nobody knows what's really going on my
question simply remains this until we
know what is going on and we've taken a
closer look should nourish Coyle have
been made to stay in India yeah
definitely and maybe made accountable
because this round of negotiation as I
said started from August and everybody
just had one issue that the biggest
nourish goal clearly was the biggest
asset of death for this airline he
became its biggest liability and imagine
this is the 25th anniversary it's the
longest serving private airline but it's
it's just collapsed because the whims
and fancies or one man who just thought
that he can you know he's clever by half
and he will take the system for granted
finally the music stopped but it could
have I mean thanks everybody could have
intervened
yes Arjuna and a lot could have been
saved if we had moved in and we'd moved
in slightly slightly earlier phase one
wish to go ahead hey can I come in yeah
say I you know in my view we shouldn't
jump to quick conclusions you see with
the resolution which might have been
signed between Naresh Goyal and
government of India or the banks would
allow them to you know get engaged with
him even if he may be out of the country
so there would be number of resolutions
which may have been signed by them which
we may not be privy to so the banks
won't let him go just like that
there must have been some documentation
done before they would have stepped down
so what my contention is that yes I
agree he should have stayed on on his
own
he shouldn't have left the country but
if he has even left the country with the
full knowledge of the bankers and the
financial institutions and government of
India I am sure you know certain you
know checks and balances would have been
done before he left and we could we
should come you know there is a company
we can you go through the exhibition we
have done this we have done them with
Vijay Mallya I don't even think that any
such chicken balanced egg exists so I
will tell someone you are lie off to
London and if we decide later that we no
no no come back we'll come back there
would have been lot of sense learned
this anybody know the exact line from
the past you know the engineering the
carpenter said at the same time nobody
can understand you wait for your turn
the fake give me last twenty minutes
ever spoken give me a child okay so okay
so yes that one okay so a B Shaykh
Mishra of the BJP
if tomorrow and it is very likely given
what people the panel is saying tomorrow
that they will discover that a perfectly
healthy airline that has flown for 25
years and mind you as an airline gets
older it gets cheaper to run that
airline because you start to pay off a
lot of your costs in the beginning in
the first few years if it is discovered
that there was in fact foul play or
mismanagement and a rich girl needs to
be made accountable how will we do it
now that he is in London
why was he allowed to leave the country
and not me he's a citizen because he's
not enough Afaf it don't run agenda here
the aviation expert was right mr. Hirsh
were then when he countered mr. Damania
saying at once new promoters come in
they will bring fresh capital and once
new promoters come in the state
the market value of the company changes
so I agree so first of all let me re
inform you what I have said earlier the
debate the when rich girls stepped down
the the main Clause of SBI was a new
promoter will come in the promoter will
bring fresh investment and that's why in
the rich girl was told you have to go
because we thought you going no new
promoter who everybody and that's what
jekeiti has said that our priority is to
get back the public money for which is
old which is owed to s behind PNB so we
are committed to keep getting back the
money which the public banks or haven't
yet that's a priority we'll get our
money back and we the fifty and it has
been given so that the new promoter can
coming and giving you a swindle give
them a bird they're back to as B and P
and B let me clarify that and mr. parez
the money or director of Kingfisher has
gone bankrupt she's not lectures BNP any
what to do I agree one second now a fish
a krishna let's assume let's assume in
the world of aviation heaven where a new
promoter is actually brought in which
they've not been able to do for any of
the other airlines including air india
up till now let's assume a new promoter
does come in let's assume even that
these banks SVN PNB recover their eight
thousand crore rupees my question to you
is this will there be no accountability
to Naresh Goyal for having made the
mistakes that he has made lost the money
that he has lost and brought the airline
to me it is is there going to be no
accountability at all did we just say
utter up day hamsa Malini so where is
that accountability to him whether or
not and quite well the government and
SBI might be very capable of cleaning up
the problem solving the problem saving
the airline and of jobs where is the
accountability for Naresh Goyal
but faith question is I think page on
mission house presidency I've already
said then guy has stepped in down only
today hug there has to be a proper audit
proper checking only then we can say
what has happened exactly exams to get
the money back
mr. Schroeder please explain to faith
that mr. Ashe where then is the first
problem arose over a year ago should
nourish loyal have been allowed to leave
I I personally believe he should have
been I should not have been allowed to
leave the country because besides the
accountability there are many things
where the clarification of nourishment
will be needed in running day-to-day
management in the coming months and like
we have also seen that the actual
liability which are being talked about
8,000 crores and another two three
thousand crores would turn out to be
much more than what is actually being
mentioned and the balance sheets of the
figures because once you take over a
unit of this nature the physical
liabilities turned out to be almost one
and a half times more than what is
claimed by the promoter so I think there
is a need for him to be under scrutiny
that was the wrong step but then you
know when you have already taken this
step we can only wish it with the
government and the banks all the best
that they might be able to turn around
because they have not been able to do it
for air india for so many years and only
they've been bringing in people of their
own choices will not been able to who
have been only detorri ating the
situation more and more you know well
Arijit berman senior editor with the
economic times is it likely that a fresh
promoter might bring in new cash to Jet
Airways that the government might be
able to find a buyer for this airline
having not been able to find a buyer for
Air India yes that's likely there there
would be there there would definitely be
interest now that mr. Goyal and his
family stepped down but as I keep
reinforcing if we are expecting that
banks will face no haircut then we are
mistaken whoever's coming in whether we
take it to the bankruptcy proceeding or
do a resolution outside the process
bankruptcy process nobody is going to
pay top dollars if we had done a deal if
he had was willing to actually put more
money at he has an existing partner who
wanted some exemptions but the
regulator's did not give which was again
very strange because the same set of
exemptions were given where to SpiceJet
when SpiceJet was facing similar problem
some years back which is an open offer
exemption it was not given to a Teja
this time around so why would anybody
put more money and face these
restrictions which is why Etihad is
being hesitant a new person will
probably come in will have to come in
and start the process but it's an uphill
task because as I said indigo and
SpiceJet they are expanding and Eric
they look at the fleet expansion that
they are doing and the cost structures
of jet completely haywire for a long
long time analysts have been saying this
till kingdom comes I mean jet did
nothing to fix it cost structure till it
was too late in the day we have to leave
it here because we've run out of time
but I want to thank how much was given
doing the you paid and you do a survey
and put a mirror now tomorrow please mr.
mr. Bishop mr. off the BJP you cannot
run with the assumption that when the
UPA was in government that SBI was being
controlled by government and now when
the BJP is in government that as we guys
not being controlled by government and
also that eighty thousand crore rupees
that was linked to the to jet amis as if
how much of that I mean in the last four
years how much of it has gone down in
the last four years and how much of it
was from eight years ago it's very
difficult to see but you know because
the banks keep rolling over the dead the
point being if the banks wanted they
should have had this crackdown far
sooner this problem began in August it's
only in March before election if dr.
Ajay Mehra's been made to resign I mean
what has changed in August it's only
been gone from bad to us so we've had no
learn
from digimon usernames with bank I mean
can you imagine State Bank of India will
be running an airline State Bank over
there's no knowledge Turner they're not
taking over under the bank or insurance
company how will they manage it's an
uphill task all right we have to we have
to affect is the State Bank of India
okay this is this is where it is we have
the the government of India already has
an airline and it's not making any money
it's losing money the Government of
India has been trying to find a buyer
for that airline for a very long time
and nobody wants to buy that hairlike
now effectively the Government of India
has a second airline because it is
effectively bailed out Jet Airways and
now State Bank of India is going to run
jet it is this effectively means you and
I now own two airlines neither of which
are making any money as taxpayers of
India it's not a very good idea the
bigger problem that we have to ask is
this since there's so much blood burning
over here over bringing Vijay Mallya
back and bringing need of Modi back how
is it that we find ourselves in a third
situation where one person running a
company borrowed thousands and thousands
of crores of rupees from public sector
banks owned by the Government of India
then left the country safely from London
has now resigned and handed the company
back to the Government of India seen you
run it you fix it you solve the problems
and the person has been completely let
off the hook where is the accountability
we haven't looked through the books the
government hasn't done an actual CBI
enquiry to find out why those banks kept
lending money to this airline that
obviously shouldn't have received this
money they obviously had no assets to
merit being the borrower of k2000 crore
rupees was Naresh Goyal running this
company properly was the same was their
embezzlement was there actually money
that was being moved around that
shouldn't have been moved around without
any of that information why was Naresh
Goyal allowed to leave the country he is
now safely in London like everybody else
with his friends near of Modi and Vijay
Mallya
we've had zero learning from this
I will have to ask ourselves these
questions why is it that the public
sector banks that are owned by the
government of India that are meant to be
looking after servicing and lending to
the poor find themselves in these
positions over and over again public
sector banks was strengthened after the
need of Modi case they were allowed to
actually impound passports and not allow
anybody to leave the country why didn't
they exercise that right in this
particular case why is it there with me
our citizens are being made fools of
over and over again who's going to pay
us back sister

transport rules as the license was only
valid for cabs and not five taxis my
colleague Deepak Bopanna now joining me

graph will take us through the latest
well you know it's like the deadlock is
finally ended as far as the state

although of course was pulled up over
its bike taxi the you know projects a
state come up to always maintain it was
just a pilot project in Bengaluru
letters other services like lab being
you know operating bike taxis in
Bengaluru for a longer duration but you
know it they said the state government
installed looking at you know it's
benefiting the people in the state was
you know looking it was looking at it
with a very narrow perspective now
politically as well there were a lot of
confusions that did come up after the
ban of course came in then came in a
tweet from a minister Priyanka gay going
on to say that the ban has been revoked
the Chief Minister said that the chief
secretary would be reviewing the
situation and finally today another meet
has ended by all of themselves have you
know put out a statement you know saying
that they apologize for the

Rajiv Shetty was asking for a Cola and

include Bangalore Singapore Delhi Abu

suspended remember Jet Airways is
undergoing a major financial crisis
there is no resolution yet in sight as
far as Jet Airways is concerned
let's go across to Irishman Irishman it
seems like more and more routes more and
more flights are being canceled by Jet
Airways the current situation yet it had
already and all that speak to valve on

ago since dat hot deal sale and right
now we are saying that 14 routes

operating the hello what folks say they
are not announced yet but what both say
that these routes also will be cut will
clearly be fun France that is holding
right now in Gatorade is some vegetarian
his situation is everything's by every
passing day remember the pilot
Association has the five minutes office
and there'll be a little ministry for
this image as well as the engineers
Association they have also done the same
there has been no world public authority
that's how they plan to overcome the
situation but this is infinite you keep
getting work by every person when you
can see 13 what with rules of
international arena have been cancelled
by DJ terrain right
I just know and so obviously on one hand
you have the pilot so who have
threatened that they're going to stop
flying if their salaries are not paid
you have the lenders who want an Irish
girl to step down looking for a
management change and on the other hand
there is still no clarity as far as the
resolution is concerned do we have any
estimate of how much of the fleet has
been grounded at this point how many
flights of their overall operations are
you know are still flying
versus how many are not well right now
the disc is totally silent of the
numbers of flight that have been rounded
as well as
renumber this is a operating right now
we wanted to get the exact number from
there is already working a smooth
recording a fabulous revenues but when
you Versalles has a n number of flights
we are operating as well as well there
is no clear picture from there it has
how many flights have been cancelled at
the same time if you remember that of
over meeting in the busy schedule which
was headed by the aviation minister
threat from wind whistling he said that
the airlines need to follow certain
North regarding these reservations which
are Dunkley terms of future taking
taking stock of the future scenario at
the same time there has been injustice
reaction because relative to the
government saying all those passengers
lost their money because of the advance
sufficient also they responded so there
are some there is a row of fight in
whatever you say in a jet situation they
are facing some trouble regarding
function by every passing day right I
run one final question as far as the D G
C is concerned it had told other
airlines not to increase costs as a
result of the flights that have been
grounded by jet but obviously that's not
happening because the the airline's
other airlines the costs have shot up
even in routes or they've gone up
multifold times the the price of these
aircraft and the other point that you
mentioned as far as cancellation charges
are concerned the refunds have not yet
gone back to those who has in the
situation right now also
that's why clearance is given by D Ln
some little busy schedule ministry
discharges continue to score and it
remains an important concern the DDPs
said that they have instructed the
companies but not much and have no
ground all right
tankmen will keep coming back to you as

conversations lined up for you but
before we go on to the story about jet
airways crisis let's bring to you the
latest on the mega Shivaji statue and
memorial project the ambitious and
expensive plan of the Maharashtra
government has run into trouble once
again after being wrapped by the Supreme
Court for not following due procedure
now a report in Indian Express reveals
that we may be staring at a scam
even before the project work has
actually officially started in an
express RTI query Shah said a PWD
official has sought a special audit into
what it called serious irregularities
into this project there is a part of the
letter that I want to just read out to
you and I quote with all around
complications and conflicts it has
become difficult for me to follow any
direction for this project therefore I
want to bring to you attention that the
project needs a systemic audit end of
quote what are we talking about here
what are we staring at how is it
possible that a multi crore mega
ambitious project has started off on
such a wrong and complicated note that
we are now looking at serious
irregularities even before the first
brick is laid there let's say briefly to
our guests you think Acharya
spokesperson for the BJP IC Rao
president for the AAP Li in Mumbai is an
activist joining us this evening but
first up I want to go cross to
vishwasrao Modi he's the principal
correspondent for Indian Express who dug
out this story for us and will show us
this explain to us this RTI response
that you've received from the government
what does it say and how does this work
because effectively in many ways the
project hasn't even started now the
issue has come out only because the
chief engineer of the Public Works
Department has written to the principal
Auditor General of the Maharashtra
saying that there is a need to conduct
the
special audit in the irregularities the
irregularities the chief in general is
referring to the issues raised by the
divisional Accounts officer of the
project division itself project division
ministry bhaji memorial project division
okay so the divisional accountant has
clearly stated that there are several
the code which you refer to and besides
that he has also referred that the cause
there are several India Grote's in the
project and in such a scenario it is
difficult to continue with the progress
of the project the divisional account it
is not that the this is for the first
time that the divisional accounted has
raised this query or raised the issues
he has referred to the previous
divisional accountant who wrote for the
first time in 24th July 2018 so in that
later he clearly stated that the
government's move of reducing the cost
from 3826 crore down to 2500 crore is
not as per the norms as per the laid
down norms of the CVC guidelines and
other norms specifically he was saying
that whatever the in in the arm of
reducing the cost of the project the
government has clearly diluted the scope
of work reduced the scope of work and it
hasn't given a chance to other bidders
to have a competitive rates and
competitive tender process so that's
where he the PWD engineers and the
accountants are referring to it as a
serious and major irregularity on the
parts of the government where they have
decided to go for the cost optimization
or reducing the cost of the project so
since then this issue has been going on
so that the issue first started in
February 2018 when the government
decided to reduce the cost of the
project in with negotiation with the
contractor the three meetings were held
between the contractor and the several
government officials they decided to
then they reduce the cost subsequently
after after that the PWD engineers and
the divisional accountants officer have
been writing several letters to the
seniors and to the even the divisional
accountant wrote it to the principal
accountant General in July 2018 itself
this is this is the second time in
February he wrote the latest second
letter to the principal accountant
general saying that he you need to look
into these you must conduct a special
audit and we are demanding the audit
this is what the player the account
divisional account trees accountant is
mentioning in the letter and we so this
is after that
7th of March the later of recent later
is of 26 February 20 1974 which is the
head for the Mumbai region and for the
project wrote endorsed endorsing his
views wrote to the principal accountant
general saying that there you must take
necessary action against to the points
raised by the auditor okay and that has
created a big this thinking all the PW
engineers and accountants seems to be
convinced with the fact that it is going
to be as you mentioned a kind of scam
but rather than tapping it a scam I
would say it is going to be a big mess
and a like same serious it ugly it is it
correct in fact one part of this letter
says the project has so many
irregularities that I do not wish to
take any responsibility regarding the
payment or the progress of the project
that's how much worried there so the the
reason that he has mentioned and the
raised reason that he has written this
letter is that in since January the
contractor so what has happened in in in
October so this is a big project so in
such a project the government or the
government and the contractor has to
make an agreement the agreement was
signed on 28th to June 2018
after that the government has to give a
commencement did to start the work the
commencement date was given to the
contractor on 19th to start the work was
19 October 2018 after that after that
not much work has happened at the sea or
at the ground there but contractor has
raised according this is what the record
shows that the contractor has raised a
bill saying that as per the contract
agreement the mobilization advance
should be given of 72 crores and then
the process of giving the mobilization
advance started in the project division
the file went up to the mantra level and
when suddenly the Supreme Court stopped
work came then then it is possible that
the accounts officer might have feared
or might have realized that there may be
a pressure from the higher epson and
this is what he has clearly mentioned in
the later that there is a pressure from
higher ups to give the payment to the
contractor okay due to that pressure or
fearing that pressure he wrote this
letter to clear his responsibility
he doesn't want to be the fall guy as
usually is in these larger messes and
complications that happen
you use fought the easiest and the
lowest official and pin the blame on him
and he doesn't want that yes oh gee
thank Acharya this is hugely
embarrassing if such an important
project such a big project you know
supposed to sing become the landmark for
a city of Mumbai and even before your
project has started we are talking about
serious irregularities what is the
government going to do about it no I
think as mr. Vishwa so as he as you
pointed out that you know the the
concerns have been raised the concerns
have been you know going throughout
going through the process now that it
has been raised or the you know and
asked asking for an audit
I'm sure the concern of the government
will will take whatever necessary
actually
necessary action on it has to be taken
whatever needs to be done the government
will obviously do because this is a this
is an extremely prestigious project for
this government and this normally is
extremely serious about this project if
the government is so serious about this
project how is it that everybody from
your PWD official to the super to the
high Bombay High Court are so upset with
the way you are handling this project
you've gone back and forth experts have
issues with the design of it which this
is unattainable the costs have gone up
and down the auditors have a problem the
court has a problem with the procedure
not being followed I mean if anything
just just shows that the government is
least bit interested or committed to
this project no I don't think so I think
so I think so what what what we are
really doing is we are right we are
trying to amplify a lot of amplification
is done on what I would call our
procedural issues in which come with
with with many with many last projects
what needs to be seen what needs to be
seen is how government is tackling those
issues right like like like you know we
are right now debating a lot of
hypothetical situations like what he
said but I mean vishwas said that you
know he thinks that the officer thought
that he would there will be there will
be pressure from the higher-ups we
we are not sure right we have we are
debating a lot of hypothetical situation
the fact remains that this is a grand
project this is the grand project and
sorry I am having some trouble with my I
am with my your phone but yeah I mean
this is a grant project government
extremely serious now that you know
whatever concerns officers have they
have raised it to the right authorities
authorities in the government will take
mean we will do whatever is needed to be
done on that let me go close to mr. icy
domicile I said how do you think these
are just speculations I mean we can
obviously deliberate on what caused this
PWD official to write such a letter but
the fact of the matter is the issues
he's raising he's saying that when you
have gone back and reduced the budget
from 3,800 co2 twenty-five hundred crore
through negotiation with the lowest
bidder you've not followed rules he's
saying that this entire process is
against the CVC guidelines which is the
vigilance commissioner now if the
process is not being followed on
multiple levels how do we read this mr.
Rao I think we should first of all give
credit to mr. vishwas one more day of
Indian Express for bringing out these
issues into the open secondly I want to
mention that normally the senior
officers must tell their junior officers
to follow the rules and do their work
properly here there is a junior officer
telling his seniors do your work
properly because at all times at every
stage the senior officers from the
government have officiated existing
procedures they have changed
specifications at the time when they
should have stuck to specifications
first of all they were not allowed to
negotiate with the lowest bidder now
they do that then they also allow
specifications which are affected safety
they have changed dimensions they have
removed one jetty which was for safety
they should have had two jetties one for
evacuation if one jetty
is has a problem for example when there
was an accident happened which happened
on the 24th of October leading to a
death that enquiry is now for months it
has not come out and so this is is this
the way to tackle it which obviously if
you are wanting 10,000 people to go
there every day the boat route should be
safe when four boats go one boat
capsizes and comes back with one person
dying on the route you the enquiry
should have said what should be the
corrective measures for the project that
enquiry is four months now is it a tool
is it too much to expect for four months
to for a guidelines to come out on what
corrective action should be taken
similarly the soil investigation there
is two versions one from the IIT one
from the LNT now the government has
written to the IIT saying please resolve
this you know at the same spot you can't
have two kinds of stone one says basalt
other one says volcanic tuff and shale
and sandstone at the same spot until
this is done
one should not start though this letter
was written by the government in
September in October a commencement
order was given how can the commencement
order be given when you don't know what
soil there is yes similar there are
several such incidents I can give you
where the government has said for
example they have changed the dimensions
of the statue four times yes first of
course it went from 190 meters to 210
meters then they went from 210 to tool
to 212 meters at additional 2 meters who
sanctioned it on what basis what was the
technicalities involved and even at that
time the pedestal started at 30 meters
height then it became 60 meters then it
became 90 meters and as the pedestal
starts growing the statue keeps
shrinking now the statue started with
120 meter side yeah
it became 83 then 75 now back to 83
how can anyone test stability of a
statute if the dimensions keep changing
who has done the Windtunnel tests
what is this way of doing a project
where you don't do a Windtunnel tests
for a statue which has to withstand a
cyclone
where the specifications say at 55
meters per second is 98 km/h I don't
know I don't think so now nobody has
tested it nobody has said it'll send of
course mr. Rao I don't think they're
looking at designing it and care
factoring in measurements based on what
will ensure that it is stable and and
and and can withstand cyclones and
storms or strong winds what they are
looking at is how can we make it the
tallest how can we increase the the
height of the sward so that it's visible
from a longer distance how can we make
this more about chest-thumping rather
than actual work rather than actually
looking at what will be the impact on
the environment how are the laws made

they have highlighted the problems with
each aspect of this project from without
doing proper due diligence which is why
by the way for a viewers to reminded
this project is on hold as per orders of
the Supreme Court because the procedure
was not followed now it emerges that
there have been irregularities at the
PWD official that the project man
official who's in charge of this project
is refusing to take any more
responsibility that even before the
project work has started there are bills
being raised by the contractor for over
70 crore rupees what is happening in
this project and if the government and
the party are in Raleigh serious about
it they would do an honest and in-depth
investigation I'm going to thank my

Mira now us as the farm crisis now
impacts the job crisis will the
government acknowledge the severe
unemployment problem that India is
facing will government released the NSSO
data let's debate well they've been two
stories were bringing to you for the
last one year the farm crisis and the
job crisis and it was only a matter of
time before data began to point out that
one was affecting the other according to
the Indian Express a story on their
front page today says 3.2 crore casual
workers have lost their jobs in rural
India between 2011-12 and 2017-18 this
is nearly a 30 percent drop over the
previous NSSO survey now this is the NSS
so data that was not released by the
government and one can understand really
where the government is coming from it's
extremely inconvenient and it paints a
very very grim picture but at the end of
the day if the government is going to
continue to pretend that the problem
doesn't exist it obviously means no
solution will be explored for the farms
and for the jobs all right right this
point the blinkers are on an election is
the only thing the people in power are
thinking about on the show with me
Abhishek Mishra for the BJP you gain the
other national president of Swaraj India
Rahul Raj is with the youth wing
president of the rush tricky son must
duel Maha sang-moon guru Swami senior
economist and and Harish d'art moderne
will join us as well the Rural Affairs
and Agriculture editor at the Indian
Express the Indian Express is the one
that released the story you again three
other of good evening to you and thank
you for joining us are you surprised by
this latest number that has come out 3.2
crore casual laborers so I'm assuming
these are people who get paid on a daily
basis who are hired hand workers on
farms who have lost their jobs in the
last five years
mr. Yadav
I'm not surprised what we are witnessing
is a series of things that are happening
especially if I speak of the rural area
number one we've been hearing for quite
some time that farmers incomes are not
going up they are stagnant they're in
fact negative farmers are not getting
the prices the second piece of
information that we also have is that
farm wages have gone down I'm glad we
averaged a modern on the show who has
explored this was reported extensively
on this that average farm worker wages
have actually remained stagnant over the
last four years despite the fact that
the inflation was very low and this is a
period where real wages can go up in
spite of that it did not happen and the
third piece of evidence that we can now
add thanks to the story by Indian
Express today is that the total number
of farm worker jobs there are two kinds
of jobs in rural India you can have
either farm labor or you can have labor
which is engaged in non farm activities
so what we know is that both have
declined but primary primary decline has
taken place in the case of Agriculture
workers so if you now look at it it's a
triple whammy farmers in rural India do
not get income if you are not farmer but
farm worker you do not get where your
wages are not going up and the number of
jobs is shrinking now this the only
compensation ting factor for that could
have been if the urban economy was doing
wonderful if lots of jobs were being
created in urban areas and these people
were simply migrating and getting better
job but we know again from the NSA so
again from si mie and from every
possible survey that that's not
happening so in other words we are going
through one of the worst phases of
unemployment in the history of
independent India we say either the
government has always quoted Ola uber
swiggy and Zomato as job opportunities
that are being created in urban India do
you not see these as valid alter
for the three crore people who have lost
their jobs in farm level where there are
different ways of measuring whether what
is the temperature in Delhi I could say
let us look at the number of air
conditioners that were on today and
compared them to the number of air
conditioners that were operating last
year that could give us some sense I
could say let us look at the people who
were jogging in the morning last year
and the number of people who were
jogging this year the third option would
be to say let me go take out a temporary
and thermometer and actually check the
temperature now please remember it's
extremely important for our viewers to
know that NSS so and CMIA data is like
thermometer you know you this is the
fight because these are household based
surveys which all over the world are
considered the gold standard of how you
measure unemployment everything else is
indirect inference why should we
privilege indirect inference when we
have direct data NSSO because the method
deployed because the sample used and
because of the overall credibility over
the years this is a gold standard data
now the report is as good as in the
public domain because the entire thing
has been leaked so we know why the
government has been sitting on it and do
remember afraid this is the third report
on unemployment which is being
suppressed initially there was n word
survey being done by Labor Bureau the
government stopped it refused to release
it they said we'll go buy an SSO and SSO
report comes gives a very bad report
they stopped that as well and then they
were hoping that they would reduce some
mudra figures to claim that lots of jobs
have been created and we now know that
even the mudra figures have been stopped
basically something is utterly rotten
and that is being hidden from us but we
have Harish the mother and on the show
with us as well and we're very glad to
have him on the show mr. dime other than
good evening and thank you for joining
us so that one is the rudl affairs and
agriculture editor at the Indian Express
there's also been another piece of data
that came out a couple of hours ago mr.
Donavan
latest EPF OData that says that eight
point nine six lakh jobs were created in
january and seventy six lakh jobs were
created over the last 17 months now is
this another example of what yoga and
regather was saying is basically
inferring from third you know from other
data pieces instead of actually
acknowledging the NSSO data do you
believe that the government is
withholding NSSO data because it's
inconvenient at this point see I think
what the government has been trying to
say is also the fact that the latest
survey is based on the periodic labor
labor force survey you know something of
this kind and they are trying to say
that they followed a different
methodology from the earlier rounds you
know but if that is the case then they
should be transparent about it see what
is happening right now is that they are
not transparent you know so all kinds of
data is getting leaked out or you know
and so that doesn't help in the
credibility you know suppose suppose
just to give the government the benefit
of doubt suppose the methodology
followed in in the latest periodic labor
force whatever survey you know it is
different from the from the earlier NSSO
surveys which were happening in 2011
whatever 2004 you know at 1993 etc then
then then there is nothing wrong in
saying look we have changed the
methodology so so it's not that things
are that grim but but the government is
neither coming out with with the data no
and and and at the same time it is
hiding and at the same time you know the
even even at the same time that
definitely the the wage rates clearly
show that there is no tightness in the
in the market see you see assume that
like like I think another logic which
they are trying to say is that you know
you're basically your work force is
sorry your labor force is basically all
those people who are the above who were
basically above the age of 15 you know
and and who are willing to work okay so
it is possible that the labor
participation
is rate is coming down simply because
people want to study you know people
don't want to get into the job market
immediately you know if I if I study and
if I accumulate certain skills I might
be able to get a better wage in the
market I may be able to so so because of
that probably the the supply of laborers
in the in the in the market is falling
okay but if that is falling if supply is
falling then your wages should be rising
but that's also not happening so either
way I think we are in I mean it is a
fact that we are in a serious job crisis
and and probably we have not had this
kind of a thing which is which is
basically some kind of an open
unemployment you know and that is
probably happening I don't know maybe
maybe in several decades you know which
was not the case earlier and and as I
think yogi indra was saying you know
earlier what used to happen is suppose
say the crop failed you know my crop
fail I didn't and and or it didn't rain
so what used to happen is I would
migrate you know suppose say I was in a
village and say lot or you know then
then I would migrate to lot or town you
know if I couldn't find work in lot or
town then I would go to say or ngah but
if I didn't find work in oranga but then
I would go to in go go to Bombay so now
what is happening is it looks like there
are no jobs anywhere you know whether
whether whether it is in my village
whether it is inlet or town whether it
is an oral gabite City or it is in
Bombay and that is definitely something
new which which we have not seen
probably I don't know at least I have
not seen as a so it is a serious problem
now will you now you can hide it through
various things you know
yeah yes it is like what we do yeah
there was a point to make misty either
will go ahead and then I'll bring in the
rest of the bank just
to supplement what Harish said look we
are dealing with some of the finest
statisticians in the world I do want to
remind our viewers
whatever our recording economy our
record in statistics has been extremely
good since the days of man August Indian
statistics have been seen as top-notch
in the world and this is the first
responsibility of any statistician to
say are the two set of data comparable I
mean I'm very very confident this is
something statisticians routinely say to
say please do not compare this with a
similar figure in the previous time
because these are strictly not
comparable they would have done all
these things in the NSSO report these
are reported in a very transparent way
it doesn't need a secretary to
Government of India or the minister to
say oh my god are these comparable we
are dealing with some professionals let
us respect them and why not release
these things in the public domain if
that is the case absolutely
Abhishek mistress with the BJP who's on
the show right now
Abhishek Mishra is the government hiding
data because it's inconvenient before
the elections is it is there any shred
of doubt now that we have a crisis of
jobs and we have a crisis of firms fear
two things I want to clarify I don't
know why you're in the readö hides the
truth maybe he has a politic agenda here
it's a sahaja beyond foundation and he
wants to mislead it with the country I
want to state three to four facts iam
say fact number one which you can the
rather was hidden this data has been
leaked by Gen Express nithya yoga in
January clearly said that the NSSO data
which has been quoted by some people is
a draft report which we have not
verified we do not accept so Government
of India has not released this report
officially people of India must know
that so some people some people have you
know taken some data have the least one
newspaper and now they're saying it's a
government data government has not
released this data one point number one
we say other was not said this point
number two Fei which is very important
is that this data they may say other
said that why don't we try the citations
mr yadav CSO is also a government
autonomous body of body of statisticians
why don't you try the CSO data
ESO clearly mentions that India's GDP is
growing India's growth rate is growing
manufacturing sector jobs are growing so
mr. hodda one should trust NSSO data
which has been leaked but d doesn't want
to trust and still it has been
officially sent but is there a job
crisis he don't trust the government he
no no I want to fail let me come to my
point I heard everyone patiently I did
not interrupt anybody give me my two
minutes you're given five minutes very
politely
point number three the EPF o data which
has been released today clearly set is a
170 percent growth in number of jobs in
January we have had 8 lakh jobs the CI a
data for the last four years for the M
SME sector clearly says there has been a
13 to 14 percent growth rate in number
of jobs almost 13 million jobs have been
created now the global agencies they say
India the fastest-growing crumby in the
world what is Emily I mean the jobs have
been created
definitely fade there are some problems
somewhere some sector which are the
global agencies that say that rectify
that but jobs have been created India no
no no I am F in the in the WEF all the
agencies are saying I am from the World
Bank where does the IMF and the World
Bank get its data from India does the
IMF do an independent study on the
growth of video of the Internet economy
Government of India data never faith
okay you touch the government if a
government of India Clara said we are
growing at seven point three seven point
four we are growing faster than China
via device then you give failure to
understand without manufacturing sector
jobs being created how can a economic
growth I don't know which is what I'm
wondering where the manufacturing sector
jobs are mr. Mishra you answer that
question that's exactly the question the
economists have asked that's the
question of service stations are asking
without the jobs how can we grow if you
are telling us that we grew at eight
point two percent in the year of the
monetization then where are the jobs to
support that you're turning around and
saying because we grew at eight point
two percent obviously there will be job
not where are these jobs you think
good faith I appreciate your question I
appreciate your appreciation mr. adi
Cuadrilla the chairman of the cordage
group yeah the RT mr. Rd goes the
Chairman the goldrich group today I said
that this perception created by the
opposition that there's no jobs jobs are
being created people at the rural level
all of your arguments all of your
arguments are Bechet commissioner allow
allow my panel to now rebut your
arguments let me also point out that
when you say that you again rather was
withholding information you again three
other ways here as a panelist and he
will answer whatever question I asked
him so I don't think is in a position to
withhold information but if you say that
the leaked NSSO data to the Indian
Express at that point the story came
from the business standard but I will
allow her each time other than to answer
that question was not cleared by the
Government of India nobody in the
Government of India is in a position to
actually clear the NSSO data the NSSO is
a independent body but mr. da wather and
you wanna answer that question that some
people have leaked and you should not
take this seriously no but going by like
like I think the BJP spokesperson is
saying that you know the whatever we
should trust the CSO data with the CSO
data also shows a slowdown in growth in
GDP growth right like as you pointed out
the the the growth seemed to have
crossed 8% in the year of Dee
monetization 2016-17 right and the
government's by the government's own
admission 2017 and the current fiscal
there has been a slowdown right so so if
so if the CSO data itself shows that
that that that growth has slowed down
and I think the last quarter I think
it's been something like six point eight
percent or something right so when the
government data itself shows is slowed
down
so where is the controversy and and
about this leaked and non leaked and all
I mean it is nonsense first of all
neatly IO has nothing to do with with
with NSA so you know an SSO is under the
is is is is clearly under the under the
National Statistical Office you know
which is which is which is completely a
National Statistical Commission which
has nothing to do with with
ETI of in fact I think the more the
government tries to hide the data the
more others will start picking up other
data seal I like like for example say
two wheeler sales right car sales bank
credit of take right cement dispatches
your real estate unsold inventories so
there are so many other indicators so
ultimately any data whether it is
official or unofficial has to pass the
smell test
right and somewhere it is not whether
this whole thing is not gelling see and
and we and we can have a very dangerous
situation where we're very aware suppose
the government starts giving very
bullish kind of growth rates whereas the
reality is something else at some point
there'll be a there will be a crisis of
credibility so you like like like like
for example we know in the case of two
wheelers everybody took it for granted
that this this times festival season
will be a great season and everybody
built a production based on that and
then now suddenly everybody is found out
that there was too much of production
right yes Anna and and via and we are
and and we have and we have landed up
with some 90 days inventory is 100 day
inventories so so this entire thing was
because of wrong data which the
government supplied right so ultimately
it doesn't help anybody you know and
ultimately we should know that you know
what is the real situation and and when
you have right right data then I mean
it's just like a doctor right I mean you
need the right diagnosis if we make
making the right diagnosis requires you
to do whatever the tests and you need
the thing
so whom is this helping I mean this kind
of a North Korean approach will not help
you know yeah mr. Mohn guruswami joins
us as well senior economists will secure
Swamy you fought the arguments
that was put forward by the BJP leader
apart from accusing
yogi the other of having political
affiliations which I'm sure was together
fears once a day now he talked about the
CSU data can I say something on that
okay all right mr. Yadav go ahead misty
other go ahead
I just wanted to clarify something I
think my friend from BJP does not know
I'm not from any foundation I'm from a
political party which is called Swaraj
India so yes your allegations about my
politics are absolutely correct sir I
why have you no I hope I'm not
considering this fact I've never tried
to conceal it their logo is right behind
me
in case you did not notice number two to
say that the the NSSO versus domitor of
India just wanted to remind you sir that
NSSO is a government of India
organization number three to say that
I'm concealing the fact that it is a
leaked report and actually not a real
report sir I assume that people read
their newspapers this has been in case
you did not notice this has been on the
front pages in this country for the last
one month business standard Indian
Express Government of India has held
rapport meetings me the Government of
India has instituted inquiry to look
into who had leaked the report after
which experts have met once again and
they have reaffirmed once again the
report should not be held back there is
a national controversy about this if you
want I can rattle off the morning
headlines every day to you I thought it
was unnecessary and I thought it was
mirror now job to say it's a leaked
report of course everyone in the world
knows that it is and more importantly
sir
to assume that growth rate figures are
automatically indicators of employment
is to make a very poor assumption
sometimes growth leads to employment
sometimes growth does not lead to
employment in fact UPA period was one of
the periods when growth did not lead to
employment and that was admitted by the
prime minister who happened to be an
economist so there is a syndrome called
job les growth you might as well
recognize it and finally sir to claim it
on the basis of EPF for data there are
all kinds of technical hitch is there
whether it is only formalization or new
jobs but you know this is akin to saying
I have information on Siberian icebergs
so much have melted
therefore Delhi should not be so hot
today yes but you know why don't you
take out the thermometer and check
it isn't like in your pocket because
called analysis of data don't let me
take this question to warn you respond
yes yes yes mr. Goswami of the argument
that keeps popping up and I think
someone needs to bust this once and for
all
the argument of if we are growing at
this much GDP obviously they will we
will have jobs if we have jobs and
obviously our GDP will grow so both
sides are asking the opposite if it's a
chicken and egg thing the those who
believe that we have a job crisis is
asking that the GDP data is not
trustable and those who believe that we
have high growth GDP says the jobs data
is not reliable so which is it and we
infer one from the other
this whole attempt to draw a
relationship between GDP growth and job
creation is a bogus as porous one we've
had the highest GDP growth rate this
country has ever seen during the UPA
tenure he almost did about eight point
eight percent and it was a jobless
growth which is why the country turned
them out because there were no jobs
people were unhappy people were in
difficulty and you know the then
government had the the decency to admit
that the they didn't create enough jobs
and the same thing happening mr. Modi
came with the promise that he would
create so many jobs area he hasn't done
that matter factoring hysteria
we've lost 27 thousand jobs a day
because you know you can get rich this
huge income inequality in this country
the highest income inequality in the
world now with Gini coefficient almost
touching seven and so you know with this
kind of inequality they'll be good you
know the the big guys are growing at 30%
every two years and the bottom 70% have
garnered one percent so there's
joblessness today I saw lines of ladies
because I could recognize that come from
our Marathwada because they were wearing
the typical sarees and standing for
construction labor in Hyderabad
obviously there is a problem in rural
man Astra you have to recognize that to
attend to the problem you can't hide
now the government's big argument all
these days was that we have given mu
draal loans we have given 10.2 crores
Morelos and they have created jobs mr.
Modi's argument was that every mudra
alone would have created at least one
job now out of these mobile phones man
corner alone anchor plus something with
real loans have been pill of 50,000 and
the average mudra alone is twenty five
thousand rupees
so twenty five thousand rupees you can
create a job this is the kind of
spurious argument this government puts
across and the neatly ioq has no
capacity to judge the veracity of an
essential reports it has no locust and
either the statistical Commission is the
body which decides on these things and
you know you have for two members or to
resign and said this statistical
Commission consists of people from Delhi
School of Economics and then inimical to
us so people from JNU then school
economics we don't want anybody of them
so you know finally you will get some
data like you know our friend is given
that you know and I go to data saying
that you know you were jobs Allah
you know these kind of things are so
these are not new jobs and EPF Oh data
right if you have more than eleven
workers you come into EPF oh so you know
there's not mean new jobs have been
created
you've just grown a little more and so
you've come so many informal secular
companies have become formulas but
doesn't mean you created 12 million jobs
a year and that's what you need 12
million jobs a year yes and and evidence
on the ground let me bring in Rahul Raj
Rahul Raj is the national youth wing
president of the rush tricky son mustard
masa
Rahul geumru leader degree botany but
sir kharka Aki Aki nakri or barrows
curry Cucuy problem name must do wrong
Keiko a problem here we kiss on Cucuy
problem knee ok Appa hypothesis thank
you a B Joe must do have we lost trouble
do we have to seem to have lost our
connection with Rahul but we'll try and
get back in touch with him Rahul media
vos optic poetry okay we're trying get
back in touch with Rahul all right
Abhishek mister do you want to respond
to any of the clarifications that have
been offered by our panelists yes yes I
do wish to I have a bit of waiting
patiently and give you all have that
habit this is the one we have but look
in the other said that yeah you can the
other said that you know NSO data is
also covered of India data I agree to
that
so Government of India is CSO data is
also covered of India data so so
Government of India has a purgatory that
which data
it feels should be released and
whichever Government of India is North
Korea cannot object to that is the
government of North Korea not a couple
of us cannot withhold data that it feels
you can you let me answer let me answer
you now let me answer let me answer so
let me answer so CSO data for the
diamond ation period give us eight we
seem to have lost
make me sure as well let me just ask my
studio director are they any of us yes
who you have I will try and get you'll
give the other do you want to respond to
that I think my friend doesn't
understand how the Indian state operates
I think the assumption is if we are the
ruler we can do what we like we can
suppress any data we can release any
data we can change any data that's not
how democracies work see s the the
statistical Commission is an autonomous
body of the government when I said it's
a government agency I wanted to
underline that this is not a private
profit-making body which is somehow
releasing some such thing an allegation
which was unfairly leveled against cm ie
that's a private body I said all right
if you don't trust a private body and SS
only is a government party they have no
ax to grind
they have they can't possibly be into a
conspiracy to disturb lies your
government I mean this is an elementary
information the trouble is that these
people cannot trust even these basic
things
my friend says CSO data unemployment
where is the CSO data unemployment there
is none where would the CSO get its
information from they would get it from
Labor Bureau they would get a tremendous
s so there is no other separate
independent source of employment
information as well mr. Mongor Swami has
clarified the EPF for data it is not a
data of employment for example about
rural jobs for example about agriculture
labor job if your data is completely
irrelevant it is a list of people who
get PF now if it shows an increase it's
a good news for our economy but it
doesn't necessarily mean more employment
in most cases what it means is that
someone who was not getting someone who
was in employment but was not entitled
to PF has now for various reasons become
entitled to PF which is a formalization
of job it's not a new job I mean all
this is elementary for a be a student in
economics mr. Morden guru Swami would
support me I'm all for that you know and
why are we on national television
debating things
which should be absolutely utterly
Elementary what we should be debating if
the BJP spokesperson was a little more
familiar with information that he's
handling he could have said all right
this data pertains from 2011-12 to 2017
two of which years were UPA years all
right we can have an intelligent
conversation about that whether UPA
itself was also responsible possibly
let's talk about it
but this this approach to say this data
doesn't exist it is all rumor it is
nonsensical it is wrong information I
don't acknowledge it let's be real we
are into a serious debate we are not
doing class 3-4 or class seven eight
debates here on national television but
see either let's actually just put the
rebuttals out ourselves is it possible
that because of mechanization because
there are tractors now that can do the
job of say ten farm laborers because
there are machines that can do the job
of you know ten libras at a time is that
why labourers are losing their jobs on
the farms of course these are serious
issues and I really thought in a serious
debate we would be talking about these
issues when you say farm sector job
agriculture labor jobs are reducing this
is one of the reasons that in in fact in
the long run the work force employed in
agriculture is coming down we have
lesser number of farmers we have lesser
number of farm workers which is bound to
be the case because the share of
Agriculture is shrinking in our economy
yes it is one of the reasons but the
sharp drop which has been reported by
agriculture by Indian Express this
morning that cannot be the result of
such a long term slow process something
in addition to this is happening which
is what is reflected in this loss of
three crore jobs teak road is not a
small figure yes the process that you
described could account for loss of let
us say 1 million every year 2 million
every year these things can happen they
do happen but 3 crores in in this period
of 6 years
No that is extraordinary that is
something we must think seriously about

I'll be honest to you than the farming
there are multiple issues and this
debate does not report in to the farming
sector as I did show the NS no data and
weather
what are the data implies so I would not
wish to digress from the debate I want
to in fact come back to the main part of
the debate and mr. doob in the other was
saying about some seriousness some verse
you using to the effect of being serious
etc but to mr. Yadav I'll quote a
serious statement of a serious person
mr. Mehta
can't we'll see of meetha eigen also the
efficient ex officio member or the
National Statistical Commission so mr.
Amitabh Khan referring to the same
instance of data which has been lead by
some people and which has no
verification by Government of India mr.
Amitabh can say that nearly seven point
eight million jobs have been created we
have to take into account people living
the low quality jobs so PHA the main
issue is that some people have left a
low quality jobs and hence there is also
some seditions have had some you know
something like the jobs in gone we're
creating adequate number of jobs for new
entrants okay sure you know you can
hello if you come back here and tell us
in quote Amitabh Conte from a month ago
when this whole thing started in
February we all heard that press
conference really clearly we read about
it we've researched it we've paid very
close attention to everything let me
start with Hopkins said in that press
conference I want to reiterate then if
you're going to quote Amitabh car I'm
going to quote mom guru Swami who said
they need the ioq has low no locust and
I know capability to check data coming
out of the NSS so it does not have
second would know secondly the needy ioq
has no business and the Government of
India has no business checking NSSO data
there is nobody more qualified to check
later than the people in the NSS oh who
quit their jobs because they were not
being taken seriously and finally if
you're telling me the people are losing
their leaving low-paying jobs leaving
low-paying jobs and going where where
are these high paying jobs you speak of
where are the jobs why can't you just
release the data if you're so confident
why is it if the government refuses to
release the data and then gives us
anecdotal evidence from other pieces of
information we we saw the statists we
saw the city Chaisson mirror now an
earlier debate they were saying that we
don't resin etim but who were these
editions they were from Harvard Stanford
Berkeley Berkeley Canada so now I want
to know are just the citizens of India
whether they did trust nithya open
government of India all of those TV
stations were accompanied but no no once
again please
Abhishek Mishra do not make this a
national anti-national debate I won't
fall for it the state is the economists
who asked the question and the
statisticians who asked the question
were from IIT Bombay they were from I am
Delhi they were from J knew they were
from every important Institute and
University from across the world this
this argument of they are not in favor
of the nation is garbage and I will
refuse to allow you to peddle that sort
of nonsense on the show if you have a
fact to present to us present a fact mr.
Mohan guru Swami the idea that
statisticians and economists and
journalists who asked questions are
effectively anti-national is the worst
part of this argument isn't it because
what it does is it discredits everyone
who's in a position you know it
basically challenges everybody's
patriotism if you challenge my my my
data if you challenge my assertions your
unpaid show which is a rubbish absolute
rubbish and you say somebody went to
Harvard so he's not qualified to commit
about data and then there's also rubbish
you know this is the kind of argument we
don't need we have an body which is
specialized collect this data analyze
this data you take their data
why have you you know suppress the
mudras report and the Labor Bureau has
seen it I said no it's not the time to
release it because inconvenient even
mudra confirms that that you are not
creating any jobs the fact is that it is
not their fault
we need you our problems are huge we
have four hundred and ten to twenty
million people in the unorganized sector
we need to create ten eight million jobs
a year in the unorganized sector and the
biggest employers are nagano sectors the
farm sector half today 70% 80% of
farmers have less than 0.6 acres of land
who are they going to employ you have
exist labour and coming out of the farms
you have no jobs for them you see all
over the cities now this morning I was
driving somewhere and I saw huge lines
of
standing there available on holiday
yesterday so you know this is a problem
you're facing they're coming into the
cities they're getting the rottenness
jobs in the cities you know do nothing
they need to put on the uniform to stand
there and say I'm gonna choke it out and
that is what the gap in care is doing
things were choking us so pathetic
the job of last refuge an average joke
is that it gets about 5,000 6,000
degrees a month that's not a job you
want to create when the government says
that you know 10,000 rupees is the basic
wage you need if I may ask this question
of Harish the mother and a couple of
things have come up that should be
worrying us mr. de Mazarin is journalist
first of all a music mistress saying the
government of India can withhold or
release whatever data its it seems fit
that's worrying point number 2 it's not
just the NSS of jobs data that has been
withheld farmer suicides which comes
from the Home Affairs NCARB has been
withheld since d monetization we don't
know how many farmers have committed
suicide in this country Labor Bureau
data has been has been withheld there
are several pieces of data that should
be released on an annual basis that have
been held back by the government because
it's not convenient now this idea that
the government can hold back whatever it
choses it's undemocratic isn't it yeah
it's it's very dangerous in fact
actually we can have good debates like
like for example I am really keen to
know what this periodic labour force
survey is you know how is the
methodology different from the earlier
ones you know it could be possible that
again I'm trying to I'm trying to
support the government you know it could
be that the things are not that bad you
know if we do a comparison same thing
like I don't consider farm suicides to
be the ultimate indicator of distress
you know suicides could be for many
reasons it need not be just it need not
be and and probably you will you will
find the more the chances of of not so
poor farmers committing suicide you know
and and and you'll probably have more
farmers committing suicide say in Punjab
than say never and poor in Orissa you
know so so it is worth debating these
kind of things so earlier that that
that's what used to happen see the
government used to come out with
different reports you know and then
people would debate it and it would be
sort of you know and then and then and
and and in fact people used to write
dreams of papers you know and and and
and that's how you know we we we improve
the quality of our data it's not as the
what's it called our our data systems
are perfect or something but you evolve
and then you deviate it it comes into
the public forum you know expert so I'll
so you know but whatever economic and
political weekly they they they they
come out with this thing so this
withholding data is something and I mean
it is it is completely stupid and and
then saying that the government will
decide which data to realize I made
there to release so what the government
should should understand this you know
data will come out in various other ways
you know people as I said I look into
whatever a sale of two wheelers you know
I look into cement dispatches I look
into other kind of things so so I'll
stop depending on on the government data
so is that good for the government
itself is that good for policymaking see
if I'm going to give a very rosy picture
of everything or I don't see what is
happening you know suppose tomorrow like
you were to say that India
meteorological department shall not
release the rainfall data you know
because if you if you do it then then
then then what is it called it may cause
whatever droughts you know reports of
drought and it will cause
speculation and holding it doesn't make
sense you know and and data today you
cannot hide you could do it in the in
the 1560s you could do it in the Soviet
Union you could do it and you can do it
in North Korea nobody is interested to
go to North Korea right I mean I don't
want to invest there right so as an
investor I yes yes as an investor so
North Korea tomorrow can say we are
growing it doesn't make any difference
whereas people are interested about
India you know and and and and beauty
about India right I mean we were putting
up putting out data on all kinds of
things here and the more data you put
out and the better you know I mean
absolutely
yes well I thank our panel just boil
this down very simply it's like allowing
a child to decide whether or not he
wants to show you his report card or if
there are some numbers on that report
card he'd rather just hide it's not good
for the child it's not good for the
parent it's certainly not good for his
upbringing or it's like allowing a
patient of diabetes to change the number
or hide the number on the blood test of
the sugar reading the insulin reading
that's not good for the doctor or the
patient the Statistics Department while
it is a government organization it is
independent of the government like the
RBI the data that it puts out is not
meant to be corrected by the government
or you know looked at by the government
or approved by the government and
certainly not by the nithi I of doesna
theäôve doesn't even have the capacity
or the talent or the ability to do that
the NSSO is the best statisticians in
the country and the best decisions
across various countries if they have
data that data must be released if
you're not releasing the data means you
have something to hide and when you have
something to hide it means something is
rotten at the end of the day it's much
like evidence of the weather you can
check the evidence of the weather by
walking outside figuring out whether or
not it's raining or it's really humid
and sunny if you're not going to give us
the actual job data people will figure
it out from other sources journalists
will not stop asking questions
economists and statistics will raise
questions because that's their job
calling us anti-national will not make
the questions go away and will not make
the answers magically disappear you will
continue to ask questions we will
continue to raise data points that are
released in the media because the
citizens of India deserve to know the
government must first of all released
the NSSO data without editing it and
secondly acknowledge that we have a
problem that is rude and in our job
sector that is the only way we can move
forward

Tata Group now Tata group might be
evaluating options to buy jet airways
routes to buy parking slots and landing

I've got the permit to fly overseas just
last week this is of course about the
same time that Etihad also announced in
in those strained ties with Jet Airways
which had affected flights to the Middle
East on how this is going to be
impacting flights and the aviation
sector we have with us lengths are RI
getting us further inputs here on what
data is now looking at the intera for
the second time ground the Tata Group is
looking at Jet Airways what's
interesting is that Tata is pretty clear
it is not interested in all of Jet
Airways it wants parts of Jet Airways a
lucrative routes the parking slots the
landing rise which was really the
goldmine for any airline as the second
time around is that an early stage is
being evaluated by the Tata Group so I
would like to carry it maybe a deal will
fructify maybe a deal will not fructify
but sources say that even as this
evaluation processes on Tata Group is
thinking of making a representation not
just to jet and his lenders but to the
government at large that let Tata start
using the unutilized capacity of Jet
Airways it could be it slots it could be
its roots it could be its landing right
and it will make this case for larger
consumer interest we've all seen those
air fares go up look at the prices you
have of tickets now from Delhi to Bombay
Bombay to Goa so that is the case that
we understand is going to be made
immediately but vistara
which is also part of the Tata Group but
you know the joint venture with
Singapore Airlines got permission to fly
overseas just last week and so the
timing is also great Jet Airways has a
gold mine of parking slots in London
Heathrow Hong Kong Amsterdam seen of the
Tata Group certainly I know all of that
I sent her a detailed questionnaire to
the Tata Group and they said they will
not comment on market speculation but
this is you know in the realm of
speculations I would also like to point
out this coming at a time an indigo has
been eyeing Jets pilots poaching Jets
Palace those that have not been paid you
seen flights that have been grounded
SpiceJet wants the grounded aircraft of
Jet Airways as well the government to be
fair the Civil Aviation ministry is also
working on how it can monetize Jet
Airways okay and at least increased
capacity to their sanity in air fares
that's right in consumers grievances of
course would be the strongest picture as
you said that Tata would be making fall

us those inputs

in more developments coming in these are
lenders of the cash-strapped jet Evy's
they're also looking for a management
change now
according to sources the lenders have
started looking out for possible
candidates for the top job for the
airline's also say these changes that
could be announced as soon as just next
week now this comes in after the ongoing
financial crisis that the airline
continues to face last week it was a
thread by pilots to stop flying if their
pending salaries are not cleared the
pilots they had also written directly to
the Prime Minister urging him to look
into the matter so this is yet another
aspect here of the Jet Airways crisis
both car shuttle way they're getting us
further inputs now on what the lenders
here are aiming at so what we are
picking up at this point of time and is
a very important lenders meet which is a
scheduled at 4 o clock today at the FBI
headquarters in Mumbai now what the idea
of the lenders are given the fact that
episod is out of the race and the
cash-strapped airline need immediate
money infusion r24 to continue now if
you look at any other player you look at
Tajikistan or any other player that you
diligence we take a lot of time it will
be at least 30 to 40 days till the money
from them comes in all the formalities
are being done until then the Linden VA
line afloat now what is the plan is for
a frame the plan is to give some money
to the company around 1,500 to secure a
code to let them pay all the creditors
to let them pay the pilot but the
lenders do not want Nashville to
continue then so the idea is they will
put in money but management will step
down
they say well we'll step down in fact
there's nominees of Marysville will also
not be a part of the board and a new
management will come in now who will be
the new management now the most
important part is that you have to see
that in an industry like a Jason it is
very difficult for an outsider to come
and hold the ship and that is why you
will have X PMD software India which we
have been speaking about there are names
I'm righted CEO then but the only
difference is that if you look at the
private field of the problem is that
they are not being able to run okay

coming in but you get more clarity once

has been arrested and you know more they
haven't been arrested in London these
are the developments here coming and
remember this was an arrest warrant that
was issued against a need of Modi by a
London Court he's now been arrested in
London we have with us our consulting
editor Vanetta Valley getting us further
inputs here on a huge development here
that is coming on this case it's pretty
much the first step in a long winding
process that lies ahead I mean the fact
that he's been arrested is similar
almost similar perhaps exactly the same
process that was followed in the in the
case involving with Amalia where he who
was the resident producer them as new
support and then granted bin which is
perhaps likely gonna happen in this case
as well he will be produce into the
supporters remember the extradition
process that the UK follows has to
undergo three distinct steps and this is
just the first of the set and I'm
assuming that since he's now been
arrested on the basis of the details
that the specific information that the
Indian government has provided the UK
authorities he will now be produced and
will be bailed out for him to contest
his extradition process in the lower
courts of the United Kingdom said all
right when I stay on with this of course
is you saying that this is a process to
be followed he could be given bail he
would be applying here foot bail but
also let's get into voice here a senior
advocate mesquita Lutra with us or the
phone line appreciate you being with us
ma'am in these major development that
has come in here of course a very clear
sign that the Indian authorities have
continued to pursue on this so it was
expected one it has been certified by
the home factory and sent in to the
magistrate's court that in routine he
would be arrested I also think that as
in mr. Mallya skills which emolia's case
is going to be a matter of fact that he
should get bail and and
most like that bill should follow I
believe almost forthwith so obviously
it's part of the process and in a sense
it has taken a long time for them to
reach this stage because the Indian
government's request had gone a long
time before the Home Office has taken a
long time to certify sometimes it takes
time because they are not happy with the
documents which have been given and they
want more documents so first be external
at the Ministry here looks at the
documents and sees if it's satisfied
then it goes to the English to the Home
Office in England and they see if they
are satisfied or if they need anything
further and then it one must have been
certified and that's how it's gone to
the magistrate's court so I'm sure he's
going to say that he is going to oppose
the request and also apply for bail and
to a large extent
unlike India you can't read anything
into getting failed because the grants
of bail is more a matter of course in in
in the UK for example or the u.s. rather
than in India where after extradition
request it would be more difficult to
get bail in India it's not the case in
the UK that's right and as of course mr.
Lutz are you've been explaining that
this is going to be taking procedure
would in fact a predictable procedure
that is to take place here on this very
similar to what we've seen in Vijay
Mallya's cases well Vijay Mallya's case
only now has reached this stage where in
which his extradition has been approved
only recently and is now pending in the
UK's Home Office so near of Modi's case
would be taking exactly the same route
and it would be quite some time
presumably several months till we
finally have him brought back here in
India to be tried by Indian courts he I
would expect you know first court then
second Court and Supreme Court so it's
most likely it would take two years to
three years unless for some reason it's
expedited because some of the defenses
are bound to be similar so it's not a
political arrest
so it is a legal arrest or for offenses
including ideo fences or CBI offenses
and therefore it's it's according to me
there the defenses would be very similar
and it will be a different joint so they
will have to here you know the the whole
case would have to be heard on merits
with the defense's and I think it's the
Westminster court elsewhere i but it's
been fine and their defenses are bound
to be the same that they don't expect
justice or they don't expect or don't
think that the two process would be
there and the English courts will
definitely examine it they may overrule
it they may accept it but they will have
to examine it and therefore take their
time okay
but also ms/ms Lutra as has been
reported in certain sections of the
media here that he's believed to have
started his whole new business they're
living in Soho of will this arrest and a
bail granted and then moving on to the
next stage here will this have an impact
here on whatever work in business that
he's now started in London oh I don't
think so because what he would be seeing
is two three years into the whole
process all first court Magistrates
Court leads to appeal
dreamcourt and therefore if you're
looking at two three years right and you
don't know what will happen at any of
the three junctions or three steps then
I would in a sense be business as usual
because most likely he's all right
likely totally all right please I
apologize for the interruption because
we're getting in more voices here on
this also getting in a word here from
former CBI director mr. AP sing with us
on the phone line I appreciate you being
with us this is the first major
development from your experience or what
are you expecting next now after the
surest Molly ugly which is that you know
and there's a process to be followed and
it is an expeditious healing process and
that's what I think but I'm not aware of
exactly what relevance of taking place
in court
I mean if he had been arrested has been
given bill which I presume he would get
and then we proceed extradition
proceeding right follow which would be
very similar to what is happening mr.
Mallya's good he's of course to be to
quickly update you and what's exactly
happened here he has been arrested he's
to be produced in court there which
would be 3:30 p.m. our time here in
India Neera Modi is going to be produced
in court in about 25 minutes here from
now and a confirmation here that he's
been arrested so mr. a P Singh III you
also of the view that this is going to
be taking a predictable route he of
course is going to be using his rights
of asking for bail applying for bail
getting it the case being scrutinized in
two three stages before we finally have
him the go-ahead from the authorities in
UK that he be extradited to be tried
here in India again we look looking at a
process of two three years then I would
I like this good expected to follow the
same route as mr. Mallya case and that
would be the timeframe that would you
know be entailed in this hole
extradition process it's not that you
know he's going to be arrested and sent
back to India tomorrow so because in in
England you do have a legal process and
that they follow it that's right and one
of course has to keep much patience
because this does not take any less than
two and a half three years time of what
we very recently of course seen in Vijay
Mallya's cases and whatever arguments
and excuses they're they were bought for
the brought forth by his legal team on
this being a motivated case against him
jail conditions in India not being up to
the mark not following certain standards
and all of those arguments that we're
going to be hearing here perhaps in
which his need of Modi's legal team
would try to bring in certain excuses
stay with us please also getting in
certain political voices mr. magic
member of the NCP without cell phone
line appreciate you being with us this
arrest of course now coming about at a
time when the opposition parties have
continued to attack the government
saying that they're not doing enough and
he's been arrested now this wasn't
obvious for all of its feelings with
issuance of warrant by the trial court
but you know it's um August where the
request was already made to British
government why did it take so long why
it has taken nine months they should
have happened in my less than two weeks
there in any case that has been delay on
the part of the government in showing
keen interest in securing the presence
of this man and personally with your
experience as a senior advocate here one
one perhaps would need to take an
account that there is a lot of
back-and-forth in checking
cross-checking documents being in place
in certain further issues that are being
raised from the other side here to
finally bring about that formal arrest
well let me tell you for your
information that in fact I have
conducted extradition proceedings
the silo QP in another extradition
matter of famous personality in the DYP
and there he found that once the
linguist was dead within a month's time
this step of getting the man
stranded in that cities and I see you
exist upon to be bound by condition to
the course happens within the Western
action of was like why is risky to set
second line but no Telegraph's reporter
from local London expose that he's
solemnly seclusion
so since we're lying though since well
produced and it's everything I activated
all D thereafter so that is why I be
brave but is it a sign of election the
Modi government wants to have a kind of
undeserving class by saying that to care
we are let them get me Ramudu me Romo
they should have been back here by now
we suggest equal two years
what does it come January 2008 changes
and the quantity we have completed 15
months already
where is the initiation of mister mister
lemon are you saying that as I are you
saying that this has been a strategic
delay so this arrest comes about just
two months before elections is that
really possible because this is you're
dealing with authorities of entirely
another country here is that the
government does not want to vigorously
follow against this man maybe that is
enjoying the simple things of some of
the people in the government number two
is that the government now excavates
everything so that they can cancel and
we serve 50 60 and just Prime Minister
won't say that look here please watch
him arrested this arrest is meaningless
this man will now be immediately
released in another 15 minutes
just watch and just a formality mr.
lemon it does it does set the process it
sets the process it starts the entire
code process before we finally reach
that
stage that the authorities there and
agree with the extradition Vijay
Mallya's extradition there that has been
accepted and is still pending in the
UK's Home Office then known about this
stage which we have reached today should
have been reached in beginning of 2018
when you found out that he is in UK why
did you take mine yet this is the
question mr. magic memory appreciate you
speaking with us a senior advocate there
also of the view that this is a process
that should have been kick-started by
the government perhaps much earlier
earlier last year itself and this has
been delayed but predictably from what a
lot of legal voices here have have told
us that this is once again going to be
taking about two and a half three years
as has been case in the case of Vijay
Mallya as well if near of Modi's legal
team goes about and opposing those
impediments that his his case here be
heard in terms of human rights in terms
of the case being the allegations being
fair against him mistake piecing their
former director of the CBI still with us
over the line mr. a piecing from what we
are now observing in both these cases
both in Vijay Mallya's case as well as
near of Modi's case that the the very
fact that when you have someone escaping
the country it's only it only becomes
that much more difficult to get them
back to be tried back in India so do you
think there are going to be questions
raised back to having nipped escape have
having caught this in the right in the
NIP of the initial stages itself in in
raising those red flags when it mattered
in not having them leave the country
yeah that yeah you're correct their
prevention is always better than cure so
it could have prevented them from
leaving the country that would have been
better but expeditions are not expert
deportations we have had successes from
other countries to buy you the recent
example US and Canada have been
cooperative it's only the EU countries
and UK that we have a problem because
they play a lot of emphasis on human
rights and process now in this case the
only good thing that's right human
rights and jail conditions have already
been discussed in the Mallya case so
maybe that will not be a so an argument
that their lawyers of little movie will
be able to put forth anymore because
that is already be obvious in British
courts that the Indian jail and human
rights conditions are quite okay so that
meaning means speed up okay to the
palliative oh that's that that's an
interesting point that you've made here
irrespective of whichever prison that
the Indian authorities say that near of
Modi would be taken to back home here
you do not feel that issues along
similar lines that now could be raised
by near of Moody's legal team yeah I
think so because Oh even if they raise
it I don't think that the the British
courts will give it much credence
because the body established in Marla's
case that the that the bail conditions
in India okay yes please stay on with us
as we're going to be continuing to
getting in for the inputs in reactions a
very quick update here for our viewers
near of Modi has been arrested in London
this is of course based on the arrest
warrant that was issued against him
particularly pertaining there to the PNB
case and he would be produced he would
be produced in court there in London
3:30 p.m. india time in about 15 minutes
from now is what were given to
understand he's to be produced in court
in westminster court itself this
is a reminder of procedure that has been
followed here in Vijay Mallya's case as
well and and that is why immediately you
have these parallels being drawn in in
in how much time would it really take
remember Vijay Mallya's case has now as
we speak er almost reached the last
stage where in which we've gone through
the entire rigmarole of him asking for
bail getting bail using all his legal
rights there to delay his extradition as
much as possible and now that his
extradition Vijay Mallya's extradition
having accepted it is still pending in
UK's home office so the question that we
are also looking at here is can
nirav Modi's case also be taking as much
time if this is the procedure which will
be followed in London Coates and his
legal team of course would be putting in
as many impediments in the procedure to
delay that would this also be taking as
much time as about two and a half three
years to finally get near of Modi back
home here in India to be tried in Indian
courts it has taken as much time in
Vijay Mallya's case we still of course
need to see on what is the legal
argument that would be put up by near of
Modi's our team therein in proving his
innocence in saying that these are
motivated charges against him all of
that of course still needs to be seen
but it's also important to note that the
Indian government has been at it many of
course have questioned that this should
have come in earlier this should have
come in earlier in 2018
the arrests could have come about last
year itself did the Indian government
sit on the case and delay it why the
arrest now just two months before the
election beginning in further breaking
inputs and this is a spur CBI sources
here saying the process of extradition
of near of Modi
on course it is on and we'll assess will
assist the Crown Prosecution Service the
next date of hearing has been set on
this as well being 25th of May the CBI
is confirming that yes we have been
informed of the arrest and as far as the
extradition process there is on it is on
as well
this levy I would be assisting the count
prosecution service you're on this next
date of this hearing is to be on the
25th of May so this is now having set
the ball rolling as far as near of
Moody's case now is concerned it has
entered the legal process set the ball
rolling here and however much time that
it would take for this process we are
going to be getting in updates on this
as per eventually what is being decided
in different stages is just the first
stage in different stages there off of
the legal process there in London this
is a confirmation now that of course is
coming in from sources within the CBI
that they've been informed confirmed of
this arrest and also in assurance so to
say that the extradition process here is
underway as well so fugitive economic
offender yes looted the public sector
Bank Punjab National Bank and yes flood
away from the country now it created
huge uproar in the country questioning
mr. Modi and his government finally the
Enforcement Directorate it is reported
as arrested him and it would produce him
before the court in London we'll have to
wait and see what UK Court is going to
do whether you co court will under him
to Eadie to take him back to India and
make him stand before the law of the
land we'll have to wait and see there
are many ifs and buts now there are
questions also how could he go away from
the country who allowed him
leave the country after looting after
robbing the people's money from a public
survey Bank mr. Modi has to answer that
question then how much time it took to
find out where he is
mr. Modi should explain now finally when
the country is getting ready for general
elections to Parliament now Judy could
manage to arrest him and Judy he is
going to produce him in the court of law
in London under what exactly is going to
happen we will have to wait and see and
it should not end up as a political
electoral election gimmick just to
hoodwink the Indian masses Indian people
that chunky door Modi has been taking
strong action to get these budget is why
it did not happen in case of Vijay
Mallya and why he did not happen in case
of others so that is why the timing and
everything will have to be considered
and mr. Modi I will have to explain I
will have to answer several such
questions",True,en,90,1,3

very beginning a day before the final
court hearing in the Mahal
rehabilitation case the Maharashtra
government in an affidavit has said that
it cannot pay a rent to the residents of
Mahal well the state said that this
would be a huge burden on the state
revenue department this after an IIT
Bombay report deemed Mahal unfit for the
30,000 residents living there the IIT
Bombay submitted its report in the
Bombay High Court last year the court
had appointed IIT Bombay to conduct this
survey to measure the health problems
faced by the residents in mouth all
right so today we are looking at a
situation where the Maharashtra
government is literally trying to shirk
off its responsibility saying that they
cannot be rental accommodation provided
to the affected residents of ma who
simply because the government cannot
afford it the government has cited the
reason as causing burden to the state
revenue department or to the state
coffers so to speak they feel that this
cannot the cost of this relocation
cannot be borne by the state government
now the question is that this entire
area has been declared unfit for human
habitation by the government itself by
the service conducted by the government
itself right number two the IIT Bombay
report that was submitted in the High
Court which spoke about the sort of
pathetic living conditions to say the
least these people have had to in fact
have to in fact endure
let's go cross now to Bilal Khan who's
an activist who's been supporting the
people of Mahal for quite some time a
lot of times so much was speaking to us
here on Meera now you know what do you
what is your reaction when the state
government effectively the Chief
Minister and his government tells the
High Court that look we've we can't give
these people who clearly are living in a
toxic hell we can't give them any rent
because it's going to burden the state
exchequer it's really very shocking ways
I read that I took a PDF in yesterday it
was the reach noting that they have put
so much effort in in writing the
justification why they cannot
given even the justification is not
justified they are saying that that it
will be a burden on the state exchequer
but they
so much worried about the state
exchequer but party thousand people that
whose life are at stake and I think came
only when the government refuses to
locate those empty lying houses which
are available in abundance so it's it
appears that the state is not at all
worried about the lives of the people
who were really poor
yes Bilal Khan also if we look at the
sequence of events let's remind our
viewers here and probably you'll be the
best person to do this that these are
project affected people they were
relocated from their original place in
order to you know in order to enable
developmental work it is definitely the
state's responsibility to make sure that
they are simply not abandoned in an area
which has been declared unfit for human
habitation yes that's what I mean and
this is what happen everywhere in the
country wherever there is a development
project
everywhere the project that people have
to pay the cost of those a developmental
project and then they are dumped and
nobody looks at their misery that they
suffer after facing this party
rehabilitation like we have tales of
from different parts of the country
where people are dumped in in a shed tin
shed in the name of rehab it is so is
done in where people are you know at the
verge of 9 yes and that that's exactly
the point isn't it because Bilal you
know the issue of course surely is the
fact that again as Athena said that
they've been put here it's not as if
they've gone there by choice and they've
been talking about moving out of this
place for the last few months if not
more than a year and their pleas have so
far fallen on deaf ears and despite the
fact that they've been sitting on the
streets on a sort of on a protest you
know appealing to the government trying
to set a representation to the
government as well to try and explain to
them their plight
they did in you see they have paid the
cost of development days they are the
one who should be treated with most
dignity and treat the opposite is
happening they are treated like the tech
industry and cities and no amenities are
there they're just been very well proved
by
the reputed institution like IIT and UT
that this place is not the Bible and
still read companies and I mean not
making these people out of mountain
right and other startling fact here in
fact is that you know these surveys that
we're done we're in both by the
iit-bombay even NGT but all if you can
tell us had given a report saying that
this is a highly polluted area it is non
livable and we discussed that report
many times in this channel can you tell
us that you know despite this service
how can the Maharashtra government
simply shock off its responsibilities
like this what are the facts that you
put out in your petitions belong so we
take this and that in the altar of the
NGT which had in 2015 it said that this
place is not livable there's a threat to
the lives of those people who are living
there so this is the ground that we took
in the High Court and hopefully we are
going to get some positive outcome today
with the quota is if the geometries
regimen and but more thing I want to
highlight for your channel is that the
very existence of maha rehabilitation
site and industry are in is an illegal
act because in 2005 the entity also said
that there has to be a safety distance
between an industrial and residential
area and tradition is a few kilometers
and currently the resettlement effect
and the industries are just separated by
a 15 meter wide Road it is not even a
you know if there's some blasts happen
people don't even have escape route to
look save their lives that what have
been pointed out in IIT reporters will
write be loud please stay with us
because we've got one of the residents

absolutely it's really heartbreaking to
listen to the stories the people of
Mahal the number of people who have lost
their lives because of these sorts of
health related problems is just going up
as Anita has been pointing out let's go
to de Chartres now the Shasha joins us
with details of what the Maharashtra
government said in the High Court
yesterday the Shah for those who've been
campaigning for Mahal for the results
who've been watching their neighbors
friends family members died slowly
because of the absolutely pathetic
conditions they live in tell us what the
government had to say the court
yesterday
well that's right every rain today is a
very important today of the yearning
especially for 30,000 Maui residents who
have been waiting for a very long time
to move to a safe place so that can
either happen if the state government
goes ahead and pay either rent or or
gives them alternate accommodation but
at this point in time what we know a day
before the yearning the state government
was supposed to submit an affidavit to
the Bombay High Court citing jiya
reasons and decision as to whether they
can pay rent to 30,000 residents or
whether they will be given a alternate
accommodation to stay but to our
surprise once again the state government
has written in the affidavit that they
cannot pay rent to the residents of
mouth because this will burden the state
revenue department and that is really
not good for the government at this
point in time I'm reading few pointers
from their affidavit of aerion which
says that state government is not ready
to pay rent to Maui residents and the
port they it also requests the court not
to pass any such order earlier regarding
the same in factor the government says
that at this point in time all of these
were the unauthorized structures were in
legal structures and that is the reason
they are not permanent structures and
the residents who are staying in Maui
currently they do not have valid
registered documents and that is a
reason they are not even entitled to the
house that they are staying in right so
basically we shall need rent to almost
30,000 residents munis yes so in the
name of a development project this
entire a lot of people have been simply
abandoned they're poor they're helpless
they cannot afford to fight long legal
battles now that's the reason why I
assure we've been taking up this cause
and you've been in the forefront of the
coverage but at this point in time and
this is a huge embarrassment as well for
the government to say that we do not
have the funds we are running that
question on our screens that there are
funds for statues and elaborate
structures that the government indulges
in how can one get away saying that we
not rehabilitate project affected people
we do not have funds for that well
that's right after that I mean again we
have been questioning the government via
the Chief Minister of Maharashtra
Devendra Fadnavis be the Housing
Minister Prakash marathon even the
respective Department like Mahara and
BMC representatives for that matter but
we have been just getting same answers
every now and then that they are working
towards the betterment of 30,000
residents they are ensuring that day at
least alternate accommodation will be
provided so all of these are only
promises which is wobbly given to the
residents but when it comes on paper a
Freda you entire line of first sentences
the entire line of tone are in the
manner of which it are they really
communicate with the residents that
changes so it was just yesterday when
the government went on to say that these
30,000 residents they do not deserve to
be paid rent also because they were
staying in illegal structures and
because we had to demolish structures
are in and around tons of pipeline we
had no other option but to shift them to
mouth and after coming to Mahal they
have started complaining about
restlessness and even our pollution air
and water pollution but what is
important at what can be expected today
are freedom from the Bombay High Court
is the fact that an order might be
expected from the Bombay High Court or
against the state government either to
pay rent to these residents or to move
them to an alternate location move them
to a safe place because as far as Bombay
High Court is concerned they were only
dependent on the iit bombay report and
now or considering that report has been
submitted which establishes that there
is air and water pollution in the area
and no amount of amenities can solve the
pollution problem the court will be
delay the court or might give an order
today against the state government that
is what we are hoping for right thanks
to the show for joining us it's very
heartbreaking that these people have had
to beg and plead of the government to
move them out of this or to this book
place when it's clearly established time
again that this is not fit for human
habitation absolutely
basic fundamental right to live has been
violated we continue our focus on the
story
thanks very much the Shah for joining us",True,en,1022,4,33

meanwhile toothless is instantly

that's not the case from the first few

astounding the beautifully rendered
vistas and fluid action works seamlessly

toothless and their friends to its
natural progression while still managing
to keep the storyline fresh if not

it honestly doesn't matter because the
character arcs of hiccup and his search

a day after 131 Chartered Accountants

with the government is credible why not
make it public if the Indian economy has
created a record number of jobs why
isn't the NDA government putting out
numbers is India's job crisis a myth
let's debate
cleaning the big debate this election
season is M over employment yesterday we
brought you the big poll survey that
showed 42 percent of the waters believe
employment is the biggest issue this
election season so no wonder that it is
dividing our experts is dividing our
waters and it's also bringing out the
big guns into the public for debate
today it was the Finance Minister Arun
Jaitley who weighed in with a comment in
a detailed blog now here is our
different versions stack up in the
accountants versus economists versus
Arun Jaitley or the government debate
why number one what is it that the
hundred and eight economists said a few
days ago they said that the CSO and the
NSS all subjected us being subjected to
political interference
what is it the finance minister Arun
Jaitley said today he said CSO functions
professionally and independently what is
it that the 131 Chartered Accountants
who came out yesterday slamming The
Economist said the economists are
politically motivated
just like the award waxey gang now if
you remember viewers last week when this
debate first broke out that's exactly
what we said The Economist will be
called let's aspect where there is a
difference of opinion on the GDP series
economists say that the Reaver revised
GDP series benefits NDA and there is a
data mismatch on the macroeconomic
indicators that have been picked up
finance minister arun jaitley says 2014
to 2019 as witness the fastest ever
economic growth and there is no debate
about that 131 shorter accountants say
changing GDP base year is a regular
feature it's not like it happened the
first time under the NDA in fact the
entire process of a new GDP serious
calculation began under the UPA what's
the other aspect of disagreement between
these scams economists say government is
withholding up
unprecedented unemployment data the data
by NSS so that was supposed to be
released in December 2018
hasn't been given out arun jaitley says
unemployment with with development is a
myth so if the country is growing at the
current rate that it is then how can it
be that an unemployment is the reality
of our country
131 Chartered Accountant say India is
the fastest growing economy in the world
and this goes on the charge against the
government 108 economists is that the
government is intentionally withholding
data pressurizing the institutions who
are supposed to analyze and give us
these statistics Arun Jaitley says
credible institutions have accepted
government data you have the IMF and the
World Bank praising our economy and our
country what are you talking about and
the Chartered Accountants are backing
the government saying credible
institutions have accepted our data so
where we stand over this big missing
data debate and what's really the true
picture of our economy that's the big
debate this evening mister are now
garage professor with the IGI dr joining
us this evening Saddam Kamel joins us
once again economists with the Tata
Institute of Social Sciences I also have
mr. Santosh Mero traversal of economics
at center for informal sector and label
studies at Shan Yu and Abhishek Mishra
leader of the BJP will be with us
shortly unfortunately we had one of the
chartered accountants who was part of
this group who was to join us but had a
personal emergency so had to cancel last
minute but let me go across to Professor
nagaraj first and ask him not so much on
what the CEOs have said for us but on
what Arun Jaitley has said the label
there is compulsive contrarians what's
your response yeah I was thinking about
this term when I heard the finance
minister say this if they are compulsory
contrarians then we cannot you cannot
accuse us of being politically motivated
because when the other when the the
people in the previous government also
we were contrarians
and we were criticizing the government
so we we take the government's to task
when we find the things are not alright
whether the government data or garments
analysis so our job is is of
professional economists we analyze the
the data in light of the theories we
have right so if you are profession we
are compulsory contrarians then we
cannot be accused of being politically
motivated if i may just ask you because
this is what happened Jaitley has said
in his blog most of them meaning the 108
purported economist as he calls them
most of them have over the last few
years repeatedly signed memorandums of
manufactured political issues against
the present government now this is a big
allegation and a big charge at the
credibility of those economists who have
spoken out but if I may ask you have you
actually signed any memorandums or been
part of any other campaign questioning
government policies or data no I have
been an economist and I have analyzed
the government policies in various
occasions and they're all available in
public domain and I have done this for
last thirty years as a professional
economist okay so but we have not signed
we have we have we have we have looked
at specific policies not not party
politics we if the policies are right we
have said yes there is correct if the
policies are not right or if the data
behind them is questionable we have
raised issues okay so this is what an
independent economists are supposed to
do we do research and we teach okay and
we maintain our professional dependence
and that is what I think our job is and
our job is not political job and and you
cannot accuse us of being politically
motivated okay
all right done out of professional job
as careful commentators yes I take your
point yeah but Professor Ravikumar with
me in the studio is the same question to
you in the interest of full disclosure
to our viewers and you've been power
this conversation with us now for
multiple debates have you been part of
any other motivated or manufactured
campaigns against the government well I
have been in the past I have signed I
don't exactly remember how many but I'm
sure two or three letters I have signed
during the previous government as well
as well as during the current government
we have signed letters related to the
poor functioning of the EMG and our
ideas we have signed letters concerning
the poor design of the National Food
Security Act we have signed letters
related to the Right to Information Act
Forest Rights Act so we have written
letters to the government often on
during the previous government as well
as the current government so there is
the charge of politically motivated and
of compulsive contrary an argument
doesn't quite work it's true you are a
compulsive contrary respective if it's
UPA or VG or NBA in power then good to
the extent that mr. Arun Jaitley is an
obsessive loyalist yeah I have my
compulsive contrarian okay all right
let's get to the actual facts then and
the point of discussion here obviously
there are two big themes one is the
unemployment data the second is the GDP
and mrs. Santos minute so I'm going to
come to you first since we've had
numerous and I think now I've lost count
of the debates we've had on unemployment
in various data what is your response to
what Arun Jaitley's saying and he says
that look at our growth numbers and if
this is our growth then unemployment has
to be a myth well the finance minister
is right in claiming that jobs are
growing but jobs are always growing as
youth are entering the economy the jobs
are always growing the real issue is are
they growing as fast as the number of
entrants into the labor force and if
they are not then the unemployment rate
will rise which is what has happened I
don't have to say any more jobs are
always growing and jobs are always
growing in even in the organized sector
so it's not a question about absolute
level of rise in jobs it's perfectly
possible that in manufacturing there
might be an absolute decline in the
number of jobs as has happened and as
the data itself demonstrates but that
doesn't mean that overall jobs are not
growing jobs can still be growing okay
so let's take at I don't know what that
I don't know what yes let's take a look
at the data that is being cited by
finance minister and then take it one by
one here is what he says the recent
survey of MSME published by
Confederation of Indian Industry CII in
the month of March 2019 covers one lakh
five thousand three forty five forms of
varying sizes across sectors and
geographies now this survey indicates a
growth of thirteen point nine percent
almost fourteen percent in net jobs
created over the last four years that's
about three point three percent for
annum of compounded growth rate he also
goes on to say that given that the total
workforce size according to Labor Bureau
is about four hundred and fifty million
overall job additions workouts - about
thirteen point five to fourteen point
nine million per year what do you think
of this data and the argument being
presented here mr. Mehra
well I think the only data which is
truly reliable are three sources of data
on jobs one is the cm ie data which has
a national sample a hundred and sixty
six thousand houses the second is the
annual survey of the Labour Bureau which
is roughly similar sample size slightly
smaller and the third source is the NSS
17:18 about which we already know now
all three are giving reinforcing
evidence and please remember that all
three of them have in their sample the
organized sector which is what the CII
survey would be capturing as well as the
unorganized sector so
obviously the three surveys that I have
just mentioned which are reinforcing
each other and which are nationwide and
representative at the national level are
going to be more reliable than what the
CII has done honestly I would doubt that
capability of the CII to conduct a
survey of this kind in the first place
okay I in fact I'm being told that and
we have mr. Rajesh Sharma council member
of the ICA I which is the Chartered
Accountants Association mr. Sharma thank
you for speaking to us it's a very
colorful statement that the 131
Chartered Accountants have released and
obviously you have your own reasons to
say what you did but frankly if you are
going to make the charge that the
Economist 108 economists are politically
motivated then this sentence appears
more politically motivated too when you
say allegations are pure choreographed
and resemble the various previous award
whoopsy drama award WAP C drama is
actually a political phrase that was
coined at that point of time and if you
use such phases about being politically
motivated is going to be love all
business all the economic things de
Kooning columns activities at ground
level
passionate about defending this mr.
Sherman oh if I could just ask you this
question and I understand obviously the
data that you're suggesting because
between D monetization and GST of Vista
Chartered Accountants have had a great
time in the last few years but that's
not reflective of the entire economy
just putting it out there my question to
you also is you say none of these
economists or social scientists ever
made an appeal in those 54 long years at
India is on a slow track and is being
left behind
now when India has become the fastest
growing economy in the world they have
worried about the credibility of the
data is it their intention to scale
foreign investors
correct now can can I please finish my
point mr. Sharma I'll give you time to
respond before you joined us I asked
both of the economists who are on the
panel tonight if they have in the past
spoken out and being part of you know
signature
movements and campaigns against
government policies and they said yes
and they in fact one of them also
pointed out that they have raised issues
about government policies during UPS era
with ups pet schemes pet projects so
will you now admit the perhaps you did
not do your research properly and you
slammed these economists without
bothering to find out whether or not
there was in the past because also the
private investment in our country has
been at a significant low in the last
few years mr. Sharma
I know my facts and these are the facts
in the last few years maximum amount of
infraspinatus happened has come only
from the government and not from the
private sector if you say the private
sector is so hunky-dory why aren't
companies investing more in projects in
our country ease of doing business
the ranking doesn't make any difference
if people and companies within our own
country do not have the confidential
setup
because mr. Rajesh Sharma do listening
because you've made some very very grave
allegations against these economies let
them respond to the points that you are
making mr. Rawat you ignore the personal
allegations that mr. Sharma made but the
point is that the letter by the
Chartered Accountants are filled with
errors and wrong informations let me
list out one or two profs analogies here
he will elaborate on some of these if I
miss them out miss them with something
out first is that they have said that
there are a certain year there a set of
years in which GDP has been revised in
the past as well in certain base with
certain base years let me just read out
a sentence from there they have said
they have said that the GDP has been
revised earlier in August 1967 January
1978 February 1988
ninety nine and 2006 misuk these are
completely wrong there were no the GDP
data revisions in any of these years so
these desta writers of this letter a
completely missed out when GDP data was
revised in India they don't even know
this basic fact so who is politically
motivated
in fact data were revised in sixty sixty
one seventy seventy one eighty eighty
one ninety three ninety four and two
thousand four five and then now in two
thousand eleven twelve not in any of the
years that the Chartered Accountants are
suggesting so it is filled with errors
like this I can list the list them out
but I'll sort of leave something out for
profs Nagaraj as well because he is
myself a difference between when it was
and the base here that was taken the
base here upon which the revisions were
made yes that's what you got I think
that's what I'm referring to yes they
say that GDP data was revised in X Y Z
number of years where there was no
revisions okay so it revisions were
actually in a different set of years
correct so they don't even have the
primary information on when the
revisions took place how do you take
this letter seriously number one yes
number two is that narrative being being
constructed here which is that you know
India is growing fast India is growing
faster than China India is just fastest
growing economy in the world
but let me put out why this narrative is
problematic this narrative narrative is
problematic because they begin from a
wrong premise what is that wrong premise
right
the revised GDP data based on the
2011-12 yes base here which is which we
are criticizing yes as problematic so
you take a problematic set of GDP
figures and put them out in the open
of course you World Bank will take it
because you're officially putting it out
yeah right the World Bank doesn't
compute India's GDP separate wallbang
doesn't do it IMF doesn't do it all of
these international agencies are
actually just taking the growth data
what we are giving them their own I just
want to make this clear to our viewers
also to understand because when you say
that how can if the World Bank and the
IMF are backing us how do you have a
problem because they're not really
scrutinizing our growth they may have
comments but the point is whatever India
puts out as official data that's what
they are taking yeah right now so you
start with the wrong premise and create
a narrative why is the directive wrong
I'll just take 30 seconds you know
economies talk about something called a
smell test smell test means that you is
your growth rate associated with growth
in a set of cooperative indicators as
well so you look at your savings rate
investments investment rate you look at
your growth in exports exports and so on
so let's look at the savings rate it has
fallen between 2011 and 2013 four point
six percent of the GDP to 30 percent of
the GDP investment rate Falls from 39
percent of the GDP to 32 percent of the
GDP exports of goods and services as a
share of GDP Falls from 24 percent to 19
percent
but your GDP growth rate rises from five
point five percent to eight nine percent
it feels the smell smell taste as we
call it yes this is what so that you
start from a wrong premise and you
create artificial narrative out of it
okay and then make Indian and call
others contrarian yes well I'm not an
economist so I'm gonna go across to
another economist who may have a
contrary view to that professor I'm
gonna go well good evening thank you for
joining us
Rajesh um I'll just come back to you Jay
let's just professor Agarwal respond to
this and then I will go across you
Rajesh Sharma and Santosh Malhotra I've
had the honor of working at the World
Bank almost 18 19 years back at the
financial sector development department
and certainly the data comes from the
government but I don't think it is
appropriate to understand that they just
look at the data and publish it the way
it is done and even if it is only one
bank or the IMF or other agencies like
this thinking that some of us think that
they just published whatever the
government gives please understand we
have private agencies like Moody's and
others also looking at India and they
have upgraded us as well so just to look
at it
secondly when you talk of savings rate
thirty three thirty five percent my dear
friend was not a good rate because that
means we are not investing in the
economic 30 percent is fairly a
comfortable rate even today so even the
fact that we have had major shocks in
the economy 30 percent saving date is
still a fairly high rate or where is
addressing rains in a country so let me
complete sir secondly you tell me you
mentioned about private investment
please understand for the last year and
a half there has been a creep scrutiny
on the bank financing which has happened
in the past it had become a freeway
where we saw
companies were actually swindling away
with funds taken from the banks as loans
and taking loans after loans and loans
after loans which have been brought to a
check naturally when that has been
brought to a check we would not see that
kind of a momentum in private investment
typically coming in despite that fact if
still had about 5.5 to about six billion
dollars coming every month from
international investment itself and we
apart from the tax
so I'm not saying that everything is
very good it's in a country like India
which is democratic we certainly like to
hear all different kinds of views and
good to hear and debate about these
issues but just to just say that
whatever the other person is saying I
was completely bluntly often wrong I
think it is bad is accepting that there
is there is a slowdown or the not even a
slowdown primary investment has not
bounced back since its UPA era Meir
professor at irrespective of what the
reason is I'm not sitting you're in
blaming the government for it I'm just
saying that that is a reality whether or
not it is because the banks or banks
have lost money or any other reason the
reality is yes but the issue is that yes
sir sir mr. Agarwal may i sir yeah
sir we have become the fastest growing
large economy in the world let's take
that for be that as it may the fact of
the matter is that this is because China
is slowed down that's why we are the
fastest growing large economy in the
world point one point two we were the
second fastest growing large economy in
the world just after China for at least
10 or 12 years in the past and for the
past 10 or 12 years so I don't know what
the big what the big deal is about our
being the fastest growing large economy
in the world that real point is that our
level of income is so slow so low that
we have to grow fast for the next 20
years if we don't grow consistently fast
for the next 20 years there is not a
hope in hell that we will reduce poverty
so let us not just pat ourselves on the
back because we are we
we've become the fastest-growing larger
economy in the world because China
because we were already growing quite
fast reasonably good in China China's
growth rate has come down point this is
point three point four do you know the
real question that I want to ask our
Chartered Accountants is the following
why is it that independent economists
have not replied to 108 independent
economists why is it that the Chartered
Accountants find it necessary to reply
to the hundred and eight economists and
this is the reason why Ram Kumar is
absolutely right that they've made some
basic simple errors so let's just take
apart some of the things that the
Chartered Accountants talk about one is
they talk about Oh a poverty information
we've been reducing poverty but we don't
have nationally produced poverty data
since 2011-12 and the consumption
expenditure survey that was done by the
NSS has not been revealed so we don't
know because that's the only relevant
basis for our estimating what the
poverty is on the other hand the
Brookings Institution has been has
published a clock on its website in you
know you based on a paper written by
homie Cara's and some team members which
essentially draws upon I am have
projections about what our growth rate
is and draws upon 2011-12 poverty data
and says oh if the if the elasticity of
poverty to reduction to growth is is
what is what it was in until 2012 then
our poverty has come down to this but
the but everyone is still questioning
thus the GDP data itself so how are you
going to make an estimation of what the
poverty estimate of the what the poverty
elasticity is point 1 and point 2 we
have reasonably solid data above which
says that because jobs are not growing
therefore real wages have been
relatively stagnant they've been growing
but growing very little and as a result
of which poverty could not have declined
too much at all
the final point I would wish to make is
that regardless of how high the
investment rate might be and how well
our exports the government claims might
be doing the fact remains that are
exported absolute level of merchandise
exports are actually lower
yes.can in over the last four years
every year than they were in 2014 our
investment rate is lower than it was
then they are agricultural growth rate
is two and a half percent in the last
four years while it was five percent in
the preceding five years despite all
these underlying estimates the GDP
growth rate is now supposed to be higher
in the last four years compared to the
preceding fibers it does not stand to
reason can be yes okay so let's get in
Rajesh Sharma to respond to that mr.
Sharma because those were the questions
are Miss Emma another one I'll come to
you but Rajesh Sharma first that's the
question directly to you Rajesh Sharma
firstly why aren't independent
economists speaking out against these
108 politically motivated economists
secondly what about the data on poverty
to which I will also add what about the
data on unemployment what about the data
on farmer suicides what about the data
on crime there is all this data can you
respond to mr. Rajesh Sharma first let
me say to my good friend he told me
because down but in the world he knows
economy well you need to check the world
over all the countries the economy of
the countries but most of this country's
economy are chewing down at that time
with a higher P then definitely India
has done them number one number two he
was not saying in killing that just
increasing government the economy was
going with that same page he knows 2013
cooking the chicken was 10% percent an
hour doing which I thought so
to tell about the change what you know
it well this 2011
[Music]
it was in 2009 so basically I think
that's probably going to be a response
on whether or not you're counting it
from base here or when it was done but
let me go across point taken there let
me go across to Professor Nagaraj
professor Nagaraj to what is being
discussed here and a to the specific
statement put out by SIA the CIA's and
Rajesh Sharma says why
charter accountants question the
economist we know economy better than
you because we are dealing with the
reality every day yeah first of all
about the chapel accountants of
statement there there are may there are
many many many mistakes in that one
thing which which has been propagated is
that it is the first time that India
Indian national accounts or Indian GDP
is compliant with the United Nations UN
SME which is again completely false
India has always followed the UN SLA and
the previous series followed the UN SNA
1994 which was therefore India has
always been compliant with the UN s le
okay that's the first point
secondly the the child accountant
statement talks about the ease of doing
business
I think that business that index has
serious problems as known to economists
worldwide this this index has no
correlation to increase in investments
globally and there are very very
interesting cases where country like
solar says Russia improved its ranking
from 120 in 2012 to 20 in 2018 but
Russia's investment rate did not go up
and finally it is widely known that the
use of Doing Business Index is a
politically motivated index and as up as
admitted by the former chief economist
of World Bank Paul Romer who got Nobel
Prize last year said that this this the
index in Chile moved quite quite with
the changes in the political regime
whenever the Socialists came to power
the index went up and the rank when they
rank went down and when the when the
Conservatives came it it went up so I
think the entire exercise of
either doing business is questionable
when it comes to India it must be it
must be pointed out that much of the
improvement in India's ranking is
entirely on account of the
methodological change which has been
widely admitted and there is a there's a
new study by Centre for global
governance in Washington which has shown
that the improvement in India's ranking
is entirely on account of on account of
methodological change so I think the the
the the report has report has serious
outage as the Chartered Accountant
statement has serious loopholes in the
information they are provided on there
surely surely the Chartered Accountants
have right to have their view like like
anybody else okay
but one must understand the Chartered
Accountants do not have a macroeconomic
view because that the training is to
look at firms that is micro economic
units okay whereas macroeconomics is the
discipline which helps people to look at
the economy as a whole
this what we call the aggregate economy
we look at the aggregate production
aggregate consumption I can get in
employment and and that can that can be
achieved only by large nationwide sample
survey data or an estimates like GDP
right so unready cannot they cannot be
acquired by simply looking at firms in
India we know
India in India we know that the
corporate sector even by the new
accounts account for only 34 percent
whereas two-thirds of the total
two-third of GDP comes outside the
corporate sector about which channel
accountants understanding is
unfortunately not not right because that
is not their expertise that's the reason
why macro economists insist on getting
the picture of the economy as a whole
and that they get only by national wide
sample surveys right and aggregate
estimates like GDP right it's very
important to keep in mind I take your
point out frankly I think this debate
would be a lot more easier and things
should be clearer if we actually had a
lot of the data that we need to stack
things up to
right now we're looking at you know
different data points and trying to put
it together and coming up with different
versions I'm Anna girl don't you agree
that if we had more concrete data
available on employment this debate
would be easier because right now the
government seems to be quoting to us CII
reports rather than any established
institution report you see that way data
is a very complicated thing it only
gives what we want actually to project
and we've seen that happen in United
States we have seen that happen in India
and statisticians would know about it
very well how WPI which does not reflect
an appropriate index is still quoted and
how WPI was chained to CP in the US and
the employment data which is projected
by United States with perfect
information coming in would not even
reflect whereas they were having a
unemployment rate of about 20 years back
when I was there at the World Bank of
almost about 16 17 % whereas they were
protecting anywhere about 8 or 9 percent
only so you know data is something which
is very complicated to look at what is a
sample how what subtype size should it
be out we use three in data how do you
smoothen data let's not get into the
debate of statistics one thing which is
very clear and I think one of my
colleagues did mention is about the GDP
figure I think everyone up first knows
that we're a two point six trillion
dollar economy today whether China has
gone to town or Russia has gone down or
America has gone down but we have at
least gone up in our absolute figures of
GDP growth and that is certainly not the
actual figure because we know very well
that we have a very strong parallel
economy and I think all you can always
to look at a macroeconomic perspective
but know that we have a very strong
parallel economy in this country which
is still not gone away after the
monetization and that also contributes
to GDP growth which never gets captured
in it and this is what exactly what the
government has been trying to put
forward is that the statistical data by
some of these agencies would have
modulated up to the factors that there
are other factors of job creation
employment of governments calculation
versus you know
the old way of calculation only when we
have the new calculation I am NOT
questioning I meant all these people
here what I am Telling You is that the
data these statistical agencies should
have actually introduced a mechanism the
economics working they should have we
can introduce an economic mechanism of
introducing that component of even job
creation where it's not getting captured
by EPA for government data for so many
years I am running out of time here but
I'm going to give 30 seconds to mr.
Malhotra for the last word before we
wrap up on the show mr. Malhotra go at
least on the GDP estimate I want to
remind our audience that the chairman of
the prime minister's Economic Advisory
Council yes had himself questioned the
new estimates that have been put out by
the CSO most recently which are in
contradiction to this estimates that
were put out by the committee of Sudipta
Mandel the National Statistical
Commission and the point that the
chairman of the prime minister's
Economic Advisory Council made was that
it's possible that the reason why these
new estimates seem to be a fort for the
last four years seemed to be higher than
the estimates for the preceding 10 years
is because the deflator used has
question marks around it he left it very
you know pregnant with meaning but he
didn't say very much more than that and
I think we need to keep this in mind so
I this is those is all I would like to
say at this point that when the Prime
Minister's chairman the Economic
Advisory Council himself
yes he's raising question marks about
these most recent GDP estimates then I
think we should all you know sit up and
notice but Nidhi I hope isn't and that's
what is told to us every time that we
have this conversation and somebody from
the government side will come and say
but nithya yoga told us this and Athiya
accept that and that's all fine then but
I'm going to thank all of our panelists
for joining us on this debate you know I
don't understand why we have to bill
this entire narrative the minute you
start questioning something linked to
the government you become
anti-government anti-establishment
politically motivated why will anybody
in this country not want to believe that
we are growing at a healthy level if we
indeed were going at a healthy level why
should I be in denial of that why should
any economist be in denial of that it
doesn't make any sense
one would be happy if you're doing well
in life if your family friends people
around you are doing well if you're just
businesses doing well if you're asking
questions is because you perhaps don't
see merit in the numbers that are being
putting are being put out now this is
what finance minister said I have given
some details of economic development in
India or the last five years with
empirical evidence the evidence shows
rapid progress and economic fortunes of
all Indians irrespective of caste or
creed only those who fail to develop the
Indian economy despite being in power
for several decades cannot witness a
reality that is staring in their faces a
whole world which is the IMF and the
World Bank regard India's the fastest
growing major economy 130 core Indians
believe it only the compulsive
contrarian
don't perhaps it is time lately to have
a conversation with these compulsive
contrarians at the end of the day they
too are Indians they may not all be
politically made motivated there may be
some days to the questions that they are
asking the fact of the matter is here is
a list of data that you and your
government aren't willing to give us
data on unemployment a report by NSSO
that would have given us a sense has
about the job creation situation in our
country has not been released since
2011-2012 the report on social economic
car census which would have given us a
sense of the status of the OD Caesars
not tingly since 2011 2012 the report on
the rapid survey of children done by the
Ministry of Women and Child Development
has not been released since 2013 2014
the data on number of farmer suicides in
our country at a time when farm crisis
or gradient crisis is one of the biggest
boiling issues in our country has not
been released since when 16 the data on
foreign direct investment said is six
something that the government only has
been speaking
a lot about has not been released by the
Ministry of Commerce or dipt since June
2018 the data on crime in India whether
it is accidents and suicides whether it
is prison statistics and kidnappings and
abduction none of it has been released
by the National Crime Bureau in the last
two years if there is nothing of concern
give us the data and end this debate
thank you so much for joining us

Mirror Now's Mir Fareed shares the details.,2019-03-19T11:42:51Z,MIRROR NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u34vHyBfoN8/hqdefault.jpg,"in other news now despite the schools in
large parts of Kashmir Snowden students
and teachers are made to put their lives
at risk every single day Carnivale show
Piana Baramulla
are among the districts of Jammu and
Kashmir that have several such schools
which are still covered under six to
eight feet of snow
despite that no holidays have been
declared in these places in fact the
children have to struggle to reach
school on roads that are still covered
under snow parents in fact now want the
schools to be temporarily moved to safer
buildings or immediate snow clearance at
this point by calling me for it now
joins me live with further updates on
this Fareed right now there are some
very important questions that the
administration needs to answer at a time
where a lot of schools of these areas
are knee-deep in snow it is extremely
crucial why children are being subjected
to risk their lives every single day why
isn't any kind of first steps being
taken by the local administration to
ease the plight of these people a well
the answer to that probably is that they
don't care about these very students
because they're probably from far-flung
areas and literally they've been left to
fend for themselves now the school
session for our post winters is the
winter vacation ended the school session
started in the first week or should I
say the second week of March
now these schools are we're open and
sensor we know that there are many
schools now in this case pictures speak
for themselves schools which are
completely covered with snow and snow
levels are very very high and in fact if
we talk off or the roof or offer the
schools they are completely covered with
snow so these students what they're
saying is that they everyday have to go
to these schools go inside and there is
a constant threat that because of the
snow accumulation and these structures
under heaps and heaps of snow they can
just cave in they can come down and the
results could be fatal
to add to their that there is absolutely
no arrangement as far as heating
facilities are concerned so all these
things are ensuring that these students
not only in one specific area talk of
any district we've got similar
reports from Baramulla from bad gum
district to show peon cool gum
ganderville where's there are schools in
similar condition unstable buildings
unsafe buildings and the things have
been complicated by here a wave a high
snow levels so authorities have done
absolutely no ordered nor survey to
check which schools are fit for students
right now either the schools should be
shut till the time are these these
schools become safe or snow levels come
down or some alternate arrangement needs
to be made so both of these things have
not happened and it is the students who
are suffering and even teachers feel
unsafe in the school so something needs
to be done about it but the authorities
are doing right now absolutely nothing
to do something about and give give some
sense of security to these students so
they cannot have education or they can
in fact be educated without any fear of
being trapped in these aren't still
unstable buildings back to you

looking at in fact stay with us for real

No - I mean discussion this evening
there's breaking news the Mumbai Police
has announced that it has arrested
Neeraj dsi the structural auditor of the
collapsed foot over bridge in the city
the arrest comes four days after the
foot of a bridge collapsed claiming the
lives of six people and injuring 30
others the police say they've arrested
neeraj who is the person who audited the
bridge the police has also altered the
charges against neeraj from 3 to 3 0 for
2 which is culpable homicide not
amounting to murder this is what the
police had to say the initial
investigation it came into our light
that the structural audit and the
negligence on the part of various
officials are the persons who are expert
in this field and they have a knowledge
that such an act such a negligent act
can cause damage to the life of people
so we have applied section three zero
for part two instead of three zero for a
which means culpable homicide not
amounting to murder in our initial
investigation based on facts we have
taken in our custody
Neeraj desai who was structural auditor
of this particular breach and and he we
are investigating his role into this
offence further this investigation is
being monitored on a daily basis from
all the senior officers CP Mumbai is
taking daily review about this offense
as well at joints equal on order and
additional CP South Region we are
conducting a professional and
independent investigation and we ensure
citizens that a proper charset would be
filed before court of law
from the beams no he's he's owner of the
decipherment Thank You officers in this
so in our investigation till now we have
recorded statements off view of the BMC
officers about the systems for
maintenance of bridges and after
reducing their role necessary legal
action would be taken in this particular
case our colleague Santiago is standing
by she's been tracking this entire
process Anthea the investigation
obviously has now brought in the the
vendor the contractor who had actually
audited the bridge but what about those
within the BMC this the engineers within
the BMC who've been suspended
have they been named in the air fire and
will anybody in government be held
accountable
this is the first name which is added in
the FIA and it is off the of the owner
of structural audit forum the forum
which did the structural audit of the
bridge now as far as the BMC officials
are concerned the chief engineer of a
bridges departments and authority was
his statement was taken by Mumbai police
but Mumbai Police has made it very clear
that as of now they do not suspect him
of anything the reason they took his
statement was to understand how the
functioning inside BMC as far as a
construction repair or an audit system
of the bridges are is concerned
apart from that three out of those five
people who are suspended one engineer is
the his statement is being taken by a
Mumbai police as of now his statement is
being taken on what lines and is Mumbai
police planning to add his name also in
the FI R that is something Mumbai police
is yet to come to a conclusion to but as
of now needles Desai will be produced in
the court tomorrow and Mumbai police
will take his remand for further
interrogation and investigation many
thanks for bringing us that update my
colleague Santa who's been tracking that
case very closely and we will keep a
very close eye on this case because it's
not just the contractor who had that
contract that messed up but those within
the BMC who weren't doing their job that
costed us six more lives other than the
four other
since we've had in the last three years
in the city that have claimed lives of
innocent citizens but moving on to the
conversation that we're having now
India's missing data we've brought this
up several times on the channel the fact
that for the last several years the
government just hasn't released data for
various reasons but if we take a look at
the reports that are in fact missing is
the government withholding statistics
that are inconvenient in the run-up to
an election take a look on the debate
tonight the mystery of India's missing
data
India's jobs data last submitted in
2011-2012 India's crime data last made
public in 2016
India's accidents and suicide data once
again made public three years back in
2016
farmer suicide data reported last in
2016 the list only grows longer with no
proper statistics India is concerned
on Friday 15 March as many as hundred
and eight top economists and social
scientists from across the world issued
a joint statement raising concerns over
statistical data coming out of India
they appealed to all professional
economists statisticians and independent
researchers to come together to raise
their voice against this
there is a concern that the quality of
economic statistics have deteriorated
last for five years and there seems to
be a seems to be interference in in the
in the release of the data since it's
genuinely an effort by the economist to
say that the data is sacrosanct I mean
that is something which should not be
interfered with where are now asks when
will the government disclose crucial and
up-to-date data is the government
withholding data for electoral gains
isn't the government hurting India's
credibility by withholding this data
let's debate
well it's not just the data on jobs that
have been missing socio-economic caste
census is missing the NCARB data like we
pointed out on the channel specifically
to do with farmer suicides has been
missing since the monetization we don't
know how many farmers have committed
suicide in this country prison
statistics released by the NCR v has not
been released since 2015 we was a whole
list in fact they say data doesn't lie
if you can't get it to lie then you just
don't release it on the show right now
PC Mon and former chairperson of the NSC
who quit his job because he believed the
data was not being taken seriously
very very senior citizen mr. Bonin do
you agree first of all with the letter
that was put out by the 108 you know
economists and statisticians saying we
modify the data in India and we will
lose credibility globally yes very
timely and very relevant to the current
situation because overall we have a
feeling that there has been some efforts
to see that uncomfortable data of note
released public domain or RTD so this
feeling is one of the reasons why this
economist to come forward and raise the
voice which I think it's a very
appropriate thing to do I do want to ask
you is about GDP and the fact that the
GDP calculation has been modified for
and I won't make it too complicated for
our audience but basically since the
modification of the kind of calculation
it shows that India grew phenomenally in
the last four years including in the
year during the monetization where we
recorded the highest growth in a decade
do you have reason to believe given your
experience that our GDP data is not
reliable
I fully agree with that see that ETP
data comes out with a very elaborate
kind of an exercise but is I agree that
it should also be reflecting the
situation and it will be convincing too
public at large that it is it is the
responsibility of the CSO and the
statisticians offer explanations if
there are raised doubts raised all of
its status it's your fundamental yogi
spoon ensure that they clarify the
points raised fortunately this year so
or the official statistical system has
not issued any clarifications on the
point especially like you said the GDP
growth during the year of de
monetization all because some time the
kind of the inconsistencies in the back
series nobody has come forward in
clarity predict that is the unfortunate
part of it but there are technical
intelligence experts behind he looks
into this methodology I would not be
totally pampered or anything like that
but what is important is to be more
transparent and come out in convincing
answers to the question being raised yes
mr. Bonin we've seen the nithi I hope
which is a politically appointed body
get increasingly involved first with the
GDP data that it took out or it made the
CSO take those numbers down from its
website then they got involved with the
jobs data do you believe the nithi i
okay has the expertise to deal with
national level data see this point was
mentioned by me earlier the you know the
Planning Commission used to have a dot
for of statistical people impact but
when the Planning Commission was
disbanded in the media you came into
being all the statistical positions have
been transferred back to the main stage
at estates and they have experts but I'm
not sure they have official
statisticians in the they have experts I
know what an auto official statistician
that is to mine on equality that civil
service officers have to be drawn from
that for Planning Commission but the
name vio came into being I am not sure
about the competence of an API of but in
any case we have a separate mechanism
booked for our see individual statistic
production between National Statistical
Commission now cs1 the Commission they
are we who involved parties the Navy I
already mentioned we also have an open
space for enter into the picture they
can
interpreting they can comment on the
results coming 20 data 1/5 of a doubt
set in the public domain but they're not
getting involved and take decisions
about water population and that's mr.
Bonin obviously going into the election
at this point what caution would you
offer to the citizens of India as far as
this national level data that's being
released by the government or withheld
by the government is concerned should we
take this information with a pinch of
salt to be slightly sceptic about it
well the mechanisms currently you know
there is no national statistical
Commission because without a chairman
for almost close to seven eight months
and two numbers posted also vacant for
the sale period so this is an
institutional mechanism with your built
up over the years instead of them going
from bad to worse we need to stand on
them and ensure that these are
established and it is not just relating
to the these two kinds of data I you
also mentioned the RT number of data
sets that cannot be released by the
government I can add to that including
the corporation sensors some of the
papers of the corporation sensors
relating migration these are yet to come
out so most of the agencies are to be
more affordable in public and that is
possible heating withdrawal to grocery

and that is the government has to be yes
but the election time PC moanin former
chairman of the NSC many thanks for
giving us your time here on mirror now
and having this conversation with us I'm
opening this up now to my entire panel
on the conversation with me Vivek ready
for the BJP rethink Akira is he
associate professor Indian Institute of
Management Ahmedabad are Rama Kumar is
an economist with the Tata Institute of
Social Sciences both of them have signed
this letter
Ashutosh senior journalist professor
arun kumar chair professor of the
institute of social sciences we also
have with us
jeido our former Commerce Secretary I
welcome all of you to this conversation
and I thank you for your time
I will start with radhika hara it's
always lovely to have a woman's voice on
matters like this rethink a first of all
thank you for giving us your time
professor kara
why did you sign this letter why do you
believe that right now
India deserves to be cautioned about
National Statistics so you know data
concerns as far as as economists are
concerned are something we quibble with
the government successive governments
going back to 99 2000 but what's
happened in the past few years is that
for instance the two data points that we
are concerned about in this letters jobs
and the GDP series what's happened is
that those who work with these data they
have been writing academic papers
they've been writing perhaps even op-eds
raising their concerns and asking
questions but none of 90 and no
clarifications have been forthcoming
from the government so initially it was
really these constant revision of the
methodology with respect to the GDP the
change of base in and and yes in a way
that's not been done before I mean the
change of basis or normal practice but
the way it's been done was there was
some concerns about that
but because there was no answer from the
government and then after that you know
what happened to the jobs data it had to
be leaked and that actually was a cause
for alarm as well that you know if you
don't speak up now it's just going to
spread further and as you've already
said there are other data important data
that are not being released by the
government so it seemed like you know if
they're not going to listen in one way
then you have to try another way to be
heard and that was the main point of
this letter
if I may add two very quick points which
were not in the in the letter one of
course I've already mentioned that it's
not just these two data series that are
problematic there are others which you
mentioned you know the NCARB data and
mr. Bohannon mentioned the census data
that's been very deal
the last point is that actually there's
a very serious crisis I think of trained
and skilled staff within these
organizations I visited the Labor Bureau
headquarters in Shimla a few years ago
and that's the main point of collection
for all a price data and the person
there was complaining bitterly about how
there was no staff in fact a lot of the
offices were empty and he says basically
there's a lot of learning on the job and
if you have a long gap of lack of
appointments then that also makes the
quality of the data suffer so there's
actually a whole range of issues that
need to be discussed but the people who
initiated this letter actually work with
the GDP series so really the focus was
on that Oh reservoir tell us this do you
believe that the government is
adequately responded to the issues or to
the concerns that were raised by all of
these economies yourself included not at
all not at all in fact what I see today
evening is that the statement 108
economies has been responded to by the
statement of 131 Chartered Accountants
now I wonder why the government could
not even get at least five or ten
economists to respond to the letter by
Hyundai net economist it shows the
shallowness of the intellect in the
official establishment extensively on D
monetization do you believe that this
government is currently suffering from a
bankruptcy of economists or people to
advise them in these matters let me just
say this that the D monetization of 2016
was the creation of one chartered
accountant
I think if 131 chartered accountants get
together God save India well it was
obviously be a difference between a
chartered accountant or economist
through very specific skills but opening
this up also to Ashutosh shadows I could
see you smiling there's obviously and at
the end of the day what audiences must
know is that national data is important
for every single government decision it
is not about winning or losing elections
government decisions are based on this
data and if we don't have the data I
don't know how the government has been
making decisions for the last two years
our solution see if
108 the 108 eminent economist if they're
writing and they are raising concerns
about the data then it has to take it
very very seriously and I think if 108
economies are countered by a chartered
accountant that you can imagine I think
or the one of the guest panelists has
said it very well that one chartered
accountant has created so much mayhem
148 god only conceived this country
they're the two very quick point one
point is it is not only about the data
manipulation but there is also data
suppression every time I remember
correctly that we all were told the 2004
to 2011 13 the Indian economy has grown
at at the rate of 8 plus but suddenly
you are told that in 2014 to 2019 in
economy has done much better than what
Manmohan Singh government has what
Indian economy has done during Manmohan
Singh I am NOT here to believe that
because today the data do not support
whatever has been claimed by made by the
government there is a serious crisis and
then if you ask the data but the former
suicide you are told no you can't get it
if you ask me data about the employment
and employers you are told you can't get
it even you ask the CAG report which
should be online about the defense
procurement you are supposed to be told
no you can't get it no the issue is what
is there for the government to hide and
if yes NSO data is countered by mithya
oak which is which is not its main
domain meet the aisle job is to to
advise government on the issues of
policies and others not to crunch data's
and if somebody from the nithya I was
coming and telling yes they are giving
some argument then obviously there is
something much much deeper than what
let's allow a wake ready to respond to
this Vivek ready where is the data and
why is the government not releasing that
isn't this extremely worrying and
embarrassing when a hundred and eight
economists from across the world caution
us and if we continue to mess up like
this we will lose our reputation
globally I think
no occasion for us to lose our
reputation growth globally India is the
fastest growing economy in the world has
confirmed by world bank and nobody can
deny that India has also jumped from the
ninth largest economy in the world to
the sixth largest economy in the world
and this year we will be beating Britain
which rule does I know they make red
like give me great good this is how I'm
asking you know it is not an election
campaign Mike will ask you a question
about the data where is let me tell you
my question is the earlier panelists the
absolutely the earlier panel is took a
very escapist route by saying it is
given by Chartered Accountants today 131
Chartered Accountants have countered
every point raised by these one not
eighteen Chartered Accountants of coins
raised by economists that look you
should be counted by others yesterday
these just understand then Chartered
Accountants come to court encounter you
then to different professions Chartered
Accountants winding axis
don't go by the branding that CAS have
done what is the I do I go by college
education they say something of this
this government does not use that the
content reports every point that they
have raised the points are salient
because they are not economists complete
fail I think you would give me a fair
chance to correct what I think I well
that can't be a reason to put them off
the Chartered Accountants are saying the
Chartered Accountants are saying that
look at the points that you've raised
are that there is revised GDP rates the
chocolate or chartered accountants have
busted this light this falsity
they have said look here there is but
there are revisions that are made every
year every every other time and this
revision is because of the United
Nations regime under 2008 there was a
new regime adopted by the United Nation
on the system of accounting under
various nations under the national
system of all right mystery by revision
process of GDP was initiated under the
earlier UPA this is this is not this is
not a manager of this political party or
that political party
ready first of all let me just stop you
for a second I'm gonna stop you for a
second vivica do you take a deep breath
I'm gonna stop you for a second because
I just want to remind our audience about
something very important
India is a democracy and when India is a
democracy belongs to each and every one
of us and we all have a free right to
raise questions and concerns about the
country at no point at no point are you
allowed to say why are these people
raising false concerns because it is
their right as citizens of this country
to ask questions rebuttal from Professor
you know the question is not about this
government or that government over the
period of many governments in the past
also letters have been signed by social
scientists and economists reporting
different issues if you look at the
national food security act and our EGS
right to information letters have been
sent by all kinds of social scientists
to earlier governments also the problem
here is the GDP data that has been
released in 2015
shows some peculiar kind of kinds of
trends the economy's usually understand
economic growth to be accompanied by a
set of accompanying factors for example
if you look at your savings rate it has
fallen from 34 percent to around 30
percent if you look at your investment
rate it has fallen from 39 percent to 32
percent yes if you look at your exports
of goods and services a share of GDP has
fallen from 24 percent to 19 percent
however your GDP appears to have risen
from 5.5 percent to 7.2 piece of jobs
data has pointed to D growth and not in
any way in fact if you take bank credit
growth it also it's under many many
decades for many decades you haven't had
a fall like this so economies call this
a smell test in the sense that you does
your GDP growth yeah
come accompanied with a set of other
growth indicators to say to into
layman's word this this GDP is like the
weather right you you can't tell me it
is summer when it is pouring rain
outside because as a citizen I can walk
out of my house and there are various
indications to tell me that it's
actually the monsoon season and so you
can release a report saying that it is
summer season better of
various ways in which you can actually
test that it's not summer and each of us
will actually experience this in our
lives every day it is a very similar the
smell test is very similar to that
so no indicator of the economy is
showing that GDP growth could grow at
that rapid pace
comes the IMP employment report the
employment report shows a data change
which is actually in corroboration with
other indicators like savings investment
and so on because unemployment has risen
to a 45 year old high but that report is
not released everything else so I also
have a to do an Professor Arun Kumar
I'll give you both the opportunities to
make opening statements I see your hand
up professor Kumar but massages do a
first you had a rebuttal go ahead
what is your rebuttal I think the main
issue before us is not what has not the
very fact that 108 economists
statisticians and other social
scientists have the the memorandum which
they have given today by way of a press
release but over time via the issue of
credibility of data pertaining to the
economy pertaining to certain social
factors in the economy as well as the
people who are now being involved in I
would call it redacted of data which has
been work on which has been done by
people who have traditionally done it
and who had developed a forte in
collecting and compiling that data the
very credibility of central statistics
of a statistical organization which
works at an arm's distance from the
government including the Finance
Ministry was something which was said as
late as 2016 by the current finance
minister when he was asked by it
the National Statistical Commission
which came to me set up a little earlier
under the then professors for each
Tendulkar in 2011-12 I think D was
precisely to make sure that there is a
significant difference between the
government which uses the data which
makes policy measures which makes
programs based on it and the people who
collect the data if we mix up the two
which is what we seem to be happening or
drifting towards making it cause that
Nita yolk we have involved in and given
it a virtually veto position for
instance in the employment data the
central statistic the National
Statistical Commission earlier had a
member of the Planning Commission as its
ex officio member and now nithya oh very
fine because the requirement of the way
you want the data to be presented could
come from the user on how the data can
be made more user-friendly but that does
not give or did not give any veto power
vetoing power of our report otherwise
prepared by the National Statistical
Commission - one member of the nithya
yoga as seems to have been currently
taken over saying right all right we
have your report but I don't agree with
it so I'll take it to my Master's in the
DT I know and thereafter the data would
be released that's something which
cannot by any stretch of imagination be
accepted by the intellectual community
by the users of the data policy makers
themselves because the credibility is at
doubt because there's a conflict of
reference yes absolutely people give me
for interrupting us to do it but I'm
running out of time and I want to bring
in Professor Kumar the chair professor
of theories through social sciences
professor Kumar you've had your hand up
I'll ask you a straightforward question
is India's national data right now
credible do you trust it well
the problem face is that data has been
routinely manipulated you know for
instance the budget data is routinely
manipulated where you show a lower
fiscal deficit you show higher revenues
and higher expenditures but what has
happened now is an abnormal kind of
manipulation that is taking place and
what is the abnormality we must
understand that the abnormality is that
a where the data is not convenient it is
now being said we don't have data at all
for instance on employment the
government has said we don't have data
you know now the problem is if you don't
have employment data especially of the
unorganized sector then how do you
measure the unorganized sectors
contribution to GDP because that's a
crucial data point so therefore when you
say that that means you don't have you
in GDP data and if GDP data is not there
then how do you claim it 7% rate of
growth in the economy the other is that
all data is based on certain assumptions
you know and these assumptions can be
tweaked like for instance in the data
series for GDP the assumptions have been
tweaked to show that the entir time the
rate of growth is higher than what it
was during the UPA period so usually GDP
is rias tomater
based on the change in the base year
that's the normal but the assumptions
that are made they have to be gone
through with you know what is happening
is that suddenly the knee TI Olga start
as some other Department of the
government says that we are going to
withhold the data and we are going to
revise it but every time there's a
revision we know that it has to go
through some commission or a committee
which then approves that methodology you
can't do that arbitrarily so that it
suits you so I think what's happening is
that the manipulation is taking place in
a very large level and this manipulation
is not only in employment but also in
GDP and also in you know as you said the
crime Bureau also in the case of
Agriculture and the suicides that are
taking place in agriculture so in other
words the the manipulation of data today
has gone to one step higher than what it
has been earlier and I think that's what
the economies are agitated about and
that's what brings down the credibility
of the data of the Indian economy yes
that then impacts our international
reputation it
also means policymaking become more
difficult because policymaking requires
data now the question is what is the
data government is using for making its
policy if it says it doesn't have
employment data and then it says we have
to create so many CRO jobs it said that
mudra loans have created three crore
jobs but now the mudra the data
unemployment is being withheld because
probably it's not showing that and all
the experts were saying that mudra could
never have created three crore jobs you
know because after all the average loan
was only about forty-five thousand
rupees whereas the average investment in
us a micro unit about two and a half
lakhs so therefore one job cannot be
created with just forty five thousand
rupees of loan and that's what probably
the data shows of government's
policymaking becoming a problem and
what's happening is government had
claimed too much the government was
claiming too much and the data is not
showing that and that's why the
government is withdrawing this at the
moment I see professor radhika fira has
her hand up she's had a hand up for a
while I want to give her an opportunity
to come in yes we make ready just before
that professor Cairo please go ahead
yeah so I was actually thinking about
you know why chartered accounts
accountants should or should not
intervene in this debate and I think
there you know it's very fair for them
to think about this issue and to respond
but the problem with that response is
that it's misrepresenting our concerns
so they seem to be saying that we have
an objection to the change in base and
actually they're saying that's not not
not the problem at all the problem that
we are raising is something else so if
they were responding to our concerns and
they had intervened it would have been
perfectly fine the other strain in the
letter is to raise questions about us
being politically motivated and again I
think that's a good thing that people
should be suspicious and should ask
questions I would say that the people
should also be equally suspicious of
government claims but just on that one
point let me say that you know a similar
problem arose with the previous
government with the National Family
Health Survey data because the previous
rounds had shown hardly any improvement
and the government at that time UK - got
a lot of flack for it what did they do
they completely did
they tried to disband the National
Family Health Survey fourth-round but
because there was a lot of pressure from
a lot of us writing in the newspapers
etc ultimately they were forced to
implement that survey so in that time
some pressure worked in this time like I
said Professor nagaraj has been writing
consistently for years he's been writing
not just in this government's term but
even in the previous governments term
but when your inputs are not being taken
when they're given in good faith and
they're not taken on board then we feel
that we were you know well within our
rights to raise these issues in the
manner that we did if there's just one
move in it I can take you know one
dangerous fall out of this and some
people have highlighted it but there's
one particular aspect which is that the
government is telling us don't look at
NSS which has been the most reliable
source look at uber and Ola employment
pressing don't look at NSS or
in the National Family Health Survey for
sanitation look at a survey done by
Quality Control Council of India they're
not really well placed to do this so you
know data is a public go that was the
first sentence of our letter and there
is a reason why the Gov it should be
undertaken by the government the
government needs to be kept a watch on
but in VA a lot of us have done it in
the past not just with this government
but previous governments going back to
1990 2000 you know it's for some of us
so I feel people should you know listen
to the concerns that we are raising and
not waste time on just mudslinging or
casting aspersions but look at the
content of the concerns well let's
actually stick with the concerns Vivek
Reddy of the BJP wants to respond to
make ready why is it that since tea
monetization the numbers on the farmer
suicides in India have not been released
well hey let me just clear up what
others have said because the right like
I wanted to intervene first of all the
the claim yes you know I will come back
to your question also first of all
regarding data on jobs and other data
India is a vast country and the earlier
methodologies of collecting data were
flawed so therefore the government moved
to a different architecture
this was one no that's not correct I
would have really placed some reliance
on the on the letter of The Economist's
learned I would have really placed some
concern or some you know we were given
some credibility to the letter of these
economies if they had addressed certain
criterias or certain standards that have
been coming out in the past few months
and certain statistics of the World Bank
unfortunately they suppressed that data
and set up an alternative story and this
the nation must know therefore the
Chartered Accountants came up and they
raised these issues I lost them okay so
it's so Vivica d out of curiosity
because I know then everybody watching
at home was going to ask this question
I'm sorry why did the government get
just not one or two but 121 Chartered
Accountants and couldn't you find a
single economist you have to be fair to
this discussion I'm asking I am asking
no no don't you don't have to you don't
have to jump in faith you have to listen
to the statistics forget the chart
you're lying to my audience mr.reddy how
can I not jump basics and obvi let us
ask these questions to the economist
also my question is should I not ask
these statistics which are most
pertinent and most material for the
economy of this country and these are
statistics which are proved the World
Bank takes it up my question is when
India has gone up from a 1.6 billion
economy to a 2.5 billion economy from
2014 to 2019
why can't you address that issue in York
in your letters it's not 800 eminent
economists second when India has India's
India's collections all ramadhir's
collection of Texas has jumped from 8
lakh crore to 15 lakh or crore double
from 2014 3 9 - if there is India
earning this money how is the government
earning so much of that I don't know you
honey
we're not making any money miss ready
most people will tell you they're losing
jobs at this point and our offices have
not given us raises for a while and most
basic why did you suppress that
why did you evade it oh wait no please
don't disturb me I'm asking if you're
lying to my audience mr. Reddy I have to
stop you these compelling facts it is
evident this have got a light
4.6 billion economy - correct then allow
the
hello mr. ND first of all mr. Reddy
you've started all of this but before I
go to the economists to respond to you
host already can you hear me can he hear
me he's ranting on his own during
elections and the letter of mr. aney why
is the farmer suicide data being
withheld you promised me you'd answer
that question takes away with your
argument and what I've read is the
farmer suicide data been withheld since
the monetization the government is not
hiding any facts the government will
release it is collecting data from all
the straight guy into one month will go
into election when will you release it
that select these facts all the state
governments will have to suppose service
already I will talk one more attempt to
ask you this question after which I will
move to the rest of my panelist mr.
Reddy can you hear me this is a sound
check for mr. Eddy can you hear me
static the state government the
government has to collect data they've
asked them okay why is it the Government
of India has not released this farmer
suicide data after D monetization this
was data that was released on an annual
basis I told you just now what is it I
told you just now this data is being
collected from all the state governments
it is the state governments which are
the nodal agencies they are the ones who
have the employees who will collect this
data many of the state governments have
not transmitted this data some of the
show how is it coming they confuse speed
post if they'd use we post it with every
show the number of deaths it is the
state was suppressing the data because
it's not convenient
mr. Eddie thinks we are all a source of
state governments ok let's have a debate
we will give you statistics of the state
governments which have not reported I
will give you statistics all right let
me have a debate let me point out to you
that the central government I'm asking
this fundamental question are these
economies avoiding true facts asking
questions would you allow me to ask
questions now I just want to point out
to our audience that's the data ok cut
is like the data that we are actually
showing on screen and the data that we
are talking about was released on an
annual basis by various ministries of
government and a lot of that data just
hasn't come seen you could see it on
your screen right now hasn't been
released since 2008
in 2013 2014 2015 in some cases and that
could continue to run on your screen but
let's attempt to get answers to the
questions raised by Vivek ready
professor am Kumar here's the question I
use suppressing data and not
acknowledging what the world bank said
in your letter when you drafted it no no
let me just answer some of the pointed
questions that have been raised yes we
are collecting data on farmer suicides
from the states that's completely wrong
because every state police headquarters
has a Statistics Department
yes which collects farmers who said data
through the F IRS that have been filed
in police stations yes that has been
sent to the center or in some states
they will send to the center it's true
because in such cases the data have been
reported as zero in the earlier in CRV
reports those states who did not send
the reports their data has been reported
as zero yes the NCR we actually put the
state wise but it'll just say zero zero
zero order - yes whatever it is so that
has been the system in the past now
coming to the second so that it's very
clearly not the question of States not
sending data even if the states did not
send the data it has been released in
the past one time yes no number one
number two the methodology of the
employment service have changed from
2011-12 and 2017-18 that's also
completely untrue
what determines the methodology what
determines a comparability are the same
concepts followed are the same same
definitions followed is the same
sampling framework followed is the same
is the way in which sample is drawn
followed exactly the same and is the way
in which data is collected from the
ground by investigators the same all are
the same the only difference between
2011-12 and 2017-18 dr. Mohan has
clarified earlier in another few days
back it is that an additional
repeat visits to urban households have
been added to the survey framework now
that does not in any way change the
comparability of 2011-12 and 2017-18 now
the other point that has been that the
spokesperson did not raise it but others
in his party and nithya yoga have raised
it which is that the sample
size has come down from 2011-12 in 2017
18 it says some don't but it is still
adequate to draw a result at 55 thousand
households have been surveyed so there
is no change in the concepts definitions
framework between 2011-12 and 2017 18
they are perfectly comparable and let me
also bring in a professor Kara because
you signed on this letter have you
ignored the world bank's data on the
fact that India is the fastest growing
economy not taking that into
consideration when you wrote this letter
I think the issue is not just of the
growth rate its the divergence in the
estimates that even the government is
putting out one time you get a certain
rate growth rate another time you get
another growth rate at some times they
put up some data on their website then
they take it down that's where the
concern lies see we it's not as if we
are going to feel happy if the growth
rate is lower we are obviously going to
feel happy if the growth rate is higher
right all we want is that the sanctity
of the data which was in any case in
danger has always been a matter of
political it seems to have reached
another level in the past few years I
mean I certainly don't recall and I may
be wrong but I don't recall peat members
of the Planning Commission a sorry of
the statistical Commission having to
resign that post because they are so fed
up with your and he said in his article
that basically there was no respect for
their work and they felt redundant there
so I think that really is the issue and
it would be good to get into the nitty
gritties of these issues rather than
just having to for both these charges of
being politically motivated yes
I've also to give an opportunity to
Professor Arun Kumar to respond you've
had your hand up and I can see but
actually do as well
professor Kumar very quickly do you do
you want to respond to Vivek ready yeah
yeah so Vivek ready said that the tax
collection has gone up you know this is
always the case because as inflation
takes place and as output Rises the tax
collection Rises the question is what
has happened to the
GDP ratio the tax GDP ratio has not
changed
even though the direct activity ratio
has risen by about 0.6% but the indirect
at GDP ratio has come down so that has
not risen so that shows that the growth
rate cannot be in measured based on the
direct at GDP ratio or the indirect tax
rate periscope second point is that the
World Bank does not collect independent
data so the World Bank only takes the
government data now the government says
that we don't have data and the
government says we will not release the
data or the government says nobody has
reliable data then the World Bank would
also have to conclude that so in other
words when the government says we don't
have data on unemployed employment and
unemployment and therefore unorganized
sector data is not reliable and not
available then the GDP data is not
reliable and the World Bank would end up
having to say that that's also the case
that you know this data is not viable
so my argument is after demonization the
unorganized sector declined because of
the shock and the GST added to the shock
so the rate of growth of the economy is
less than 1 percent it's not 7 percent
with the unorganized sectors declining
and that the government says we don't
have data on if it doesn't have data on
unorganized set that means it's only
dependent on the organized sector data
and the organized sector may be growing
according to surveys by others you know
so therefore all other data shows the cm
ie whether it be the punjab around Delhi
Chamber of like this just widen to
address this organization they are
showing that these sites and therefore
the rate of growth is not 7 percent but
1 percent well said in fact I
unfortunately believe that we wake
already has not in you know he while he
questions the questions he hasn't
answered any of the questions that we
have asked at the end of the day both
economists are all saying is very clear
none of the indicators none of the
indicators around us so basically how
much money are we saving and that money
that number is available with the RBI
they release it every year if you're not
making any money you're not saving any
money it won't show up in household
savings how many jobs are we actually
creating this away how many we've lost
that number is available and there is
data that has been relied on for the
last 40 years to turn around now
today before an election and say this
data has been wrongly calculated from a
very respected organization within the
government that has been telling various
government what's what for the last 40
years is not okay to withhold data that
is not convenient at this point but how
many farmers have killed themselves in
the last couple of years is not okay
there are two things we have to be
worried about in the global community
countries that tamper with their own
data suffer when it comes to receiving
investments from the world and secondly
all government decisions are made based
on data like this if there's no data are
either not making decisions are you
making wrong decisions when you're
shooting in the dark and that's not good
for anybody either we understand that
there is an election coming up but that
shouldn't in any way stand in the way of
the normal course of business and it
will not in any way stop us from asking
questions because that is our job and
that is our right remember of viewers
the people who ask questions whether
economists or journalists are the real
chocodiles thanks for watching

good evening in January last year the
current union government announced the
details of electoral bonds as a system
it was meant to cleanse the political
funding in our country and to move to a
cashless economy now this bond allows
citizens to donate money to political
parties through the banking system using
a kyc compliant account of the donor and
the money goes into the bank account of
the political party that's verified by
the Election Commission sounds fantastic
and it would serve the purpose of moving
all of this funding into the official
white money system the bonds though do
not bear the name of the donor and so
while the bank knows who's donated the
money the general public does not the
donation is tax deductible of course for
the donor and the political party but
they've been some serious questions
raised about the anonymity and the
secrecy that these bonds encourage now
in earlier rules any company or a
corporate donating money to politics
very strict no company could donate any
more than seven and a half percent of
its profits and it needed to have been
in business for at least three years to
have made a donation it also needed to
declare the name of the party that the
money has gone to now in this new system
it been some modifications all of those
requirements have been moved on and the
criticism is that it opens up the system
to shell companies and loss-making
companies being used as a funnel to
bring in political donations foreign
companies can also now donate
anonymously drawing criticism that black
money that's currently being stashed in
tax havens like the remember the paramo
papers will be given a clear route back
into the country into politics and the
last big criticism is while only the
bank is supposed to know the details of
the donors the banks report to the
central government because these are
public sector banks giving the
government in power the ability to
single out the people who are donating
to other parties now a lot of these
changes were moved in into a money bill
which did not necessarily require the
approval of the rajasah but we didn't
see the
position put up a very strong fight
perhaps because a lot of the political
parties realize that's what what's good
for the goose is good for the gander at
some point everybody is going to profit
from it
a former chief election commission
Naveen chavala called these bonds a
greater method of camouflage that fails
to address the issue of black money with
been a year so let's take a look at
where the money has gone according to
ADR in the last financial year the BJP
has received the lion's share of 1030
crore rupees
in comparison the nearest competitor the
Congress has received 200 crore rupees
but can also be argued that this is a
direct result of the popularity of the
BJP the problem is that 53% of the total
funds received by political parties have
come from unknown sources and you and I
will never know where that money came
from 31% of that money came through
electoral bonds so here are the
questions we have to ask do electoral
bonds in fact increase the thickness of
the wheel and make political funding
more opaque
if someone funds a political party
heavily does it encourage crony
capitalism so will these parties return
favors to those who have funded them
when they're eventually in power and
finally if that's the case you and I as
citizens deserve to know where political
money is coming from it's an extremely
important conversation to have on the
eve of the big elections on the show
with me today mobile Khan for the
Congress gen major-general an invert my
head of the association for democratic
reforms ADR that's put out it's very
infuse full information
Pascal Yash for the BJP we will also
have Prashant Bhushan senior advocate
with the Supreme Court and you gain
three other of national president of
Suraj India join us and are very
grateful for the time all of you
gentlemen have given us but say either
of my first question to you we've all
seen the data put out by ADR do you
believe that electoral bonds actually
make the problem worse and allow for
money to come in that nobody can trace
in this country we've had a lot of
discussion about electoral reforms
everyone agrees finance reforms are
absolutely critical to electoral reforms
this electoral bond scheme is not a
reform it is a deform I have no doubt in
my mind that this is the biggest
regressive step ever taken in the
history of electoral reforms we are not
one but several steps behind where we
were four or five years ago and the
reasons are very clear that you have
mentioned electoral bonds do not come by
themselves there are three changes that
have taken place in the electoral
funding legislation one foreign
companies are now allowed to donate why
are a yr is Indian subsidiary Prashant
Bhushan G's in the show he would tell
you what exactly happened to Congress
and BJP because he was actually taking
up the case - there is no limit to how
much you can donate so your company may
have earned 10 lakh rupees last year but
you can donate 10 crore rupees you can
donate 200 crore rupees there is no
limit and third is this electoral bond
what it does is that illegal money can
now be given in a legal form so
hypothetically if someone wants someone
did a deal let us say in Mauritius and
someone was beholden to a ruling party
and wanted to give them ten thousand
crore rupees all they now need to do is
to have a shell company which is an
extension of that foreign company here
in India give them ten thousand crore
rupees that ten thousand crore rupees
will be passed to the ruling party the
bank would know that this company gave
ten thousand crore rupees they would not
know who received it ruling party of
course would know that they were given
by whom no one else can find out but if
by mistake
that person gives it to an on ruling
party then the government and the ruling
party would know a because banks are
reporting to them be as it was found out
through investigative report there are
invisible numbers written on this
electoral bond so the government always
knows this is the most pernicious
possible change that we've had in the
system of electoral reforms that makes
it more opaque and this is a systematic
manner of really capturing the politics
of this country through black money very
well said in fact we also have Major
General Anil Varma with us
Major General Varma released the data
that that we're facing this report on if
you could tell us what your opinion has
been after looking at this data do you
believe this is purely actually can be
attributed to the popularity of the BJP
or do you think do you actually believe
that rules have been relaxed to allow
for anonymous funding BJP has been
receiving the maximum amount of
donations right from 2013 onwards
probably the sense is that
the corporates back the winning horse
that's my view but the point is that mr.
Chaddha was already mentioned a bit
about it it's actually related to our
fcra case which he briefly touched upon
in which the BJP and Congress were found
guilty of accepting foreign funds and
Delhi High Court had indicted them so
firstly they amended the FCRA Act you
know the earlier one the 1976 one which
was already superseded by the FCRA of
2010 and everything was amended I mean
even a dead law was amended to let BJP
and Congress off the hook but that is
another story so to come up with this
scheme which in the Finance Minister in
the Parliament also and in his various
press conference he's been mentioning
two things one that it increases the
transparency of political funding and
second thing he says the aim of the
scheme was to hide the identity of the
donors because they expect
reprisals from the opposition party if
the other party comes to power as in
when now these are contradictory things
that is one the second thing is that
none of the political parties came up
strongly against this thing because as
he mentioned they probably think
whichever is the party in power will
benefit by this scheme only CPI has
filed a PIL along with a dia I mean it
they are not joined they filed it
separately and that had been heard by
the Supreme Court last week and because
we had then filed what you call another
petition as to why this electoral bond
scheme should be permitted just before
the election we should put there should
be a stay on the matter so the
government counsel asked for more time
and Supreme Court has now fixed a date
for 26th March so let's see what will
happen on that day but I also want to
flag another issue that an RTI activist
had you know found out from the ministry
because if you recall in the Rajya Sabha
in December session a question was
raised by an MP Sri nadim all Huk
pertaining to the electoral bonds and
the Minister of State replied that they
are not aware that the Election
Commission had taken a stand against the
electoral bonds
now when the RTI activists asked for all
those documents and he got those and he
has submitted them to the MP who had
raised the question it was quite evident
that the Minister of State had stated
the statement was far from truth because
Election Commission has raised
objections to the scheme right from the
beginning yes it is there in writing and
it is there with the Ministry of law and
justice and the Ministry of law and
justice has referred the matter to the
Economic Affairs Department
yes Economic Affairs Department is not
applied in fact
the minister said we do not have any
information about it so that is yes yes
just to take our viewers through what
you are talking about the amendments
that were made in order to change the
rules of how political parties are
funded the Election Commission actually
said this is a retrograde step as far as
transparency of donations is concerned
this is a provision that needs to be
withdrawn and it another point it said
this amendment opens up the possibility
of shell companies being set up for the
sole purpose of making donations to
political parties no other businesses of
consequence will will be you know will
be interested in this
it has also said non-disclosure of
political contribution by companies in
the profit and loss account would
compromise transparency so the Election
Commission has very clearly said that
these electoral bonds are not a good
thing
Pascal Ghosh of the BJP why did the
government of India push through
electoral bonds that are obviously non
transparent not good for democracy and
not good for the citizens whose money is
being funneled back into India into
political funding mr. Ghosh
see I was just sharing all my panelists
starting from mr. yoga NYADA and
everybody has has the opinion like it
was an it was an doesn't methodology or
a conduit in order to stash the black
money out of disk from the external
source to internal in inside a country
but I really surprised that if you see
that before mm before in the induction
of this particular what was the
situation in India you know how the
political funding was taking place there
was a huge amount of cash and black
money was was used as a political we can
see resources for winning the elections
now we want to put an end to it so let
us let us see that what exactly this is
first of all these bonds are nothing but
like promissory notes and it has got lot
of safety valves it has to be bought
from the SBI number one number two let
me let me ask you specific questions you
said if I don't explain know I've
already explained it mr. Ghosh
I'm asking a specific questions you said
what was the situation before these
rules were brought out no company could
donate more than seven-and-a-half
percent of their annual profit no
company could donate if it wasn't
already three years but I was actually
stickily no no fair take it holistically
let me answer he looked at with a
fine-tooth comb mr. Ghosh you have
funding loosen up why did you allow
bonds for shell companies to fund and
this is the Election Commission saying
it first of all first of all there is no
no that's what I'm answering let me
answer let me answer or otherwise let me
hear only what I'll say the first
question is that this particular system
is absolutely transparent from three
angle number one even the donor has got
an identity proof in front of the bank
there's no question of any illegal money
to be pumped in number to the receiver
even the receiver the the political
parties has to be registered under
section 21 a of the people who visibly
act and they should at least get one
percent of the board that is there mr.
Ghosh you are leading out give me an
answer mr. Gould just give me an answer
why have you relaxed the rules of
political funding from corporates have
you relaxed the rules from foreign aid
digital and cashless economy cashless
does not mean clean mr. Ghosh we you and
I both know it even the foreign entity
who has been funding how do you pre
assume how do you assume that it is a
black money I'll tell you this is your
property and may I please answer that
question proper channel into you what a
black money is what proper channel what
proper channel is it coming through do
you know that up until the BJP touched
this no computing the money has coming
from as a no company that didn't hold
50% India State why it was 7.5 percent
can you answer me why do you 7.5 percent
because loss-making companies which are
effectively shell companies that
actually don't do any business at all
have no business donating to political
parties which is why they shouldn't
donate more than 7 and a half percent of
their annual profits but if you take off
that rule then a company that does no
business and makes no profit will start
to donate which means that it's just a
shell it is being used as a conduit to
move money into politics
do you have another question for me even
I accept even I accept your your
argument that shell company will
transfer their money so my argument is
the elections tamesha but they have to
be kyc complained there will be trailing
me so by the bank about the system of
money route mr. Basham sure not do not
listen to me don't take my word for it
don't take we say ok the others were for
it don't take me to general Anil Varma's
word for it can you take the Election
Commission's word on something the
election
mission says and I quote this amendment
opens up the possibility of shell
companies being set up for the sole
purpose of making donations to political
parties rebut and we offer a rebuttal to
the particular argument by the
Commission okay I object because you
should really objection yeah because me
of course the argument is if it's not
proper I will object obviously I have
all right to object
though Election Commissioner is not
Supreme Court so first this money if it
is routed through a shell company he's
properly trailed identified and tracked
by the banks okay all right it's not
another route to check the shell
companies to move their illegal assets
to it into the country so it is a
digital transaction of it we are heading
towards a digital cashless transaction
for we're in individual to a corporate
to even a shell company will be
identified and proper action I won't
just remind you Sebastian once to
Mauritius and Bernama and to other tax
havens it was not sent in suitcases it
actually gets sent from bank accounts
the question is the anonymity of not
knowing where the money comes from but
your gains we gather would you like to
offer mr. Ghosh a rebuttal on this shell
company route and why he believes that
this is actually a positive transparent
method
I think you've already answered it the
Election Commission clearly puts it out
the fact so let's say you meet a kyc
compliant company so all you know is who
is the person so so basically as I said
let's imagine a scenario where I'm
sitting abroad
I've made some twenty thousand crore
rupees out of favours in an
international deal let us say an
aircraft b and i want to send 10,000
crore rupees back to my political
beneficiary party in india
all i need to do is to open a subsidiary
in india transfer that money yes that
subsidiary would have proper account it
would be kyc compliant but basically no
one in the world would be able to find
out that i offered a bribe and i
actually managed to give my benefactor
that bribe of ten thousand crore rupees
because that bribe would no longer be
bribe it would be perfectly legal
transfer and the recipient would be
perfectly correct in law
is that it actually legitimize this
bribe and the other question that has
repeatedly been asked what so my friend
says if the company is foreign how does
it matter because it is legitimate now
the question is is it B gp's official
position I thought BJP used to talk
about nationalism is the BJP then
officially saying what is wrong and
receiving foreign money foreign money is
alright if this is nationalism god save
us from this form of nationalism
very well said Mahmoud Kanaan joins us
of the Congress and I will give you an
opportunity to to rebut yes but it
exists case one second one second as
soon as the others have had an
opportunity to make their opening
statements Mohammed Khan of the Congress
no one in the opposition put up a fight
when electoral bonds were introduced and
when the laws were modified isn't that
because effectively all political
parties see this as an advantage Oh
basicity for everybody means you all get
to make money and the rules are Lucifer
everyone the only loser here
is the Indian citizen mamma-jamma not
act on it gives me great pride to tell
you and we've had this debate on mirror
now at least twice before that on
January 3rd 2018 the Congress party and
mr. and Eve since ravallo who's the head
of our communications department held a
press conference solely on this issue we
call this a regressive measure we said
it will institutionalize corruption in
fact in every single debate since then
over the course of the last year we have
put out one challenge to the BJP again
and again and I will reiterate that
challenge for your viewers all the
information as to who the donors are are
is with the SBI you don't know it I
don't know it but we challenged the BJP
please declare please make public the
names of the people who have donated to
the Congress party as long as you are
willing to declare the names of the
individuals who have donated to you as
well you have clearly benefited as per
the idea report up to 96 percent of the
donations I remember when we were
criticizing it
mr. Jaitley came out in defense and
here's a response anything it is
important for your viewers to hear this
once you tell the Congress why you
creating such a ruckus if everyone who
if anyone if a donor was petrified of
donating to you earlier because of fear
of intimidation or influenced by the
government then now they would be free
to do so
unfortunately for him we did not buy
that argument now let us come to March
of 2018 when this was introduced in
Parliament P you will recall in anyone
on any viewer can go to youtube and
watch the video of the day when this law
was presented for passenger first of all
it couldn't go to the register by it to
the money bill
so during that hour our leaders stood
and shouted on the floor of Parliament
asking for there to be a debate do you
remember how Sumitra Mahajan rushed
through the provisions of the bill but
the eye is Hamid Zi is happily I sell it
for the Prime Minister completely dark
day for democracy again we discussed it
with the provisions in the Finance Act
arethey the Finance Bill Parcells of the
pradhan mantri compressor so I have a
question for the Congress when you pass
or Oto's keep it proved against my
debate own appetite there was no debate
okay okay together who has a question
for press conference I'm giving you the
date ok public or objection to the
scheme will see otherwise a question for
mr. Khan mr. Yadav go ahead please sorry
I there's a bit of a line I have a
specific question not about electoral
bond but about that Amendment which
effectively allowed you to accept
foreign money yes through Indian
subsidiary is it not true that your
party Congress was found to be in
violation of law by Delhi High Court
like the BJP is it not true that BJP
then retracted li amended the law is it
not true that you actually supported the
bt you did not object at all to this
completely fraudulent provision are you
not guilty there yes the way I want to
answer mr. y1 questions yes Hamid Khan
well first answer this is absolutely
true one second a Delhi High Court and
I'm quoting the Delhi High Court says
over the last two years one second
mama can't Delhi High Court said prima
facie the acts of the Congress and the
BJP clearly fall foul of the ban imposed
on foreign contribution of donations
accepted by political parties from
Sterlite and society or from foreign
sources within the law this was the
Delhi High Court after which the
government very quietly retrospectively
changed the law back dated to 1975 and
you voted for it in Parliament Hamid
Khan the press conferences don't matter
the votes in Parliament do okay again no
I like to call these questions got you
questions where you seem to suggest that
suddenly you've caught us or footed but
the infirmity and the contradiction lies
you can wrestle in the question itself
beavering powers for several years for
10 years to be exact and during that
point of time these causes of action
that you speak off before the Delhi High
Court arose we did not carry out any
amendments then this amendment that you
speak off and again I will draw your
attention to the
yukine the sir how was it passed it was
passed as a finance bill what is the
finance bill a bill that doesn't go to
any of the select committees in the
Rajas about where the Congress is in
majority or was in majority at that
particular point of time there was no
debate there was no scrutiny so when you
try and put this disingenuous spin and
say that you are compliant so we didn't
do it in ten years when we were in
government where we supported now and
I've told you repeatedly we have held
press conferences to give a statement of
I assume you are saying that is not
enough we've come out and said declare
what money we've received under the
scheme you are saying that is not enough
it is very easy to agree as i sir but
there is a reform happening in the
congress there is it completely
different way of thinking about these
things now and I can tell you certainly
you should be welcoming itself
all right Prashant Bhushan joins us as
well we see others just one second mr.
Prashant Bhushan
here's requested electoral bonds simply
designed to bring in money that keeps
the citizen in the dock do you believe
the electoral bonds are an act of a
precocity mr. Bhushan yes no doubt about
it because the whole purpose of
electoral bonds is to keep the donor
anonymous that's the status stated
purpose of the electoral bonds and
they've made changes in the
representation of people act in the
Companies Act so that the companies
don't have to declare so that the
Election Commission is not informed it
is designed to keep the donor secret
from everybody except the government
because the banks which he showed his
electoral bond that controlled by the
government and only the banks can come
to know who the persons are who have
purchased these electoral bonds and they
can find out which party hasn't cashed
those electoral bonds other than the
government nobody not even the Election
Commission can know who the donor is and
as you gain the other rightly pointed
out this is now a legalized way of
allowing
bribe-taking and bribe giving to take
place and you three changes which have
been made are all very very
actually what we needed was a greater
transparency in electoral funding
greater set of rules to prevent
overspending by candidates etc a law to
restrict spending by political parties
bringing the parties under the RTI law
making parties and candidates cashless
but instead of doing that electoral
bonds are brought in credit for
including of electoral of political
parties is brought in and he limit on
corporate donations to political parties
and corporate political donations which
was earlier seven and a half percent of
the annual profits that has been removed
so now this government which claims to
be talking about amid they call these
reforms it's very interesting that this
complete deformation of transparency in
electoral funding is being called a
reform by this government which is now
tom-toms that maybe chalky tar mess of
chalky dar may Machoke either and so on
a chalky dar who has allowed all this
non-transparent getting a political turn
i must answer yes i should be given
solution using the word chalky that is a
concept we are doing the chalky dari you
know i have a right to defend my buddy
i will give you that i will give you
that opportunity but if you don t
somebody will bring it up mr. Ghosh it's
not it's not a word that nobody else in
the country can use if you just allow
him to finish making a statement and you
can respond to him straight off mr.
Bhushan please finish yes that he forms
are called reforms a person who has
looted this country who has allowed
these persons who looted this country to
flee this country who has allowed Ambani
to take the missions etc and there a
file he'll he is calling himself either
I mean it it's a complete travesty of
manner at which words are being used in
this thing all right hang on we have to
now allow Oscar goes to respond Pascal
gosh three points of response foreign
funding why was it necessary to allow
for more foreign funding interpolated
why do foreign companies need to invest
in Indian political parties second
question why did we allow corporates to
invest or fund limitlessly political
parties and number three electoral bonds
actually brought in only to make the
system opaque faster oh sure
no I will answer one by one so I will
take a test case was mr. Joginder Yadav
as mentioned that any company can form a
subsidy company in India and that
through that company they can they can
bring the black money and donate
political way it's wrong the whole test
case is absolutely wrong because the
moment you create a subsidy company in
India and you bring any money to the
bank channels until unless you justify
and and you give the proper project so
the reason for getting the money no bank
in country end up in the present law we
have a strong banking regulations now
will allow this money to come into the
country forget about political donations
no company no bank will allow it to come
into the mainstream in mainstream the
financial circuits so therefore simply
by creating a subsidy company and coming
from a money from Banana Republic it's
simply impossible so the test case which
has been presented by mr. hodda I can't
understand why it's impossible mr.
Shue's there are no laws that prevent it
we are allowing the foreign company to
come with this test case you just talked
about there is no you will start a money
into this country no because you have to
show the reason but for the money has
come to India non-denial is the circuits
can you show me one example funding a
political party political funding that's
the reason know what pull it if you say
a political funding yes say yeah okay
okay fine
suppose you mentioned that is a
political
funding the moment you say the political
funding it is identified it is not
unidentified money that this is the
amount of money you are saying the
political funding especially scrutinized
by so many authorities mr. Ghosh it's
identified to the government that is
receiving the funding why isn't it
public to the rest of the country this
information is not public to the rest of
the country I just want to give a major
general anil verma an opportunity to
respond first it is really identified
where it is the identified by the bank
bank is not the government o bank is not
the government is owned by whom mr.
Ghosh thank you saundh by the government
let me answer the second question one
second please please one second mr.
Ghosh gentlemen a warm up will rebut and
then I come back to your second question
all right it's just a little revolver go
ahead please all right okay see the
banks have got nothing to do with the
shell companies they are in no way you
know they they are not enable to find
out whether this is a shell company they
are just checking in address and
somebody's name and that is the cave I
see that's it so the money can be rude I
mean they are such in genuine suede in
which people you know root money we all
know about it so this nobody can know
only State Bank and the Reserve Bank of
India and perhaps the government they
hope they will be knowing so it is very
evident like now almost 30 percent of
the donations in the unknown source
category are from electoral bonds which
was not there earlier and as per the
denominations if you go ninety percent
of these are in one crore rupee bonds
and ten percent are in ten lakh category
bonds there are no bonds of lower
denominations which are being sold very
miniscule number so is there some
individual going to buy this it is very
obvious that it is the corporates which
are buying these electron bonds so if
the corporates are buying in such huge
numbers and this that's what we are
saying a ceiling is important a ceiling
on the political parties expenditure is
important nothing
happened we've got a PL running for the
election expenditure ceiling also
nothing has happened on that and the
other issues which are raised political
party is not coming under RTI so how can
the common man get to know where is this
fund coming from it's obvious yes it
becomes absolutely absolutely your you
want to respond to your test case answer
that Oscar goes provided that it would
never be able to come into India I'm
amazed I mean what is you mean to say
you open an account in a bank and say
I'm bringing 1000 crore rupees in their
bank and the bank will say no will not
accept it please explain us the reason
why you are bringing that rupee sir
which is the law when does it happen I
mean this is weird but Prashant Bhushan
D is here he should probably answer
these things this is an astonishing
statement we shall not examine it but
the banks will examine it is not in my
extraordinary justifications being mr.
Bhushan mr. Bhushan do you want to
respond to that in you say let's take
the case of this row file now des all
sets up a subsidiary in India and that
subsidiary gets money from these what
are called offset contracts and from the
Government of India and out of that
money they want to donate let's say
thousand corrode the five thousand
crores to the BJP by way of kickbacks
for giving them this deal nothing
prevents them from doing that and
nothing prevents them from not
disclosing this amount to anybody in
fact by law this amount this kickback
paid BJP through electoral bonds by this
decimal company subsidiary in India will
not be known to anybody not even to the
Election Commission so you have a
straight legalized way of it backs take
back one thing companies hit back and
that's why ninety-six percent of the
funding has gone to the BJP if somebody
were to examine it most of
again again so actually you know what
Baskar goes as straight this all of this
would be laid to rest one second all of
this would be laid to rest if the names
of the people who have donated this 1030
crore rupees to the party were released
just give us the names it would put
everything to rest it would solve all
these problems if the names were made
public would the government make the
names public why are those names kept
secret fee pay by the name what yeah
what is the reason what is the reason
this name has not been publicized in
order to protect them from the wrath of
the opposition the opposition has mr.
Wasco but when they come to the power
they may identify them and take the
wrath is it to protect the donors free
operation is it to protect or is it to
protect the powerful from the wrath of
the common man because if we found out
know this donors from the opposition in
order to protect them from the wrath of
the opposition you have a majority in
the house right now
you rule most of the states you are
constantly talking about a Congress
mocked Bharat what Rock does his
opposition have if you are so powerful
what are you talking about no we are the
largest part largest political party of
the world so we are receiving 1000 crore
which is Congress's ring one fifth of
that but even before this law nobody
knows how much Congress has received
okay very quick question suta mama's son
was not will the Congress party will the
Congress party reverse these changes if
you come to power or is it so
comfortable right now that you are all
in it together we would be hypocrites
and I can tell you this so on your
channel we would be hypocrites if we did
not reveal repeal this I am certain that
when we come to power this will be one
of the first things that we remove we
have spoken or vociferously
we have been some of the most vocal
critics of it I don't see why that
upsets some people in this panel I would
like to add to what prashanta was also
saying not only I have you
institutionalized corruption you've also
made it tax-free because the person
who's giving this bribe is getting a tax
exemption there's also a parallel
Amendment which says that whoever you as
an individual or the company donate to
you cannot keep you do not have to keep
that information that information
doesn't have to exist it's privileged
communication so again you can give
money you will get the benefit but we
don't know who you've given it to and
the political party doesn't know who's
been received from it is literally one
of the worst systems without comparison
anywhere else in the world and I promise
you when we come to power this is one of
the things that we will repeal like for
example one of the things that we have
promised and I know I'm going slightly
off-topic is that the draconian law with
regard to sedition needs a relook and we
have promised to look at it in our
manifesto
and tell you what we hear on mirror now
and we will keep tabs of all of the
promises including the one to set up the
ICC in your party which you've not done
yet and the one about women's
reservation for which I will be counting
every single ticket released by your
party to see if you actually walk the
talk but on this particular topic we
will have to leave it here because at
the end of the day while mama counts as
the Congress party addressed press
conference after press conference
disagreeing with electoral bonds what
you did in Parliament is the thing that
matters the most whether or not you
support it whether or not you voted
against it at the end of the day this is
where we are there's something called an
electoral bond in this country viewers
and the laws around funding of political
parties have been relaxed to a point
where foreign companies can send in
money without you and I finding out who
that company is corporates can put in
money without us ever finding out who's
donated what to how much and a lot of
the money that's coming in right now is
from unknown sources what happens when
you have large amounts of money being
donated to a political party to help
them win that political party will have
to return the favor
to those corporates and foreign
companies when they come into power
that's what you call crony capitalism
nowhere else in the world in any other
developed country and we'd like to think
that we're as good as a developed
country if not better nowhere else in
the world is political funding anonymous
everywhere else in the world you were
supposed to declare where your money
came from who gave it to you and how
much we demand demand that information
about donations to political parties be
made public and political parties be
made subject to RTI so we know where the
money is coming from because if we work
for you and you use that power to pay
back some corporate the citizens of
India demand that information thanks for

Parrikar of this was one of the
respected leaders of not only of Cova
but we can say of India since morning we
have seen that us from 6:00 a.m. or
early the morning people were waiting at
the BJP headquarters that particular
venue was chosen just for the BJP
workers and we should be leaders but all
the people from his constituency the
common man we can say that because he
was a leader of a common man he came
there to pay their last respects a fter
that his mortal remains were taken to
Cal Academy and outside Cal Academy it's
still there is a huge queue people have
gathered in a large number to take a
last look or pay the last respect to
their leader because Manohar Parrikar
and Goa there's a kind of a connection
that no one will forget he had done a
lot for kava the Goa which we see right
now the develop go why he was the we can
say the backbone behind this entire
development architect of this entire
development as we speak about Manohar
Parrikar true yes RSS in 90s asked him
that he should enter into active
politics and he should spread a BJP
throughout the governed what the
glorious days which of BJP is visibly
seeing right now or which appear seen in
fast it's just because of Manohar
Parrikar so he was he used to work
relentlessly since morning I've given
one example again I would like to tell
our viewers that when he was in the US
for the medical treatment that time also
he used to take regular follow-up from
his cabinet ministers about the proposal
and especially the proposals which which
work on which which were having the
concern of a common man like a road
development a bridge development kind of
projects he used to take a regular
follow-up and he had asked them to put
all such projects
the project that's why we saw that there
was and tremendous a gathering which had
come to pay last respect to a murder
paragraph in that gathering we saw that
some people from various walks of life
have come up they were small children
there were young students or we can say
the young rigor was also there and all
and I I could see that everyone's eyes
was moist when they just came out of the
BJP headquarter so certainly it was a
wave it is a very emotional moment not
only for entire punch him because
Manohar Parrikar's constituency was a
punch him but it is for entire Goa and
especially for the NGO of BJP because
they have lost but there he loved cm who
work till last day of his life
frightened by you - we do know that
Manohar Parrikar's final journey is
going to begin a short time from now
could you just take us through the shed
you and I'll be expecting the Prime
Minister and BJP president Amit Shah to
be walking along with him Denis last
ride journey as well yeah certainly of

Goutham Miramar Beach where the final
cremation and the final whites will
happen right Prime Minister Narendra
Modi accompanied by Nirmala Sitharaman
they're paying respect and extending his
cologne condolences to an inconsolable
family of Manohar Parrikar now my arrest
somebody from accross everyone from
across the political spectrum I beg you
pardon us pay respect to him he was
actually the original armored me
Chief Minister he was extremely
accessible he was somebody who would
you'd see standing in queues he was
somebody who had no pretense about him
at all
certainly and if you ask anyone in
pungent constituency or endo or they
will say that Manohar Parrikar was very
much accessible to them we have seen
that leaders once become MLA or MP or
they start eating themselves as a VVIP
and they expect the same from the from
their voters or from the common man but
he was not like that as since yesterday
is not of our own guest panelists I have
shared their views that how model
protocol used to stand in the queue of a
bolding of plain or else even for that
matter during the elections I have seen
that even heat early in the morning at
7:00 7:15 he came to cast his vote in
Punjab he stood in a queue then he car
then along with the queue he went ahead
he cast his vote and then he came out so
certainly he was a man of a discipline
and that's why he was regarded as a
taskmaster let me share one view Manik
one of the experience or we can say the
memory of mother Parrikar that - when he
was in I just said that when he was in
the u.s. that time also he used to keep
tab on each and everything and he used
to regularly take follow-ups and is to
ask that this task should be done
whenever any file goes to Manohar
Parrikar or even if he get some SMS from
anyone from his constituency from any
part of a grower that this is a problem
in this particular area why don't you do
anything he immediately used to ask his
officers that please get the details of
this particular thing what exactly is a
problem over there and after getting the
details he if the problem is really that
big he used to take a regular fall over
all a follow-up of that or certainly he
was a kind of a taskmaster
who or who always followed the
discipline in his life and we saw that
in last few months also that despite
being gnawed or not keeping well used to
attain the office he presented the
budget also this year and that was quite
remarkable that no one no one had
thought that Polycarp will come after
the treatment to go and he will directly
go to his house he after that
immediately he will present the budget
so certainly it was kind of a comeback
that ever even thought that model
particle had are done but unfortunately
yesterday he breathed his last at his
Tonopah
students and now Manohar Parrikar is no
more",True,en,98,0,3

Joseph has asked the attorney general ...,2019-03-14T12:33:25Z,MIRROR NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jbmVJn0n6wc/hqdefault.jpg,"right and some breaking news coming in
you're the hearing in the rough I'll
review petitions have resumed in the
Supreme Court and justice schemes Joseph
has asked the Attorney General and has
observed that the RTI has overriding
effects of the Official Secrets Act my
colleague Meenakshi Bandra joins me from
the Supreme Court with more details
Meenakshi this entire argument seems to
center on the Official Secrets Act
versus the right to information and
which one takes precedence when it comes
to disclosing information of national
importance well at write RT these are
very crucial set of arguments which are
presently underway remember 14th of
March was earlier determined as the day
when the arguments are would have
continued in the Supreme Court yesterday
we saw the after debate which was
brought on record and submitted by p.m.
Modi which is speaking for the Supreme
Court to dismiss these a batch of review
petitions and very very interestingly
when the matter commenced at around 3:10
in the afternoon today we have seen the
Attorney General again being pushed on
the back foot on this one and this has
happened because the line of questioning
adopted by the Supreme Court again seems
to have trumped the Attorney General
which is why these observations ought to
assume a lot of importance and like you
refer to Honorable Justice game yourself
of the three-judge bench is making the
observation to the Attorney General as
to how the RTI Act has overriding impact
on the Official Secrets Act so much so
that section 24 of the RTI Act has been
quoted by the Supreme Court bench which
goes on to enumerate as to how even
intelligence and security establishment
abound to give information about
corruption and human rights violations
subsequent to that the attorney has also
been handed over a circular
by Justice Joseph which is the office of
memorandum which were prepared by the
DOPT which categorically states that
file loadings are covered under section
24 of the RTI Act now the attorney was
seeking exemption of for these secrets
of materials invoking the RTI Act and
clearly the bench at this point in time
same
very unimpressed with that line of
argument as we speak Prashant Bhushan is
has resumed his counter he want to
highlight as to how the government's
reason for seeking privilege in this
case is mana fide documents according to
Christian Bhushan are already out in the
public domain in public interest and he
is also citing at least law of SP
judgment to highlight as to how the law
in India is well settled about public
interest proceeding over privileged
right Meenakshi and just for the benefit
of our viewers on a certain background
to this case because the last time the
Attorney General had claimed that
certain crucial documents was stolen and
there was quite a bit of controversy
over that statement well that's right
now that's a statement which even
efficient social is obviously it can see
later that the word stole involves were
very heavy were to have used and could
happen from has avoided but the fact of
the matter is we also saw a u-turn
coming in from the attorney after having
taken a position of the document being
stolen was in the last hearing before
the Supreme Court pertaining to the
Rafael review hearings 24 hours later
the attorney communicated as to how
there was a misinterpretation he was
merely referring to the document being
accessed in the unauthorised way and
being photocopied and produced in
Supreme Court so clearly that is yel one
line of argument of which the Supreme
Court for now does not seem very
impressed by right Bonacci bonds are
bringing us all those updates we of
course will keep coming back to you as a
raffle review hearing is underway in the
Supreme Court

Boeing called recommended grounding of
its entire global fleet of 737 max
aircraft 371 such aircrafts were in
service worldwide this after consulting
with regulators in the u.s. Boeing said
and I quote we are supporting this
proactive step out of an abundance of
caution safety is a core value at Boeing
for us as long as we have been building
airplanes and it will always be unquote
meanwhile the DGC and the aviation
ministry have assured all the Indian
passengers will not be affected by the
ongoing ban on the Boeing 737 max
aircraft from the Indian airspace
remember on Thursday out of 500 SpiceJet
flights 30 flights will be cancelled
however after meeting with the Indian
Airlines the DGCA has assured that there
will be no surge pricing on any of the
airline a special cell will be set up
for all the passengers so that they can
be informed in advance about any changes
that are being made this in fact comes
after that fatal Ethiopian Airlines
crash which killed all the 157 people on
board what was the meeting about we had
a meeting with all the airlines and the
the backdrop for this meeting was the
accident the plane a particular make of
plane being involved in in accidents and
this has happened twice so the DGC had
taken a decision a couple of days back
to issue a series of safety instructions
to the airlines and they were closely
monitoring the situation and based on
the inputs received from various
squatters last night it was decided that
by DJ's here that these planes have to
be grounded and orders were issued and
today all the airlines in the meeting
confirmed that these planes have been
grounded an important part of your press
conference was on the fare rise how will
you ensure ensure that the affairs don't
rise in this matter well I think in
today's meeting we made it very clear to
the airlines that there should be no
predatory fare fixation by by the
airlines and they assured us that they
will not do predatory fáil fixation
based on this small
order which has been small crisis which
has emerged by grounding or these planes
and the DDC also will keep a watch on
all the fails and in case it has found
that the fails are becoming unreasonable
then did you see will intervene
these are emergency situation in the
sense that spies yet they have built on
that mats because of our order then the
jet airways some issues are there anyway
their fleet has been depleted and then
also because of the closure of our
airspace on the western side this kind
of situation all the airlines are always
based in in as far as the fears are
concerned so what we have requested and
secretly has requested that means that
fear they should be kept at roughly the
same level as the 12 year before this
one of course from today itself and
tomorrow onwards the bgca will be
monitoring the how the fear movement is
there and wherever there will be need
we'll be in touch with and we'll talk to
the airlines they say now they try to
accommodate different leaders in
different land lines there we know Eddy

claimed that how they will accommodate
all their passengers and other flights
but passengers are going to bear the
brunt of it as far as the fare hike is
concerned DG sneer has categorically
said that how it's going to monitor that
in know Airlines increases its price
funds no Airlines and pleases its price
considering this current situation as of
now in fact if we check the websites
booking these tickets no significant
price hike can be seen especially in
sectors like Mumbai to Delhi Mumbai
Hyderabad Mumbai Bangalore Mumbai
Chennai Mumbai Jaipur Mumbai Ahmedabad
despite the fact that DDCA has given
instructions to the airlines but exports
aviation experts believe that it is
still going to result in to a price hike
because it's not just buys jet SpiceJet
before this Jet Airways has also
grounded its flights or conserved
because of the financial crisis they are
going through and because of this there

This new ...",2019-03-13T18:03:28Z,MIRROR NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K_ZBTNsX5AI/hqdefault.jpg,"on the debate tonight controversy has
broken out over the election calendar
for the looks of our polls last Sunday
the Election Commission announced a
seven phase looks the by-election spread
over a whopping 39 days first phase
second phase it in different third phase
23rd April 4th phase 29th April 5th
fails 6th me sixth phase 6 fails tells
me phase 719 may back in 2014 the
national elections were spread over nine
phases and was spread over 36 days the
Election Commission has said this time
with an initial over 8 crore electorate
and with nearly 10 lakh polling booths
the calendar has been designed keeping
the availability of the additional
security forces in you constraint of
availability of central forces and other
logistics requirement of security forces
for security of candidates in wake of
the recent incidents of violence in the
past recent past and keeping all other
challenges in mind and taking it keeping
the totality of used totality of views
the Commission has decided at this stage
to announce only schedule of the
Parliament election in Jammu Kashmir
political experts claim the calendar
will impact the level playing ground
while poll pundits claim the election
calendar has been designed to benefit
the BJP as controversy over the looks of
our deaths snowballs
Mironov asks will the longer Pole
schedule benefit better funded political
parties will along will share you'll
increase chances of malpractice of
violations of code of conduct will the
longer share you will freeze government
policy why account assembly polls be
held simultaneously in Jammu and Kashmir
let's debate well as citizens of this
glorious country and this very very
large democracy obviously it's a
complicated process the Election
Commissioner has detailed several times
the compulsions behind choosing these
states everything from school exams
schedules of teachers the weather the
harvest festivals in the months of April
and May and of course the possibility of
violence and security that the election
needs but there are some questions that
have been asked even though the previous
election had nine phases and this one
only has seven it's stretched over a
longer period of time there's a longer
period of time favored parties with more
money and the ability to sustain a
campaign for longer just one of the
questions we're gonna try and answer
this evening on the show with me you'll
give the regathered national president
of Swaraj India has always had through
his career a keen interest in elections
analysts Inc for the BJP are those
single / I for Congress Javed Ansari
very senior journalist but at Komara
political analyst and King Shukla and
senior journalist as well we'll start
without our political guess mr. Yadav
good evening and thank you for joining
us you raised some of these questions
yourself when the schedule was first
announced have you found the answer
satisfactory or do you believe the
longer schedule of elections actually
favors parties with more funding and
more money FIFA
first we should be careful about
critiquing the Election Commission
because it's a very responsible
institution and one should not
straightaway get into political
accusations I remember when I was a
young lecture in a university for some
reason I was tasked with the you know
this job of making timetable for my
department and it's a thankless job you
have to factor in so many things and at
the end of it it's so easy to criticize
a few things so I would resist the
temptation of that we have to be very
careful there are questions but let's
not ask wide questions let's not put
white delegations this is not a
political game here number two as far as
the overall stretch of time is concerned
this has been a long-standing issue this
election is slightly longer not
substantially longer to my mind there
has to be we have to find a way of
shortening this window but that's not to
do with this election it's a
long-standing concern addressed to
Election Commission as an institution to
my mind the real question there are two
real questions and one which has been
asked which I don't quite see the merit
of the one real question is that in
states like ERISA and West Bengal the
schedule has been stretched in ways that
doesn't seem to quite you know there are
no obvious reasons for that Orissa is a
small state not more affected by maoism
than Telangana Andhra Pradesh which go
in one phase to do Orissa in four phases
doesn't you know it doesn't make sense
and every one of us knows Arisa is one
state that the BJP is I to increase its
position say in the case with the West
Bengal that's one thing that I don't
fully understand the other is Jammu and
Kashmir every single political party
they are demanded that looks uh behind
the dancer bar should be held together
Constitution requires that it should be
done and then to say we can hold looks
of our elections but we cannot hold the
answer by elections this defies logic I
mean there has to be political logic to
it but if there is a political logic it
should be spelt out there has been
a lot of questions about Ramzan but
something that I have looked at closely
and looked at the evidence I found that
there was no merit in the allegation
about Roxanne the fact is that Ramzan is
not a one-day festival it's a it's a 1
month long religious ritual and election
window is a given window you can't
change it very much and if you look at
the constituency swear off Muslim
concentration it is not true that
constituency is with Muslim
concentration fell in their arms and
period the Election Commission has taken
precautions so I would not criticize the
Election Commission on those two things
the last point I wish to make is should
we be bothered even about these limited
observations that I have made normally I
would not have been but Election
Commission is a sacred institution in
the last few years more than once we
have found the Election Commission
vacillating slightly bending backwards
to accommodate the government this is
what makes it so very critical to keep
an eye on what the Election Commission
is doing and to demand reasons to demand
public rationale for what we are doing
that's why we are discussing it here
well that's so that's a very very fair
answer and I'm going to go around to the
panel and give everybody a chance to
make those arguments
Javed Ansari same question to you do you
see merit in the questions that have
been asked some by opposition some by
journalists and poll pundits about the
schedule designed by the Election
Commission is there any merit in those
questions at all or do you think these
are matters being worthy of being
discussed right now look
one there are no second no holy cow so
everything can be discussed but we need
to do it with a with you know utmost
responsibility I don't have subscribe
any motives to the Election Commission I
I am a firm believer that the election
period can be condensed I don't for the
life of me understand why a
parliamentary constituency like unnethe
nog polling has to take place on four
separate days why must a polling in a
parliamentary constituency happen in
four different phases I fail to
understand why the Election Commission
continues to view put that Pradesh and
Bihar from the prism of the 1980 70s and
the 80s things are a lot better now
seven phases just makes no sense you
know that Pradesh it can be condensed
into into three and and you should also
look at it from the other parent point
of view even the candidates even those
seats where elections will be held in
the seventh phase which is on the 19th
there for them this is going to prove
very very costly election because in
effect what you have is 70 days of
electioneering 70 days of campaigning
and and their course the cost will keep
multiplying so the Election Commission
ought to do not take a very hard look at
all this as far as this bugging about
Ramzan is concerned it's an it's absurd
and it's a manufactured controversy
Muslims go about doing their job they go
to schools they go to universities they
go to you know do you know undertake all
their professional obligations that they
have to so is so if even if they have to
go out and vote in Ramzan they will do
it I don't think this is something that
we can accuse the Election Commission
about I just want to point out to our
panel that we've not raised the Ramzan
question at all on the channel because
if we don't pick up you know this sort
of religious questions but I'm yes yes
mr. Raut same question to you do you
believe that this that the election
schedule
would stand to be you know shortened a
little bit and that would give us more
efficiency even perhaps in security and
the control of malpractice and
violations of the code of conduct listen
I I do believe that if the election
period is shortened as much as possible
that is better for democracy also
because I'm not comparing India with
America no but America geographically is
three times bigger than India despite
that the presidential election happens
in one go why do we take five weeks to
complete the process but I'm not
withstanding by this argument or these
observations I can say that if the
elections I had to happen there is a
major exercise the biggest exercise
opening at any democracy in that case we
have to take in care perspective every
every every angle and in that so if the
Election Commission has thought that yes
the process should one for five weeks it
is okay I don't think it matters much if
you remember for the first elections of
1952 when that way that was going on for
three months or little more than three
months but so it happens I don't see
much credence in the criticism against
it now what what does this endure in
Orissa it could have been curtailed but
in one state if it is curtailed and the
total period of electioneering the
voting remains the same what does how
does it make difference so this okay
state like Gujarat traditionally has
been voting in one phase it is it is
worth devoting in one phase this time
also so I think the Election Commission
has not made bigger exam experiments and
gone by the common wisdom or traditional
wisdom and has shifted on it
I am NOT again raising the issue of
ramzan because that is a religious issue
but I think Election Commission has
taken into consideration those emotions
and those compulsions also so I am
really separate satisfied with the way
it is being done
mr. kang seok nog interestingly we've
seen west bengal and orissa West Bengal
will have seven phases Orissa will have
four but under Pradesh and Telangana
won't do you find that curious as well
well I find most curious that mr.
Chandra Shekar Rao's the chief minister
of Telangana had stated on the floor of
the house a few weeks ago that he has
requested the Election Commission a to
have a one-day poll in Telangana be that
the poll should be in the early phases
and that's exactly what's happened this
is one thing number 2 West Bengal has so
many phases and I think that is also
related to the fact that there's going
to be this anticipation of a lot of
violence in West Bengal and since the
dates of the election are all about the
about police forces whether police
forces are available central police
forces are available I think that's why
the Election Commission doesn't want to
take chances and has extended the date
offers we got to many phases that is the
second reason I think in these two cases
and on the British of course is also
Monday I think if that's why if the
Telangana is Monday they have made West
Bengal also on day as far as the size
concerned I really can't understand why
it's three days maybe it has to do
something with the movement from
structural movement of the central
reserve forces but the but the third
thing is that in the first election your
first election was four months on you
can say that now the population has gone
up so many times the electorate has gone
up so many times the number of seats
have also gone up so if you have first
election which was of course a learning
exercise could have been who has four
months long it is okay if you have it
two months here but is lost a lot of
money is being spent
yes so now when you say that the Chief
Minister of Telangana requested a single
day polling and in the beginning of the
of the entire calendar what benefit
could he have seen - you know in in that
single day polling and in the be being
at the beginning of the calendar I mean
beginning of the calendar bra
we thought that he doesn't have to
extend and so much in this hot summer to
go on and they're cheering everywhere
maybe a problem
and one day also is a fast election
instead of which campaigning here gap
billing there I think he's a well
position that's why if a party is not
very well positioned they'll want to
straight election but if you are
well-placed you know that your main
opposition the Congress party is not
doing too well you are confident of
winning the polls then you wanted to be
fast I think it's like a student going
to exams if he's not performing very
well you know on the exams to be
staggered and if you think he's doing
well you want exam to be done in one
stroke I think that was the logic of
Cajun the shikoro mr. yollop obviously
lovely yes missing out the main problem
of election nobody on sorry forgive me
mister now go ahead the main problem of
elections is I was saying something I
would say that the main the main problem
of election is the number of population
is increasing but the number of seats
are not increasing the number of seats
has frozen at the level of 1971 so that
is by itself making a fun of democracy
and that's a very pertinent issue which
is not been discussed the number of
seats in parliament as you know have
been frozen in 1971 and this freeze will
be deep freeze in ninety two thousand
thirty one in the meanwhile the
population of the country has gone on so
many times I as a young boys to live in
Delhi at in 1971 I remember the
electorate of Delhi would be someone
like to date 90 20 lakhs so there has to
be more competition and these are all
these are things where we have to talk
about reforms in electoral processes and
not look at dates that's my feeling I
think you can ask the special to your
every other also yes I was rather busy
out of my other question to you is this
so explain to our audience in layman
terms when you hold an election for the
central government which is the locus of
election it involves booths it involves
security it involves using schools as
spaces or where the election process can
take place how would a simultaneous
election change the security needs of
Jammu and Kashmir why would it be that
the Election Commission would decide
that we can have the looks of our
elections but we can simultaneously also
have elections for assembly
first about that question of size of Lok
Sabha constituency is yes that's a very
major issue this issue is beyond the
Election Commission is the
constitutional issue and the larger
problem is that the scale of our
constituency is just so large our
parliamentary constituency is like
contesting one full state anywhere else
in the world but that's a larger thing
so we should keep that out of today's
discussion it's a larger question of our
scale being such that does not allow any
direct meaningful representation on the
issue today the Election Commission
would say that yes we have problems of
security force movement and so on and so
forth the problem is why have we assumed
that in every single state police is not
enough that you need central
paramilitary forces in every single
state of the country you don't there are
very limited areas I do agree that West
Bengal is one of those states where
there is a serious apprehension of
violence yes it needs to be addressed
but do we need seven phases for that I
think somewhere along the line the
Election Commission has fixed the bar of
security requirement so high that now
they are caught in that trap and they
have no way except to then stretch it
out over seven weeks or something of
that kind because otherwise there is no
you can't move the security forces so
something needs to be reviewed there but
that is not about this particular
election that's a larger thing on Jammu
and Kashmir the Commission might say
might think and I would like to know
their reasoning that if you have
assembly elections then you would have
very intense local political activity
and for that you really need to have the
security apparatus for the entire
duration on a very high alert and so on
and so forth
parliamentary election they know that
route is you sometimes 10 percent
sometimes been 7 percent in the valley
and therefore is the Election Commission
in essence participating in this idea
that let's keep the lectern out load
doesn't matter let's go through the
formalities the real election is only
the Assembly election
politicians can say this I do not expect
the Election Commission of India to
share this view I would just come back
finally to Orissa and Bengal I do not
know what the intention of the Election
Commission has been but I can tell you
the consequences the consequence in
Orissa
Arisa used to have two phases it has for
the first time being turned into four
phases the consequence of this is that
the BJP which is making a very very
serious bit in fact if you were to name
one state in the country which would be
on target of mr. Hamid Shah where he
says I would be able to improve my tally
substantially it is Orissa now with four
phases it provides his party enough time
it provides them the space that they
need to ensure that the Prime Minister
can cover Weesa properly that BJP can
actually have very intense campaign in a
state like West Bengal the consequence
of this schedule again I'm not speaking
of intentions the consequence of this
schedule would be that a smaller party
like BJP with the limited gather would
be able to also move its carder from
from phase to phase and be able to do
slightly better than it would have
otherwise done now these are things
which people are likely to read into the
schedule and it would have helped the
Election Commission had specified and
clarified and had not announced if
scheduled which would naturally give
rise to anxieties of this kind well
another quick question to you mr. Yadav
is that of anti-incumbency or incumbency
right now we do know from latest state
elections that the Telangana Chief
Minister and that party in the TRS are
in a very comfortable place is that
perhaps why parties like like mr. nog
said parties that are currently in
comfortable places would want quick
elections to be in and out and like you
said there are some other states where
they would be a consequence to those who
are trying to make an entry to have
longer stretched out election calendars
case of telangana the consequence of
what the Election Commission has
announced would be that it suits mr.
John shake around perfectly but from
that let us not infer the intentions of
the Commission because no matter which
way you announce it it is bound to suit
someone it is bound to go against
someone else no matter and incidentally
a chief minister or a government
expressing a preference about date and
phase is not new this is a routine
question which is asked to all state
governments about and in any case these
are states which have had a tradition of
limited for phases of polling so in
Telangana at least you cannot say
something out of the ordinary has
happened what is happening in Orissa is
out of ordinary and therefore some
question need to be asked some questions
do need to be asked we have two members
of the political class with us analyst
Singh for the BJP and our they'll sing
opera for the Congress either you first
the opposition specifically also in
Bengal has raised questions about the
election calendar do you agree with mr.
Yogi and Rihanna that the consequence of
the calendar could mean an advantage to
the BJP in some states will fear the
Congress has no doubt in their mind that
the Election Commission unfortunately
has become an extension of the PMO and
that is why the delay in the
announcement of the elections perhaps he
had to get his go-ahead from mr. moody
but be there is it may we have
nationalization the country is yearning
for change but let me take mr. yardas
point further states states like West
Bengal states liquidus are states like
my rostra states like at Nautica these
are states where the BJP is delusional
about making certain in rows are
improving its tally why is it that the
election schedule and all these states
has been staggered why is it that the
phases have been increased now we all
know that the richest party in the world
is going to benefit by the extension of
the pole sheduled so these are certainly
German questions and the Election
Commission of India must answer we've
seen in the past during the Gujarat
assembly elections how Mr Modi was
campaigning on the date of woulding he
was campaigning on that there was a
formal complaint made to the EC but the
EC took no cognizance of the complete
they've been several instances in the
past where the Election Commission of
India has actually leaned in favor of
the BJP therefore these are issues which
the ECI cannot brush under the carpet
and finally on the question of Jammu and
Kashmir I think this is an
acknowledgement by the BJP that the
situation has worsened this is for the
first time after 1996 that the state
election schedule and the state
elections have been differed so much for
mr. Modi's 56-inch chest that today we
can't even hold elections in an integral
part of India will there be any
accountability for his kashmir policy
all right
okay so obviously fired you fired that
round immediately as soon as you started
speaking but I do know Bharat Kumar out
has a response to you mr. Raut go ahead
and I'm opening this up to the panel to
respond to Adil mr. out go ahead do you
have a rebuttal for him yeah I only want
to ask one question
he made some admit some later
observations about Election Commission
being subsidiary to the Prime Minister
and over here it has gone as per the
advice or guidance of the prime minister
of with that the sugar is shooting the
Prime Minister's party I don't think we
should attribute any type of such
motives against the Election Commission
at Miss when the elections are round a
corner do Election Commission does not
report to the prime minister in first
place so it has nothing to do with Prime
who is the prime minister and which
party he belongs to in the bay as far as
you know the Election Commission is an
independent body and it has crew on it
time and again so there is no point in
attributing any motive in this second
after saying this then I would say that
if the Election Commission has taken the
decision we can criticize the decision
one don't attribute any motive to that
okay I just want to give you again the
other an opportunity to respond before
he said I do know I've come back to you
are the lie I will give you an
opportunity to rebut
but another thing you have to talk about
you have to think about is when you make
an allegation as serious as the one you
just did how
then did your party managed to win
Rajasthan to Ithaca and Murray Pradesh
and we'd come back to that and I know
you have an answer already but you again
the other do you want to respond to the
allegations made by other thing before
of the Congress I was sorry to hear that
language to say that election commission
is an extension of PMO and to draw it
based on that schedule I have these
questions about the shadow but I would
not say that this schedule itself is an
evidence to suggest that it is an
extension of p.m. or I would not use
that language at all but I would only
agree with one limited point and it's
nothing important about institutions
that critical institutions that we speak
with care that ever since the Election
Commission acquired the kind of stature
that it did under mr. shishun 1990 1991
and so on
after that currently the Election
Commission's image Election Commission's
image for autonomy and independence is
on the lower ab so while in other
elections you only watch parties in this
election election commission itself is
being watched so far in the last few
days especially on the issue of use of
security forces advertisement etc
Election Commission has acted very
fairly yes I would only say let it be a
case-to-case judgment rather than a
sweeping presumption very very fairly
said sweeping presumption until nursing
hasn't spoken yet analyzing of the BJP
do you want to make an opening statement
before I go back to other affair the
topic which we are discussing is about
the seven phase elections which are
going to happen in upcoming months and I
really fail to understand that why such
controversy is being cropped up by the
opposition and especially if we talk
about about couple of states why Odessa
is being covered in four phases why it
is not covered in two phases why Jammu
Kashmir election but the
some elections are not happening
simultaneously with the parliamentary
elections I mean this is the perogative
of in the Election Commission of India
no but I second no no I'm gonna say
another thing you will find until you
make that last point go and I'm gonna
stop you there forgive me but it was the
Home Minister mr. Raj Nath Singh who
made a commitment to Parliament that
Jammu and Kashmir will have state
elections in a state government will be
put in place as quickly as possible and
that is a priority for the government so
it's fair to say that yes it's
affirmative of the Election Commission
but there was a commitment made to the
country and to Parliament by the
government that Jammu and Kashmir would
return to having a state government so
why don't why isn't there state
elections taking place in Germany would
you be able to answer that question
absolutely very well-said free and this
proves that Election Commission of India
works from its own thought process it is
not being commanded or it is not the
extension of the PMO as being accused by
the congress spokesperson so the
Election Commission of India is going to
decide when the elections are going to
happen though a home minister of our
country he promised that he will try to
get the elections happen as quickly as
possible but perhaps Election Commission
of India didn't think so
so instead of saying that the Election
Commission of India is the extension of
the PMO and you enjoy yadah very rightly
interrupted and you corrected him that
it cannot be the extension of the PMO I
mean these are the independent bodies
like today it is the our government
parties in the party government
yesterday it was somebody's else
government it doesn't use that these
agencies are going to work under any
political head they have to work
independently and it is their moral duty
all right never say you can Bob
effectively is properly and without the
loss of any life okay I want to open
this up to the rest of the panel just
raise your hand if you want to come in
and I think specifically we have to
focus on Jammu and Kashmir because do
you turn around and say it's purely the
prerogative of the Election Commission
and Jammu and Kashmir being left out
while other states have been considered
for simultaneous poll we see out of go
ahead and there
come back to mr. Ansari mr. Gallow first
let's not get into such formal
platitudes purely the prerogative of
Election Commission of course it's not
election commissioner himself said in
the press conference he said it is after
consultation with the government it is
after consultation with law and order
agencies of course Election Commission
is duty-bound Constitution bound to
actually hold it along with this they
have no reason so there is no
constitutional legality that prevents
the Election Commission in its wisdom
not to hold elections they are simply
saying look we have security inputs we
have law and order inputs based on which
we have taken this call the question is
what are those law and order inputs who
gives those Lord order inputs of course
the central government gives it of
course because they are also in control
of J&K today the assembly stands
dissolved and please remember all this
is comes in a political context the
political context in gnk is this that
PDP was an ally of the BJP situation
gets bad BJP decides all right enough to
dump the PDP now they dump them then PDP
and NC come together they form have the
numbers they want this take a claim and
say all right let's form a government
then suddenly the governor's fax machine
if you remember stopped working suddenly
this strange decision takes place the
assembly is dissolved remember the
people of Jammu and Kashmir are watching
this entire drama if at the end of it
this very unusual declaration comes to
say we have learned or the situation
good enough to hold parliamentary
election but not good enough to hold
assembly election people will read
political meanings in this and this
could have been avoided
very well said mr. mr. Ansari I saw your
hand go up go ahead at the point
want to make is if if we can't hold
elections in the state of Jammu and
Kashmir simultaneous assembly and shtetl
and Lok Sabha elections then what
happens to this government's claim that
was made earlier in the year of of
general one country one poll which is
helping simultaneous polls for both
state assemblies as well as for for
Parliament if we can't hold it in one
state how on earth I we gold told it
across the country and there is one
reform III would be very keen on the
Election Commission enforcing witches
the use of EVP packs the opposition
obviously has demanded hundred percent
100 percent even if a hundred percent is
not possible at least 30 percent 25 to
30 percent if this can be implemented
this will go a long way in in in
assuaging some of the concerns regarding
Fair Pay that people have because you
know elect they are like I said earlier
there are no sacred cows here the
Election Commission not must must not
only do the right thing it ought to be
seen as doing the right thing so forth
therefore the Election Commission should
put its entire weight behind this demand
and ensure that this is done as
expeditiously as possible Bob I I know
that other wanted to rebut when Bharath
Kumar's corrected him about you know the
allegation you made about the Election
Commission I wants yes I can see your
hand up go ahead I then go out let's
just open this up now they'll go ahead
can I come in fear yes go ahead
what I wouldn't say he collected me
that's his perspective he shared a
different perspective me that is it me
let's be very clear Fay and let us not
be naive let us not forget that the
elections in west bengal orissa and
karnataka have been extended
keeping in mind certain logic in certain
rationale now any person who's been on
the ground and mr. Yadav has much more
experience than any one of us on the
panel that a party which has unlimited
resources benefits from an extended pole
schedule therefore this is a legitimate
question why is it that these three
states where the BJP oops
and intends to make gains why is it that
the election schedule has been staggered
why is it it's been extended this is
point number one point number two as far
as Jammu and Kashmir is concerned I
again want to emphasize on this point
this decision of the EC which of course
is in consultation with the Home
Ministry and the state administration
under the governor is an acknowledgment
that they have failed in the state of
Jammu and Kashmir I think much has been
said by mr. Modi about national security
about you know assimilating Kashmiri
I think this is a monumental failure of
the BJP government for which they are
answerable they can't get away from this
other you of the other thing I want you
to address when you say and I'm quoting
you here where you said the Election
Commission functions as an extension of
the PMO how do you explain the Congress
is sweeping wins in Rajasthan
Chattisgarh and Mother Pradesh well
let's be clear it's the people's power
notwithstanding the fact I'll give you
an example the VV part
cross-checking example the Congress
party said that if it can't be hundred
percent at least have a significant
number so that people's concerns can be
a label the EC is still vacillating on
this issue if you have VV pads why don't
you have a cross-checking which is up to
about 15 to 20 or maybe 25% let's put
this issue to rest there is a purpose
plane having very bad system
they've been malfunctioning their beam
manipulations alleged manipulations and
karana and beaned the EC was reluctant
to even entertain something like this
they've been summarily dismiss ink
objections
they've been advanced country is likely
of like like the United States
Netherlands and several other countries
in the Western world who have switched
to a system the EC has been summarily
rejecting it be that is it mean
notwithstanding the fact that the EC
unfortunately it appears is leaning in
favor of the BJP the Congress party and
the opposition will emerge victorious
because ultimately it's people's power
today this country is yearning for
change this other class I'll stop you
before before your political this
country has campaign speech begins but
Bharat Kumar
the party you should give me a chance
okay one second
analyst thing I want you to remember
first of all that other than the
Congress nobody has made a outright
accusation there been no accusations on
the panel at all in fact most of the
panelists are very clear to say the
election commission is independent and
we should be very careful even when we
are asking questions off the Commission
mr. out go ahead please
now here I would like to bring up the
Kashmir issue again and I would like to
support what mr. Yeo has been saying all
this while and that the Kashmir Assembly
has been dissolved I think I'm not
mistaking it around four months ago so
it is the duty call Election Commission
on one hand and the government of the
other hand is duty-bound legally and
morally to give the people of Kashmir in
any state the popular government as
early as possible now that this
elections were in happening it would
have been whatever difficulties they
might be facing
they should have conducted the elections
assembly election also simultaneously
now you if now the government or the
Election Commission wants to hold the
Kashmir election your earliest that
would take two more months yeah so it
means how long you'll be keeping the
Kashmiri people
deprived of their popular government so
this was the opportunity godsend so that
should have been taken but I don't know
for what reasons but the Election
Commission has decided to differ it I
personally don't agree but I don't
attribute any more due to that no but
okay we have to I wrote you said all the
panelists keep saying we don't attribute
motives to the Election Commission I
have a very simple layperson question to
ask and that is this if you're going to
have a look sir by election you'll
choose you you'll take a school building
you'll make it a booth
you will put security outside that
building you will get the schoolteachers
to man that entire process we will put
the bus in there that will have actual
voting machines and people will go and
work technically if you are also going
to have state elections you will put
another debar next to that you have two
boxes one for looks about one for state
and the arrest of the entire structure
should ideally remain the
so I still haven't understood what the
Election Commission or the government of
India might mean when they say we don't
have adequate security to also hold the
state elections how would the to be
different and now I'm opening this up so
analyzing since you said you wanted to
respond please tell me how is it
different to have the state election
simultaneously how does the security
situation change way to start with I
think so it is more than two years since
Prime Minister of our country had been
advocating for the simultaneous
elections and at the time all of the
opposition they were criticizing him in
and out so let us not discuss about it
here were the political parties who were
singing their chorus against primary yes
and today we are talking about Jammu and
Kashmir I think the Election Commission
understands very well then when to
conduct the elections that if you
haven't been listening to us should have
been conducted together no fee please do
no I wouldn't you know I wouldn't you
Lodge my formal unhappiness about the
fact that you haven't heard the other
panelists say that the Election
Commission will actually consult the
government and security agencies and
they largely ask the local government
also to give them advice on security
arrangements so I still and you haven't
been able to answer that question what
changes between the security
arrangements of a Lok Sabha election and
the security arrangements of a
simultaneous election all right all
right you are you agree to that point so
Election Commission must have got some
some inputs from the administrative
authorities of Jammu and Kashmir not to
conduct both the elections together so I
think we should we should allow Election
Commission you know what I'm gonna put
fine I'm gonna go to stop everyone and I
do realize that everybody's saying we
should not attribute motives I'm not
attributed motives but as a citizen of
this country I believe we have the right
to ask questions of any agency we should
be able to understand why you made this
decision given currently nobody can see
the logic in this decision there is no
logic so if you can turn around and tell
us that they must have been something
that they are in some way privy to some
sort of secret information that is not
back Election Commission of India of a
job again sorry go ahead
hey I am NOT the spokesperson of the
Election Commission of India but as the
spokesperson but as the spokes learner
that's why you've already had mercy yes
awaken citizen of my country I know I I
know this thing that how to hog the
things work but the political parties
who know the result beforehand okay no
no no no no nothing unless you're going
to give us a specific answer I'm going
to have to cut you off and move to Java
done sorry mister I'm sorry do you see
any logic at all no no but Angela you
know you are refusing to answer any of
the questions I'm asking you ice is not
a platform for an election speech I'm
sorry tell one thing fail that why not
when lack of preparation is now is done
not in a month's time it is years
together hard work which parties in the
party has been doing with you and that
is why the position is wrapped around
Apple today
no no your party is failure no your
political parties failed the way you are
analogy I'm going to give you one more
opportunity to if the situation is
conducive to hold Lok Sabha elections
what makes you think that it is not
conducive for Election Commission of
India I can't okay
Ellison Ellison analyst a fine let me
let me rephrase the question
analysts think you have to listen to the
question in order to be able to answer
let me rephrase the question if you are
saying the Election Commission checked
on the ground and found good enough
reason not to hold a state election in
Jammu and Kashmir does that not prove
that the situation on the ground in
Jammu and Kashmir has worsened in the
last five years because before this we
were actually able
- as a country hold elections in that
state whenever we thought necessary if
you're having to postpone elections
because of the security situation is
that not clear indication that the
situation in the ground has gotten worse
absolutely analysts exit wait I will say
I will just say two things okay I will
just say two things on it
number one I am pre here the depend
lists are not ignorant of the latest
conditions happening in Jammu Jammu and
Kashmir and secondly I really wish and I
really hope the Jammu and Kashmir would
but the cars versus it a wall it has the
same condition status of like other
states in our country okay no matter
arms about Kashmir then definitely we
have to see a door so you can expect
okay all right I'm going to move on to
our other guests Javed Ansari
all right all right any last thing I
give you an opportunity to answer and
you didn't really answer my question
Javed Ansari come to Clark Javits job is
mr. Java ji first to you do you see any
sort of logic in the decision that has
been made about the Jammu and Kashmir
state elections and do you by any of the
arguments being given to us by the BJP
representative well absolutely none and
I would be you know I would be willing
to give the benefit of doubt to the
government provided it shares with us
reasons as concerned citizens Anila
Singh and a party are not the only
represent citizens in this country all
of us are concerned citizens and we have
a right to know as to why simultaneous
polls are not being held in the state of
Jammu and Kashmir that - at a time when
a party which has been in the fronting
this debate this demand for simultaneous
polls across the country in the absence
of any logical explanation from the
government or from the Election
Commission
you know this will only lend credence to
all kind of speculation all kinds of
motives will be attached and the
Election Commission and the Government
of India both of them
themselves and to the people of India to
share the reasons why this has not been
held because here was a party here was a
gum senior ministers of this government
who were fronting this demand for
simultaneous polls and now suddenly when
the time has come we not only not only
Jammu Kashmir being deprived of an
assembly across the country you have
elections which are which are spread
over over close to two months just
imagine the kind of expenditure I know
of of candidates who are you know who
will be polling or in the seventh phase
of elections and they've been telling me
that they have a 70 in effect for all
practical purposes they have a 70 Day
campaign imagine the kind of costs
involved well very well said now we've
run out of time unfortunately I have to
wrap this up but like I said earlier in
a democracy we're allowed citizens to
ask questions democracies have as
especially ours has checks and balances
we have the media and will continue to
ask questions of all organizations
independent and otherwise all
institutions independent and otherwise
including the Election Commission we
must acknowledge that a general election
the Lok Sabha election in India is a
colossal complicated complicated process
the fact that we are able to do it fair
and free and bloodless is extremely
important but that doesn't mean we're
not allowed to ask questions and we're
not allowed to pay for any close
attention the decisions that are made

after getting trapped during a snow

part of a larger group that had left
from karna from cookada but got trapped
due to the blizzard the remaining people
managed to escape and were rescued by
the army my colleague made for him
joining me live with more on this Fareed
this is a very very tragic incident that
has come to light but first of all tell
us where did this happened and how many
people were part of this group well this
has happened enroute from ku para to
karna these people who are moving from
KU para to karna some emergency had
forced them to travel in the night while
there was no fall on now so somewhere
very close to the Kuna Yala
not as close to sadhna top these people
were got trapped in blizzard it was a
group of around 10 to 12 people
three of them were badly hit and
unfortunately they died and while the
others did try to rescue them and take
them out of the area but even they were
in a very bad shape and that really
ensured that these people could not
survive but this is a sad reality as far
as people living in these border areas
or LOC belts are concerned as snow
levels right now there still continue to
be around 14 to 15 feet and with the
road blocked they have absolutely no
other option to just take this this is
this serious threat and move on as far
as these bad weather conditions are
concerned now these three people were
moving from a KU para to karna when they
were trapped in this blizzard imagine
the date of the night around 1:00 a.m.
they could not reach anyone because
there were no mobile towers around there
was no signal around so they were left
to fend for themselves
after this incident the locals protested
in KU para blocked the road because they
say that for six months as the winter
starts the administration goes into a
hibernation no one really helps them and
they are literally left to fend for
themselves and they want more their
demand or for long
has been that there should be a tunnel
that connects sadhna Tov with Tong des
it will be a two kilometer long tunnel
but for years and years now nothing has
been done on that so this really is
another story that exposes the situation
as far as the broad areas are concerned

only affected by the ceasefire
violations but also by weather and
official apathy Apoorva absolutely

This has resulted in ...,2019-03-13T09:16:14Z,MIRROR NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GkRtUxwDSkA/hqdefault.jpg,"there's been white commotion that's
taking place at the Delhi Airport as the
passengers have been left confused after
the DGCA grounded all the Boeing 737 max
8 aircraft and this remember after the
DGCA has come out with the last-minute
move saying that the India is going
ahead to ground all the Boeing a 737 max
and this is going to happen from 4:00
p.m. today now DGCA has very
categorically said that all the Boeing
737 mats of the spice suit is going to
be grounded before 4:00 p.m. and this
was according to a late night decision
that was taken for grounding this
particular aircraft now India has also
joined the ranks of many countries
almost 13 countries which has gone ahead
to a ban or ground this ill-fated their
Boeing 737 now we've given to understand
that this decision has translated into
widespread commotion that is taking
place at the Delhi Airport getting
further information on this my colleague
Ayushmann joining us in live with
further updates on this I just want this
clear confusion that is taking place at
the Delhi Airport there are passengers
who were stranded a clear fall out of
the decision of the DJ's here but right
now has there been no alternative that
has been made for the passengers
considering the fact that 4:00 p.m. is
the deadline that has been set by the
DGCA to ground the Boeing 737 airline
pelipper why if you look at the
condition in Delhi Airport right now we
have got this statement from spy state
where they have maintained that they
operate 76 with 76 flights they have and
in that 12 of them have been grounded so
they are now operating on 64 of the
flights on of the effect that has taken
place
they have said 16 of their flights have
been a 16 of the flights have been
canceled that journeys have been
canceled and these people who have whose
flights have been cancelled they are
trying to accommodate in then in the
other alternative measurement is being
taken place at the same time they are
trying to refund but what is what we are
seeing individuals is that there is a
commotion at the Delhi Airport because
there is a confusion on this as to how
people those people who are ready to
board and at the last moment when they
are told that their flight is canceled
definitely there is a combo
but right now that what we are getting
from SpiceJet is that twelve of their
flights have been grounded and they are
following the instructions from the GCA
in which it was said that they flight up
to a Boeing 737 has to be grounded and
all those 12 flights are being grounded
right now and 16 flights 16 destination
journeys have been affected and SpiceJet
has assured that they will be fully
refunding and making alternative as an
arrangement for people who whose flights
have been canceled approval but at this
point it was also very important for the
airport authority to ensure and not
create panic at the Delhi Airport
considering widespread commotion but
also help us understand the aircraft the
boeing 737 max was being used by both
spy state and jet airways so are we
given to understand that the passengers
flying boats file state and jet airways
are in the middle of a fix and they have
not been accommodated to other flights
well a para in case of SpiceJet
14 flights have been cancelled and if
you look at these five states number
fourteen flights at one go if they're
canceled definitely there is
inconvenience or to the passengers but
if you see on the other side jet they
have already all their five flights are
grounded because they fund currents that
is there in the jet airways right now we
are given to understand that 14 flights
which have been cancelled by the
SpiceJet they'll be making alternative
arrangements for the passengers were
facing these difficulties they are they
have promised full refund to all those
passengers but the SpiceJet maintains
that review the security and the
following the order of de Guiche year
they have taken to this decision and
they have grounded all 12 of the boeing
737 max that they were operating in
India all right so that statement
they're coming in from spy state saying
that while a majority of passengers have
been affected as a result of these
cancellations they have been
accommodated by spy state on an
alternative flight the rest have been
offered a full reef and we'll have to
see what happens and whether this
commotion that is there at the Delhi I
produce results soon considering
the DGCA has put out its direction to
ground the Boeing 737 max by 4:00 p.m.
today
I wish won't request you to stay with us
because the DGC directions that have now
come out for grounding the Boeing 737
max aircraft the regulator has issued
further instructions in this regard now
no boeing 737 max aircraft will be
allowed to enter or transmit the Indian
airspace from 4:00 p.m. today the time
limit is given to facilitate the
positioning and maintenance of the
aircraft it is also to make sure that
international flights reach their
destination the Civil Aviation Secretary
has also called an emergency meeting of
the airlines at 4:00 p.m. today
now the DGCA step comes after an
Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 max 8
aircraft crashed killing all the 157
people on board including 4 Indians
I wish man continues to be live with us
I just want the DGCA also going ahead in
issuing further instructions in this
regard and it is going to be very
important to note that a meeting that is
going to take place in the evening at
4:00 p.m. today by aviation secretary
because there's going to be more
direction and more guidelines that is
going to come out in this case and also
their concerns as to what the airline
feels on decision and what or what all
has been their opinion on this and if
you see the dtc instructions obviously
it was there there was rounds of meeting
and deliberations being done yesterday
it was being considered whether it
should be the decision of who grounding
those boeing 737 should be taken today
or not because yesterday there was a
criticism of the DGC for going lenient
on this issue the aviation experts said
that the DGCA was somewhere not very
serious about the safety of the
passengers because when we are hearing
reports of current repeated plane
crashes how can these flights operate
instead
DGC had issued instructions to the
airlines that the pilots will be on
these these flights boeing 737 they need
to have a good amount of experience
despite that there was a criticism of
DGCA that they were not very serious in
this yesterday late night there was a
decision from d GCM
they said that now no flights will fly
from tomorrow because they have to be
grounded now to ground these flights
needs and needs our timeframe that is
why because they they must be in transit
they must be out somewhere so that's why
DGC has given this people little time
for him by four o'clock in the evening
every flight Boeing 737 of spies it has
to be grounded wherever they are post
that they won't be allowed to enter and
that is life spice it has also come out
and said that they will be following the
norms that has been set by DGCA and
they'll be grounding all their 12 sites
that are Boeing 737 that they are
operating in India and they they have
cited that they securely of the
passengers is of the prime importance
and that is why they are following the
instructions from the D G C F",True,en,341,0,2

same period a year ago the retail
inflation has risen we understand to two
point five seven percent in February as
against one point nine seven percent in
January now the number that we should
actually look a look at is the eiope
number this is industrial production the
industrial production number having gone
down to less than two percent if we
compare that to where it was in the
month of December where was 2.8 percent
that is a decline so the argument that
the government gives us about jobs would
be linked to how much we're producing
through our industry and that's the
story we will track very closely for you
but there is a story I do want to share
with you before we go on to our main
conversation for this evening
a month ago you'll remember when and how
visited the Dharavi transit camped
school and we found it in absolutely
pathetic condition exposing the
realities of the BMC run schools now we
investigated how children were denied
basic facilities they were made to sit
on the floor the classrooms were being
clubbed compromising the quality of
education we raised that issue we
followed it up with the BMC we insisted
they take action at the BMC promised us
that action would be taken and we've
done a follow up ground check today we
found that our coverage has woken up the
authorities the children now have been
provided with benches to sit on the
school which lacked basic amenities now
has computers and science labs for the
students my colleague de Chasseur joins
me live right now this shows the one who
did that story and very proud of the
result this year so first of all
congratulations for making an impact to
the lives of these children but did you
see was it just a couple of classrooms
and benches because I do recall that
there were several other problems in
this school well that's right
or we are talking about one of the
biggest school in the heart of Mumbai
the Gaurav a transit camp school with a
student capacity of over six thousand so
as you rightly pointed out that in the
first week of February this year we had
a visited the school and we investigated
that how children were forced to study
in pathetic conditions what a school
really need basic facilities like
benches that was also not really
available for the children and most of
them were forced to sit on the floor a
month later we revisited the school fair
and actually we took the tour of the
entire school to see if there are any
changes on the ground level like how the
BMC had assured and promised dasa on
12th of february this year so to all who
surprised me we revisited the same
classes that we had investigated last
time and we saw a tremendous change and
progress on the ground way we saw that
children were not sitting on the floor
but they had benches to sit on no more
classrooms were being taken in corridors
or playground but in proper classes
second important discrepancy that we
highlighted was the fact that how two
classes were clubbed in one with this
student capacity of over 18 but today
what we saw was that there were only 40
students in one class and one teacher
teaching only one division so to our
surprise when we also interacted with
the students they told us that this
change has taken over in the last 20
days or so third aspect fear what we
really highlighted was the fact that how
one entire or the medium section the
ninth standard was made to study on the
corridor which they were being forced to
do so for the last one year but today
what we saw at least four classes have
been designated for all
unknown so all of these changes we have
seen and lastly fear the computer and
the science lab which was noted on
operational or available for the
secondary section they have now made it
available at least so for secondary
students science labs and computer labs
is something that they are learning at
this point in time and other issues like
what your problem the hygiene problem
all of it what we saw there especially
in the girls toilet it was really clean
and we saw that how there were workers
working at least in the two walls of
fire when we were there so we saw
tremendous amount of change of it but
the biggest question your is that really
in the last year there were about 277
crore rupees the budget which was
allocated but only 40 percent took off
amount was you so today what we saw was
a big Mironov impact but the question is
that big schools also should really
follow the same leave all right these
are many thanks for bringing us that
story and of course everything will
hinge on the government's ability to
maintain that quality and we'll continue
to check not just the schools in Mumbai
but schools across the country to make
sure that the quality of our education
that we're giving our students and our
children doesn't suffer moving on to the
topic of discussion today we do know
that the center went ahead with de
monetization
despite the RBI board cautioning the
government that none of their purposes
would be met why did the government do
it anyway take a look at November
those are Sola ki raat Rico Parra body C
vermin homage re pants or pay or a hajar
opt currency not legal tender nah here
engage
the announcement that disrupted lives of
every single citizen of the nation
minutes of the RBI bought meat before G
monetization reveal the central bank and
board members had reportedly warned them
or the government about the impact of D
monetization the minutes of this meeting
accessed by mirror now detailed
discussions of the negative short-term
impact and doubts over meeting the
intended goals it goes on to record as
to how D monetization would ensure a dip
in the GDP alongside noting as to how
there was a purported currency a fake
currency in circulation of 400 crores
which was not that high in quantum to
have undertaken D monetization as a
exercise all through the government has
maintained that there were three main
objectives to D monetization curbing
black money flushing out counter feed
nodes and ending terror financing the
minutes of this board meet sure that RBI
board had observed D monetization will
not have any material impact on black
money and that the volume of counterfeit
notes in circulation was not very
significant additionally minutes show
that the board felt D monetization will
have a negative effect on the GDP now
multiple reports from the RBI and
governments show that the board's
warnings turned out to be true in August
when a 18 RBI reported that 99% of the
des moines rise money was returned
counterfeit notes the continued to be
circulated and terror funding in
terrorism continue to plague India mara
now asks will the center concede the D
monetization was a failure why did the
center not pay attention to RBI's board
warnings let's debate
but before I bring in my entire panel
and the question to ask is simply this
if the RBI very clearly three hours
before the government announced D
monetization course shouldn't the
government but this will not work and it
will have in fact an adverse impact on
the economy and on citizens why did the
government go ahead with that decision
iris Gandhi former deputy governor of
the RPI is with me on the show so is the
way called who's a very senior
journalist who is examined the matter of
D monetization and the Indian economy
very closely
mr. Gandhi good evening and thank you
for joining us you've obviously taken a
look at the minutes of the meeting would
you say the government went ahead
despite caution issued by its very own
experts in the RBI because the RBI is
our the board are the foremost experts
that are meant to consult the government
on these matters yes for public on
public policy matters the government and
especially me relating to finance
government does consult there is a bank
is a banks board in this particular case
and his bank board has deliberated on it
and had given its observations comments
and express certain reservations also so
in matters of public policy that has
have I never been here say any policy
which is singularly completely
beneficial there will always be by
aspects there which may have a negative
impact on certain segments or certain
sectors of the economy and then power
policies are made the experts will have
to make those comments upfront so that
everybody upfront clearly knows what is
the likely impact negative impact in a
in respect of such policies so as I
resume on being a professional body it
had given such observations to the
government and ultimately this
particular decision is way at the
government so government had taken that
decision to go ahead even after
listening to and understanding there is
a bank's comments and probably they
would have thought that this can be been
certain
negative aspects are only a short-term
in the medium term that can be corrected
when the other kind of safeguards can be
brought on so that's a way typically
public policy will bear happens so in
this case also
despite razor banks certain observation
my government went ahead the week when
you looked at the minutes of the meeting
and some of it is fairly strongly worded
does it suggest to you that the
government gave the Reserve Bank board
enough time because we know this meeting
happen at 5:00 the announcement happen
at it I mean I mean if you if you take
that into account it's very clear that
the government had already made its
decision yes and and I mean if you look
at the Modi government once they sort of
make a decision they are very brazen
about implementing it I mean they really
don't bother about the other formalities
which stand in the way so and the
quality of the decision because we do I
mean in the meeting it says that the
board has been assured that this matter
has been under discussion between
central government and arya for the last
six months and basically most of the
things you're worried about will be
looked after don't worry we're just
going to go ahead let's see you know the
most basic thing which which is not
there you know in this RTI replay is the
fact that money ultimately people money
ultimately has no value of its own it's
basically a medium of exchange now the
moment you take out 86% of the paper
money out of an economy I mean an
economy it need not be India it's you
know basically economic transactions
will collapse I mean it's not rocket
science at the end of the day so I mean
once you take that into account all the
other you know everything else follows I
mean you take the fact that near the
talk the entire talk about black money
now in 2012 me and the government had
released a white paper on black money
okay and it had some very interesting
data which the income-tax Department put
out wherein they said that during seach
search-and-seizure operations which is
basically a euphemism they use for
income tax rates only around 4.9 percent
of the unaccounted wealth which they
found was held in the form of cash yes
so which basically means that people
hold
black money as we call it in the form of
real-estate gold or it simply leaves the
country I mean as you know near of Modi
in London suggests so and he's just a
lot of that money to buy that ghastly
jacket but let me just point out that
what the RBI has said it echoing what
Vivek just pointed out it is said
significant observations were made by
the directors of the RBI one it is a
commendable measure but it will have a
short-term negative effect on the GDP
for the current here it goes on to say
that your calculation has not adjusted
for inflation so the actual difference
is not that stock any incidents of
counterfeiting is a concern but rupees
400 crore rupees as a percentage of the
total currency is not significant enough
to merit this decision most black money
is held not in cash but in the real
estate sector or in gold this move will
have no impact
so basically would it be safe then to
assume mr. RS Gandhi to say that a the
government had received enough an
adequate warning from its own RBI board
on the adverse impact of de monetization
as a decision and you said yourself it's
the Ardoin his job to give an opinion
and then the government makes that
decision do you believe the government
made the right decision mr. Gandhi yeah
our way border has certainly given its
views about the negative side of the
demarcation proposal and ultimately
government must have weighed on both the
sides there about 30 merits and merits
of introducing it and and finally it had
gone ahead whether it has been the right
decision or not history will of course
record that and even at that time also
and many times thereafter I have
mentioned that benefits of demonization
can be measured only after medium-term
three to five years the benefits to flow
one has to completely wait so we may not
be able to make a judgment based on the
immediate negative effects which
everyone has considered nobody
even the government did not say that
there will not be any negative impact on
the economy in the short term period
whether that that price that paid in
terms of reduction in the economic
growth and certain sectors being
affected badly compared to other sectors
whether it is a right price to be paid
for the benefits that is likely to come
we have to wait for the final judgement
where as I said within three to five
years these their tax compliance well
what is a major objective of eliminating
or reducing the incidence of black money
that tax compliance should increase tax
to GDP ratio should be very increasing
so that that to happen
Aled observer in the last two or three
years since the motivation we are seeing
an upward trend in that respect the
finally obviously the researchers will
come out and buy will will be able to
establish what is the contribution of
the demonization for such impact that we
need to be waiting for the final column
obviously if I ask you the negative
impact of D monetization that's the
whole show were they any positives that
came out of it I mean no I mean I I
wouldn't look at it like that blinds you
know first I think for the first point I
just responding to mr. Gandhi you know I
would like to make is that you know as
as a former deputy governor of RBI I
mean he needs to be euphemistic so so
you have to take that into account while
you know taking his answers the the good
point about you know tax compliance
going up is you know it can really be
challenged because you know if you look
at the fact that in the last few years
the stock market has really done well
now I'll give you a parallel example of
the tax to GDP ratio going up between
2005 and 2008 when the stock market was
doing very well and obviously and in
2009 2010 the ratio collapsed and that
was primarily because a lot of people
were trading on the stock market and
hence they were paying a short term
capital gain because you can't trade
black money on the stock yard so so long
similar line something like that could
have happened you know in
in the last few years as well the other
point that people don't realize about
tax collection is that you know even if
you look at the the GDP the government
GDP data which is highly suspect the
economic growth has fallen from you know
high higher than 8% yes so less than 7%
now if in this environment the
government is collecting more tax as it
claims to I mean there is something of a
problem you know when when the economy's
is economic growth is falling and tax
collections are going up there is a
severe problem so I want to point out
that the government did not list
increased tax compliance as one of its
reason it wasn't there the original
scheme of things it was brought in later
and even so the seventh day Commission
increased the number of people who had
to file taxes and who had to pay taxes
and we've seen the actual increase on a
lot of places in a lot of years is among
the salaried class the interesting part
is just because more people are filing
taxes it does not mean more people are
paying taxes so this is something that
in salaried class paying tax is not
increasing because there's no black
money in the salary case in fact in one
last point I'd like to make is that
there are just eighty-one thousand three
hundred forty four individuals in India
who have a gross income of greater than
one crore as per the income tax
department yes that in itself tells you
that you know we might go gaga over a
lot of things andhe monetization but
that gives you the real picture of how
you know number of people paying tax in
India is very few so well mr. Gandhi I
know you have to leave so one quick
question before you go do you believe
that the advice given by the RBI was
heeded to do you believe the RBI board
was given enough time to consider a
decision of this size do you think the
government did right by the RBI board in
this case the first value actually have
mentioned they even a a number of
comments and serious comments that are
away but had made on the proposal that
itself brings out the fact that our way
by board has applied its mind even even
though the time given was very short but
they are able to the very
able to analyze the proposal and compare
it with whatever possible impact that it
may have so the Buddha has been
sagacious in terms of arriving at the
conclusion we haven't up at the time if
you would as you would say that three
there are two or three hours or whatever
is insufficient but within that time
itself it had come out with significant
observations so that shows that it has
done its duty very well and two two
quick points I wanted to make that the
demonization had other objectives one is
elimination of for of course one is it
tackling the black money the other is
about tattling the counterfeiting
counterfeiting in these three years of
course is it too early also because a
completely new set of notes have been
brought on it is not easy for any
counterfeiter to simply copy that yes
they have a crude counterfeiting like a
photocopying and everything that has
happened that will ever happen so that
is not the real counterfeiting but the
serious counterfeiting which we have
seen prior to this that has not happened
at all and that is unlikely to happen
because some completely new series have
come on at one go and all the old series
have been better on so that benefit
definitely has accrued to the countries
and they had there not been demanded
session they level up yes go ahead
mister the level of cash in the economy
would have been much much higher than
what they say the level of cash that is
in the economy you had there not been
the motivation would have been something
like 25 lakh crores or whatever and
today actually it is 20 lakh crores so
that means that there is a reduction of
file across of cash that has been
financed realised I so to say the cash
which was would have been otherwise
there that is now been in the form of
financial assets or aerial assets so
that is another benefit of demonization
alright mr. Gandhi many thanks for
joining us on the show just to bring in
the rest of our panel Vivek ready
spokesperson for the BJP are sure though
she is a senior journalist professor
Arun Kumar is the chair professor the
Institute of Social Sciences we also
have with us our cash Jindal and
economist AJ do our former Commerce
Secretary and of course be we called
Christie's with us
I thank all of you for joining us on the
show I'm going to open this up right now
to the panel but by once everyone has an
opportunity to make their arguments
Ashutosh I will come to you of course as
a journalist and I'm sure the vehicle to
agree with me these daily stories that
we did during D monetization I mean was
shocking for us and the anecdotal
stories that came in from friends and
family of what was happening outside
every bank was just unbelievable but
TIFF now find out that the government
now we can safely say ignored the advice
of the RBI and went ahead and did this
anyway basically means that all fallout
or D monetization decision stands with
the government and not with the RBI
Ashutosh team C I think what the Prime
Minister spelled out on that particular
day that why the D monetization was done
done to to tackle basically treating the
black money the drug and if I remember
correctly it was terror funding and then
there and the counterfeiting the four
still I think there is no check on these
things and so what was the what was the
real reason behind that D monetization I
think that still need to come out and
what was most baffling was that even
after D monetization when the question
were asked how much money had come back
to the to the Exchequer nobody was ever
told even the Parliament committee was
asking questions to urge it pertain and
even Patel was not in a position to tell
exactly what has happened and finally he
I'm being told that he has resigned from
from the RBI because of the D
monetization though he never spelt out
but my sources has told me so so it has
been a very very mysterious baffling
exercise in my opinion first of all what
was spelt out had never happened terror
is still a reality the counterfeiting is
still a reality the black money is still
reality if anybody says the black man is
completely wiped out from the system I
am NOT going to believe that okay so the
real reason has to be has to be to be to
be a certain and I hope some day the
truth will really come out mr. J there
was the former Commerce Secretary mr.
Thor I thank you for joining us and good
evening to you do you did you find the
minutes of the
RV I'm eating worrying because the RBI
board effectively predicted what would
happen with this decision and that
prediction was ignored
subtly the minutes of the meeting which
you've been able to get through the RTI
is a matter of concern that the federal
government central government chose to
ignore the views of the RBI which is the
body kind of given the responsibility of
running the monetary policy of the
country
however fee I think the army I cannot
repeating that they were not aware of
what was happening because after all
some amount of logistics arrangements
had been made by the area because very
next morning
socata trucks BP trucks and had been
used by it to send out new currency
notes
so some sent some notes were ready but
what also bothers me a bit a bit is that
the concerns expressed by the RBI of
were are more by way of like at any
conservative body with most federal
banks are a conservative Department of
the government where it's not opposed in
any sense of the word that the
government should not go ahead ready
monetization but has pointed out a few
difficulties and the fact that the
consequences in black money covering as
much as a form of bureaucrat yourself
would you say that this is commonplace
in government offices to mildly caution
but not actually stand up to the
government I think it requires it varies
from a person to person in the
government if this was if the RBI felt
so strongly about it that 86 percent of
the money was to become illegal tender
within six hours of it meeting ended
then certainly it should have pointed
out to the government what the
consequences would be and it was not as
we all know mildly upsetting the economy
but it was virtually for several weeks
derailing the economy where the most
vulnerable persons that means the daily
wages the farmers the farm labor as well
as those working in the organized sector
but not on the record yes in fact in
fact the medium term was a dnalien of
the economy the short term was a
derailing of people's lives
they were senior citizens who were
extremely inconvenient farmers like you
said daily wages who just simply
couldn't go on with basic day-to-day
life there has to be accountability for
why that decision was made Vivek ready
of the BJP joins us now the vague ready
D monetization has fallen off the cart
of the government's achievements you
barely mention it now that we're in
election season is it a bad dream that
you wish never happened I don't think so
the Prime Minister's tweet on in
November 2018
which is hardly three months ago jfa
says that the Congress is questioning
the monetization because it has taken
such radical steps which led to the croc
crackdown of several shell companies and
the number of shell companies which have
been cracked down is up to 3 lakhs but
sorry Vivek ready ready you did not
place before the RBI that your aim of D
monetization was to crack down on shell
companies that was not the declared a.m.
and you can't keep changing the gold
which is black money that money's was
this theory we know it has nothing to do
with one second
one second mr. Reddy one second one
second one second
maybe so here's the thing Shelly couples
if they did exist there is the Companies
Act they're all registered or they have
they have to have bank accounts it's
very easy to find them and crack down if
that's different you don't have to do
you monetize 86% of the nation's
currency to crack down shell companies I
mean that was one of these theories
which was brought in later along with
digitization of the economy so let's
forget that there's no acknowledgement
of the hundred people who did die nobody
has even bother let me just clarify
second thing you go ahead can you do you
know that there are three lakhs
companies which are closed first one
kindly look at the second the second
issue is about thirteen point five four
lakh accounts in India which had holded
about two point six six eight lakh
crores thirteen point five four lakh
accounts holding about two point six
eight lakh crores these account holders
even today have been unable to explain
satisfactorily where they got the money
what was the source and therefore these
accounts are suspect so what is the
total exposure is two point six eight
lakh crores
how many people have prosecuted with
this new evidence when you have received
three lakh crores and it is two point
six eight lakh crores mr. Reddy yes how
many people have gone to jail you say
how many people have gone to jail
because of this new evidence you have
received how many these double no three
point um now now when after the election
all these are suspect accounts will the
Government of India and the BJP
acknowledges one hundred people who died
during the monetization it will all you
apologize to those families will you
apologize to the hundred families of us
no come on fee come on please what what
do you mean come on hey come on please
I'm very same you let me tell you faith
no no I don't I don't understand I don't
understand your your theses fail I mean
the sort of everything up it was I
really understand it well the government
apologized a hundred families who lost
loved ones during demonetised shacks
collections no no I
don't understand the sort of narrative
that you're putting forth where there
there are bound to be some serious
repercussions yes he serious are very
precious it cannot be lost
yes it cannot be lost there are bound to
be serious repercussions but look at the
large-scale impact on the economy look
at the large-scale impact on economy I
wonder you know I really don't know I
really don't understand free you you are
prone to take certain incidents and you
exaggerate them mr. Reddy
give me mr. Reddy I don't think that mr.
Massarelli please tell me how one you
exaggerate yeah hundred in how do you
exaggerate the day one second one second
all right I heard you worked I heard you
out you have to hear me out also and
I've heard you out you you suggested
yesterday it'll be Fay mr. Reddy
you have to talk to stop talking to be
able to hear my question amount of tax
collection prior to do monetization was
8 lakh crore today it was 15 lakh it
doesn't matter that was not one of the
aim is empty monetization monetization
and GST no has led to doubling of that
what do you mean doesn't matter India
that is not one of the aims declare for
the monetization mr. Reddy is obviously
not willing to listen to any of the
answers let's move on to the other
panelists I do want to point out if
there is anyone watching I would tell
you I do want to apologize to anyone
who's watching right now who might have
known someone who passed away or lost a
loved one at that time I do not believe
it's possible for one to exaggerate the
death of hundred innocent citizens to
believe it's something as a country we
should acknowledge and we should perhaps
also apologize for there are two
panelists who haven't spoken yet
professor Arun Kumar and Akash Jindal
Akash in value first do you believe that
the government should have paid
attention to the rbis morning pay
firstly lots of congratulations for
winning the top editor award I think it
was 15 February but this is my first
show after you since then and it's
lovely to be on a platform which is
getting so much of recognition and
respect now as far as the monetization
is concerned I
take you back to the RBA report what
I've made out is that RBA's perhaps
saying that black money exists in two
forms one in real estate one in gold now
whenever I have talked about the
monetization I have always spoken D
monetization and the follow-up action if
you see the follow-up action the
government has kept cash transactions
whether it's real estate whether it's
gold so those people who were into the
illegal business of using black money
now they have been penalized who had
illegal black money assets in gold or
real estate they can't exit it so the
target so the black money people have
already I already been impacted they
have already been penalized now coming
again to the GDP growth just for the
short term we were impacted but as of
now the World Bank says 7.3 percent GDP
but that's a January 2019 report for
this fiscal 1819 and for the coming two
years they're talking about 7.5 percent
growth rate international agencies say
globally we are into a state of gloom
and globally the GDP growth has been
downgraded 23.3%
China they have be escalated from 6.5
percent so you're saying Japan the third
biggest economy they had a one quarter
negative yes so growth is growth is okay
except for the jobs issue I'm in BJP has
problems on the job this time just
growing economy in the world as far as
jobs are concerned but I I I'm I'm
talking about sir but we have the jobs
issue I mean you have to answer if I'm a
professor on Kumar here's the thing and
I every last week to comment on this is
well
the revised GDP data tells us that we
actually grew at 8.2 percent during d
monetization wendy monetization was
happening to us now this caused a large
number of people to question the GDP
data at all do you agree that growth was
not affected
do you believe and agree that the
government did the right thing
cause tax compliance improved and that's
what makes it okay so hey you know what
I'd like to say is that the GDP data has
a lot of problem when the government
says that we don't have employment
figures then how do they estimate the
unorganized sector because you require
the employment figures to estimate the
unorganized sector and the data for the
unorganized sector comes once every five
years when you do service so that
assumption is the unorganized sector is
growing at the same rate as the
organized sector that assumption was
true before the number-8 but not after
number eight with unorganized sector
unambiguously declined the organized
sector was still rising perhaps so in
other words the methodology had to be
changed and that's why my argument has
been that the rate of growth of the
economy is not seven percent if you
include the decline in the unorganized
sector which is shown by a data from all
India manufacturers organization from
the Punjab Haryana Delhi Chamber of
Commerce and Industry etcetera then the
rate of growth is less than one percent
today and the World Bank does not
collect independent data the World Bank
only reproduces the government's data
and that's why it will say what the
government is saying therefore World
Bank is not an independent it a data
collection agency it cannot collect the
data independently and that's why that
would not work
how are coming back to the RBI's issue
are it's good that we now have the
minutes because earlier it was said that
the RBI board met in the morning now we
know it met at 5:30 earlier it was said
that the the meeting took place in the
morning and it was recommended and then
the RBI governor went back and met the
bank managers but now we know what the
truth is but the important point is that
here it did not give in writing that the
D Morton should not be done in 1978 IG
patel who was the governor then gave in
writing when only 0.6 percent of the
notes were high denomination note he
said that this will not solve the
problem of black economy it will create
problems in the economy as a whole the
second point is that the discussions
were going on with RBI for six months in
the six months period the RBI should
have made a complete analysis of the
impact
Damona typhoon would have on the thing
it should have also made an analysis of
how much counterfeit currency there
existed
unfortunately the RBI did not do that
and finally if the RBI thought it was
negative I think it should not have
given the go-ahead to the government
because that gave the sort of fig leaf
to the government to go ahead with the
decision which they're already made so
in effect what I'm saying is while it's
good that the RBI made certain points
about the ill effects of it but it did
not go far enough to say it should not
be done it did not give in writing it
should not be done if it had given in
writing that would have been a very
different matter altogether yes the
special point I'd like to make is that
the unorganized sector which operates in
cash data that has been damaged very
severely and the idea that cash means
black that was underlying the idea of
the monetization that is not true and I
see the confusion in the RBI's report
when it says black money is held in the
form of real estate etc and freeze back
black wealth and black money is only one
component of that so RBI is again making
a mistake the same mistake that the
government made yes in the 2012 white
paper black money in the my question
this is not correct this this argument
of we are the fastest growing economy in
India and wake ready actually saying
despite all of this why does it have to
be despite why did we create a man-made
hurdle that we would have to trip over
and then still do well in fact I would
like to rephrase what we wake that he's
been saying India is not the fastest
growing economy in the world India is
the fastest growing large economy in the
world so there is an important
distinction that needs to be made then
there is this bit about China right now
we need to take into account the fact
that China is a ten trillion dollar
economy and we are two point six
trillion so even if China grows a few
basis points lower than we do like you
know in in 2017 China grew by around
some six percent it added 1/4 of the
Indian GDP to its economy it's that big
so you know you have to take into
account the fact that as an economy
grows bigger and bigger it its economic
growth is bound to get slower but at ten
trillion dollars if China is still
growing at six percent it's a huge
achievement I mean at two-and-a-half
trillion we are finding it difficult to
grow at even seven percent yes that is a
you know I don't find you should caution
our viewers about D monetization had
three specific goals and through the
course of that D monetization process we
saw the gold change to digitization we
saw the gold change to opening more bank
accounts we saw the gold change to a lot
of different things but we have to in
order to be able to properly assess the
solidus of failure one second success of
failure of any government move we have
to stick to the original goals in fact
you know I want to just make one more
point which you know the deputy governor
made please the former deputy governor
and you know I mean it's surprising that
it came from a person who was a deputy
governor of the you know the RBI so when
when the 20 monetization happened the
cash to GDP ratio was around 12% it fell
to less than 9% and it has been growing
ever since and it's now closer to 11%
yes so there is nothing that suggests
that it will again touch 12% in a few
years the other thing that you know
needs to be countered here is this
theory put out by Arvind Subramanyam the
former chief economic advisor who
equated you know the amount of cash in
the economy to the level of corruption
which is very very you know if we look
at global data it's a very stupid point
because you know Japan has a cash to GDP
ratio of 19 to 20 percent now Japan is
in inherently more
Nigeria has I have some numbers here
Nigeria has a ratio of around one point
eight five percent so you know cash and
and and you know amount of cash in the
economy has no link to corruption so you
know I also want to point out the RBI
was asked by the parliamentary panel in
September 2017 an official estimate of
the black money that was a sting
extinguished with this move and the Army
has answer was there is no information
in this regard so I I and I'm going to
just ask this now this conversation I
need to move one step further mr. Jay
though the question is this it has been
21 months since the monetization was
announced aren't the people of India
owed an answer and explanation of white
paper on who advise the government what
research was this entire decision based
on what the final impact was on GDP on
jobs on black money on counterfeit
currency whatever it is let's have one
final word why is it the journalists
have to use RTI to sort of extract
pieces of information and put together a
collage of what really happened where I
would totally agree with you I will in
fact been saying it for a while now
particularly after the RBI governor's
evidence before the parliamentary
committee where he could not point out
the advantages are the pros and cons of
this very major monetary measure
I think the even if the goal posts have
changed which normally one should should
not the cost which has been paid or
incurred by the economy as a whole for
these parts for a cheap make for these
attainments is not commensurate with it
at all it is not for the government to
refute this and point out that all right
we may not have thought of all the
possible benefits there have been
certain side benefits of it as well as
maybe certain side ill ailments or which
have cropped up but
whether they were severe or not that
needs to be refuted otherwise public
both informed as well as otherwise would
continue to base itself on anecdotal
evidence as well as the fact that there
was a fair amount of press as well as
opinions expressed which had pointed out
that the government had taken measure
for which it has not done adequate
reparations I should oshi I want to take
you back to what you said about yes yes
oh I'll give you an opportunity after
there's a hundred people who died with
vacantly said that they will be
repercussions or send increase in the
number of taxpayers okay Ashutosh go
ahead i think if i push it increase in
the number of 50 like more next period
by by the BJP spokesperson it was not
only the death of these people there
were many marriages which could not
happen and that many people had sir had
suffered and see I have I just failed to
understand that why this government is
hiding the data D monetization and there
is a pattern there's a clear pattern
here the clear pattern is that you can
you cannot know the the the price of
structure there are file deal you cannot
know about the about the farmers death
there is no no data about the farmers
death you cannot find out the job data
from the government you cannot find the
demolition data and above all the CAG
report on that defense deals which you
should be on online even that has also
been bid on now the question is if the D
monetization data people cannot know
there are other five things which PP
people cannot cannot know in a democracy
if the transparency is not there if the
people are not being told what exactly
is happening that means there is
something to hide and that is my
question that is my question and that's
what I described was not what it was
spelt out is occasional you and I have
had enough of these conversations to
just let's just settle on the fact that
the government owes us the data and an
explanation
definitely the government owes lots of
explanation not only for D monetization
it's for jobs many other things BJP has
to give us answers but one small limited
point now RBI perhaps says that black
money was in the shape of real estate
and gold if now if it was like so now we
all know transactions have been capped
in cash now those people who had money
in these illegal assets black money
assets now they have been penalized they
can't come out of that so black money
has already been hit that is one point
which nobody has perhaps with due regard
I would say bothered to answer now
supposedly somebody had invested black
money into a real estate deal subsequent
to D monetization government has capped
cash transactions so how would that
person come out so he has been penalized
for doing illegal activities in black
money secondly now I have lot of respect
for call saab he's a veteran now he's
saying that Chinese economy is growing
at 6% at sufficient paste China itself
is admitting sir that they are their
beans they have suffered severely and we
are now making adjustments to according
to America just pray in order to our
economy sorry I only have finished I
only have a minute
I give that minutes to vevey I want to
focus more than the Chinese economy
all right III do want to focus just on
this transactions being capped in cash
we could have kept track without doing
this is what I wanted to say and to also
say that transactions are not happening
in cash if this because transactions
have been you know captain cash doesn't
mean transactions are not happening in
cash I mean that's we actually on this
channel did stories pasta monetization
six months in but people were still
taking cash three months in with a cash
had a going rate I can I can only talk
about where I live so you know I live in
central Mumbai in any one should try
hiring an apartment you know at 100
percent check so you know you they will
know for sure as to whether transactions
are happening in cash or not so I mean
just because they
I just wanted you bring it back to one
of the things now increased tax
compliance the increased you know people
using bank accounts less cash being
moved in though and and following
success of PTM which is also a happy
coincidence for that company after D
monetization and transactions being kept
in cash all of these things could have
been done very easily without bringing
the country to its knees for three weeks
we needn't have gone through demolish
there was no link between you know
increasing the amount of digitization in
the economy and you know sending all of
us on a merry-go-round for a period of a
couple of months so all right so we have
run out of time but like I said then
they we rode as a country an explanation
we rode data we have to understand and
we have to be told at this point or
whose advice the government of India
decided to make the decision of D
monetization who was advising you what
research papers were you referring to
what was that massive need to bring in
that surprise decision there's no longer
the need for secrecy you can tell us now
and we are also owed a white paper on
the final impact of D monetization on
the GDP on jobs on the farm sector on
agriculture on farmers on daily wage
laborers on small businesses on the SME
sector on the real estate sector on
laborers who work in the real estate
sector and so on if the government wants
to tell us that they have found so many
thousands of bank accounts with
unexplained cash in it I would like to
know what action have you taken against
those people how many have you
prosecuted how many people have gone to
jail for not paying their taxes and how
many people currently are strolling the
streets of London wearing ostrich skin
jacket and have not been brought to the
book D monetization was a singular
decision that affected all of us we are
know we are owed an explanation thanks

come and following the Ethiopian
Airlines crash and I'm quoting here Jet
Airways has five Boeing 737 max in its
fleet but currently is not flying any of
these aircraft the airline is in contact
with the manufacturer and the regulator
in context of this development and
off-court those are the details that are
coming in this is the statement that's
coming in from Jet Airways let's go
across to you negombo joining us on the
phone line
Heena obviously this was the first
question that perhaps went across
everybody's minds as to how many such
aircraft do we have here in India which
are the airline's flying them and at
least now Jet Airways has clarified that
they are not flying any of the Boeing
737 max AIDS
well what is important to note here is
the fact that one Jet Airways have got
five Boeing 737 max aircraft in its feet
and apart from jet we have spy jet which
operates Boeing 737 max Patrick has got
12 from the Indian regulator which is
DGCA there is no direction as of now to
the Indian operators to ground going 737
max at a time when two such aircraft
have crashed in less than five months
only directions has been given to Indian
operators as far as the precautionary
measures are concerned now Jet Airways
has issued a statement saying that five
it has five such aircraft and it is not
flying we know how the financial
condition of Jet Airways is quite bad
and there are many aircraft which are
already grounded so it seems that
perhaps among those are these five
Boeing aircraft as well it does not mean
that jet has grounded these particular
aircraft they are very much a part of it
it is just that they are not blinded but
the big question today is that at a time
when airlines across the world are
giving importance to passenger safety
following these two crashes in less than
five months why is the Indian regulator
still in a wait and watch mode why are
we not seeing a strict action link
by the Indians edca vai only directives
are being given that something that is
important jet of course in a statement
has mentioned that they are not flying
it but they haven't really grounded it
because of the reasons that other
airlines across the world are grounding
Boeing 737 max
all right thanks enough for getting us
all those details of course those are
some extremely important questions
remember this is coming now at a time
when there are places like Singapore
Indonesia China even who've all grounded
who've asked their local airlines to
ground this particular Boeing 737 max
it's in the airline's fleet and at this
point the Indian aviation regular has
not done any such thing it is just it
put forth certain safety requirements
certain rules that need to be followed
if this aircraft is in fact to be flown
we have like inna was pointing out two
airlines that is Jet Airways and

on the debate tonight new headache for
the Modi government Labor Bureau notes
that incomes from farm and non farm
based jobs have clocked an appeasement
growth of 3.8% data released by Labor
Bureau shows that rural wages have grown
three point eight percent you're on
you're in December lowest ever for this
month this comes from the back of lower
prices for farm produce rural farm
workers say they are unable to make ends
meet
last week is an Opie summer schedule is
people up dangling about our checked out

sulky they are adding about neurotic
about Italy at Pisa you have a July

whoa both developed a British colleague
or advocacy Lucas in the case of say
when West Kadamba Johanna Carla coming
back me because make with your
government culinary more proof that the
agriculture sector is in distress
recently India had witnessed over
thirteen massive farmer protests across
the nation mirror now asks has the NDA
government failed to address agrarian
distress will the agrarian crisis be the
biggest challenge for the NDA government
in the upcoming elections let's debate
[Music]
good evening most of y'all would have
got done with your annual appraisals now
the good news is that companies are
expected to pass on an average 10% hike
to their employees this year and I call
it good news
why I'll tell you in a bit take the case
of our farmers or other skilled laborers
in rural India now a Labor Bureau report
shows that wages in rural India or
income growth has slowed down which
means not just farmers laborers are also
make not making enough money now add to
this the fact that money from farm
produce has gone down because food
prices have crashed which is again good
news for you and me but not so good news
for a farmers or for the rural economy
and at the same time input costs for
farming like irrigation like electricity
and pesticides caused have actually gone
up no wonder then that our farmer is
angry now add to that those working as
labourers in rural India what you have
then is a situation where people in
rural India are just not making enough
money now that's what the latest numbers
from the Labor Bureau reveal we are now
going to sit down with a panel and try
to decode what that means is there a
problem in rural India how desperate is
that problem and in an election year how
could this impact pull outcomes now
that's the question I am going to pose
to our guest tonight
joining me is professor I don't Kumar
was chair professor Institute of Social
Sciences former professor and
chairperson of the center for economic
studies and planning at the JNU also
joining me is G Chandra Shekar who's a
senior journalist and Harish de Madrid
who is a Rural Affairs and agriculture
editor at with the Indian Express
joining us in a little bit we'll also be
Bhaskar gross who's a spokesperson of
the BJP and avec Sahab spokesperson
Farraj India and Wawa Suliban Mohammad
Khan who's a spokesperson
of the Congress party but I'll begin of
course with you
Harish de Madrid you have of course
reported on those numbers that came out
of the Labor Bureau if you could tell us
what it means for rural India how bad or
how dire is a situation see everybody
knows that farm incomes have been under
stress you know because of prices
crashing across crops okay but what is
very clear is that the the problem is
not just confined to farmers it's also
confined to the other sectors of the
rural economy you know the rural economy
is supposed to be very diversified and
it is more diversified than what it was
you know and and and generally there was
a talk that you know okay a farm farming
is doing badly but but rural India is
not just about agree you know the non
Agra is doing well you know that was a
thing but now now it's very clear that
even non Agra incomes are under stress
you know the the fact that not just
agricultural wage growth but even you
know so-called skilled works you know
even there the wages are under pressure
you know whether it's a plumber whether
it's an electrician whether it's a
construction worker whether it's a it's
it's a driver you know so so I think
what we are seeing is a general rural
stress you know which goes beyond
agriculture you know initially it was
probably mostly based on based on
agriculture you know because of because
because of low prices and all but but
basically the rest of the economy too is
not doing well you know whereas I think
what we were having earlier was you had
good agriculture growth high prices you
know prices were increasing every year
so you had good farm income farmers were
spending that money you know and that
was in turn sort of triggering all
around rural activity that was what we
were seeing whereas now the whole thing
seems to be decelerating and and we
don't have enough jobs even in in
sectors like manufacturing you know
construct
those were the kind of things where so
probably I don't know maybe the impact
of both both D monetization and GST I
mean I think I think the cumulative
impact and what is interesting is that
the slowdown is continuing and we are
more than whatever more than two years
done with the D monetization and GST was
supposed to have settled down you know
so so I think I think I think I think
the stress is now all around you know
that is that is the thing so so how do
you say essentially what you're telling
us is that the money flow is essentially
stuck in rural India the farmers are the
ones who are supposed to be making the
money by selling the produce because
they're not making enough money they are
not able to buy or consume enough and
that's a reason by the other laborers in
the recall you you you speak to right go
on go on absolutely you speak to any
pipe man if you you speak to any pipe
manufacturer you speak to any
two-wheeler manufacturer they'll all
tell you that you know generally rural
incomes are under stress you know and
and and and and probably I think in the
period between whatever you know 2005 to
say maybe I don't know 2013 2014 during
that period the maximum crook growth for
companies you know that the Delta was
coming from rural you know like like if
if urban was was they say if urban
consumption was rising say say say 1x
you know probably rural was doing 2x you
know so so I think the I think the
entire Delta was coming from rural areas
you know even when it comes to say cars
you know then then other things you know
things like say paint you know cement so
so I think the whole thing that that
that engine has completely slowed down
both the consumption and investment yeah
honey shall come back to rural
consumption in a betta have my questions
about that as well but let me bring
bring in the G Chandra Shekar over here
if you could you know sort of there was
the other point that Harish made about
the impact of demo and GST how has that
really hit the rural economy absolutely
I think it is hit really
but coming to this without for the
moment taking away the seriousness of
the the October December 2018 data I
must mention this has not been a sudden
phenomenon it's been happening over the
last several quarters and the the latest
data only go to prove a trend which is
an absolutely worrisome trend of falling
falling rural incomes and or lack of
growth in rural wages this is something
which is not good for this country after
all 53 percent of the workforce is
engaged in agriculture and related
activities rural sector is a huge
contributor to to the economy and and
therefore rural distress is something
that needs to be taken very very
seriously but pardon me saying this I
have not seen any serious attempt over
the last three or four years contrary to
our earlier expectation I have not seen
any serious attempt at addressing the
structural issues of Indian agriculture
yes a number of schemes have been
announced a whole lot of 100 page
booklet was issued a couple of years ago
a whole lot of schemes but I think they
have not really translated to anything a
substantial or tangible for the rural
population particularly far for farmers
and for farm workers and this is
certainly a worrying situation and the
sooner we address this the better but
now we are into we're only an election
mode nothing is going to happen over the
next three months
so come June and let's let's wait and
see what's the what's the composition
and color of the new government and
whether they will really zero in on this
problem and and start working towards
addressing we have to be obviously the
new government will come but we have an
election that is coming up and of course
this could be a big big factor that's
what we'll be asking
the party spokespersons are joined us
but before we go to them
I don't Kumar if you could explain to
people watching this at home what it
actually means on one hand your wages or
your income has not grown as much as it
should have it's actually grown slower
than it is it should be growing on the
other hand you're not getting enough
money for your produce and on the third
hand you're also seeing a situation
where input costs the cost for
pesticides acosta fertilize in
fertilizers the cost of water
electricity etc is actually increasing
what does what happens to a farmer or to
a laborer caught in such a bind so you
know to explain the problem of farming
is the problem of the unorganized sector
we know that the unorganized sector
employs ninety four percent of the
workforce and it produces forty-five
percent of the output now the
unorganized sector is in trouble
and ninety four percent of the
employment is being hit as data seems to
suggest then it means that demand comes
down and therefore the bulk of the
demand for food which comes from the
unorganized sector if that demand comes
down food prices also go into a
deflationary situation second point is
that when these people get unemployed in
the urban areas they go back to the
rural areas and therefore this excess
labor over there and that puts pressure
downward on the wages both farm wages
and non farm wages so in other words the
wages do not rise the prices for the
farmers fall these are all linked to the
fact that the unorganized sector is
declining and as has been already said
by the previous panelists the shock to
the economy was first by D monetization
because the unorganized sector works in
cash and when there was cash shorted
it's the unorganized sector that got hit
and then the GST which also hit the
unorganized sector because they are not
computerized they cannot cope with the
GST mechanism so even though they are
exempted from GST they still cannot cope
with it and therefore demand is shifted
to the organized sector so as a result
the unorganized sector got hit
both by D monetization and by GST and
then by digitization which is going on
in the economy because the unorganized
sector cannot deal with digitization as
a result of this what you find is the
man raiga demanded shot up the
allocation two years back was
thirty-seven thousand crows now it's 60
thousand crores so that demand is
persisting now all this implies that
there are lot of people in the rural
area looking for work therefore the wage
rate has declined now the question is
that still does not mean incomes of the
workers if decline that is because the
amount of work available per worker that
is also declining so not only the wage
rate because the wage rate is marginally
risen so it's also question of how much
work of you are getting and the RBI
report seems to suggest that even man
raiga people are not getting hundred
days they're getting less than hundred
days of work because that money has to
be spread out therefore its wage rate
into the amount of employment that
together is the income of the workers
and that is declined so in other words
the crisis of farmers the crisis of farm
labourers is the crisis of the
unorganized sector in the economy as a
whole
and unless we are able to address that
problem that problem will persist and
that's why we see that in spite of
demotivation having been done 2 and a
half years back in spite of GST being
done more than 20 months back
the problem is persisting because the
unorganized sector remains in crisis and
what you see in the farm sector is the
crisis of the unorganized sector right
Harish
just just to put things in perspective
if you could tell us tell our viewers of
your what is the average wage in rural
India currently that depends you know it
depends from state to state but but
generally you can say about say 350
rupees you know 3 325 350 rupees the the
thing is it's not rising you know see
earlier earlier 10% increase raised was
very normal you know whereas now it's
hardly increasing the the rates are not
increasing and as an S professor Arun
Kumar said you know even the number of
days of employment also are probably
coming down you know so so probably the
the way to measure stress is not just by
wages but we
into number of days you know so so if
you look at incomes probably definitely
they are under stress you know and and
and you can see it you know like like
like for example say four years ago or
three years ago you try and you know we
are in cities you try and get look for a
maidservant you know somebody somebody
who will work at home it was very
difficult you know to get a full-time
help today you today you call out you
know you'll you will get I mean I don't
think you'll have to wait for more than
one week you know it's very clear you
know the the the the stresses I mean it
is it is palpable you know so and and
and I think that is the main thing the
number of days you should come both the
number of days of work and what is the
wage rate that you are getting you know
and along with it the collapse of many
labor intensive industries you know
whether whether it is textiles you know
power looms whether it is diamond
cutting brass where you know all these
things you know so so I think I think
the entire that fabric has sort of
collapsed and it's a serious crisis and
and I'm surprised why political parties
are not raising this you know and
instead going for all other you know all
other things like I don't know whatever
ramzan fast and you know those kind of
stuff you know problem let's bring in
our political parties in but we'll begin
with a week's AHA a week sahar we've
spoken to you a number of times on the
channel especially when our farmers have
come out onto the streets in protest but
illnesses do you think that as a country
we've not really we've sort of
underestimated the distress in rural
India first I want to congratulate
Harish for that excellent article as
always since info journalism is a class
apart again professor Allen Kumar's very
succinct analysis you see the crisis of
jobs in the Agra sector in rural economy
was clear to us more than you
why an organization like aik SCC all
India Kesang Saunders Coordination
Committee wasn't for the first time a
common platform of farmers and farm
workers you know the red flag green flag
blue flag yellow flag everyone was
together so we could understand and
sense that this there is a grave crisis
of getting jobs now if you shift your
attention to narita currently the
government owes around twelve twelve
thousand crore rupees which it has not
been able to pay and this year as
Professor Arun Kumar rightly pointed out
the bill could touch anywhere between
fifty five to sixty thousand crores so
overall what is happening is it's not
just a question of jobs not being there
or the price of you know the labor costs
are not rising what's happening is we
are seeing people ready to work for man
Riga at half the average and will
liberate man Riga gives you something
like between hundred and seventy two
hundred eighty rupees that's almost half
the labor rate that Harish was pointing
out so we are pushing a lot of people
towards a dole economy and that's
something to be very very alarmed about
I'm sure the congress spokesperson will
have something to say about that but
overall the prognosis is very very
serious
if a large section of the population has
to move on to dole then your whole
economy is about to collapse that's how
we see it and it's alarm it's very alone
so lemon or Matt cut what do you have to
say I think as we all know that the
agricultural sector the farming sector
is under you know great distress
therefore this rural you know wage
growth rate is going down
if we compare of UPA to from 2009 to 13
the average arrow near wage growth rate
in real terms is 6.7% and if you come
2014 218 during this nd or BJP
government's point 5 percent so it's
very clear that the that the rural wage
growth rate is you know in a bad shape
it's going down and even if we see the
agricultural growth in past 4 years it's
1.9 percent and if I'm compared for 10
years of UPA it was 4.2 percent on an
average from 2004 to 2014 one of our
panelists was talking about manraja
manraja workdays have dropped from 45
days in 2014 the workdays average was 45
days in 2018 it's sixteen point three
days as for the RBI report
99% of manraja wages remain unpaid in
April two thousand eighteen Modi ji has
also promised to double the farmers
income by 2022 but it's not possible
because compound double envelope rate is
2.5 percent so to achieve double the
income you need to have 10 percent of CG
cagr growth rate so therefore I am
saying that all these are joomla's and
therefore the farm sector is distress
one of the panelists very rightly said
that D monetization and GST is also you
know contributed to this distress and
trouble in the in the agricultural
sector of the rural sector for the first
time since independence BJP government
imposes tax for GST on agricultural
equipments like tractor agricultural on
n agree implements there's a 12 percent
GST tyres tubes transmission part 18
person pesticides 18 percent cold
storage is 18 percent this is the first
time since independence so it has also
contributed and we all know how D
monetization has badly hit as far as the
promise which is he has made about mr.
Modi has made about you know the MSP he
has completely failed to give he has
said I will give the cost plus 50
percent of the promised for past four
and a half years he has not done so one
of the panelists was saying that
Congress party need to raise all these
issues sir with all due respect
when this government completed four
years in May two thousand eighteen I am
just trying to you know look into the
figures this is a booklet we have
published four years forty questions we
have questioned the government on in May
2010 a full booklet has been published
and given to everyone and we have also
done a press conference the first issue
in this booklet we have questioned the
government is on the agricultural
distress and the bad shape of
agricultural sector so it is the
government at the centre to blame there
are other issues like sugar cane areas
of 20,000 crores the society former
society the farmers known and dates so
all these issues are completely you know
all are contributing to this
agricultural distress and drop in rural
wage growth growth rate right sulla
Mohammed Khan it is very nice that the
Congress is actually published a booklet
and you blot it out right before the
elections but we would have wished that
you'd ask those questions also given
enough no we would have wished that it
are also denounced in the parliament on
the floor of the house because that is
where business is done and that is where
you should be presenting our interesting
thank you have it let me help us and
show it on your channel let me bring in
Bhaskar gore sure let me breathe Oscar
Usha via a Bhaskar goes your government
famously promised to double farm income
its you've been in power for five years
now have you lost the plot you have a
problem on hands do you accept that
there is a problem on hands on your hand
and have you lost the plot first of all
dodgy let me see my Congress friends was
talking lot of statistics and all this
kind of thing but he should remember
that whatever MHP price we are giving
for last five years we have just
completed is much higher than what they
have even thought of now you're talking
about the double the income so it is it
is a complete baskets is a pack
what we offered one side we have
increased the income or increased the
MSP we have given subsidy in annum coded
urea we have given us a lot of
relaxation in the in the power in in the
electricity consumption we have created
a whole benchmark of infrastructure for
the producer to get the maximum price
for its products we have created a
market we have set of operational
operational digitized system to to to
get the market the consumer and the
producers as as close as possible we
have made a huge cabling network so that
the market should in in the coming days
the market should operate on a total
digital platforms on our one-to-one
basis so if you see the entire package
into the basket which is after
independence the first time in this
country it is occurring yes I I accept
that they double the income make we
cannot give it but at the same time we
have put the entire 21 crops under the
MSP price so if you do the permutation
combinations and see the net or
resultant effect of that obviously you
will find that this particular growth in
Agra industry agree sector is much much
you know bigger than or higher than the
last 15 20 or 30 years right let me now
bring in fortunately I have with me two
gentlemen who track the agriculture
sector very very closely to each other
Shekar would you care to tell us how the
MSP increases actually played out on
ground has every farmer got the benefit
of MSP for every crop that it's been
announced we believe from what Bhaskar
goes tells us MSP was increase for 21
crops I'm happy you asked this question
I remember a few months ago in the
Reserve Bank's annual meeting I was
asked to
to speak there and I was asked to
discuss MSP and its impact on the market
and impact on farmers and I said MSP is
a political imperative you can't do
without it
MSP has got to be announced but MSP more
often than not is completely unrelated
to market conditions to take pulses for
example we had a couple of years ago
what's that
Arvind Subramanian committee report
where I found he he said pulses have
fantastic qualities of nitrogen fixation
therefore farmers must get a much better
price he completely ignored market
conditions because pulses are allowed
for import freely and the world market
has enough and more pulses to supply to
India and never you kept the import
window open but you raised the MSP for
farmers never got the MSE or most of
them did not get the minimum support
price before MSP alone is not going to
work in our country we need MSP plus
plus what is this plus plus the first
plus is a robust procurement system when
prices fall below the MSB we need a
robust procurement system to mop up and
support the market second often I have
found that procurement alone is not
going to work we also have to look at
our import export policy we have to look
at our tariff policies import duties and
export duties again going back to the
pulses example when pulses MSP was
raised and but we had a large crop in
this country prices declined imports
were still coming into this country six
point six million tons of import and and
the procurement was weak therefore we
are still carrying that burden of
inventory in the last two years and
therefore prices are not recovering the
fourth you need MSP which is a political
imperative but you need a robust
procurement system plus you need a very
judicious combination of trade policies
and tariff policies so is it is it safe
to say then that most farmers have not
really benefited from the increase in
MSP well certainly in case of pulses yes
I have no doubt at all but I can't say
the same thing about rice and wheat in
rice and meat most farmers in Punjab in
Haryana in yupi and parts of Madhya
Pradesh have certainly benefited but but
in in in several other parts of the
country I'm sure there are pockets which
are left out of of the food corporations
procurement system and therefore and
therefore we can't say that we have a
robust procurement process in this
country I think we did we think that
when you say they're left out of the
food corporations procurement process
does it mean that it'll sell in the open
market and then when farmers sell that
produce in the open market are they
being paid at least the MSP or are they
getting not really there is actually
distressed sale and I know in case of
oil seeds I know in case of pulses there
is actually distressed sale in regions
where there is no procurement so there
you have it you have most farmers
actually indulging in distress sale of
their jobs you're not even at one point
right please please please come in for a
one can please come in
yeah Kavita you know I'm just trying to
add to the Leonard panelists observation
the agriculture exports have plunged and
imports have rising is very right
you know the figure for 2013-14 Eden it
is in u.s. dollars in billions was for
the three point two three billion US
dollars in 2016-17 it's thirty three
point eight seven the exports have gone
down by some nine billion US dollars and
import was fifteen point zero three in
1314 financial year thirteen fourteen
fifteen billion US dollars and it is in
1617 it is twenty-five it has rise in
and you know as far as the pulses are
concerned the food grain mafia was
permitted to import pulses at the rate
of rupees 44 in the financial year
2015-16 and were allowed to sell it
to 30 per kg this is the truth and you
know the production of pulses was bumper
to 21 lat
turns in 1617 still we imported 56 lat
terms of pulses at a rate of 44 per kg
this is what has happened as far as
sugarcane is concerned you know there
was a essentially telling us what
Aaron's really telling us let me let me
let me make it very clear for our
viewers over here what we are looking at
is a situation where the MSP which is a
minimum support price below which a
farmer should not be selling his produce
is not really followed across the
country what is in fact happening is in
a lot of cases farmers are ending up
distressing now the other problem like
Suleiman Khan just pointed out is that
at the same time Agra imports have gone
up I agree exports have come down which
means even though we have a good crop we
are still importing more of that crop
down use and which is a reason that
prices have collapsed now that's a
situation that we are looking at in the
market now the other thing that you
mentioned
Baskar goes if I could if I could bring
in Professor Aaron Kumar on that he's
Bhaskar go spoke about automation I I
understand over here this is what we
call this is what was also earlier
called as Eamon d'Orsay a mechanism to
link all the markets in the country
electronic market has it really taken
off is it working chance in hill you
know let me step back slightly what I'd
like to suggest is that the farmgate
price which the farmer gets is different
from the price which is available in the
mundi and very often this is because of
the distress that the farmers in and he
just unloads it to the mundi you know
and the de monetization process when it
brought about a shortage of cash what it
meant was that the farmer was not
getting the cash immediately from the
trader and that caused further distress
to him so d monetization had this effect
of separating the
farmgate price from the male and his
price even more than what it was earlier
there's always a gap and that caused
further distress second point I'd like
to make is that we are talking about
supply side responses we should talk
about the demand problem the problem of
demand is that this inadequate demand
and that's why 40% women and children
are malnourished if they had enough
purchasing power they'd be able to buy
that and there will be no surplus and
actually the stocks that we have would
simply disappear with 40% could eat
properly what they they had so in a
sense what I'm saying the unorganized
sector where the demand has fallen
dramatically that is the reason why
stocks have risen now this is an old
problem because it's not that
malnourishment is started now but this
problem is getting aggravated even
further and therefore the problem is
arising now regarding the Mundy's you
know Mundy's can begin to function
properly only if the monopoly element
that prevails in the money's that is
taken care of unless that is taken care
of
I don't think Iman D or anything else
would really solve the problem that the
farmer faces so all in all what I'm
trying to suggest is vial supply side
things are good we must look at demand
side and in this mechanization leads to
loss of employment so as you have more
tractors more harvester combines etc you
have less employment available to the
workers and that is causing a problem
and that's why the employment elasticity
in agriculture has dropped to close to
zero that means hardly any jobs are
being created even when there's growth
in agriculture so that means that the
distress in the unorganized sector in
the farm sector is also a result of the
kind of mechanization that's going on
not only in the farm sector but also in
the non farm sector and also in the
urban areas so this problem of
unemployment is a result also of the
mechanization that's taking place second
let me bring in Bhaskar go Shearer
busker goes to of the big moves made by
the government has not really had the
desired impact what else do you have up
your sleeve No
and I was just falling closed in
statistics and whatever is my fellow
panelists are talking about but okay
with I just answer me one question see
if it is if such a situation how we can
achieve a GDP of around seven seven
point two seven point five percent
because the industrial sector is growing
I will cultural sector is growing if it
is not grown what he is talking about
then how we can achieve such a high GDP
I don't understand economics of or the
mathematics of economics if it is like
that number two whatever is my is
professor M Kumar is talking about with
due respect to him these infrastructure
whatever he is talking about the e
portal or the e markets and the D ties
Asian and giving infrastructure and and
also giving the crop insurance giving
the cash on credit card then giving a
lot of a lot of relief from the bank
interest so all these things you have to
take as again I'm talking about in
tandem with each other
here to see whether the farmers are
getting from the trap of interest
whether whether they are getting
directly to the market to the producer
to consumer and the difference is
reducing or not obviously what what my
fellow panelists are talking about that
we have not achieved the targets it will
take some time even the effect of the GM
effect of the D monetization and GST
will take some more time in the longer
run to be filled but we talking about
the holistically we want the entire
agricultural community to get out of the
trap which was liberal which was created
for our seventy years so if you go on
point-to-point statistics may be the
answer you do not get the answer
properly but if you talk about the
entire holistic policy decision of the
government and implementing phase wise
of that right whatever has been done for
last 70 years cannot be undone in five
years but of course in five years we
have given a new direction of
agricultural growth agricultural I mean
the crop insurance and
and agricultural we can say the degra
cultural habitat in the hole that you
must be appreciating in fact in fact
also busker goes should just now spoke
once again once again busker goes show
just us I want to make a quick point
guitar right right but I I have a I have
a question that I want to have put to
you gentlemen in fact let me play
devil's advocate over here busker Gore
spoke about the GDP numbers now there
are a couple of other rural economic
indicators let me bring that into play
now what now the economic times says
that if you could track the sales which
is an indicator of the growth of the
economy in the in rural India tractor
sales have actually gone up twenty two
percent over the last one year between
twenty sixteen seventeen and twenty
seventeen eighteen at the same time two
wheeler sales also an indicator for
rural economy has also shown of fourteen
point seven percent increase according
to cm now if one of your gentlemen could
just explain to me how is it like
Bhaskar goes so eloquently put it on one
hand you have the GDP going up on the
other hand you have tractor sales and
you have two wheeler sales going up how
is it that people in rural India are not
making enough money if they are buying
why don't they have the money in their
pockets can I can I ask our own to
explain that to us yeah in fact these
contradicting it is contradicting right
i I I'd like to point out that yeah that
the data on economies growth rate of 6%
or 7% is based largely on the organized
sector data the unorganized sector data
comes with a time lag of five years now
when the government says that it doesn't
have data on employment and employment
figures are used to calculate that GDP
growth of the unorganized sector that
means the government doesn't have any
data on the unorganized sector now the
unorganized sector if you look at the
various surveys done of the unorganized
sector like all India manufacturers
organization you look at Punjab Haryana
Delhi chamber of commerce industry and
sector's declined so the real rate of
growth of the economy is 1% is not 7%
and that's why the data is consistent
that unemployment is rising farmers are
in distress is consistent with 1% but
not consistent with 7% so if the rural
distress is real then the economy cannot
be growing at 7% that's my point number
one point number two is that more
tractor sales means less employment
generation for that what I want to I
want to I want to make a point here to
make this point even the World Bank is
just let it make a spoil or tractor
sales will mean less employment
generation the rural areas so so what we
have is mechanization more harvester
combines both freshers more at you know
tractors therefore the employment
situation deteriorates further and
therefore the farm distress increases
further for the lower sections of the
farming community and the employment
generation right Oscar goes I know you
want to come in but let me also bring in
harissa mother in he wanted to make a
point
yeah so do I yeah yeah you look at
tractor sales 2017-18 the high growth
came after two years of decline okay
2013-14 tractor sales peaked 14 15 15 16
it it fell and then you had 2017 18
which caught up okay and two wheeler
sales you look at the data for the
current fiscal 2018 19 prices have
crashed and if you ask too will the
manufacturers they'll tell you that lot
of stock is now lying in the in line
with the dealers okay and and and and
and nothing is selling from there you
know so a lot of stocks are are
accumulated at the dealers end and that
is why now you are seeing sales come
down even in the case of two wheelers
okay
this is this is this is one thing the
other thing regarding tractors you know
displacing labor and all these things I
don't think so you know we we had very
high growth of tractor sales combine
harvester and
mechanization we had in the period from
2003 for to 2013-14 I don't think they
ever displaced any labor or you know
that kind of a thing
rather they created new kinds of labor
like like like for example if you go to
rural areas this lot of you know bad
jobs which are created through through
you know repair of machinery and you
know those kind of things so it's not I
I won't say that you know employment
elasticity of Agriculture has come down
you know certain certain jobs I don't
think should should continue beyond the
point in in in agriculture like like
like for example if instead of manual
transplanting if you have mechanical
transplanting there there's nothing
wrong in it you know and I don't think
mechanization is a reason for falling
short of time yet but bring the focus
back to where it belongs on the rural
wages and the fact that we seem to have
a distressed rural economy on our hands
right now the question that I now want
to ask my panelists is what does it mean
have you completely underestimated the
situation and secondly what does it mean
for a country that is going to pull a
visa there will be some impact of this
on the polls I can't tell you exactly
what if these three state elections that
took place in December November December
are any indication then the rural folk
are angry what I would also like to
point out is that there is going to be a
mass migration syndrome which has
already started and this is the systemic
failure to deal with the agree agrarian
crisis at the Agri sector issues is
actually far beyond polls
I know Harish his article compares the
NDA performance with the BJP performance
and you know that that could be a
subject of interesting debate but
finally it's not that the Congress
during its time was extremely far more
friendly and did a lot and the BJP is
not doing anything
both our are bad now we are just
disgusting which one is worse than the
other
and besides the Congress has been
sitting on the swaminathan Commission
report forever and I haven't yet heard
of the it's implementation on the c2
plus 50% of course I have heard of loan
waivers so in election time agrarian
issues rural issues will become pool
planks I fear after elections they will
be promptly forgotten lost so I am
looking for a government in the years to
come that will actually look at
agriculture as an important sector in
the indian economy and will look at its
structural correction growth and future
that's what it should be and I do hope
that these elections are fought on the
critical issues of unemployment and a
gradient crisis and not on some you know
peripheral issues of Valor and what what
have you so yes
important issue in terms of election but
not being given sufficient focus as
you've rightly pointed out right I'm
running short of time let me bring in
the two party spokespersons Suleiman
Mohammed come yeah I I the Leonard
panelist said that Congress has been
sitting on the Swaminathan Commission it
came in 2006 and yes it's right we were
there for some seven eight years after
it came but even mr. Modi who has
promised the Sun and the moon to the
people of the country has completely
failed he has not even fulfilled the
problem solution very quickly do you
have a solution that is do you have a
solution yeah what is it I am telling
one by one because I didn't have a
chance in between and as far as as far
as as far as the sweeping statement
which mr. Modi and all we GOP leaders
makes that you know the wrongs done in
70 years cannot be corrected in five
years so you should have pulled the
country in 2014 that we cannot do in
five years and it's very easy to say the
country has been built you know step by
step slowly and gradually we what we
gave you in 2014 it was not in 1947 so
it's very easy to say as far
agriculture growth is concerned for four
years it's by one point nine percent for
ten years from 2004 to 14 it was one
person and I'm running short of time I'm
running short of time
Bhaskar Ross Geller's do you do you
accept there is a little distress do you
have a solution for rural districts see
let me go with the one thing if you see
that if you go to the Swaminathan
Commission report the policy and the
other you know suggestions was made to
rectify point-by-point I can say that
this government has implemented more
than the previous government on
point-to-point basis you don't have time
so I am NOT going detail of that number
one number two is that in the total
aggregate agrarian sector we have to see
the per capita outputs
now this sells increases for tractors
and all these all justifies that
whatever cultivable land is available
out of that the per capita output have
been increased or not that is our
mechanized system of the of the farming
now the supportive system that is that
is water the providing the water
providing electricity providing the
Morea providing other allied factors
whether there is in stark improvement or
not then after you should judge that
whatever we do Swami's and Commission
report we have implemented because we
cannot go up to that target of course
but whatever you implemented is better
than whatever it was implemented before
that
so now holistically holistically if you
see the per capita to GDP right it has
been increasing after after let's not
try and hide behind numbers so that's
not Chinese
it's not try and throw numbers and
confuse confuse the country or confuse
the viewers over here what we need to
understand is
that there is a situation we do have a
situation in the rural economy there is
a serious problem over there you have a
problem where people are not making
enough money you have a problem where
they are not able to invest enough
because input costs have gone out of
hand and they are forced to survive with
a little that they have we have a
situation where the people who put the
food on our plate do not have enough
money to eat themselves to feed their
own children and that is the problem of
EUR and the other problem of course is a
way that our governments have been
looking at the entire issue our
governments whether it is a BJP whether
it is a Congress before the BJP all of
us need to take take a step back and
understand where the farmer is not
asking for much the farmer is asking for
a fair price for his produce the farmer
does not want a pity the farmer wants
his dignity he wants a fair price for
his produce the day you give him that
that is a day that you will have won
over the farmer and the rural economy
something that our political parties can
keep in mind before going into the polls
thank you very much

the Election Commission has also
instructed the political parties to use
only eco-friendly materials for
campaigns keeping in mind the
environmental hazards by the plastic and
polythene remember the Election
Commission has made it now compulsory
for the candidates contesting polls to
publish their criminal records in
newspaper and television channels at
least three times during campaigns which
means that criminal record of candidates
filed by any party will be publicized
for the first time in this looks of
Elections now with the announcement of
the election dates on Sunday the model
code of conduct has also kicked in and
in order to empower citizens in the Lok
Sabha polls the Election Commission has
introduced the see visual app at pan
India level whereby citizens can report
violation of the model code of conduct
to the election authorities directly in
fact just to recap the dates for the
looks of my elections for our viewers
which were announced on Sunday the
elections will be held in seven phases
during which 90 crore Indians will vote
to elect the 17th look Sabha the first
phase will begin on the 11th of April
and the last phase on the 19th of May
now the counting day will be the 23rd of
May maranao sichuan kumar spoke to the
former Chief Election Commissioner via
Sampath who announced the 2014 election
dates we spoke to him to get his
perspective about the seven fierce
elections the preparation of the
schedule is a very laborious task the
Election Commission almost preparation
for general election takes place about
13 to 16 months before the actual
announcement of the elections they are
to go all over the country
take different climatic conditions into
account examination what is suitable for
one state it will not be suitable for
another state plus we have certain areas
which are special
mystics like you know left extra
mysterious no J&K some other districts
which are critical from Lara point of
view some states which require only a
first election because it said it is
possible to conduct election only with
the central security forces so keeping
all this in mind after a very elaborate
exercise discussion with all concerned
including the state governments I
remember when you know before VR or the
elections we had one or two rounds of
meetings with the state Chief
Secretaries state DGPS apart from all
the important functionaries at the
central government level like Home
Secretary etcetera as a result of all
these things and again you're the
constraint of the season
like for example north east northeast
you allowed to complete the election
almost first you have to do the election
because that is an area where monsoon
sets in early the kind of voter turnout
that we are seeing the introduction of
Vivi Pat how important are these aspects
in 2019 looks of high elections of C
ultimately what is the purpose of all
this exercise like affidavit publication
of details of the affidavit putting it
on the website now they have gone a step
further said you should publish the
criminal records even in the newspapers
all this is what X should know what is
the kind of candidates who are coming
before them seeking their votes to
represent them once everything is
brought out C ideally yes there should
be some mechanism to disqualify the
people with criminal record some
proposal has been made to the government
it has been there for a very long time
with the LA ministry for whatever reason
notation could be taken but you might
recall some time back matter event
before the Supreme Court also earlier
people used to say
the Election Commission should ban well
do we have the powers to ban the
candidates qualification
disqualification of the candidates is

Alexson joining us on the phone line
Alok tell us more about the stampede
that happened in Rohtak what was the
provocation how did this happen I love
if you can hear me I just wanted you to
tell us a little bit of more details of
this stampede that killed one person in
Rohtak I believe this was a political
gathering with the Congress MP present
as the chief guest I'm unable to connect
to our look I'll just inform our viewers
at this point that we are talking about
this stampede that took place at a free
ration camp and this was attended by
Congress MP as the chief guest Congress
simply depend the singh hooda was
present there one person one woman
killed in the stampede several others
injured we are still waiting for more
inputs to come in but that's latest
information that we have at this point
Alok coming to you can you share more
information on how is it that in a camp
that was organized by the Congress party
where the MP of the party was present
something of this could take place where
one person lost her life how did the
Stampede happen well this incident has
happened yesterday in the afternoon that
there was a bat camp that was organized
by a local social worker who is also a
Congress worker and he had organized big
camp and he had invited around thousands
of people that who are mostly dead
people and apart from that he had
invited a dependable Dalit the biggest
of and he was the MP of rotor and after
laughter chief gets relief because he
gets these there he also addressed the
people and also there was politically
speech was made and after that he left
and soon after his Li
because there were the people that who
were waiting for the distribution of of
the Russian and it got delayed and that
and if grew restless among them and that
is the main cause off for that kind of
stampede that occurred during that that
incident occurred and one lady that who
whose name is would be baby [ __ ] as she
succumbed to her injuries because she
got injured and apart from that for five
more persons that received injuries they
were taken to the hospital in fact after
the incident the MPA in fact said that
he that incident only occurred after his
release after after he left the event so
as of now that police's registered a
case and now we started the
investigation what was the false in
what's how it all occurred what the
police said exactly clearly there was
mismanagement at various levels and
there was no level of preparedness to
handle perhaps the kind of footfall that
came in for this particular camp I look

biggest event in our that our country
witnesses in living proof of a thriving
democracy has officially begun now 900
million that's 90 crore people are set
to what in the world's largest such
exercise 15 million or one and a half
crore are in the age group of 18 to 19
those who've just recently got the legal
right to ward and here is a big headline
the key date that we had all been
watching out for may 23rd will be the
counting day the result day elections
will be held in seven phases starting
from April 11th all the way up to 19th
of May and then the counting on May 23rd
except in Jammu and Kashmir Assembly
polls and by polls will be
simultaneously held wherever they are
due right now let's put this all in
perspective and get the conversation
going here let's say good evening to our
export team sitting with me this evening
radicalisation consulting editor to
business standard birth control
political analysts with us in our
studios macho Saiyans in his journal is
joining us from Kellyanne relative ari
our consulting editor also with us when
I let me start with you seven phases all
culminating on May 23rd how is the
picture looking right now well I mean
more or less okay though little few
surprises in in my book I think there
are certain somebody did ask that
question to the CC about for instance
Alisha being put through a multiple
phase poll which is not exactly how it
happens but I guess the fact that
they've contained into seven phases is
welcomed because we've gone as much as
high as nine on one occasion predictably
ups Bengal and Bihar are in every single
phase which is exactly how it is every
time so that's not a surprise and from a
political point of view of course we
still don't have the notifications we
don't know which constancy is going to
poll on which day but phase three in
terms of the size is of course the
biggest so that's perhaps the most
politically relevant I guess once we see
the sheedy we'd probably know that as
well yes phase three which is on 23rd of
April will have about 115 constituency's
that will go to vote across 14 states of
course in the number of state twice with
91 constituency's is what we will see on
11th of
Andhra Pradesh Gujarat Arunachala
Haryana Himachal Pradesh Kerala
Meghalaya Mizoram Nagaland Punjab
Tamilnadu Telangana and Utrecht on these
are the states which will only have one
face on one single day the entire state
will go to vote and like when I was
pointing out on the other hand you have
three states be harboring all in Uttar
Pradesh who will see seven phases of
voting cannot caracas tan Manipur and
Tripura are the ones that will see two
phases of voting Jammu and Kashmir will
see five phases but like you were just
listening in they won't be any assembly
elections held in Jammu and Kashmir
right now only lakhs of elections and
politics over that has already begun
with Omar Abdullah lashing out but we
thought that we let's now look at what
would be the key things let's now look
at what it is that could perhaps decide
the course of this election season may
or may not really play out as the big
themes this political season but let's
get our first views in mr. Rath what did
you think any surprises there as far as
the election dates are concerned or
pretty much the routine no I am NOT
surprised at all because whatever has
been decided it is as per our tradition
so most of the state said they like
Gujarat and go our and other states they
are going in one phase for the last
three four elections now this is the
same I'm surprised about the Bengal why
should Bengal go in all seven phases I
didn't understand perhaps because of
natural light problems they must have
decided to go in smaller smaller phases
then then large phases otherwise Bengal
should have gone in three or four phases
at boost
ups you always goes in more phases
because of the size of the state
otherwise is nothing in the thing is
extraordinary in this schedule right now
it is to be seen what will come out of
it what will be the verdict it's like
the Maharashtra State like Morocco is
going in first four phases yes both
initial first for this March they will
be over
so perhaps and the non order machinery
and other movement
we moved to other other states after
this so they would believe the fourth
phase happens on 29th April yes then we
still have almost 20 days for the last
phase to go so a lot of dejection
earring will happen during that that is
my work conjunction all right so here
are the basic questions that we've put
together that we would be asking our
panelists and and discussing over the
next one our question number one will
the post aerial strike shift in national
narrative impact the poll outcomes in
other words do you think that the strike
that we carried out in balla court and
Pakistan is going to help the BJP gain
an edge this election season question
number two will the aggressive push of
nationalism card by the PGP help them
check their loss on ground that we've
actually seen there if there is a
sentiment at BGP hat is right now
lagging in a few places will cling up
the nationalism card one more time
health the party the big issues have
been the farm crisis and the job crisis
or the job crisis debate will they still
remain key election issues and we built
the water have that in mind when they
finally make their decision question
number four and this has been a big big
conversation point again can Narendra
Modi's chemistry Trump the combined
opposition's arithmetic of course to get
to that point first you have to also ask
will there be a combined opposition by
the end of this entire election season
or will they end up was just fighting
within themselves but largely the
sentiment is Modi versus rest how will
that play out question number five will
Congress's consistent attempts to use
rofl as a corruption case will that
narrative work they have again and again
and again played out on this do you
think they have successfully managed to
put this idea in the people's mind to
make them question whether there was
corruption question number six will we
see it
you deep rural and urban divide that's
also largely one of the big themes you
see in election season will we see that
divide again play out during campaign
and will schemes like the economically
weak section quota of 10 percent and the
farm support income that the government
has already announced when this help the
BJP regain some of the last ground so
let me go across the radicalization on
question number one good evening miss
llama session what's your view do you
think politically good evening these
strikes we carried out in Pakistan will
help the BJP certainly in the urban
areas and I'm talking about Delhi and
some of the adjoining places in Haryana
and utter Pradesh which I where I have
been speaking to people it has kind of
reshaped the narrative you know I mean
after those three electoral losses in
December it looked like a gradient
crisis and GST D monetization would
probably dominate the discourse but
suddenly you know people are talking
about India's audacious strikes across
the border in Pakistan of teaching
Pakistan a lesson and you know if you
ask a question that why was the killing
of those 40 CRPF soldiers allowed to be
happened in the first place wasn't that
gross intelligence failure nobody is
willing to Brook any kind of questioning
yes okay but I mean I must qualify that
up our Western UPA and Haryana out you
know marshal territories a lot of the
service forces come from these regions
so maybe the sort of nationalist
sentiments ignite the imagination of
people their political sensibilities and
so on but definitely there is a
reshaping of narrative happening in
urban delhi across the board and it's
not just restricted to ex-servicemen or
military people I mean you know middle
class lower middle class poor people
everybody is saying that only Modi has
the valor to do this kind of a thing
that there's also another reason for it
the other side looks so hopelessly
divided I mean is the Congress going but
they are not going with the app I mean
the whole thing is so stupidly fluid yes
that you know they the opposition is
quite making a laughingstock of itself
so here you have a leader you have some
kind of a narrative you have a theme
around which the discourse is shaping up
so these things do work in the favor of
the ruling party however we just have to
see how the opposition's discourse
shapes up in the coming days and they
will have to master all the skills all
the stratagems direct command to make
some kind of an impact so I just I have
a couple of data points and of course it
may be too soon to see how it pans out
in the coming weeks but actually an
opinion poll that was conducted by India
TV and CNX after the airstrikes forecast
that BJP could win about 41 of the 80
looks of us it's in motor petitions
there's primarily forward with the
Pradesh which is obviously well below
what they got in last time which was 73
but it showed a gain for BJP from a few
weeks ago before the air strikes the
other data point is that Reuters spoke
to about 49 farmers through in the
states of Maharashtra Auto Pradesh
Madhya Pradesh in Karnataka and only 18
of them still said that they will vote
for BJP so there is still a you know a
segment that may not necessarily just
decide on the basis of these airstrikes
but definitely mr. mr. Bachchan
the BJP has tried to change the
narrative and if we speak about that
specific airstrike and the support to
the forces they own the narrative there
yes
that that definitely I mean this is of
course a a feeling and a very genuine
feeling that the narrative has shifted
there is no opinion poll that has taken
place since Paloma and the and the
airstrike in Bala court so we really
don't know how much that impact will be
but we do know that the trend which was
going away from the BJP on the basis as
radhika said on the basis of things like
GST de monetization agrarian crisis and
so on that trend has been reversed now
we really don't know how much it has
been reversed because to begin with
various opinion polls in December and
January January this year December last
year actually showed a very very mixed
picture with moderate chances of the BJP
alone emerging with moderate chances of
the opposition United emerging now that
narrative has changed in the sense that
there is a single point on which you
have mr. Modi in 2014 of course mr. Modi
again was projected as the only leader
standing tall there was there was a
corrupt Congress there were squabbling
opposition parties well I think in a
certain sense that narrative is is still
there because moody suddenly standing
tall on the basis of national security
however the squabbling opposition
continues as they were in 2014 what has
changed is in 2014 it was moody plus
corruption of the Congress and the UPA
and now it is moody plus the security
threat or the feelings of of Europe of
terrorism overtaking this country so
there is moody plus security
earlier it was Modi plus corruption now
that is definitely something that we
need to take cognizance of i really
cannot say how much of a swing it will
have on people's mind i do not know how
long it will last because we've got a
seven phase election so i do not know
what will happen over the last next
hundred days i mean for that matter just
as a joke we have the IPL coming along
also and they're catching eyeballs on
your television screen yes but i do
believe i can say quite categorically
Modi plus security as
the moment does have the edge over the
squabbling and rather loosely lit oh so
like you said it's a it may be difficult
to predict the extent of benefit that
they'll get but when a is there is a
real you know past precedent we can look
into like what happened post Kargil did
it help the government then is there
something that we can look into it from
that time so there are there are two
presidencies and I think much I
mentioned the IPL the Indian Premier
League and Indian political league are
not very different in that sense right
both are played almost like a t20
nowadays you tend to forget what
happened three days ago pretty quickly
and I think that's perhaps a important
point you have exactly a month for the
first phase also remember the the
narrative of nationalism the narrative
of Pakistan is largely or North
phenomena it's not if you go south of
India's these things don't resonate as
much also because of historical reasons
I mean South if India is not some a
place which has ever faced the pangs of
partition the hatred of Pakistan is not
that deep they've not faced invasions
it's it's a North issue and in the north
for instance in places like Chu RunAs
and just the day after the strike if you
remember mr. mu the end or alley into
first race will be made and that is a
part where virtually every household in
that village has a soldier in the army
absolutely places like guitarra current
for instance you have every other rank
official Jevons coming from large parts
with recurrent so there are pockets in
area in the urban areas of course
nationalism plays a large role Pakistan
is a unifying factor in terms of you
know reuniting people I think a lot lot
will depend on how the BJP plays out the
next one month I have a feeling they
will have this time release of so-called
evidence they will do all of that
because how you sustain the momentum it
will make a lot of difference on how
much you can exploit it and that's one
reason why we were very interested in
checking out the election commission
seat by see announcement because where
they can exploit it is something which
is of immense interest in this
particular election correct so I mean
what would be the constituency in states
that you will be watching out for in the
early phase then well I would certainly
be looking at sub parts of Uttar Pradesh
for sure because look in Uttar Pradesh
they have an arithmetic problem and they
kind of know that and I think the only
hope that they have to counter the
arithmetic is to play the nationalism
patriotism Pakistan card because that's
the only thing that can unify you
against arithmetic
of caste and religion to some extent
that's the only option they have parts
of the August conferences which is a
straight fight between the Congress and
the B Jason I think Rajasthan which is -
phase one of them is six may I I think I
missed the earlier date oh yeah also
investing role for instance like in all
the Lee is playing that card and that is
getting dovetailed into the so-called
nationalism patriotism card as well
there is an energy factor there as well
and there is this polarization that is
happening because of that - so a lot of
issues are getting intermingled I think
the larger point is that because of poll
Hama and bulk quote the momentum and the
narrative of jobs and farmers has been
arrested to some extent it's not being
talked about as much and the opposition
is finding it difficult to bring it back
to the mainstream I can you can sense
the opposition feels that way because
it's aluminium just yesterday kept on
insisting about jobs being the only
issue so they kind of sense that and I
think they are trying very hard to bring
that back up in the national mindset
instead out do you agree that do you see
nationalism trumping over farm crisis
and jobs is narratives from the ruptured
right Ivan has really pinpointed the
whole thing the BJP is narrative is
changing if you see their expressions
and their speeches Modi's mood it does
mean changing and it will change further
it is said that people attentions must
know that people's memory is very short
and so in the sense of nationalism that
loss so my feeling is that now we are
exactly one month away from the first
phase of polling yes ok the second phase
is on foot 18th of April and then there
is quite 23rd of oil so if something
happens say another surgical strike that
happens within this period and then
perhaps the whole picture will change
further so that is that is my feeling
that and Modi has very calculated Lee
said that we had given all the rights to
the army yes to take action without the
political repercussions so that means
that he has thrown everything on army
and if army takes any action Modi will
say that I hear them all rights so he
does not take any any burden of that
other the other hand some other things
we have
that neighbors if I am not attributing
any motive to that but he said that
there is a chance of a technics attack
coming from the sea yes that's what the
naval chief has said it means the apart
from the Haryana and Rajasthan Punjab
the people from the coastal line Western
question Ryan like say Gujarat or
Maharashtra Mumbai concur and they will
also be alerted so the sense of security
the sense of insecurity that unites
people first absolutely and if that
happens that visibly stands benefited
that is one thing so a another surgical
strike be the license given to the Armed
Forces to act as per their will and wish
that these two things and the fear of
another sea attack coming that would
that would make all the all the
difference so the narrative of BJP was
sure the change in the next one month's
time and if that happens then it is
beneficial to the to the ruling side
okay you know I wanted to move the
question about three but very quickly
the Kurama session wanted to come in and
make a point and also yeah you it's just
a 30-second squeeze I just wanted to
mention this I don't know what you all
think of it but the comment that Home
Minister has not Singh made yesterday
was very interesting when he came out to
say that we have carried out three cross
water strikes
I will only know of two of them and I
won't speak about the third one now
technically if you see there have been
three cross water strikes one was the
surgical strike in P okay one was the
Ebola code strike in Pakistan and the
third one was in mind mark but the
government has spoken about the minor
surgical strike so it was a very cryptic
you know comment that he made and he
said it again and again I don't know
what you all think of it but go ahead
radicalization you wanted to say
something yeah you were talking about
presidents you know I in 1999 after the
Kargil war the election that was held in
September October the the impact was
very mixed you know and you
before instance the BJP Stanley came
down from 58 Lok Sabha seats to 89 and
the vote percentage also fell so that
sort of indicated that Carville didn't
have the kind of impact that the BJP
would have looked for in oseh Pradesh
and the reason being that the maximum
number of body bags returned to the
pradesh and agrarian crisis I covered
that election very closely so I can say
with some responsibility agrarian crisis
was a major issue then itself in those
elections and farmers were very upset
with the watch by government so they
decided to vote against the BJP on the
other hand Rajasthan Madhya Pradesh
returned a handsome number of seats for
the BJP so we just have to see how the
impact plays out my own surmises that it
could differ from region to region as
somebody's as Vinay said the South the
South is not impacted that much by
nationalism and cross-border conflicts
and so on
perhaps I mean barring Karnataka I don't
see this nationalist sentiment be over
playing in any of the other southern
states but in the North itself you know
the impact could differ from state to
state and that would be very interesting
to watch like mr. Roth you wanted to say
something yeah I want to say that yes
there is farmers issue there a farmer
starvation and cases of suicides going
up but when it comes to national
security
versus other issues national security
takes the prime seat so I don't think at
the end of the day it will to have any
impact but they impact that would
perhaps happen in in the urban areas
would be perhaps a ruffle issue because
if you remember the befores issue had
come up and that took the wicket of Raju
Gandhi if you remember that yes yeah so
it would it percept but at the same time
I would say that in 1971 when Indira
Gandhi won the Bangladesh war and
immediately the elections happened and
she came out with flying colors so so
that these truth
that always comes forth yes so I'll come
to the foul bit in just just one moment
it but a mr. Batra send do you agree
that when it comes to nationalism even
e-even farmers are you know love maybe
fear or the security sure that
everything will forget their own pain
their own debts and and still go ahead
and vote for the BJP what about the
farmers when we I'm I'm actually a
little a little cautious about this
nationalism card of course if there's a
full-scale war going on between India
and Pakistan lastly we probably a sort
of war was there in Kargil but it that
was in a sense an undeclared war
Pakistan pretended it wasn't there but
the in Bangladesh was an example which I
saw in my living memory that kind of a
war does have a huge upsurge of
nationalism but this I'm not trying to
dismiss what happened in Bala court I'm
not trying to dismiss Pulwama but this
is on a much smaller scale
I do believe what mr. rod says that is
that if there is for instance yet
another one in from the sea this time as
our Navy chiefess has suggested or or
said abscess that he suspects might
happen then it will change the ballgame
but if it is a little more than a
skirmish and more than that okay I do
gubedu go along with the fact that India
took a decisive decision to go 80
kilometers into Pakistan Territory all
of that is there but I do not know how
long the nationalist fervor will last
and actually how soon the realism of
life which is basically acute rural
distress impoverished impoverishment
lack of jobs and so on I do not know how
quickly that will come back on center
stage
secondly a beleaguered opposition which
now begins to see the game going out of
there it's great
could be galvanized into uniting for
instance
if the SP and b SP stay united in utter
pradesh whether there's nationalism or
not whether there's a sort of chest
something or not the caste combinations
alone will could definitely make it much
worse than what that not much better for
the opposition than they had in 2014 I
mean the BJP will stood there daya what
he was wiped out in 2040 this time I
don't think she's going to get wiped out
at all I do believe that two things are
happening here I don't think there will
be such fervor because it's not war
anymore yes unless we all have a series
of strikes in which case by the way we
will all begin to suspect something very
very fishy and not just a naval attack
it's just very very fishy something
fishy if it keeps happening what I do
believe is that I do believe that if
there's no more surgical strikes and so
on this might die out and the real
factors which were plaguing the BJP
joblessness a gradient crisis
impoverishment all over that could come
to the fore and of course if the
opposition stops playing one game that
is a file in a file and goes back to the
basics yeah and unites then it could be
a much tougher fight that's a lot of ifs
there are to be factored in and a lot of
it has to do with whether opposition can
unite and get its own house in order I
have to take a very small break but
those are the birth you know two big
themes that we will look into when we
come back the opposition arithmetic
versus a united challenge if they can
put one up against an arranger moody and
there are four factors so stay tuned
we'll come back with lots more
[Music]
welcome back may 23rd is when India will
find out who's going to be part of the
next government who's going to be part
of the next Lok Sabha 543 seats that go
to polls between 11th April and 19th may
well we are in the middle of a
discussion with our expert panelists to
figure out what could be the key themes
and what could be the key issues that
could swing the votes and we left off
the conversation where mr. Batra Sen was
speaking about the opposition and you
know how many of them end up sticking
together all at one of the big alliances
that have already been announced of
course is SP nbsp vanilla so let's start
with you do you see that continuing
lasting certainly I think the BSP peace
Alliance got announced way before anyone
else did and they were very clear about
it and I think both leaders are very
pragmatic in that sense they're also
very street smart they know that if they
don't come together almost both of them
risk being wiped out completely and I
don't think they want to do that also
remember both are also playing this game
not just for 2019 but also for the 2032
Assembly elections and and they know
that this is the only way in which they
can stay relevant in a state which is
the only thing where area where they are
actually of any significance in that
sense so they are pragmatic this polity
this alliance was certainly last and
it's also an alliance which is based on
very sound arithmetic so in yupi for
instance the BJP staska is pretty
difficult there's no question about that
I mean bachi I mentioned at the start
about my body getting wiped out
she got zero seats but she got 19
percent votes shares and you will rarely
see a situation in a local election
where a party gets in 19 to 20 percent
votes but doesn't win a single seat so
that's the starting block that she
always has with her and you just do a
plus factor to that along with the
Alliance it's a formidable challenge for
the BJP no doubt about that okay but
does it work on ground because obviously
when the SP congruous Alliance happen in
the state elections their own ground
Carter wasn't in support of it and that
I mean I saw that on ground it was
counterproductive for the Samajwadi in
the SP Congress Alliance the problem
more was that [ __ ] the SP actually
considered more seats to Congress than
they should
if they ended up harming themselves by
giving over a hundred ten seats to to
the Congress and I think that was a
strategic mistake you are right about
one factor that the charters and the
others for instance traditionally can't
get along and to have them now being on
the same side can impact some bit now
the question is that how much of damage
can this do it's a force alliance they
don't naturally get long the Giada's
cants handle or constant the others
dominance and superiority and if you
remember both states whenever the party
depending on who comes to rule their
destitution gets divided completely on
stuff on caste lines so pretty obviously
there is some damage there but is that
damaged enough to actually cause a
problem which is going to help the BJP I
doubt that okay okay and what about the
others and we've also got mr. kinship
now gone author incinerator joining us
this evening recipient should knock your
view on on the entire movie versus a
united opposition argument do we do we
see I believe we've lost the Audi lines
with him so I'll go to across him in
just a bit mister peres let's go a lot
your view does it work what about the
other senator bobbin I don't want that
man as you met a few times but it's not
played out after that there is they will
go down one side yeah let let me put my
image and Nick out and say that this the
basic concept of mahathat abandon either
non-starter and it has happened now and
again many times it isn't happening this
is because within the market abandoned
except perhaps Congress rest are
regional forces and in the regional
forces every regional party has a
supreme or every reasonable is one
leader and their population we look at
that will hero as the prime ministerial
candidate and if that person for example
in West Bengal Mamata Banerjee
or in March the shattered power if their
own followers they start thinking no my
my leader is going to play second fiddle
they would not accept it for
Maharashtrians were people for sure sure
ik pours insipid followers Sharath bar
is a prime minister candidate for to
normal it is mom Topanga you who is the
prime prime minister pub in U P it is
more of Milan Singh is the prime
minister
so because of this little over-ambitious
scenario this male terminal will never
work I have seen this from 1971 or
onwards when there was maja Grady maja
already was Maria Heidi was was the
title and then did not work at all and
similar things keep happening do buddy
our guard each OTR ID third force this
thing don't work but that may be a pre
pre election but what about post results
scenario will their desperation or will
their hatred for the BJP and their
leaders make them come together if push
comes to shove what do you think happens
then
no I Joanna said even the post-election
series a scenario if it comes to BJP
versus something I don't think they will
share their personal ego and go against
the BJP and will take will play second
fiddle or third Fidel no they will not
do they will keep asking for the prime
seat and that will be a problematic
situation and there so I don't think
that that is likely to happen in any
case I don't think this this Mohammad
Hamid none will survive in the last
phase of election I don't see that ok
mr. King Chuck nog I believe is with us
now mister now good evening to you we
right now the point of conversation is
more the versus the rest can the
opposition a united opposition
arithmetic really work to stop Prime
Minister Modi from returning to part
where do you start
mr. Dean shook now good evening can you
hear me yes ok so the question was to
you what's your view do we have an
opposition that's ready to keep their
own egos aside and come together to stop
the BJP actually do it well we can
actually do it or not I don't know but
all the time has come for them too
the reduce there he goes whether they'll
be successful or not I don't know also I
would like to say that at this point of
time after Bala core things are a little
bit for mr. Modi and things are not as
them for him as it was before Pilate
Road
now the opposition will find the
narrative a little more difficult though
I agree with the proposition that in
different states there will be different
narrative and Emily in certain states at
all it is possible that in bound state
she'll have a popularity over at this
point of time it is a quantum mr. mothy
I think but the elections are still away
and it's I don't know whether this will
continue or not the elections are also
in so many phases we don't know what's
gonna happen but right now right now
today if you ask me after phenomenon it
seems to be advantage movie and
therefore if the opposition has to do
science they have to come together very
very goals and whether they'll be able
to do it I don't know what what do they
need to do to get their act together to
maybe try and change the discourse or
bring it back to what it was a mr.
Bachchan let's go back to that aspect as
well how does the opposition need to
unite and say they'll own let's can
bring back the conversation to farmers
to jobs or what should be their strategy
from here on
well you see I if you look back at how
the BJP came to where it is it formed
tactical alliances as state wise I mean
they they shook hands with the Shiv Sena
and Maharashtra long ago they've they
did it with the Nitish Kumar in Bihar
they've done it earlier with also with
the Patent Act so the point is state
wise unification efforts probably more
contained and therefore more feasible
therefore I would say that I mean if the
opposition gets together and says until
all of us unite all over India and fight
to join battle against the BJP that's
not going to work I am completely agree
with mr. out that is an impossible task
and I'm talking about pre-election I'm
not talking about what happens after the
elections what I'm talking about is the
the division of words so if this is if
the SP and the bsp get together and
stick to it and let's say you pee as
they are for instance other the the
Congress and the NCP have already signed
an alliance in Maharashtra and if they
see to it it's likely to be a more
formal ions than the present BJP shifts
in our lands the Shiv Sena is not
terribly happy with the BJP Epis we've
been seeing before you know in recent
times so I think that alliances that are
required are that sort of a Lancer as
far as the opposition is concerned in
Karnataka it's fixed in Tamil Nadu the
things are fixed I mean in the sense DNK
with Congress and a DNK with BJP there's
no sort of effort to spread that all
over India you see so if you can do it
that way state-by-state then the
opposition stands a better chance then
trying to get together and have that
Mexican wave and so on and so forth
nineteen twenty characters diverse
fellows it would confuse the voter to
begin with I think state wise is what is
the way that they need to go if they
want to make a show of it okay
now let's quickly move on to the other
thing everyone one one point I would
mention here the BJP is playing a
smarter card than the Congress and its
allies and because BJP is going region
wise state wise they are having
different allies state wise for example
in Maharashtra they are going with
shavasana in Punjab they are going Akali
Dal and so and so for their the Nitish
Kumar so the as the as per the demand of
that region they are going for the
alliance so each of them alai remains
smaller with limited ambition and they
for that that state that becomes helpful
so I think instead of going of national
around that what Mahadevan done has done
they are going the region wise peace
basis and they can they can change their
narrative for each state and that is the
advantage that BJP will get whether it's
correct in democracy or not that is a
different story but in election that
works okay the other aspect that we
spoke of was the impact of the entire
AFOL controversy in Vinay up while
largely does seem like home
was managed to home that narrative for a
bit because every day there would be a
new angle on a new document in new story
and you controversy and then you would
see the government on the back for
trying to defend it but has it worked
enough to play on the water's mind to
say okay maybe there was corruption I
don't know can it work like that well
look the underlying objective of the
Congress and perhaps specifically Rahul
Gandhi I guess was to ensure that the
so-called teflon-coated image that mr.
Modi enjoys that gets dented because he
was of acutely aware that in the
four-and-a-half years there was very
little of direct allegation that could
have been leveled against the PMO or
himself in terms of a direct corruption
taint and that was a big problem for the
Congress because you really need this
removal of the Teflon coat to make him
look like any other politician and
Raphael gave them that opportunity I'm a
little skeptical Lord how much an issue
like the file actually plays out in the
areas where it really matters this is
actually an urban area issue Raphael is
such a subject where you either believe
somebody you don't believe somebody and
I'll tell you a small little thing that
me it's a it's there is it's it's
actually a couplet from-from Ramayana
which is very apt here and and that
particular couplet said some raccoon he
they should go sign those cosign what it
essentially means is that if you have if
you think of somebody is good or his
leader you don't care even if there is
an allegation retained against that
person yeah that's pretty much the earth
now in the core moody constancy in the
urban India I don't think anyone is
ready to believe that now the question
is yes there are some fine setters who
may believe something went wrong they've
handled there a final issue fairly badly
in terms of communication that has led
to even more suspicions about something
being wrong now I am NOT very but I'm
still not very sure of how much it will
translate into a situation strong enough
to electorally benefit the Congress I
mean there hecka the it's part of a
narrative but can it swing seeds for
them I really have my doubts over that
so what can swing seeds if we have a
month from her on say the initial
euphoria of the air strikes now begins
to you know recede a little what can
work but so there are three I mean look
Indian and I think every panelist is
perhaps saying so Indian elections are
incredibly complicated you have people
who work both parties there are you have
people who vote candidates there are
people who vote caste and religion and
every area differs from each other it's
incredible
I'll just add two more things to that
complication in that overall in an
overarching theme there are two larger
subtext that also come out in every
election either the electorate slits for
a compelling alternate or it looks to
punish an incumbent these are sometimes
the two big reasons why somebody gets
voted in or voted out in 2015 for
instance Kejriwal was looking like a
compelling alternate so people voted for
him in Delhi in huge numbers yes in 2009
BJP wasn't looking like a compelling
alternate even though people were
slightly unhappy with the Congress
government there was a recession that
had hit in it was as if they weren't
unhappy but vgb didn't look compelling
enough so they didn't go for him in 2014
BJP was both in compelling alternate as
well as people angry with the current
ups so you had this good landslide
victory for the it sends a single party
majority for BJP so the question now is
is the opposition today a compelling
alternate and in that narrative some bit
of momentum of jobs and farm was getting
built up yeah which is get gotten a
little arrested and slow and halted
because of this bore arching nationalism
patriotism Bala could strike because
here comes a man who you can't dislike
for having taken a decisive action so
even those who were fence sitters in
that may perhaps will find it difficult
to go means that kind of a sentiment
okay I also wanted to then talk
specifically about the southern states
because like our panelists are sings the
nationalism card or the that doesn't
play out that strongly in the southern
states firstly National Safety the
National Safety yes and and why it was
part of a long term vision for Amit Shah
from the northern states to then east
end down south I don't know it doesn't
seem like they have BJP has successfully
managed to make those kind of inroads
what's your view
do they have a strong play in south yes
yep it does not as strong today as it
has in the center in India or in the
northern India but ameesha very
carefully and wisely
has gone into alliance with the ADM k
and PM k in interminable that is a very
very shrewd and smart card because on
its own BJP does not stand any chance
not on one side last time I think in
four
got only one sickness yeah so it would
not have included situation so if
they're gone with a DMK then perhaps
this thang better chances more than
better chances for themselves they will
receive the wave of DMK which had
started up coming in they stopped it so
that is a very short card in Kerala also
from ameesha is making inroads for
example will the supreme Allah issue
help them yeah some of them are issued
definitely because he take it has
touched people's mind
it was hard so - touching the cord is
important supreme Allah has really
helped him I don't know whether that
would last you for than another month
and then Kerala goes to put but in Goa
before they will again go with both six
one is sympathy wave because of Arica
and other thing is that Congress is not
doing it is not a united force in the
tiny state but it is not a united state
force in Goa therefore they're also both
the suits I am sure that that will go
for BJP let me see if I can just quickly
bring in mr. kingship Naga if he is able
to hear us mr. Mac do you agree with
what Bharat Kumar out is saying you when
it comes to the southern states can they
those be the key states then to maybe
stop the BJP well VAP has no presence in
under the altar in Ghana
autumn is not only say there present is
in Kannada so here in Andhra Pradesh and
Telangana they are depending on their
regional partner so for regional
partners in Telangana they are depending
on TRS and in their ally earlier was TDP
bow now treaty-based broken so now they
don't have any way so basically the
South will play a very important role
Plus this is card of nationalism that
are against Pakistan does not work so
much so in South India as it was in
North Indian states etcetera so this is
these are the swing states as far as VF
is concerned they have to wear or their
partners have to do well here if they
can come
but to me it seems as I said earlier I
think that it is still advantage be give
me because of magma and all these things
but the behavior would have to find
where your heart they also take where's
belong well their position is certainly
much better than what it was in the last
election but other reasons where they
are facing 1000 is strong leader but
month on depends on not a priority Wars
and I'm sure is going there and
appealing to the indoors whether he'll
be able to take few more seats or not we
don't know most probably they will get
bored of courses but not the entire
state so it's going to be interesting
its collections it is still very early
days and we can't cut it but today I
think it is that one day which is a very
long yes or that absolutely and like
when I was pointing out earlier as well
that they're also so complicated because
each each part has its own
characteristics and you have your own
regional leaders and parties and and so
it's difficult to judge like that but if
you look at some of these surveys that
were done just two months ago where it
looked like perhaps the battle was
slightly more wide open than it is now
will will the air strike and the
nationalism card be the only factor that
may have now swung it in BJP or it can
you also factor in the farmers income
that they have announced the you know
jobs quota that they have announced for
the general category well look I mean in
terms of the service I only believe that
uh you know the committed water doesn't
change its opinion so easily on on only
on issue so incident here on an event
there doesn't really make much of a
difference and and BJP certainly has a
fair amount of committed water that they
enjoy just like other party sizes as
well like BSP has a computable to bang
SP has committed voter Bank in that
sense the one party with the biggest
trouble currently is the Congress
because they've lost the maximum
committed word Bank over the last 15-20
years of their decline I mean they've
just lost every committed word bank that
they used to enjoy earlier including
even castaways committed word banks so
there is that worry that they have in
states there is definitely a situation
varies in one thing should mentioned in
Brisbane well it's different in Android
is different in Tamil Nadu it's
different
it will of course play out differently
my only thing is I really don't think a
survey which is done say 2 mins ahead of
the ball 3 even though it is a enough
indicator of how things will pan out
correct once the actual process begins
because now you will have the candidates
name being announced yes now you'll have
factors like rebels in certain seats you
will have parties campaign you left the
fund being deployed by different parties
as a factor and remember there is one
other factor which we haven't spoken
about but in my book it does wait we'll
play a bind is in elections usually
happen at a time which is just after the
harvest season ends and the harvest
season in the in the farmlands it
reminds the farmers of a lot of other
issues whether it is procurement issue
whether it is the money they get for it
whether they're able to sell their
produce or not how much supplement I am
as they've suffered this is a critical
period in rural India mid March and
April is when the harvest is actually
happening so bowling happens in the
middle it just ahead of that and that
does play a role as well now if the farm
distress is indeed as deep as most
people seem to suggest it's not as if
nationalism will trump every other thing
and will become a completely winning
form but I don't think that's going to
happen yeah but but having said that as
I said it depends very from state to
state and it'll also vary from how well
the BJP is able to systematically do
what I believe is like a time capsule
right when you have a time-release
capsule where you eat very slowly slowly
dissolves now this Bal Court and pull
mama how well they will slowly slowly
use over the next couple of months so
we'll probably determine the extent of
the mood yes good yeah I come from
Maharashtra and as well as Martha's
concern I can say that unlike many
elections before this time the caste
card will play a very very vital and
DCCC role in these elections because
yeah there is a apprised of Marathas
yes for the reservation issue Murata
more chasm that went on for thirteen
months that has really created an
atmosphere of caste jump in Maharashtra
apart from that Dobby sees the price of
OBC is also had to be be concerned about
yes and those chakras they're also open
arms it means that there the division
between cost and cost that has become
now we pull payable and visible so if
that is
that becomes a merit of voting then
perhaps the whole thing will go however
fortunately unfortunately or
incidentally the Congress or NCP per
degree that was so far the only only
organization for maracas has no longer
remain like that or the shavasana that
was so far commanding self-control over
over the Oasis that is also not remain
like that so it will be working where
this wood will go
perhaps candidate wise each constituency
the woes of candidate which are kept at
the video class it belongs to that party
will stand from one aspect you see
largely if there are Murata's or party
doors and charts all of them coming out
on streets and demanding quota and
demanding reservation is also because
they are not doing that well right now
it is also because they're not getting
the job opportunities they're not able
to economically progress as the rest of
the country it's it's I feel it's just a
sign again that people are right now not
seeing enough employment opportunities
or not seeing enough growth
opportunities but will they analyze it
like that or will they see the way you
said that it boils down to then my caste
that united we are likely to fall and I
divided they would stand correct well so
we'll wait and watch sure this is just
the beginning the first conversations of
many follow what has happened today is
just said the officially the election
season has begun moral code of conduct
is in enforce what will happen from here
on is lots of news and developments and
rallies and charges and counter-charges
and we will keep a very close track of
all of those developments for you for
India Awards the special election
coverage and Mira now also begins
starting today now and on 23rd of May it
will all culminate on the counting day
so we wait and see how things turn from
her on our experts will continue to join

joining us
it is International Women's Day and I
must confess I like to do what we call
roadblock programming where we stop the
news for a second and dedicate an hour
of prime time to something we believe is
important or to just celebrate good work
I've got three wonderful people on the
panel with me and I'm actually using
this as an opportunity to have
conversations that I believe are really
important I mean look at this panel
these are women who have sort of grabbed
the driver's seat and changed the way we
tell stories who we tell stories about
and how the stories will be told so
actor film director latest of course of
gully boy Fame the film that's
completely I mean my god
like that life is amazing good evening
uh producer who has just come back from
LA after clutching an Oscar
congratulations beneath is a producer of
a film about ministration about periods
than won an Oscar that's amazing
and of course Ekta Kapoor the Joint
Managing Director of Balaji Telefilms
managing director of Alta Digital and
ignis a working mom who runs a
television studio a film studio who
produces digital content and has so many
shows on the floor at the same time that
I wonder how she's actually creative
director and she manages and micro
manages all of them and I want to first
begin by saying I'm so grateful to all
of you for making time and coming here I
think it's amazing they're also Facebook
live at this point and our audience is
going to be asking questions and I hope
you'll oblige an answer but I want to
focus on how you've changed the way
stories are being told so now in
Galipeau Anthony was so amazing thank
you thank you so much
no thank you thanks for giving us that
film a you've got everybody now wrapping
and sort of rubbing under there are
never tables but you brought in you
bring in a very different way of looking
at women the the character played by
alia Bhatt Safina is is an amazing
character she's got her own story going
at this going on at the side and what I
love about it is it's not about I love
this boy let me marry him
which is what it would have been ten
years ago it's about I want to go out I
want to meet boys I want to go parties
and you're not letting me and I want to
become a doctor and I want to do a liver
transplant that's only a woman could
have written a character like that do
you mean yeah was is that a focus do you
see that change when you're working on
sir I think so I think you know I also
honestly believe that there have been
really good female parts through the
years they've just been few and far
between and now it's just getting more
consistent because there are more women
in the industry so you're seeing it
coming out more frequently and it's
feeling like a bit of a movement which
is amazing and I don't think it's gonna
stop is it a hope because I think so I
think because the the influx of women in
in the driver's seat whether it's
producers whether it's writers whether
it's directors whether it's even actors
who are now getting suddenly actresses
are making films they are actually
creating vehicles for themselves so that
is changed and it's going to definitely
change so the minute you put women there
they are going to tell stories and
they're going to tell their own
narrative and there you will see the
female gaze and that's a much more
rounded gaze I think yes it in fact
ekta has is not working on or bringing
out a Davis from a woman's point of view
which is the female gaze really and this
is a story we've heard as Indians for so
many years but to relocate it and retell
it from a woman's point of view waketa
is that is that specific is that
something that you wanted to do or did a
writer bring it to you why why would you
say this is happening so you know when
we see they've got he's got his flaws
but you always you know glorified those
flaws I was like it's high time we
glorify some of our flaws you know we we
so scared we either put on a pedestal
thrown off it so this was a woman who
was from Jaipur she owned her sexuality
she went out she had a lesbian best
friend and she fell in love with two men
and both one was actually as always and
was her friend's father so it was
slightly dark Dogma yet very delicious
journey and it was something that she
owned up to and I think I had to do some
of the stuff I was doing I was wanting
to do some some characters who are no
longer on a pedestal you know
there is fun well as you know as someone
who's always told different kinds of
stories and I am going to put you on the
spot and I'm going to ask you the
question about films like Chocula hum
that I'll be honest my very young team
actually brought this up saying you must
ask this because it's always been
considered bad for women it's it's
disrespectful
what's your response there because I
know you consider your or you call
yourself a feminist you represent you
you identify as a feminist how do you
how do i actually i mean i mean it's as
disrespectful as an american pie' but
does that make you know can you hear me
it's as disrespectful as and i'm an
american pie' I mean I don't think it's
okay or bad it's just the kind of
language it is it is a funny comedy
I don't think objectifying is a very big
word it's funny at times at times it's
sexy but it note at no point have has a
suggested misogyny and you know honestly
I mean they're gonna be calculon's done
by us and we're also do our lipstick
under my boot cuz and I think I don't
want to be put on a pedestal anymore I
don't want to ever be on a pedestal
I am frosting I make content some of it
is really good some of it is really
trash and you live with it but that's
interesting Jews allow within the
ability to sort of make those mistakes
to try things that don't work out and
not make it a really big deal because
when you do mistakes some of it is
business some of it is just content that
is out there well I mean it I think it's
a personal choice I think when you're an
artist and you are out there putting
stories out it's a personal choice it's
a personal aesthetic and it's how you
look at what you are doing for me I take
like I'm not a producer I'm not as yet
haven't been putting more than one thing
out there
I have been putting my story what I'm
saying and it takes me
and when I do that to me it's very
important what consciousness I put out
into the world it's very important for
me because I am very aware of where I'm
living
what is happening and I want to be able
to affect that in some way but that's a
personal choice as an artist and I mean
live and let live
well goodies you brought and I believe
this is really important because on one
hand we awake the who's bringing in the
stories that enter people's lives on a
mass scale every day they've become part
of people's day-to-day schedules on the
other hand every two years you hit us
with something that makes us just stop
but what you did in in that 26 minute
film you made people are you allowed for
a situation where people would stand up
onstage in front of the whole world and
talk about periods you know a film about
periods won the Oscar that's what
everybody was saying at that time it's
first of all congratulations we're so
proud of you thank you thank you but
tell us how that happened where the
story came from how you decided that yes
this is something I want to do it
actually started in a very innocent way
with school girls of awkward in North
Hollywood
they and their English teacher Melissa
Burton read an article that lots of
girls there's so much shame attached to
periods in menstruation that what I
wrote is the thing they don't go to
school and they don't know why this is
happening to us and and there is just
shame day-to-day shame attached so they
thought that you know we should do
something about it they got in touch
with Action India an NGO based out of
Delhi that has worked on ground for more
than 40 years in reproductive rights in
information and education and from there
they decided that okay what is the
possible solution because how do how do
we even find a solution so they decided
to donate one pad machine and these
girls they're like 12 14 year old girls
ten of them did bake sales and yoga
thorns to raise three thousand dollars
to donate one pad machine while this was
happening the English teacher Melissa
button again thought that we should just
document the process
they had some more money and the
conversation was should we donate one
more part machine or should we put that
money into a film yes and document the
process key what happens we put one part
pad machine the process of putting it in
how does in if at all it can change and
empower lives and that's how I got
involved the minute they thought that
they have to make a movie one of the
parent is a woman called Stacy share
who's been my mentor she's produced all
of Tarantino movies and Erin Brokovich
it's not about movies she wrote to me in
saying my daughter and her friends want
to make this film in India can you help
and I'm I was blown away
I met all the girls I was like let's do
it guys what he wants i i i i was
attached as a producer and then I
mentored the process of putting the
whole movie together shooting it and
working closely with action India and
girls of hype or what is very exciting
is that we really saw a revolution
happen on ground and that emotion got
captured in 26 minutes by Reika so
beautifully yes and now given the
Academy's nod on the film given the
given what the film has been able to
achieve
I personally am seeing a revolution
happen outside the film so there is a
revolution happening around the world
around this film and yes we as the
entire team of pad project have put
menstruation on the map so how do you
follow up a story like that is so cool I
don't even know what to ask you at this
point what what I thought was really
cool about that film but it was not just
about being able to make and supply past
all of these women they were the women
who were earning from having made those
Bad's who didn't have any identity you
know outside of their families until
they started manufacturing by hand
sanitary pads and it give them some
money in their hands and that was just
such a beautiful part unexpected sort of
result from the film right yeah
absolutely in fact the way the way Suman
Sneha Shabana and all of them talked in
the film I mean someone's saying 'i'm
look picked receptacle against Gary or
Emma Club I'm just blown away by women
standing against
in their own right in their own language
in their own village against patriarchy
against misogyny and getting empowered
with what they are doing should remember
look you're polarized they were saying
I'm look we have a Huggies diaper in it
because people are coming and breaking
then and then once you know it's taken
us three years to put this whole and how
most of the men in that village have
either no idea what periods are or they
can't talk about it yeah
i i i I have to be honest I don't think
I could talk about it before this film
happened I don't think I was that
liberated you know a bad project bad
project period period it's no office
part of life when I can go in national
TV and talk about something which is so
normal and further take the conversation
forward but I feel it's liberated many
of us so that's actually a the impact of
content right the content I take that as
the content and quinita sand and what
you do you basically make people walk
out of the cinema or they they've just
watched the film they talk about things
that they wouldn't have otherwise talked
about again with big girly boy it was
very layered and quiet that it was a
Muslim character they were Muslim
characters it was not it was not in your
face it's not feminist film it was not
you know it was it was none of those
things but it did make us the class
divided the short Dury between the
driver and the woman who was sitting
behind him everybody I know came out and
talked about it because it just it just
brings you face to face with the world
we're living in is that the most
powerful part about content right now
but I think so we have I think so I
think if I mean that if you can make
someone feel if you can make someone
shift their opinion slightly about
something that's ingrained or is there I
mean that's the power of it that's the
power of any kind of art form and and
you have to be irresponsible with that I
think and you have to make sure that
you're doing something with it because
you have that power and you might as
well and there's no I mean you know
under the guise of entertainment you
can't be lazy I think you just have to
you you can you can entertain and at the
same time
yes sir you do your politics is there
yes you know what is it I have to I have
to ask you this jingle Sam yeah and ours
are the are very powerful lyrics yeah
and they're very bold to put out did you
expect backlash or did you think the
trolls about whom this song is one will
never get it you know they'll get it but
I mean strangely you know that there's
all this stuff that people just pick up
music and then they start cutting stuff
to it and you can't control it on the
net so there have been videos made of
every political party with those songs
so everyone's owning it so yes you don't
really know what to make of it which is
a good thing um but this is music that's
come from there this is music that's
comes from these musicians it has come
from the street and they are writing
this and they are making it and it is in
existence
you know so your dad worked on you know
on durian and he worked again with
divine and divine in and lazy are the
rap artists on whom the film is based
yeah so is it divine story on a sister
no it's nice it was the sidekick who's
the leader of the stories is basically
lazy was the first contact I had I saw
that song offered and I contacted him
and then it all happened so I started
going to his gigs I started meeting him
I interviewed him then I met Devine at
one of the gigs he was opening then I
started meeting Devine and started but I
met a lot of people but I just kept
going back to these two let me ask you a
question on behalf of all of the women
in this country right now is MC shades
like based on a real individual who is
he and where can we find it he's our
idea yes of what what someone you know
when you meet certain people in your
life like I'll get certain filmmakers
who don't it even if they don't really
like me they're really happy for me if
my film does well because they really
believe that the fact that this film is
in existence is bigger than you and me
yes he's that kind of artist you know
and it's a sisters ought to be yes all
right eggs
ethers working on a on a show called
test case
this case is really cool it's about
women in combat positions in the
military and India has been struggling
with that idea for a really long time
because we don't really know how we feel
about women in combat positions and it's
really cool that again you're bringing
this up and it will force people to
start conversations around it and to ask
us as why don't we do this why is it why
is it something that were uncomfortable
with so if I want to ask you and you've
had perhaps of all content producers in
the last more than the LA
homes people don't
what you think how has storytelling
changed when you when someone comes to
you with a character or someone comes to
you and I know that you personally
actually view a lot of shows and and
build a lot of characters have do you
believe characters and women have
changed or do you believe that you're
you're looking at these things more
differently right now the you know there
was a research carried out by the
Chicago research car agency in about
2000 to 2005 saying that for the first
time Indian women at homes were taking
part in decision-making because of
Indian television because once a Tulsi
or a part of the thing went ahead and
decided to take on and actually took on
cases like marital rape did breast test
I mean we had breast cancer tests in the
show I think women did change a lot so I
actually want to say that women have
changed on television a lot but with TV
going more and more into smaller towns
there is more and more escapism on
television but it's actually quite
interesting to see that TV actually has
picked up stories that no film has we
have television which has picked up
stories and I personally have done that
on women who can't have children
now Bombay won't watch it but out of
Bombay it's a huge stigma for women who
can't have children and it's a huge
problem because they're not considered
mothers so they don't come with consider
complete and India watched it because we
made the lead protagonist cannot
conceive so we made her not conceive and
she had a physical issue and that became
big I didn't do this show but someone
else's then it's a huge hit India for
the Indian television has dealt with a
show about the third sex this woman who
is I mean she's not sexually fully
defined and it's a love story between
her and a man and actually TV does far
better stories and films do but the
narration and the narrative is very very
mass so I personally work
modern characters we try to see that we
bring out stories we try to see that
each of our female characters have
themselves attached to some NGO of the
other we see to them that they're all TV
actresses in the last two years that
we've launched our working women or five
years actually so I think TV does a lot
more but yeah it scares away from
radical and I try to put a lot of
radical into television back and test
case I don't know we've not done it on
TV but if you drown digital and it's a
fun thing if the utopian thought yes
because they're gonna have women in
combat it forces and this was short yes
so if the digital does offer a you know
far more range because I I don't know if
the stakes are a little lower because
there's a new film called that has been
produced by Priyanka Chopra
it's a Marathi film it's it's called
firebrand
it's an amazing it's it's a short film
it's on it's on digital it's an amazing
film dealing with issues of sexuality
between a married couple that I don't
think anybody's ever gone there before
but how love and sex are two different
things
and you shouldn't necessarily expect the
same thing from from the same person
so does that's working in digital allow
you that bandwidth that you are able to
be perhaps a little more open with the
issues or bowled over the issues that
you want to tackle absolutely you like
for me it's like you did Gandhi for me
it's like like you know TV with push the
envelope they are in Delhi in digital
you can actually open and you can open
those fears and do things that you've
never done before
and unfortunately or fortunately that
can creat create any kind of content but
some of the stuff we could do and
digitally direct test case even both the
whole conspiracy theory behind Bose I
mean it's only digital that allows you
to do that and you pretty much can have
fun there well let me read out some of
the questions of points that have come
in Twitty cultured says kudos to Zoya
you used to show us the rich life and
now you showed us a very different kind
of story so there was a marked
difference there you chose and the film
was about the classes and how the
classes lived so close to each other but
there's a huge difference
fritzsche why did you decide to tell
that story I mean I I like subcultures
and whether it was the film industry
which in itself is a subculture whether
it is a particular Christian society in
Delhi which to me is a subculture which
is if it's you know rapper musicians
from the streets of Navi Delhi sorry
earlier and the hobby now that's a
subculture oh did lyrically though also
is a serious social critique whether
people got it or not
so I like that I like those kind of
narratives I like those kind of stories
and I'm gonna keep doing different stuff
I'm just gonna mix it up and you know
some people like this so whatever
whatever story is is in your heart at
that time that's the one that's the one
in worker I actually want to talk about
how you guys got here and it was not
easy for any of you for all three of you
agree you've you're the only person I
know who aged yourself and dyed your
hair gray and actually purposely started
to dress like you were older because no
one would take you seriously were too
young and you didn't come from a sort of
Bollywood family so people who are you
why would I even give you a meeting how
did you start off and the the industry
has its ups and downs so good days in a
very very bad times how did you get
through it
I think I started out with my knee I was
21 years old when I came to Bombay and
my I got some money from my neighbor and
it's a crazy story as to keep meeting
people in cafes and said beta paws
purchased lakh rupee was Connie I want
to make a film I mean I started as an
intern in international films doing
production work but in Bombay I wanted
to be a producer
I made two movies and then actually went
and worked for Rica for nine months on
once upon a time in Mumbai and then
picked up momentum again and again
decided to be a producer and started
producing yes I've always been very
young and I have learnt tricks of
looking older I used to wear saris I
used to wear different specs
it's just acquired send my opinions to
my male colleague on SMS because if I
in the room it would not be taken and
when you were sitting in a room full of
people and you're the only woman there
you would hold your opinion back
absolutely and text it to a man in you
said yes because you actually gave you
commercial points because young Lurky
can't explain know how contracts will be
done so I've seen that I've seen people
looking through me but yeah I think the
only way to do whatever we're doing is
to show up every morning and continue
doing it just truly continue doing it
and one day those lines are those dots
are joined and it all makes sense tell
me you called all these people and said
are my friend Oscar and it's interesting
I mean it's great to be a part of a
movie that it's great to produce a movie
that goes on to win the Oscar it's the
highest achievement in our business that
one can get but I think even without
that I think you have to just continue
telling your stories you know and that's
what I really want to do I hope now it
gets easier well I got a point that our
partner to ACTA that we've got a message
on facebook from a jeweler who says
watching a cockapoo serials changed
women made them bolder and more
confident so I suppose for urban women
we didn't understand this as much but
for women across the country to be able
to say stand up to you know someone who
was older in the household they you know
to to be able to address things like
pregnancies extramarital affairs things
like that can actually be able to talk
about it these things you know these
shows actually dealt with a different
world it yeah I did actually and I mean
I've always asked these questions and
why do women wear so much makeup I am
like let them be sometimes sorry
empowers you sometimes a swimsuit does
and these were women they were very very
honestly you know I mean when I was
casting for television I used to say
they have to look like many other women
that and for me living in Bombay living
in Juhu as a single girl making stories
about
mother-in-law's and dot nose I mean it
was tough because I was dealing with the
world that I didn't know much about but
you know you have to have empathy and
the moment you have empathy you realize
that people out of your society I mean
for me my audience begins from washing
South bomba doesn't even care and I
don't care about never of an audience
we're talking about a 1.3 billion
population I am NOT interested in South
Bombay telling me how the jewelry's to
tacky you know really that's what you
noticed so yeah but at the end of the
day I was dealing with stories and we
picked up marital rape actually that was
my biggest point when I mean it was the
most filmy scene people thought it was
the worst short scene ever it was the
highest-rated scene that's on the other
side but to see shorter own son because
India has no law for marital rape and he
said it's okay because she's my wife I
can sleep with her and wear a mother and
wrote law usually fight she said I'm
taking a stand for this woman who stays
in my house you can't touch her without
her consent and we got banned by the
classes saying that oh my god so Jackie
how can you just shoot your son but it
became a high point because a lot of
mother said we will now not stand with
us and we have always had a society
where two men two women fight for the
man as if he's a prize television at
least with most of our shows we change
that we said let's show some bonding let
them vote fight for the man and I think
that's what's worked well we have a lot
of messages coming in one of them is
from Mike Sharma who's it's so proud of
Guney panca for winning the Oscars I
think we are all so proud of it I ate
enough at this point Jatin Bhattacharya
Fei please ask the way of girly boy is
good yeah very proud of you very very
proud ing Lisa thank you there is a
chicken who says please ask soya if
galley boy is her best creation so far I
don't think my best creation so far
happened
what are you working on tell us tell us
I've got a couple of ideas but I have
haven't stopped working since galley boy
to feel what I want to do next I need
some time off
yeah so I've just been working
do you wake up in the ones you guys wake
up in the morning and look stare at the
ceiling I am so awesome I'm so good I
made gasps boy I'm so cool I want an
Oscar how do you take time to sort of
reaffirm that what you're doing you know
the success and this is you know
normally films either get box-office or
they get critical acclaim or people are
playing it on loop on this on their you
know playlist you've got all three
you've actually introduced larger India
to the idea of rap and the idea of that
art form so it's being accepted so
widely right now have you let that sink
in yeah I mean I'm trying to let it sink
in actually I like I said I've just
started working and I'm gonna plug this
but I am I sure just drop today on
Amazon so it's made in heaven so I've
been working on that it's dropped today
and now I'm going to let all this sink
in and see how it goes
and that's it yeah I mean it is it's it
was a huge relief because it wasn't just
to film and it wasn't just about my
career and the money have taken from my
producer and put in it there were a lot
of artists attached to this film there
were like 54 collaborators on the music
and they've opened their lives they've
opened their stories they've opened you
look this is this film was for them on a
huge level and it needed to work and it
needed to be good and I needed to be
authentic because they are same thing
I'm relieved you're really it is so
widely accepted I must ask you have I
mean you're your father's daughter you
came in people knew who you were you
were sister to your brother when his
first in his first couple of films boy
did you but you weren't the receiving
end of any sort of sexism when you
started off for being a woman or you
know not really I mean the little Pythia
you know like I've really thought about
this I've grown up in an environment
where I grew up I mean my dad is a
massive feminist we prefer anime were
brought up like equals
everyone in my extended family they're
only feminists like I wish I wasn't like
a thing when you were growing up it was
just the way of the world and when you
go into college you realize all sexism
oh you know this person is treated
differently from their brother so but
that I think I if people were sexist
towards me I think I missed it
I don't think it's conscious did you did
you receive any sort of sexism I know
that you don't hold back you give it
back to anybody who says something but
when you start it off and they were
success and there was some failure
did anybody turn around and say how
because she's a woman did you receive
any of that me yes oh yeah i mean i'd i
think sexism so that i received all
kinds of perceptions on me and I think
sexism was one of them I started a
company and I use my mum's name instead
of my dad's that itself was a huge issue
that it adds far more famous why you
calling a Shobha Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor
who are you - I mean you should use your
dad's name secondly why don't you lose
weight become an actress
what is the producer produces a man's
job while you trying to be a man I mean
I was like I was like but I want to be a
producer because that's a job and I want
to do it so yeah that kind of sexism a
lot and then of course constantly
because if it's a two women company
people have I had a mother and her
daughter start a company
it was always father and daughter was
father and son this itself was a bit of
a problem you know and here's the
interesting thing and your producers in
your writers and directors how often
ekta do people walk up to male producers
and entrepreneurs and directors and say
lose some VA taq pan eyes Kymco sambal
oh why don't you like take care of
yourself nobody ever says that to a man
but they won't think twice about saying
it to a woman and saying so repeatedly
yeah I mean you
dress up I remember there were the
celebrities were stressed list and I was
like topping that list and I was like
why is there no celebrity males in that
list what producers I'm supposed to work
then go home handle myself go for a
workout look great and compete with the
actresses and then land up at those
parties looking barring new clothes
every time I was like I'm not gonna do
this all with the same dress five times
live with it do you get it either I get
because when you're at events yeah III
get it I've been on panels with men and
like I've you know oh I've seen an
interview and below that in YouTube
it'll be like she's so bad-looking she
look and I'm like I'm a beauty compared
to how you out of your mind
so it's you you do get it you do you
just have to ignore it and it's amazing
how men will get away with wearing the
same suit over and over again and just
changing the time somebody notices yeah
but somehow for a woman they will always
have some sort of opinion on you on your
clothes yeah it's it's it is immediately
associated with how you look yeah should
be like Goonies and just like age
ourselves 20 years nobody do you see
don't ever tell anybody that you are 25
26 I mean I'm not in my 20s now but yeah
I could tell people I'm 25 but I'd be
lying no but I do want to ask you this
because now and and I and I believe that
we are privileged to be to be born in an
era where there are women like
yourselves in positions of control
you control the tone you control the
casting you control all of these things
one were coming out of a me-too movement
and a lot of people I've met have felt
that it didn't amount to anything that
the entire India's metal movement didn't
mean anything and people have just gone
back to where they were I want to know
first of all if that's true secondly can
women like yourselves at this point
support each other support the ones who
are coming up actually creates spaces in
which more artists like yourself will
find space so my first question to you
is do you believe that the indian meter
movement was all for nothing have we
made a change has there been a change of
course there's been a G what's the
change I think there's been a entire
shift in attitude
I think people are suddenly aware people
are talking about it people are
discussing if we talk about sexual
harassment was like on prime-time which
didn't exist that conversation and film
sets changed of course you have to have
guidelines and you have official
guidelines and you have sort of
committees in all production houses are
where people you know overly it was like
okay the big stuff you don't do but it's
that little everyday sexism it's that
you know that inappropriate touch it's
that kind of stuff people are suddenly
conscious of that and men aren't going
to think twice and women are going to
turn around and be able to be like dude
you know back up you know because there
is a precedent set and I mean it didn't
amount to much in the sense that maybe
no one went to court and nobody took you
know nobody filed the case but that's a
matter of time it will happen it's and
you know girls club came out of this
which didn't exist it was a solid boys
club yes so like you know there was a
girls I mean women were standing up for
each other and saying no he's lying this
happened to me as well so a girl's
character which I hope never gets
dismantled and the shame shifted from
the girl to the boy well which is great
example to ask you this question do you
believe that things have actually
changed and I want to understand in the
West right now they're signing things
called
up you know diversity riders where stars
are saying I will work on this film on
the set if the set hires enough minority
people if the set hires enough women to
work on the set if you are truly an
exclude inclusive set only then I will
work with you do you believe that we
have now more room for women to work
behind the camera to work in other
aspects other than just as you know in
front of the camera as actresses are we
making enough room make them so actually
television is a very different medium
and I'm talking about that because I
don't think many people are aware that
the pay shift on television women pay
get paid far better than men we have an
industry which is almost well run by
women when I entered they were very few
women are there almost 60% of the
producers are women and we have most of
the writers are women it's a medium for
women by women and it's clearly run by
women as far as
giving minorities a certain women are
not a minority and most of the places
where I work
most of the women who work in biology
are women I feel because of that there
is a certain amount of sensitivity that
has come in the meter movement has made
a huge impact I mean now I don't have
girls getting scared to go on certain
sets because they know that they can
take a stand
they were never scared on assets because
we have the vishakha move in the Posche
movement from many many years but there
was always a fear leaving a set if
somebody will fire you and you know this
isn't that I don't want to tell the boss
with me I've always taken a very strong
stand with anything that goes wrong with
our women because you know I mean
sometimes women can't take that stand
and you can't expect them to because
they have had to face a work culture
where they haven't we talked to take a
stand
yes so I think the me to culture is here
to stay it's in popular writing now by
the way it's really in popular writing
people are talking about it ok whose
name was come me too scandal ho gaya
whose kegels TT like a Kegel CTN it's
become something that people know and
it's huge it's very important for a
woman to feel safe good Eve you know we
should also him you talked about the
girls club that has now sort of come up
and it's come up in various industries
as well can the girls clubs support each
other can we be MC shapes to each other
and you know support be happy give
support of various kinds because you
each each woman right now even on this
panel is on Apple in a position of power
where we can lend support so if you were
to write the sort of manifesto for the
girls club what would you ask for what
would you want to do you know so I
actually strongly believe that if if you
win I win you know I think that is my
motto it was said to me by another
empowered woman who celebrated who
celebrated my work and said if you win I
win and I feel that you know for a long
time we've been put in a place where
because of lack of opportunity we've
been in competition so it's it's when
it's when women think that it's either
me or you know it's it's all of us we're
a team
and we together rise I think my my
little short film is a classic example
of a relay where the girls from LA young
girls started it and and it and it's
it's made enough noise in hopple from
girls have Harper yes and now across the
world we are listening to it it's a full
women empowerment thing so I think one
woman can empower another and that is
just so beautiful when we are a team
even yeah so can the Girls Club be like
MC shoes yeah I think so that would you
what would you want us to do what would
you want the club to do you know I think
what I mean what I want to do at least
is be able to enable more women to tell
stories we ought to tell stories about
whatever they want it needn't be women
stories absolutely whatever story just
want to do whatever compels whatever
compares of what it removes them
whatever inspires them to be able to do
that and to enable people within my
field
yes rise that's the other thing right so
when women work and if this I'll be very
honest happens to me as well and to the
channel I represent I get the madam
ladies keep our everybody this movie so
it's considered to be softer and it's
considered I mean while we take up
everything that everybody else takes up
somehow something fronted by a woman
will be you know it's sort of set to the
side as this will be pro you know this
will be a woman centric story that
perhaps is something else we need to
break yet that I think will break also
with the audience I don't think that
they're thinking that it's not like in
our industry like nobody ni industry
says female filmmaker only people
outside keeps a female in the industry
people don't use this terminology and
they are not anymore worried if you're a
woman helping a project that's gone yeah
yeah yeah because there's been enough
success stories make a very quickly
before I run out of time can we create a
club of powerful women who help other
women's rise and tell stories so we
I've almost created that and I think we
have that clear up I think a lot of
women I work with our directors and
producers along Krista Aria and I think
most of the times at least 30% of our
themes are with women
television is always women so I think if
the club is there I think more than
anything else is the younger women who
we need to empower women who are married
sometimes feel like they have to come go
back home I think like now I've put a
crashing Balaji I should have done that
many years ago before I became a mother
you know things like this so that women
at work can have the comfort to bring
their children at the same time can
continue with their jobs and you know I
think small things like that we'll also
have them tell their stories absolutely
we have completely run out of time
this one this show's over but in
conclusion first of all I want to thank
the three of you for making time thank
you
amazing to have this conversation with
you is a message that I'm putting out
for people who are watching this evening
who run businesses look around your
business and examine the fact that our
women still working with you after they
have children after they've gotten
married or have they dropped out if they
have get your HR to do a quick study and
find out what is wrong why are women
leaving your organization because if you
have more of a women rise to the top and
sit in boardrooms and make decisions
you'll have different points of view and
they will be able to mentor and they
will be able to help other women rise
and that would only result in a more
robust company the success rates are
very very high take a look at the panel
and look at the research very very happy
International Women's Day to all of the
women who are watching and thank you to
the male allies the men in our lives who
support us and who teach us that
anything is possible thanks for watching

on the debate tonight five days five
bubbles and they're unbelievable 7.5
crore rupees splurge in Davos meat
Maharashtra's Additional Chief Secretary
for industry suckish go by he is the
babu who spent over 1.5 crore rupees a
day during his stay in Davos for the
World Economic Forum meet from January
21st to 25th what is the main question
which door made yet not answered is that
why they appointed a us-based forum to
make all these arrangements for the
doors to the whopping bill has rocked
the Maharashtra government the
opposition has jumped in and leveled
rough charges several questions have
been raised over the bill
like why is a travel bill being raised
by a Motor Company in fact doubts are
also being raised over the authenticity
of the rental company that was used by
the industry secretary Paris a Sarkar
own research lab a MIDC kill you today
or canina thank you industrial policy
levels in manual inky
yeah deeper you proposed in the pants
are burning yeah
left red-faced the government says they
are yet to approve the bills mirror now
confronted Industries Minister of
Maharashtra Sahaj this I will have not
been paid bills have been submitted but
they have not been paid and only write
bills would be pared unnecessarily extra
expenditure would not be done Mira now
asks how did the Babu's rack up a nearly
eight crore bill in just five days
shouldn't the Chief Minister Gordon
enquiry
well it's highly suspicious the bills
themselves raise several questions about
the nature of the expenses and also the
addresses from which these bills
actually have been generated myrish my
colleague is live right now from Mumbai
he's brought us this story myrish first
of all has there been any sort of
inquiry that he's been in that has been
sort of ordered by the chief minister
and secondly you're holding those bills
in your hand when you look at those
bills are the bills suspicious I'm
fundamentally asking it was is this
corruption Irish or suddenly you give
the false answer of your question and no
inquiry has been initiated by cm nor by
Industries Minister when I asked him
about the inquiry he said we have not
paid the bills now these are but we have
got this wheel's so these bills will go
to the Accounts Department Accounts
Department will check them and then only
we'll take further unnecessary action
but we will not be paying any single or
any penny which is more than the
allotted or or we can say that or the
amount which was approved by the
government you can see this bills we
have we submitted the copy of this bill
we gave this copy of bills to Industries
Minister after that he thoroughly
examined it he a hard word or with his
officials and then only he committed
because he was not ready to come in on
camera but when he when we told him that
we have got the bills and these are the
bills and this is the amount after that
only he commented and as we speak about
the veracity of the bills whether they
are a really authentic or not
Maharashtra government has accepted that
they have got this bill so certainly
this bills are really authentic so now
it's up to Maharashtra State Government
because we really what we tried to reach
to Marechaussee aim also we did try to
ask him a question about whether there
will be any inquiry he will be
initiating because 7.62 300 rupees in
just five days is not a really small
amount and it's after all it's a money
of you people like you me and other who
are paying taxes regularly back you fit
in fact myrish this bill that we are
looking at which I know then is in your
hand as well Premium motor and
company and the address on this bill is
99 71 reading Avenue Garden Grove
California USA the team in the office
actually used Google and Street View in
America to find that Street if we pop it
up on the screen in a bit we'll actually
see that it's a home that's you know
it's not even an office building so in
your it mean from what we have found out
it's possible that these addresses in
these bills altogether are suspect and
there's there you can see it on the
screen either us allows Google to
actually give you a view of the street
from the address that you're looking at
that's the street and the home that
we're talking about is actually just
someone's home with two cars parked in
front of it it is not a premium Motor
Company others could these bills
actually be any evidence of corruption
myrish certainly because even though we
check that you've just said that you
have we checked it certainly it's kind
of a leer that that is it's kind of a
little which is leading towards the
suspicions about this bill now it's a
onus is on government to come clean and
if at all some corruption has happened
then certainly government should take
the necessary action against those
Babu's who have spent 7.6 difficult
appease as I as we mentioned earlier
also this bills from a us-based company
they are gone tus we are they are going
to Swizzle and others in Davos so why
they appointed this us-based company
then what is the connection appointing
this us-based company that is also a
area which or which needs to be answer
that is also question which government
has not answered why they appointed this
or premier motor and cars company yes in
fact this premium motor and car company
has drawn up a bill of three lakh twenty
seven thousand four hundred and fifty
four dollars for four cars and four
homes that had been offered rooms that
were rented out in Davos again the
question that should come up is why was
there a motor company actually you know
sing out rooms during the the Davos
event why weren't they using hotels
instead and what company is this what is
the nature of the company and of course
why was the bill dated the 21st of
January when the stay went on till the
25th so these bills in fact myrish were
drawn up on the first day not at the end
of the trip will that also come into
question start early because you see you
can see that their date has been
mentioned on it it's clearly indicates a
21st of January 2019 when the Dow's
economic forum
stumpage started and if you could see I
lost my cameras want to show you this is
the split up which they have given from
day one to day fifth at is 21st of Jan 2
2016 so how can a company already
provide you a bill on the day force to a
Maharashtra government when the summit
has not already happened you can see
that see from 21st they have given a
bill of a car in a car rental and on
26th also so certainly it is also
raising a lot of doubts which government
needs to answer but right now we have
got only one answer from government that
the bills are under scrutiny and
appropriate answer we will give you was
the scrutiny is done so we are waiting
for another confirmation or we can save
another answer from the government about
this bills and we will be pursuing this
matter further
absolutely myrish many thanks for
bringing us this very very important
story and the reason why we bring up
stories like this is because like myrish
quite rightly said the money that is
being used to pay these bills or the
money that will be used to pay this bill
is your money and my money money we've
paid in taxes to the states government
of maharashtra money that should be
better utilized to rehabilitate the
people in mahal to rehabilitate our
farmers to actually solve the problems
of education healthcare and severe
malnourishment that exists in the state
of maharashtra but it does seem like
there are questions to be asked at this
point about how this government is
running its business joining me on the
show Shailesh gandhi former Chief
Information Commission of issue aspartic
for the BJP clique has - for the NCP we
shall moon Tovar for the Congress and
Nahum will be lower lawyer who'll join
us through the course of this
conversation and vascular prabhu an RTI
activist client writes and goes
immediately go ahead
no if a you spoke about you know this is
the whole you know expose it that a
party or chief spokesperson or Malik did
yesterday I was there at the press
conference there's one more bill that I
think you don't have your which we sent
to you know your team you should spoke
about premier motor and cars there's
another bill by auto boys now auto boy
sounds like a you know some kind of band
to me but you know it's auto boys now
auto boys also has given a bill of about
three lakhs 78240 six US dollars now
what I'm trying to highlight here is
which you spoke earlier and I was
talking to one of fifteen people is to
Google the addresses now what you spoke
about was nine nine seven one a reading
Avenue at Garden Grove California it
shows like a house auto boys addresses
two eight five an oasis Avenue garden
grow okay in the same vicinity and when
I did a research on the Google about
this both these places are some kind of
residential in a house and both are on
sale so you know they do not I mean they
do exist but it's a home there's no
office here and one more thing I'd like
to highlight like you mentioned premier
motorcars raise the bill on 21st the
first day of of this whole you know trip
that they were doing an auto boys raise
the bill on the second day so before the
whole trip was over these two companies
knew what they were going to spend the
money on and what is going to cost so
and also if you go through the bills in
detail they're randomly like interior we
don't know what interior means but
interior costs you like twenty seven
thousand euros okay advertisement charge
which is like another fifty thousand
euros I mean these are big big sums of
money you know these are like large sums
of money another question that comes to
mind is when people from the you know
from the government are going for a
World Economic Forum yes why would they
want to live in a three back bedroom
shall a five-bedroom Chalet I mean we
all know what a chalet is yes so why
would the need of our audience it's a
cottage it is a sort is like a beautiful
wooden cottage you know it's three
bedrooms five bedrooms
I don't understand why would these
people working for the government of
Maharashtra would want to live in a
chalet so these are all you know
questions that are raised and they need
to be answerable and you know like we
said yesterday this whole thing smells
of some kind of corruption somewhere
because from what we gather these are
the same people who had raised their
voice against the industrial policy that
the government was coming out with which
was giving the Builder some kind of
incentives that was not really the right
thing to do so what they're trying to
make these people happy so that they do
not object for the Industrial Policy a
lot of question needs to be asked and
what we demand is an anti-corruption
Bureau investigation what we demand is
the lokai to look into it we've been to
the local before we've asked them to
look into certain corruption issues that
we raised earlier they have not looked
at it but we'll continue to go I mean
for a you know I actually I like it
suggest one last things I would like to
suggest this I think you know mister the
top part salga is now appointed as the
open localizer I think you know this is
his first thing they should you should
get into and look into it and come out
and tell the people that we brought this
out whether it's the fact or not you
should come out in the open okay
Shailesh gandhi former CEO joins this is
mr. Gandhi thank you for joining us if
you've taken a look at you've heard
everything that my Eurasia is reported
and you've we've taken a look at these
bills as well is this evidence of
corruption or at least suspicion of
corruption mr. Gandhi should there be an
investigation
I think it's an open-and-shut case there
need to be no thinking about whether it
is corruption this is corruption
the only possibility I see is maybe they
are buying both the properties in United
States and this was the amount and a
quid pro quo that's a possibility that
the officers were buying these houses
for themselves and bills were being
raised in view of selling the house they
said no you give us any bill this is
shameless this shows that they are not
bothered about getting caught and I
would disagree with Clyde and say we
don't need an investigation let the
government put mr. gabite before public
in a press conference and explain most
of our investigations lead to nothing so
investigation is another method of
saying don't do anything
I don't they given press conference in
explain let me say goodbye I explained
he is a senior Additional Secretary of
the government let the ministers sit and
explain to people and in between we had
got government departments to list
whatever expense of was being spent on
foreign trips that stopped because they
are all uncomfortable with him they all
want to make money and the minister is
saying we haven't passed the bills he
should be shocked and this corruption is
actually taking a morsel away from the
poorest girl in venerable country
ashamed of this seven point six three
cross five days what were they doing
this is clear corruption there is no
other way of looking at it I as I said
the only possibilities they've either
bought two houses in us for which they
are making a payment by raising builds
on the government and I am sure mr.
Patrick will have some explanation and
I'm looking forward to his explanation
and ideally mr. Patrick should say for
all foreign trips all bills will put up
on the website and in this case tomorrow
there will be a press conference which
mr. Kawai will answer the media and say
and try and explain and if he cannot
explain then I think he needs to be
suspended dismissed complete action
needs to be taken look I will do nothing
please let's understand most of our
institutions are non-functional okay
we'll do nothing in this tell me in the
last 10 15 20 years
if you can hear of one major corruption
case another by the Lok I hope it
doesn't happen but we have faced the
public I explained but mr. Vishwa
Patrick joins us right now from the BJP
will function it doesn't function they
unfortunately mr. Patrick I want you to
just answer challenge on these questions
directly Clyde ask questions as well
seven point six three crore rupees spent
on five people in five days who do you
think will believe this why does the
Mirage the government take us to be so
stupid that we will actually allow our
money to be squandered off in this
manner
it's certainly not for me also it is a
very high amount unbelievable I fully
agree however water Honorable Minister
concern audible mr. has said these are
the bill raised by the agencies they are
subject to scrutiny they have not yet
been passed look at this for any
government such spending there is or it
like CAG and various kind of authorities
so it's not that easy that anybody can
carry out the corruption after scrutiny
if something the wrong is found
certainly action will be taken but for
your information for any government
bureaucrat there are set down norms air
to air travel system then hotel booking
then the reimbursement of food and will
beyond that nothing can be pass
therefore this is subject to scrutiny
and if we feel that it is something
unjustifiable certainly number one but
last year all take action which I'm sure
you don't take action last year the
Chief Minister of Maharashtra traveled
to Davos with a contingency could you
tell us how much money he spent on five
days no again I'm saying if it is
exorbitant lehigh there is no question
of passing those bills and there will be
in Gori the reason why he'd could you
tell us how much the Chief Minister
spent last year when he traveled to
Davos for five days accompanied by his
family I I don't have figures also the
figure is one crore ninety three lakhs
thirty one thousand one hundred and
eighty five point ninety eight rupees
this is the amount that was spent on his
trip to divorce so nearly two crore
rupees over five days is that according
to the master government a more
reasonable number mr. Pathak I'm just
trying to understand what you tell you
what you would term is real I'll tell
you yes please tell I'll tell you about
the travel about the state about the
food there are the directives and you
cannot pay in excess of that
however Davos is the small plane
in Switzerland when it is a crowded
especially in terms when there is a
global economic forum and all that thing
cost are generally high and it is not
only for staying so at times you have to
hold meetings one to one with the
dignitaries therefore spending can be
more but if it is unreasonable there is
no picture of defending at that okay so
you're saying two crore rupees is not
unreasonable but 7.6 three crore what
say allow me the the other panels as
panel to look into all those things all
right that's the problem your you will
listening do you not you know first of
all the this is what is the problem with
the government is that they don't tell
anything
as part of the directives from the
department of personnel training
everything has to be published on the
website what they have spent how much I
travel is there these directives are
totally not done at her to buy the any
state government or including the
Maharashtra and also the the central
government so they don't publish it on
the web site it is mandatorily to be
done whereas if you are if we are asking
still about the Prime Minister's
internal airfare - still we are not
getting it but if you even these small
corporations which are there we have
when when we were in Technical Advisory
Committee we said all our travels must
be published on their website but they
are not doing it just because they don't
want to have any transparency the moment
the ayat results are published you come
to know about various things where
they've travelled everything so this is
totally one type of when you when
something is taken out by lot of efforts
even now now the girl now everything is
bunking high at present I think the the
thing is that key whether the monkey
needs on the corruption side or on the
non corruptions and we had to locate it
the question there also comes to mind
and I think it's a very important
question is why why are these companies
from America handling you know the whole
solar your whole dealing for something
you know from vanastra good good the
Maratha government not find any company
in Mumbai or in Maharashtra or in India
to handle that all this just makes it
even more shady because why would you go
to California in California No
also the question is you know because it
wasn't ours but don't you have you all
travel around the world and we booked
our tickets from here we've got
companies who plan our trips from here
you could not find one company in Mumbai
or in India to actually do with the
whole trip for you so this issue
aspartic you kept saying that there will
be an investigation there will be an
investigation but obviously from the
government's point of view is very clear
that when you make bookings like this
you have to use officially screened
vendors there are vendors that do the
government's work and there is a process
in place there is a standard operating
procedure in place vishwas Patek this
shows a departure from standard
operating procedure so I'll ask you a
very straight question is this
corruption and are these bureaucrats
these Babu's receiving a payoff for
something what are they being paid for
what is the bribe for mr. Patil tell us
the number one in the exorbitant early
high pays cannot be depended however
corruption is a corruption when it is
plural
now this is subject to scrutiny will
scrutinize that who is and who is
examining it there's no enquiry there's
no investigation there's no a fire so
who is actually looking into this please
tell me which department have been see
Bills have been visible issued recently
it is about 25th of Jan it has been
issued recently in February and it is
subject to scrutiny and scrutiny is also
done by internal audit Department
internal Accounts Department there is a
CAG also so it's not that easy anybody
can just get away with exorbitantly high
amount so how the bills can be raised
without a consent of any government
that's what we we want to know how this
had not been triggered by our position
and then media this would have been
teared quietly without any problems now
here's the first question mr. Bhaskar go
Shah did the premier motor and motor and
company that has given this bill an auto
boys that has given the second bill are
these regice
vendors of the Maharashtra government is
this is this standard operating
procedure that has been followed that
that I need to check I know I don't have
any information on that however it is
only they don't exist if they don't
exist well I just want to bring in
challege gandhi mr. Gandhi obviously
there is a standard operating procedure
we have we have standard operating
procedures in this company we have
whistleblowers in this company but we do
not buy a piece of paper without that
vendor being screened and registered
please tell me mr. Suresh Gandhi that
the Maharashtra government has a similar
if not a more robust system in place it
has a system and I the way mr. Patel is
talking he's clearly obfuscating the
issue I am saying a very simple thing in
let's stop all this nonsense tomorrow
let the minister say mr. Goff I will
give an explanation publicly let him
hold a press conference tomorrow and
explain these are very serious charges
and it's obvious when they expect time
to hear everything at the end of the day
a media cannot keep pursuing these cases
they will the way mr. Pathak is saying
there are standard procedures we all
aware there are standard norms we are
all aware of that but these are being
flouted unless it comes it gets
highlighted you know when it gets
highlighted they allow time to pass and
then pay off all these things let them
explain tomorrow is my question and will
mr. Patel made the commitment that
tomorrow or day after
mr. Hawaii we give an explanation
publicly to press that's the best thing
let them be transparent yes but you know
I also want to bring in vishal motive
art but before i bring in we shall i
just want to point out Shelley's Gandhi
said the media can't keep following
cases like this but mr. Gandhi I have
nothing better to do with my time I will
quite happily follow those dogged
fashion but we shall from the Congress
party you go ahead
we shall what is the process in place
that all that should be followed when
there is a member of government
bureaucrats or politician making a
official trip like this
I think your channel raises a few
pertinent questions you know I think the
spokesperson from the party gentle party
is trying to run away from the core
issue there is definitely corruption
which is which is happened here which is
very very evident I mean you have seen
that you know when the Chief Minister
travelled last year you know with a big
delegation they were I mean the money
spent was close to two broads and now
suddenly you're spending seven crore
rupees for actually doing the same thing
so obviously there is there is
corruption I mean that is very very
evident now when when when mr. partek
from the BJP says that we will
investigate this I think this is just
just to avoid the main issue which is
that why did the government of
Maharashtra choose a agency which is as
you pointed out in your investigation
which is being run out of some house and
which is not even a professional agency
there are n number of service providers
out of India out of Mumbai who could
have provided the same service to the
government and the government has
certain norms there are agencies
enlisted with the with the government
they should have used the services of
those agencies and even the rates are
fixed for those kind of services so I
think it is clear that whoever I mean
whoever whichever official who took the
decision of actually hiring an agency
for out of America instead of doing it
you know from an agency in India I think
the first thing is that the action
should be taken against that official
and I think even the minister has to be
responsible the chief minister has to
come in and he has to answer the people
of Maratha we must remember that
Maharashtra today a you know has the
highest debt in our country it has about
4 like 62,000 crores to be fed we should
allow vishwas partic to respond to what
the Congress party spokesperson is
saying but also let's consider that we
have the worst almost the worst numbers
of
children severely underweight and
undernourished in the country we have
the worst numbers of farmers suicide we
have some of the worst numbers when it
comes to crime against women especially
little baby girls who get pulled out of
school or baby girls who get aborted or
killed when they're born vishwas father
could they have been better used to this
money then sending five chaps
- I'm not justified I'm saying that we
should finish making his point do you
understand simple English I am NOT
defending anything I'm not you're saying
what I'm saying
yes should we not attain this dowse
conference I mean you do this so mix up
the topics okay all right one second
issue aspartic forgive me if I've
understood you correctly you said
divorce is a very important event in
which there are people who come in
investors coming from all over the world
and it's important for my Russia to put
up well you know so we can attract
investment which is good for the state I
completely agree with you quick
follow-up question mr. Park in the year
to 2016
they were 2560 mo use for a total
investment of six point eleven trillion
rupees I was signed by the Mirage to
government for investments that would
come into this state for making india
week for greenfield projects that would
be set up
how many since 2016 we're now in 2019
how many of these trillions worth of
projects have actually taken off hey
number one yo to understand whenever a
mu is our sign 100% there cannot be
conversion rate however in the most ever
MBA country where in merit rice
Maharashtra is contributing maximum so
that is the outcome of a 300% resolution
no no no off the no no you told me that
it's important to send a delegation to
Davos every year to attract investments
which I agree with you completely
I want to know what I'm telling you
number one I'm asking you should we not
participate well if we haven't turned
what after we make in India we know we
should focus on the first don't
participate if the Chief Minister
doesn't have the time to go there
himself don't send your vibe you don't
participate in any of the in any of the
countries in the world 100 percent
converts on the OP investment a movie
100 percent tell me what is your
conversion point 11 trillion rupees what
have you converted the boss 2560 mo use
was signed how many got converted do
some threes and my figures okay tell me
your figures mm-hmm I'm writing it tell
me it is not true that India is the most
favored most favored destination for FDR
60 billion FDI highest in the world
India's mr. Bishop show me the money
maximum mr. photos no no you know what
we've both been doing this for a fairly
fairly long period of time I know we
want to change the topic now 2560 MOU
signed by the government of Maharashtra
26 how many of them did you convert into
actual investment listen do me the
courtesy of listening to my question at
least how many of those do use the
currency very baseless you have a
business with the money can I show this
on TV
but you read the RBI's report research
physical survey report and here is the
most favored a destination 60 billion
FBI has been issued by whom and you are
asking me to show no reports of the RBI
no mr. Pathak let me let me ask you the
question again I'm not asking you of
India as a favorable destination I'm
talking about sensible question ask a
sensible question again let me try one
more time to be sensible
let me try one more time to be sensible
fine
we sign them or just show me the money I
cannot show you money okay we secondary
use in the state of Maharashtra mr.
Vishwa spartak of 2560 mo use and
commitments were signed totaling six
point 11 trillion rupees back in 2016
now agreed you said mo use don't fully
convert although let me point out from a
legal point of view and I have a lawyer
now and MOU is a contract it's it it is
a binding contract how much of it's
different okay
no no we rounded all that how much so
then why did you sign them how many of
them converted is my question out of two
thousand five hundred how many how many
is baseless how many converted out of 60
billion FDA issued by India 30 percent
has been contributed by Maharashtra so
almost like 20 billion how many of the
MOU signed converted into actual
industry billion 20 billion has been
issued by Murata out of 60 billion look
at the are you a website no no listen
listen to me okay I saw some light on
you these links are no use but for
Greenfield how many greenfield
investment projects have you managed to
start no no later let a lawyer first
correct you or said what you are talking
about
honey cake me tell you is a lawyer
aniket Nigam interesting question you
know where where are and this I I don't
want to spend too much time on this
because this is actually detailing us
from the contract is the
surely a letter of intention and echidna
come phae-phae first of all let me tell
you spending 7.6 three crows on five
people in five days by any standard is
not only unreasonable and ridiculous
because this is the public money that is
this is the public money that is being
spent and a government servant is
accountable and accountability has to be
up to the hilt now in a situation like
this where these government servants
have gone to Davos and spend such a huge
amount of money they need to explain as
to what was the reason and on what basis
they have spent such a huge f- amount of
money
I heard the industries minister saying
that the bills have not been cleared as
yet the question is not whether the
bills have been cleared or not the
question is how come these bills were
raised to such an extent in the first
place because as it is linked said there
cannot be smoke without fire so unless
there is some basis these bills could
these bills could not have been raised
that is point number one coming to the
issue that is being laid that is being
raised as to whether and MoU amounts to
a contract or not announced MoU by any
general sense means Memorandum of
Understanding which is an expression of
interest now two individuals two
entities two countries sign an MoU only
when they have reached to a certain
understanding that this is what they
intend to do in future now after having
sign on a movie they have to act upon it
the question is whether the government
has further acted upon these MOU use one
cannot just keep on signing a MoU use
and then sit tight on it and do nothing
about it
because then this is not going to take
you any further this is only spending
government money signing MMO use and
doing nothing about it the fact of
signing MOU means that you want to do
something about it and you need to do
something about it because that is the
reason why in the first place you went
to Davos had those discussions and sign
those mo use so your intent was very
clear your intent was to execute these
emus and take it to its logical end the
question is why have they not been taken
to its logical end till now that is
number two number three as I heard the
lunette panel is saying that these bills
will have to be tested the question
again is that if the Chief Minister goes
to Davos for five days and spend around
two crows what was the need for these
five bureaucrats to spend six crows now
this is an answer which they will have
to answer because
this is a question which they will have
to answer because there are set
guidelines went public when bureaucrats
travel abroad for for for government
purposes and when they do so they have
to justify the reason for which they
have travelled and secondly the bills
that they these expenses that they have
made or spent in this case they will
have to answer that because otherwise
there will be criminal implications
there will be other implications and
there have been cases where code sumo -
I have entertained petitions in matters
like this and have asked the bureaucrats
to pay from their pockets if it has
found that these bills are not genuine
they are exaggerated and unnecessary
very well so glad you had submitted go
ahead please no there's something else
that we expose yesterday
mr. Potter keeps on justifying why don't
we ask him another question which I
think you should also ask is about bills
I am NOT just tipping anything can I
finish
that something about six crore mobile
body workers was supposed to be given
1.2 lakh mobile phones now this
Panasonic Eluga
you know phones that cost nearly what
six thousand four hundred rupees online
okay you begin by phones online which
cost six thousand four hundred online
have been purchased by the you know
women and children Welfare Department of
the government of Maharashtra but nearly
eight and a half thousand rupees when
you invent when you are buying one lakh
twenty thousand mobile phones I'm sure
you get much more discount than six and
a half thousand that you're paying
online now they've gone ahead and paid
eight and a half thousand rupees per
mobile phone and the Panasonic Eluga
phones are redundant they are not in
production anymore
so there's another 106 crores scam in
the offing which we've exposed yesterday
I think that also is to be answered by
the government right now well a quick
question - you know - vishwas Patrick we
know that we are talking about one
individual Yoseph ishka boy what about
the other four why is it that the
monastic government has not released
their names yet who are the other four
bureaucrats who traveled with him I
don't have those names I don't know just
know
our reporter has not been able to either
find the names of the four bureaucrats
who traveled with mr. Suresh Kaveri only
know of the one secretary who traveled
and four bureaucrats who went with him
but nobody in the Marshall government
right now has those names handy cherish
Gandhi does that raise an eyebrow for
you obviously I'm seeing a simple thing
why doesn't mr. Kawai and mr. Garre he's
one of the senior-most bureaucrats in
the country why does he not answer and
explain this why does mr. patent not say
tomorrow we will put all this data on
the website and put everything before
public and I keep insisting the press
conference is what should be helped in
there are many serious charges which are
so obvious
there is no inquiry required for this
let them explain if there is an
explanation they'll come up with it and
there is no explanation I think
immediately mr. Kawai should be
suspended immediately you can't wait
like this and let corruption keep on
flowering and say we will have this and
we'll do that because I am sure they
despite your per porosity it is very
difficult to keep following such scans
for a very long time
well vishwas particle giver I have I
have one minute and I'll give you that
one minute to make a promise of it that
tomorrow will will will there be answers
offered to us tomorrow mr. vishwas
particle number one I'm not ok time
correctly I am NOT defending any price
it is subject to scrutiny
if found wrong it will be actually be
taken as far as tomorrow if somebody's
go to a press conference I am NOT
spokesperson for the government of
Maharashtra and spokesperson for BJP at
the BGP I have got full trust in Marathi
government they will take appropriate
and proper action is that it all right
so that was actually not a commitment of
any sort you didn't say what action will
be taken you didn't see what
investigation will be ordered you can
say by when we would get the answers of
who would offer us the GP
will they at least at least give a
commitment that whatever they are fair
oh you are a Strang whatever and travels
there any government from Maharashtra
will they be agreeing to displayed on
the website of fertility you will
believe us I do believe that you will
demand it is just not Maris now all
public authorities have this government
you see the government brought all
transparency concerned okay so which is
bringing all those practices that we are
in but you can tell you give an
assurance that a spur to the Department
of personal trainings
failure and it on the website okay so we
actually have to leave it here because
we've run out of time but at is quite as
we've heard him repeatedly say obviously
not in opposition to offer us anymore
but we will do this I'll offer you an
assurance here on mirror now that we
will track this case very very closely
we won't let the matter stroke up and
sweep it under the carpet and hope that
we don't forget about it we'll track it
closely to find out what sort of inquiry
or investigation is ordered into this
matter and it deserves an investigation
not puch such internally within your own
department but you actually have to get
to the investigative agency to look into
it because my team can tell you that
there's something wrong with these bills
it's you know it shouldn't take too much
for the Chief Minister tomorrow should
realize that there's something wrong and
an inquiry needs to be in you know
ordered once that is done we need to
know what action will be taken and why
it was that these bureaucrats were
allowed to travel and submit bills and
spend money from vendors who are not
registered with the government and we
know there are just start with the
government because these vendors don't
exist and that would be very difficult
to register with vendors who don't exist
this is a clear sign of corruption and
America needs to take action in order to
prove that it is truly anti-corruption
we're gonna be watching very closely
thanks for watching

welcome back one suspect has been
arrested in the Jammu grenade attack
this morning which killed one person in
India 32 others the suspect has been
identified as Yasser Javed but who is
confessed to the crime and also is a
Hizbul Mujahideen operative in Kaluga
the suspect was arrested based on oral
testimony of eyewitnesses and CCTV
footage now the bus that was parked at a
busy bus stop this morning when the
incident took place had people on it and
we understand now of those injured one
person has passed away based on the oral
testimony of witnesses and the CCTV
covers coverage we were able to identify
a suspect who was wearing jeans jacket
and was carrying a red rucksack he was
apprehended and after apprehension was
put to sustained questioning in the
initial rounds of questioning he has
confessed to his crime his name is
Yasiin Javed but he has revealed that he
was tasked to throw this grenade by the
district commander of his bull
Mujahideen in Colgan by the name of
Farooq I'm at but alias Omar he had
started from Colgan only yesterday and
had reached Jammu in the morning after
doing this heinous act he was trying to
escape

me but I was ill masala as a number yeah
a my colleague for either standing by in
Srinagar with information on this Farid
obviously credit to the police and Jammu
that they managed to nab this this
attacker so quickly this terrorist who
seems to be a young man following the
instructions of the his bull Mahajan
Mujahideen forgive me
that's right Faye in Factor we had been
saying this since morning ever since
this attack took place that it is now a
big challenge for the gnk police to stop
this module or these people who carried
out this attack because if they have
done at once they'll try to do it again
and the it was a race against time as
far as G&K police is concerned but they
did manage to nab this particular
suspect or should I say now they've
confirmed to us that he was the person
he's accepted this in his interrogation
on in his questioning that he was sent
by one his will commander by the name of
Faruk Hamid who is the Hizbul commander
for program district to carry out this
attack in German when in fact he had
left Valley yesterday and the kamo reach
to Jammu this morning we're finding a
lot of people in the bus-stand area he
carried out this attack now the
intention was obviously to cause harm to
as many people as possible
to create a spectacle and at the same
time ensure that after this there is a
kind of a reaction in German where the
this could really lead to disturbance as
far as social fabric is concerned
because we know that last time in
Pulwama after the Palama attack there
was so violence in Jammu some
anti-social elements really on the loose
and targeting a particular community and
some Kashmiri localities as well so this
time around possibly when the intention
was one to carry out this attack cause
harm and casualty and then ensure that
this triggers a reaction in Jammu and
then you will have a huge no inorder
disturbance so that has been prevented
by the police by this timely arrest the
police say that their further
questioning as to whether he was the
only one or there were more in this
module and what is the future plan as
far as the Hizbul Mujahideen is
concerned whether this was just for this
particular attack or they have some
bigger plan as far as amo is concerned
now vite Jammu is consumed by this
attack was concerning from the moment it
took place was because Jammu has been a
zero
resident militancy zone there is
absolutely zero local support for
militancy and that's why Jammu has not
seen any militancy related incident in
the recent past
barring a few here and there but
generally it has been very peaceful as
peaceful as any other part of the
country but the jnk police and the
security agencies have done well as to
prevent a spillover of militancy from
Kashmir to Jammu and also importantly
where our people were concerned also was
that how did this this person was this
module managed to really evade the huge
security apparatus intelligence set up
and carried out this attack so this is a
really a timely arrest and let's hope
that this is the only person involved
and there are not more who could really
carry out for the strikes in Jammu faith
that's actually very true for either
right now by hoping that this is the
only one of our you attack of its kind
that we are going to see anywhere in the
country in fact but bad news has also
been this has resulted in students being
attacked in Kashmir is being attacked in
the rest of India a video surfaced today
where we saw goons in Uttar Pradesh in
Lucknow dressed in Saffron who went
around beating up and thrashing Kashmiri
vendors who were selling dry fruits on
the street it was only after the media
picked this up in fact it was our
colleague from times now Prashant who
put the video on Twitter and got
everybody's attention to what was
happening that the police stepped in and
made sure these goons were arrested but
in the meantime there is a larger
question for us to address what is
giving these goons the authority to do
something like this to take the law into
their own hands to use the pull Varma
attack as an excuse to bully people on
the road take a look on the debate
tonight Kashmiri vendors in uttar
pradesh were beaten up
hell by the collar and asked to prove
their nationality these shameless Gomes
who belong to the fringe group vishva
Hindu dal believe they are above the law
when mirror now confronted these goons
outside the police station in Lucknow
they continued to be brazen and showed
absolutely no remorse for taking the law
into their own hands

us a convenient hiding in coral economy
after the Koala attack over 20 such
reports of Kashmiri is being singled out
and attacked have surfaced from across
India
as India unites against the fringe who
spread hate in the name of nationalism
Meera now us is Kashmir not India why
spew this kind of hit well the shocking
thing that we are going to tell you
today is that what we've talked about up
till now the 20 attacks that have
surfaced have surfaced because someone
made a video and put it out on the
internet and the police was able to take
cognizance the actual problem is far far
worse
and as a result far more worrying we
know the Jammu and Kashmir police
started a helpline for people from the
state across the country who might need
help Farid in fact from Srinagar has
been tracking that helpline and in the
studio with me is each other.you a
columnist in Mumbai who has been helping
other Kashmiris find their way back to
the state for read first for it if
you've spoken with the police in in
Srinagar today how many calls have they
received on that helpline how many young
Kashmiri either workers or students have
had to come back to the state in the
last several weeks wealthy hundreds of
them have come back there's no doubt
about it and as far as the NK police is
concerned last time also we spoke to a
senior officer he said that more than
hundred calls they had received and
initially the call flow was more and a
hundred he talked of those calls which
were that there was action on those
calls and these were distress calls and
the police acted on it and in short that
these people were timely held other than
that they were also several other calls
where people were in call inquiring
about various things so there were
hundreds of calls at the genki's this
this helpline has received and according
to the police there are also hundreds of
families and individuals including
students and businessman who come back
and hoping that things will simmer down
and then they may think of going back
but if these incidents continue
obviously it is it will be difficult for
them to make the decision of going back
to their places of work or their
educational institutions and
unfortunately these incidents are
continuing so it will take some time
before
that sense of security returns but
unfortunately this fringe and these
goons are not really helping the cause
and to add to that the authorities they
should do more in fact there's a clear
guideline from on the Supreme Court of
India directions to state governments to
act off against these people ensure that
is proper security but only it's only
after media really yes the news comes in
the media and then you have social media
which which decimates its then only the
police really accent the pressure they
should do it on their own bro be
proactive and really set a deterrent
otherwise that these people are going to
continue with this if they feel that law
is loose and they're not gonna basically
be taken to task for this right it Farid
in fact stay with us
it was so you was in the studio with me
yes I'm looking at this is the final
court order on the matter that was
raised in court by Siddharth Lutheran
Colin Gonsalves and when the court
rejected you know that the fact that was
raised on behalf of the Jammu Kashmir
people forum saying that there were
attacks against Kashmiri people the
Attorney General who argues on behalf of
the government said there has been no
incident after the 22nd of February no
Kashmiri has been attacked across the
country I don't know is that well he's
living in but you should see the amount
of distress calls that we received me my
friends across India or family members
across India soon after Paloma attacked
from kashmir 'yes it was a crisis
situation people will nervous people we
are feeling insecure and David David
life threats we have the number you just
talked about it's it's almost three
thousand people have gone back to their
hometown to Kashmiri three thousand
people almost 19 universities people
have faced some kind of mob violence
some kind of intimidation and almost
forty to fifty students have been
rusticated or they have been suspended
without any inquiry at all
so denying the fact in such a biggest
auspicious Authority the judicious
authority is in itself a joke I would
say people have seen it's this number
that you're giving us right now Road
number four which we have records
unreported internet incidents might be
bigger
and bigger than you have a name against
everyone we have an actual sheet we have
maintained an excel sheet for all the
people who have been harassed who have
been humiliated intimidated across India
after Paloma attack the Kashmiri is I'm
talking about at least goes beyond 3%
after the 22nd or in this case the 26th
of February which is when this court
order came out on the 27th in fact the
court basically said the redirect states
on whom notices have been served to
respondent in seven days and they
directed state governments to take
action immediately and stop this sort of
harassment by can yourself imagine the
state had to put in place a structure
they have to put in place nodal officers
so the situation was really grim so
unless an ally if they are denying the
fact that does nothing has happened why
did supreme court came into play or why
did the state or even Home Affairs they
came into play and they put in place an
entire structure across states they
directed these home secretaries they
created nodal offices means there the
situation was really grave so we we come
across a lot of cases female students
from universities laborers denied wages
not just students people doing jobs here
daily wages I would say a very isolated
case although Mumbai was very safe in
that respect but in Tohoku rule agent
can't evil i'm i self-rescue two
labourers they were thrown out in the
middle of the night with their luggage
we literally no rescued them from the
place although they were not manhandled
but they were denied salaries and
numerous cases we have records their
services were terminated and they were
not given a reason or they weren't given
any salary they were abused not
physically but they were abused and they
were not they were denied even of the
wages for the services they have already
rendered it there has been huge number
of cases but the question is not what
has happened the question is why is this
happening
initially you will talk about 90s the
situation was even worse that time
Kashmir is used to come to the mainland
India for jobs for education for
business but right now what has changed
the amount of hate that has been fed
through the system I think that has
blinded you did say that these students
and laborers and people who work in the
rest of India I've have always been
ambassadors who go back to Kashmir and
tell stories of how absolutely ideas
fantastic political aspirations aside
everybody has political explanations
make the shrinking political spacing
devalue or other things but there are
other day-to-day activities like job is
the education is there they used to come
to mainland in different cities
Bangalore Mumbai Delhi or even small
towns then they used to pay way for
others to follow me taking an admission
in my university starting a job or a
business venture now they have all those
people 3000 is a small number it might
be even bigger they have been humilated
and they have been sent back to Valley
what will it create the alienation was
already there now you have ambassadors
for against India who will be talking
against Indians against you it was
initially it used to be only the
military apparatus that people used to
think that there is a human rights
violation now the civilians have also
participated the the problem is that the
saner voices in India they are on
Twitter and insane voices are
controlling the streets that is the
problem right now
that's a very hard reality to be faced
with but let me bring in the rest of my
panel
Bastardo syndrome is a senior advocate
with the Supreme Court Javed Ansari
senior journalist vascular Ghosh with
the BJP go hard irani is a journalist
joining us out of Kashmir right now and
see Pal Singh from our GP Punjab who has
spent a lot of time in Jammu as well
from what I understand gentlemen thank
you so much for joining us on the show
mr. syndrome you were with us the last
time we had this conversation and I
remember your your views were very
strong about this matter hearing what a
Jaa's has to say would say to us today
that he is an excel sheet of 3,000
people who had to be sent back to
Kashmir because they were either fired
or removed from their universities or
simply humiliated what is your reaction
to this okay I'm
say that I tend to believe him I tend to
accept what he has said because without
a doubt there is a whole segment of very
deranged human beings who believe that
it's almost like a feeling of feeling
manly it's like a bully you know who's
basically a coward but he has to pick on
somebody to show his own strength so
these very deranged people are busy
trying to claim or find an excuse to be
able to spew venom on others what
they're really doing is viewing their
own frustrations and venom on others
let's not you know when I'm just looking
at your your topic for debate today
don't spew venom in the name of
nationalism they're not spewing venom in
the name of nationalism at all because
they're anything but nationalists
they're secessionists these people are
basically secessionist when they say
Kashmir is go back to Kashmir what if
they are doing is they're treating fish
meat as a different country
there really is reaching Kashmir as a
different place they don't accept the
Kashmir is as Indians they say therefore
don't accept Kashmir as India they are
really secessionist they're not
nationalism nationalists at all what
they're really doing is doing their
venom to get rid of their own innate
frustrations
unfortunately in every society you have
enough number of people like this the
danger is you give such deranged human
beings a chance give them any
opportunity instead of curtailing it if
you show any kind of semi encouragement
of it they immediately start behaving
like this what is required is very very
strict action has to be taken against
them I notice that every time there's a
knee-jerk reaction you have something on
TV and immediately someone's arrested I
want to know what happens after they're
arrested are they given bail do they
continue in jail
what kind of a cure judges are framed
against them where has that continued
all this is absolutely necessary and
unless you have a willing administration
a willing administration who's willing
to forget about votes and instead go to
treat the problem for what it is you're
going to have this problem continuing
forevermore because remember one thing
fundamentalism bees are not only once
fundamentalism is all sides and the most
dangerous form of fundamentalism is a
fundamental majority a fundamental
majority can unhighlight a minority and
that is absolutely dangerous there are
terrorists and these terrorists are
creating havoc and they have to be dealt
with very strongly but that does not
mean you in the name of fighting telling
the terrorists if you put this man who
you were showing on your screen in front
of a terrorist he will run for his life
he will turn around and run like the
rabbit that he is he just is picking on
someone who's smaller than him and
that's all he's doing so unless the
administration deals with these people
absolutely strictly and shows it as a
debtor and it has these people have to
be given a deterrent punishment a
punishment which will deter others from
doing the same thing yes a very quick
very quick question again to you mr.
Sundaram India doesn't have a hate crime
law there is no specific law for hate
crimes crimes that are committed against
an individual because they're from a
certain state or a certain community is
it time we bring in a hate crime that
attracts a larger punishment because
this sort of nonsense if it's allowed to
breed the way it is breeding this this
could easily get out of hand you're
right we are at a very secular country
for as long as the majority accommodates
the minority the minorities are always
living at the mercy of the majority in a
secular country absolutely and I think
it's any kind of crime as its punishment
but I think like we have crimes against
children crime against the weaker the
crime against women and they are given
Linehan sentences I think crime in the
name of of this kind of hate crime crime
against minorities like this and it's
and in cases like such as what you've
seen it's not just crime against it
might be that the person who committed
the crime against might be a minority
community of majority that's not the
point
a crime in the name of religion I think
is something which really can be brought
in for an Augmented Nishant and I
believe should be done if we want to
keep India is one and we want a union of
India
and not a cessation of states that's
actually very well said I want to bring
in Javed and sorry as well as evidence
sorry
do you believe as for the Supreme Court
instructions that the governments of our
various states and the Government of
India has done enough to stop or prevent
these crimes from taking place no I
don't fit the state government the
Supreme Court has done well by putting
in place certain processes and measures
but it's for the state it's for the
state governments and it's for the
central government to ensure that these
measures are put into practice it is for
the state governments law and order as a
state subject it's for the state
governments to enact and to come down
with an iron hand when something like
this happens it's pork you know while a
credit must be given where it is due mr.
yogi has finally acted but he's done
nobody any favours the reason why mobs
white thugs like what we assume what
you're showing on your screen right now
continue to act the way they do is
because they have this conference right
or wrong that because they have an
auditor ideologically inclined
government at both at the center and at
the state and that in the past these the
governments have have tended to look the
other way at their own that they will be
allowed to get away it's only because of
the because of the media because this
fact has come to light
and because we are in election season
that the Chief Minister has acted but
nonetheless I mean mr. syndrome is
absolutely he right these these people
are not acting in national interest
every time you you target you zero and
you start bashing up a hapless helpless
Kashmiri in mainland India you are just
playing into the hands of those
secessionists in yes parts of some
success nets in Kashmir and they're
there masterminds in Pakistan who kept
saying that India is only interested in
the real estate of Kashmir not it's
people who keep saying that India is not
a safe place for for for minorities
these lunatics realize that they are
that what they're doing is anti-national
to what they are doing is is just
proving what the enemies of India want
to do they are proving them corrupt they
should be tried I am the mr. Chandra
Melville throw light on this moth but
they should be tried under a much
stricter law just breaking law and order
is nothing that day after tomorrow
they'll be bailed out and they'll be at
it again the day after that they need to
be tried against a much stricter law and
put in for a long period so that it
deters people from acting the way the
baskar gauche
Baskar gosh here's my question to you
why hasn't the government done more
there was one statement from the Prime
Minister saying our battle is with
terrorism and not with Kashmiri people
other than that where is the instruction
to the police where is the instruction
to state governments where is the
message to put out clearly that we do
not stand for this sort of thing why is
the government been so silent on this
matter Bosco gosh all right so I think
lettuce lettuce lettuce introspect and
that thing in totality right now I have
seen one of my panelists Azad I was told
he used the world
Kashmiri Kashmir ease are from mainland
India cash monies have been tortured
orbiting a main lead India the concept
of mainland India itself is is a
separatist concept
he's a mainline what do you mean by
mainland invest I mean what is a other
land
if you mainland India is he used the
word mainland India does it mean
I don't let my panelist whether India is
a mainland or it's a peninsula or it's
surrounded by water on three sides is
immaterial to the conversation by having
let me rephrase my question Bhaskar gosh
the Attorney General kkv no Gopal
representing the Government of India
root of all told the supreme Buddha
there were no incidents attacking
Kashmiri 's our 22nd of February that is
obviously false why did the government
lie to the supreme auctions first of all
I asked the question so you have answer
similar attack the similar attack has
taken place
yeah I'm answering what Government of
India has done it why is it the
Government of India lie to the Supreme
Court adios I did I was out for you I
can hear the entire things but in the
last part I had widely or why the
government of india has lied to supreme
god yes government of india according to
supreme court order has given the list
of the nodal officers and circulated the
MHA has circulated through proper
channel about all the respective
officers which is responsible here in
this case today in Lucknow the police
has taken the immediate steps if you
talk about Lucknow then you must talk
about in West Bengal the same thing is
happening in other states same thing
happening almost the same which has
happened during the secrets during those
forty thousand riots which has been
taking place after the independence so
it's unfortunate give me any less Alize
do not i read my history i'm quite
familiar with it i will ask you the
question again because you were talking
over me and you didn't you know no I'm
not a giving history lesson is that this
is unfortunate during the whole 40,000
riders taking place in this country
there's nothing unfortunate in law and
order it's yeah that's what government
is doing it mr. Ghosh let me ask you the
question again my question is this mr.
KK Venugopal the Attorney General
arguing on behalf of the Government of
India and Supreme Court has actually
submitted that after the 22nd of
February no incident of a Kashmiri being
attacked in India has taken place this
is obviously false
why did the government misrepresent
before the Supreme Court mr. Ghosh can
you not hear me
adios what are you out one second part
of you can hear all right my studio
directors name is Swati Swati could we
just make sure that mr. Ghosh can hear
me please
he can hear me loud and clear I lost the
question again thank you very much mr.
Goss I'm told you can hear me loud and
clear mr. KK Venugopal the learners
attorney general representing the
government of India before the Supreme
Court yeah yeah la mitad that since the
22nd of February no incident of a
Kashmiri being attacked anywhere in
India had taken place this is obviously
false from what our panelists telling us
and what our reporter is telling us why
did the government misrepresent facts
before the Supreme Court no I think I
don't know the background why mr.
Venugopal has has submitted to has given
the submission to the court but perhaps
he he mean to say perhaps that there's
no reported attack or attack was not
reported to the proper authority and
therefore he has don't have the data and
that's why he has if you are if at all
he has given but the question is the
government in all cases of this kind of
attacks have been properly taken care of
they have been I disagree with you
several with evidence on the contrary to
what you just said
is it true that no authority had been a
complaint - of the 3,000 people you tell
me you have an excel sheet of yes
what a complaints made to police this
3000 was everywhere in all the cases
various compares to first the first line
of action was to contact the local
police station that it has been the
first that has been done in almost all
the cases even the Yavatmal case you
talk about cases in Chandigarh you talk
about cases in Jaipur and even in
which state all the cases they were
first reported to the local police
station and help also was provided by
the police station in many cases and
even protection was provided till the
nearest railway station or the airport
but cases have been reported cases have
been reported
Farid tells us that that's the point
there's a point Farid tells us that the
Jammu and Kashmir Police have received
hundreds and hundreds of phone calls and
it's very likely that these 3000
students also have contacted the Jammu
and Kashmir Police when they came back
to Srinagar go hurry Lonnie is with us
he's a slim isn't that point out mr.
Bhaskar gosh one of the reasons why the
government is so misinformed might be
your inability to simply listen when
people are providing you're pinpointing
by dates mr. Guillory how many students
and young and young people have returned
that laborers have returned to Kashmir
have they been official complaints filed
with the authorities any authority at
all whether that is district collectors
or police well I think I would agree
with mr. ages are you more than 3000
queries they're not only students
they're also traders they're also show
businessmen they are professionals even
academics and you know I would like to
say that even one one of the deans in a
university was you know sack and the
college's was sacked just because you
know he was a Kashmiri so I think you
know the more than the statistics and
moved in the data the violence against
Kashmir is in India is more structural I
would explain briefly why it is you know
if you recall what mr. Narendra Modi
said in his speeches after pull bomb
attack 1a1 line was Jo AG Aapke dil mein
woh he argh mera dil may be here so this
and after that he also said Mary v
Hobart Lelaina
but Lally in America throat a so given
the fact that there is a right-wing
government you know at the helm of
affairs in New Delhi so this message is
telegraphed to to the voters to all the
you know certainly brigade and you see
the confidence with which they are
saying that we are beating Kashmir is so
I also have a problem when you say then
then some you know anchors say that
these Kashmiris are
don't beat innocent Kashmiri so what is
meant by a innocent but lies against
against the terrorists in Kashmir no
please please
so what I'm saying is that you know if
there is a Kashmiri and a curry your
chief is he or she has a political view
if he or she has a political aspiration
or political sentiment does it mean that
he or she is to be thrashed
so this is a problem that only you know
don't beat innocent Kashmiri and also
when you say that you know they're our
own so does it mean that if there is a
foreigner that you know you have to beat
foreigners so there are lot of
fundamental problems in when we did a
debate this issue and I'm reminded of
what happened in in the era of Nazi era
during the Hitler's regime there was a
Ministry of propaganda run by mr. Joseph
Goebbels and then the Jews were
caricatured demonized and that's what
happening you know I'm glad that this is
only channel where I see a same debate
is happening but if you watch other
channels how Canaries are demonized
caricatured and and thrashed and and
there's a there's a propaganda media is
partner-in-crime and it flows from the
drop-top there's a structural violence
in what you are seeing in you know in in
many parts of India so on the contrary
there are three hundred thousand you
know labourers migrant workers skilled
workers who come from Maharashtra Madhya
Pradesh West Bengal you pee oh yeah work
in work in Kashmir and you have seen you
know how they they even live with cash
Milly's and there has not been a single
reaction to whatever it has been
happening in Jaipur in Rajasthan and
other parts of India well I also want to
bring in mr. Cee Pal Singh mr. Singh you
spent a fair amount of time in Germany I
have a question to my gallery I have a
mr. Ghosh but after you after everyone
has had an opportunity to speak we can
come back we will come back to you mr.
Singh former AGP Punjab go ahead please
see the entire problem needs to be
looked in a much broader way you see
what do the enemy want in any case or
what do the terrorists want what forget
about enemy there is one that there
should be
disturbance they should real all's mess
and there should be area nation we are
actually Fanning the cause of terrorists
by alienating the Kashmiris are by
attacking on the dictionaries are by
looking down upon them either
psychologically or physically I am of
the view that in tsipras in such
circumstances there has to miss maximum
effort on the part of all nationalist
forces to be more akin to the Kashmiris
who are here to be more friendly with
them so that we do not fan up the cause
of terrorists be in the broader century
us there are certain legislation which
are not there irrespective of the
legislation there's a plethora of
legislation where we can book them not
necessarily a new legislation need to
come for this thing in the IEP see also
these things are provided is a attack on
the human body or a psychological attack
an intimidation all these uprighted the
question is the law enforcement is not
done why it is not done because the
message trickles down to the law
enforcement agencies that forget it we
are in the process of taking Bhadra and
they think but lies in terms of our but
lies in terms of torturing
psychologically alienating are pushing
them out of India discovery this is no
matter I told you we are actually doing
something second point something against
the nationalist cause you said the Prime
Minister very kindly gave a message
after a number of such incidents are
upon number of such incident and these
incidents were by and large reported on
the media and number of leaders who are
critical leaders from J&K they again and
it is asked why the government of India
why the Prime Minister is not saying
anything of this ultimately after the
supreme court instruction the prime
minister gave the order why this slight
of quietness I mean this trickles down
maybe he had some genuine reason I'm not
saying to the Prime Minister divided but
it trickles down and people at the lower
level and with that some of their goose
who do not understand what is it to be
done in the case of terrace they
indulgence I think I really
this is one side of the thing that I
tell you that in any terrorist in any
terrorists affected State the more you
alienate the people the more terrorism
will come in be the second side of the
coin is that as well as the terrorists
as concerned they want this alia nation
not the incident which happened in Jammu
recent and today you try to understand
this incident happen yesterday and the
5th of March Pakistan has given a
statement the Ministry of federal
affairs in Pakistan on 5th March gave a
statement that 44 terrorists who belong
to proscribed there is institutional
organization have been detained yes
those are for them to say that out of
these 44 we'll go into the detail and
after a week or two weeks will
reconsider
they have calibrated the art of telling
lies and trying to win over because
there are going to be sanctions against
them the Financial Action Task Force is
revealing their the Pakistan is already
and the greatest they may come on the
blackness in a few months and therefore
it is there from 2:08 they have been
going from gray to white right to gray
but they will never come to the best
acquired that knows what are you doing
by creating the spirit activity are
showing this dissatisfaction you are
only Fanning the causal diamond in the
government of the other country
listening that yes not that they are the
terrorists we are prosecuting them the
persecution is my yes the persecution
level they are already hell you know it
in fact mister sooner you know what's
missing
yes what's missing was a clear public
service announcement that was not put
out by the government that spends a fair
amount of money advertising in
newspapers and on radio and on
television every day they should have
been a public service announcements
saying do not do this this is wrong
there wasn't any they should have been a
message saying if you feel that much
anger join the army join the board of
Security Force join the sea
RPF and actually contribute your anger
in the right direction they should have
been a very clear message saying revenge
is not what we're after because the
international courts and the
international laws will have no place
for revenge and our attack in balla
quote was not revenge and we're very
clear about that as far as international
you know law is concerned so has there
been bad communication by the Government
of India and by the ministers in this
particular case that has fueled this
sort of emotion you see don't forget one
thing for the people who are behaving in
the way they are behaving like I said
are behaving because they have to
fulfill their own inadequacies the only
way they can be suppressed is by a
strong government taking stronger action
against them in fact it's all very well
I just heard the excise EP of police who
was talking about there are various
crimes but what you're going to do
charge these chaps with assault
tomorrow they get bail they're out
nothing further happens they're
forgotten about if the government gives
a clear enough message and says these
people will be treated as anti Nationals
there are anti Nationals because they're
working against nationalism they're anti
Nationals and they're doing nothing less
than what terrorists themselves will do
whatever is do the terrorists take it
out on Hamlet on people who are harmless
on people who are helpless they go on
they go to the ordinary city they blow
up the ordinary citizen that is what a
terrorist does to get his message across
what are these goons doing they're doing
the same thing in fact they are doing a
different form of terrorism from a
different side why don't you throw the
book at them for anti-national like
activities throw them in without bail
look you have now got an identity of
these people I'd like you fear really
for your channel to follow up as to what
is being done with these people on a
day-to-day basis tomorrow as to whether
they have given bail tomorrow and if
they're given bail tomorrow I want you
to ask them ask as to why they were
couldn't bail what were the sections
they were charged under why was not the
book thrown at them in every which way
it could have been now tell me something
do what they have done today it's one
thing to say mister
beats up mister why it's a simple case
of assault yes but when it's done for
this kind of reason and its effect can
be anti-national its effect can be that
Kashmir is tomorrow are treated as a
totally different place and that can be
a lead to such as I session of the
country now they are not anti Nationals
secondly please look at what is
happening internationally
internationally what is being seen
rather than taking keeping the emphasis
on the manner in which Pakistan is
harboring terrorists an emphasis will
certainly come about as to how in in
India peep the minority community of
people from Kashmir are being mana are
being assaulted where they are and
nothing serious is being done about it
so what is different in that case that
is the kind of message Pakistan will try
to spread we have to safeguard ourselves
against all this we have to do something
very very strong and the only one who
can do it is the government and the
government has to take a very strong
stand against such people in the absence
of it this will continue because you
have bullies everywhere who'll make the
most of this opportunity and they don't
even have the intelligence they're
cowards and they're unintelligent they
can't even see that what they're doing
is really feeding into the hands of the
terrorists because they themselves are
treating me as a different country by
saying go back to Kashmir where is it go
back to Kashmir which means part of
India nobody tells me go back to Tamil
Nadu go back here or go back there
they're all part of India now by
behaving like this you are encouraging
it so to find a law throw the book at
them whatever it is don't give them bill
I want you to really follow up on what's
being done to these people today and if
tomorrow they're given bail I want you
to raise Cain about it I want you to
bring this to the public eye that this
cannot be done people like this cannot
be given bail tomorrow and I want you to
follow it up because I assure you that
within two days they'll be out on bail
in fact what we'll do is we'll work with
HR Sahib who's here in the studio in
Mumbai with me with those various cases
who which have been you know sent to the
police including the one that happened
in Maharashtra and we'll track whether
those people have been given bail and
what the status is of that doctor
Siddiqui on the phone line from Lucknow
go ahead please
yes madam thank you for calling me I
want to speak two words yes correct
this is yes this is unfortunate incident
which has occurred in cash the cash
meeting in Lucknow and this cannot be
accepted by anybody or any Society which
are illiterate and good and India is one
of the most important country of the
world now yes yes dr. Suzuki very well
said that if we are a democratic and
literate and civilized nation this is
completely unacceptable sundar on the
phone line from Chennai so there good
evening go ahead hi good evening
I just watching a TV and I can see those
guys being bashed so badly its Kashmir
not a part of India and I go to Karim
and syndrome these guys should be booked
and not be being given baby
yes you should actually put these guys
in Kunduz you start putting wind effect
on these guys I'm sure they are not
going to do this yesterday mr. Modi was
in Chennai yes you are talking about so
many things I think we should watch the
TV right now and see these cash milling
people getting hurt so badly if you are
going to continue like this I'm sure
these Muslim boys of Kashmir will join
the hands of luxury tybo well I
understand what you're saying that we
need to be able to show at this point a
sense of Brotherhood's that will shut
them outs of anybody who wants to divide
this country Javed Ansari I'm gonna come
back to you on that point of the
government using crores and crores of
public money for advertisements at this
point full-page ads in newspapers
television and radio some of that small
slivers of it could have been used for
public service announcements asking
people to keep the peace indeed
but let's not forget this is election
season all this advertising is happening
because they want to at this lots last
moment at the eleventh hour
try and you know propagate as much as
possible this is not their prior their
priority is to win elections it's not
enough just to pay lip-service you know
after five days after spate of lynchings
after journalists like you raised a hue
and cry the prime minister or that comes
on air and since the low this should
this should not happen but what happens
after that this has to be followed
through this is happening in a state
which is which is governed by the BJP if
the BJP governs State is it doesn't pay
heed or follow what the Prime Minister
is saying or do then who else will the
Prime Minister needs to pick up the
phone and read the riot act to the chief
minister of the state how is this being
allowed some of these people should be
should be made an example of and as mr.
syndrome was saying treat merely
treating this as a law and order as some
kind of man handling issue will not
suffice treat recharge them with
sedition charge them with a fit some
heinous crime
so that's they spend a couple of months
in jail and then the harsh reality will
down on them otherwise you can keep
spending money in juvie and we'll keep
reducing a human cry but this will be
business as usual if the Prime Minister
and this government really mean an iota
or what they say then they must come
down heavily all state commits and that
state governments that should be hauled
over the course absolutely Bhaskar gosh

announcing development projects right
number three development projects don't
change what we're talking about today I
don't say what are you talking about we
are not showing the half half-filled
that's trade are free let me put my
point the wire picture why I made the
comments I think why are going to bring
a man John and condemnation from the
government to what has happened to me
slush marries I don't know what you can
say I mean one by one if I'm wrong III
really that's what I'm telling you have
a message of condemnation second all of
them are telling that they should be
booked under
oh gosh do you have a message of
condemnation from the government or from
the BJP has the BJP condemned these
attacks no not at all
why not of course we condemn the attack
in all all possible way all possible way
we don't support even even even I mean
we cannot think of supporting this
attack in yadi should be obscene on your
ally the attack today in Lucknow was
carried out of members of the Vishwa
Hindu dull will you insist that these
organizations remove these peoples not
via parties it is be shown Hindu doll I
know what is I don't know who is be show
Hindu doll okay so now I don't know who
is he showing her doll they are not a
part of what BJP we know be sure Hindu
Parishad we don't know what is richer in
do dull anyone having a saffron color
you can't attach them with the BJP and
we have booked them under serious
charges of 147 323 294 5 0 4 5 0 6 & 2 9
& 3 2 3 2 3 most of them is non bailable
offence well we understand that this is
for mr. diverse underarms benefit that
they've been booked under Section 1 4 7
fariah t 3 2 3 for voluntary causing
voluntarily causing hurt
5:04 for intentional insulting ident or
a walk and breach breach of peace these
are the sections that have been applied
in this case you know this has come from
the fyr directly from our I don't mean
all these sections all these sections
all these all these sections I'm sorry
you asked me something for all these
sections are sections by which they can
get bail immediately I am saying do
something serious there's a gentleman
who spoke to you on the telephone just
now fare
a very good idea booked them under the
Kunduz act hook them under the Bundys
act because that is the way we they have
behaved why don't you book them under
the Kunduz act then there's no question
of bail right now why don't you do that
book all these people under gündüz Act
book them for anti-national activities I
booked them on charges for which they
cannot get mail all these sections
you've said are all sections on which
they will get bail within two days
please just check it tomorrow find out
on the quickest whether or not any court
for causing simple hurt no I'm sorry sir
but if you call simple hurt or if you've
write it or affray and these are kind of
things which every court will give you
bail we've got to take that not in the
normal context of causing a hurt we've
got to take it in the context of the
specialized yes swear in which we're
dealing with now you see if you take
those adjust the sections in themselves
those are all sections which in the
daily walk of life are things on which
any court will grant bail because
otherwise we'll have so many people in
jails but we are dealing with a
completely different situation where
those same crimes have been committed
those crimes take a different
perspective they take a different
perspective in in the nature in which
they become are committed for the reason
they're being convicted committed yes
Saguna is taken at the periphery and say
this is the crime committee we go again
i anti-national activities Kunda you
have to use or invoke indirect go ahead
oh yeah we have talked a lot about how
to deal with the people who created this
mess but in the process we should also
think about the students thousands of
students who have leftist studies in the
way yeah there needs to be an assurance
from the government or some
communication from the university side
that they should feel secure they should
return to the university thousands of
students their careers are at stake
which needs to be taken care of and
people who have left jobs there needs to
be some immediate assurance from the
government from the universities so that
these people can come and we have to
point out here is when you approach the
police yes that someone had was being
threatened or someone felt unsafe or
removed from their job the police gave
you protection to the nearest bus stop
us
train station but didn't say no you go
back to college we'll give you
protection make sure nothing absolutely
a simple example University on the
highway of Jaipur almost 11 girls were
stranded inside and a huge mob was
waiting on the highway they block
behavior entirely they were crying they
were in distress and they had to flee in
the dark of the night so that nobody can
see them
police did help them they accompanied
the bus to the airport and they were
they are safely they have reached home
but the situation was very tense at that
time the entire nation was in anger
because of the whole Obama thing and
even police was feeling a little bit of
helpless in such situations we had an
entire mob has taken the hostage an
entire highway so you had such kind of
scenarios in different situations well
we have completely run out of time but I
do promise our panelists as mr. syndrome
said that we should be tracking these
cases very closely we will track these
cases very very closely to bring you
updates of everything that has happened
messages to goons if you're really that
angry and you really want to show how
much or you are join the army sign up
and let's see you do some real work
join the CRPF join the Border Security
Force and actually amount to something
instead of being a street corner bully
which is what you really are to the
government of India you have to do more
you have to put our public service
announcements you have to come out and
make impassioned speeches about how
we're a united country and being united
actually means being United with every
single Kashmiri citizen because Kashmiri
citizens our citizens just like you
banned me on mirror now we make a very
very clear stand as we did the last time
you beat up a Kashmiri you beat us up
when you hit a Kashmiri you hit us and
you threatened a Kashmiri you threatened
us there is no difference we're all
citizens of this country and we will all
stand together you go out and threaten
and beat up a minority you are the
separatist
there's no room for suckers we will
stand together and we will stand with
our Kashmiri brothers and sisters and we
will not allow you to do this anymore

that despite opposition demanding a

cleared all these proposals without any

Shiv Sena held the Standing Committee of
BMC cleared as many as 60 proposals
Worth's more than 620 crore rupees in

that all these proposals were fresh

gone up in the Standing Committee of the

five of us are from the opposition with
this strength immediately going up
shoshana BJP has started clearing the

screaming we creep telling people the

proposals but since the elections are
close by and I am very sure that these

objective of getting funds for the
election it's a straight allegation that
I'm making and without any discussion
have I have screamed so many times I've
walked out from the committee meetings

then today the strength is gone up to
almost 20 of the ruling parties so now
they are clearing all the proposals

superhero film in the Marvel Cinematic
Universe or the MCU which really has
been a long time coming
the film stars brie Larson as Carol
Danvers or Captain Marvel samuel
l.jackson as a young priya pats Nick
Fury it also stars Ben Mendelsohn Jude
Law and it Bening lashonna Lynch and
Clark Gregg it is written and directed
by Anna Borden and Ryan Fleck despite
other strong female superheroes who have
arguably earned a standalone film namely
Black Widow Scarlet Witch and even
Valkyrie if you ask me the anteus focus
on the build-up to avengers endgame has
reached a fever pitch
so Tony makes sense to introduce Captain
Marvel as a vital piece in the puzzle
when we first meet Danvers she's a
powerful soldier of the alien race known
as the Kree even though she feels a
strong connection to earth she's unaware
of who she is and where she comes from
during an intergalactic battle she
crashes on earth otherwise known as c53
where she encounters agent Nick Fury she
then begins to retrace her memories to
her origins but there was a lot of
fanboy criticism and brie Larson was
cast as Captain Marvel and let's address
that right away brie Larson is
convincing enough as Carol Danvers and
she isn't as brooding as a trailer's
make her out to be
in fact Dan will share some of the
lighter moments with Nick Fury samuel
l.jackson particularly seems to enjoy
playing a relatively naive version of
the otherwise surly fury who quickly
learns that everything is not as it
seems
Jule loss addition to the MCU isn't
exactly memorable but ben mendelsohn
particularly stands out it's unfortunate
that i can't get into too many details
about their roles without giving out
spoilers the film has a distinct 90s
finality complete with a grunge era
soundtrack and I for one was extremely
happy to hear nirvana and a relatively
obscure band elastica in the MCU the
whole grunge look and sound works well
in this film and it also lends ample
opportunities for humor now although the
strip aims at big laughs it doesn't
always succeed at points where it
intends to in fact Rilke force come from
unexpected places here's a hint
cat lovers would be thoroughly delighted
with goos who arguably turns out to be a
real scene stealer this notion is gently
resonates across the film especially
with its script it succeeds and unlike
places and misses where it really should
land there are a few night of surprises
and the superhero moments are well
intact but they come along with a
meandering pace that severely drags the
film down to a lull during the first act
and somewhere around the middle - to me
this feels more like a directorial issue
and little to do with the cast yes the
plot sets out to establish Carol Danvers
as a bona fide badass and thoroughly
succeeds in the end by now MCU fans know
the drill stick around for the end
credits and you will not be disappointed
unfortunately the route it takes to that
point encounter some speed bumps
courtesy of the usual superhero origin
issues that have troubled the genre I'm
going with three and a half stars for
Captain Marvel despite the issues with
its plot and pace this is typical MCU
fare they made another fun action and
character driven film it's not entirely
IMAX and 3d worthy though but that aside
it's about time Captain Marvel showed up
and the Avengers are a much stronger
team with Carol Danvers on their side
this also succeeds in getting you even
more excited for when just endgame as if
that was needed guys let me know what

there's going to be a meal made of it

the ruling party who've gone on and
announced numbers like 250 300 and in
one case yogya the Senate said 400 have
been killed and we asked the opposition
then demands evidence of any sort of
success are these politicians basically
discrediting our forces dragging our
forces into their political questions
[Music]
should they stay out it given also more
importantly that these are questions of
national security and these are
sensitive matters of international
affairs I couldn't have had a more
brilliant panel put together this
evening and like we have been doing on
this channel over the last several days
we are going to simply listen while the
people who truly understand this issue
tell us like it is on the show with me
this evening three former Chiefs of the
army the Air Force and the Navy Air
Chief Marshal Philippe Major is the 21st
chief of the air staff of the Indian Air
Force former member of the national
security advisory board he was chief
during the 26/11 attacks on Mumbai
general VP Malik the 9th chief of the
Army Staff of the Indian Army he served
as army chief a chairperson chief of
staff committee during the Kargil war he
coordinated and planned and executed the
operation Vijay to defeat Pakistan's
attempt to intrusion in Kargil Navy
chief Admiral Sushil Kumar served as the
chief during the Kargil war there was a
joint in charge while the attack on
Parliament happened in 2001 gentlemen
good evening to each of you and I thank
you each for your time
to start with general VP Malek general
Malek there has been a lot of crosstalk
among our politics among our politicians
about what has happened about the
numbers that have been released there
are politicians announcing numbers 250
300 400 people have died is it the place
for a politician at a political election
rally to be talking about matters like
this and announcing unofficial numbers
in your opinion say I'm afraid I
couldn't hear you properly
this the voice is so muffled that one
cannot hear properly well let me attempt
to ask the question again do you believe
that politicians are discrediting our
forces with the questions that they are
asking right now general Malek look the
problem is that we have got elections
coming very soon and there are some
questions which may be appropriate but
there are quite a few inappropriate
questions and untimely also now we
carried out the strike and the results
cannot be so evident within a few hours
the fact is that there was a target
given to the Air Force they struck it
and they have verified that they have
struck the target they have caused the
damage now who is going to count the
number of casualties I don't know the
Air Force cannot the Indian government
cannot so we have to take some time to
get the ground data of whatever
information that we can collect from the
ground but why this fight is going on
I'm so glad the right answer has been
given by the Chief of Air Staff himself
a chief marshal dhanoa
and I don't think the Indian Armed
Forces would want to get involved in
this whole issue which is more of a
electoral
issue and not doubting the credibility
of the Armed Forces well general Pollock
the other question that does arise is if
when politicians announce these numbers
and you did say at election rallies
because there's an election coming up
but they turn around and say when you
ask me for proof you are questioning the
forces themselves is there a need right
now to separate politics from the forces
completely oh no the point is that after
all the military is an instrument of the
politics and as far as I am concerned I
would also like the public including the
politicians to take interest in national
security and to be aware of national
security but I'm talking at the time
because of the elections coming so these
questions which are being which are
being asked some time when you start
doubting the success of the military
what they have achieved and you start
casting aspersions on that now that I
think is unfair and that should not be
done that will embarrass the that will
also affect them or all of the armed
forces well I do want to ask a question
of Admiral Admiral Kumar Atma so Sheila
Kumar there has been a lot of bragging
that has been done by members of
government who said this is the first
time the forces have been given a free
hand in deciding retaliation this is the
first force's friendly government where
the forces are actually been giving of
giving a free hand
do you agree with that or do you believe
that this is the first time well
to look at this in a very overall
perspective there is a tactical
responsibility and a strategic
responsibility the Armed Forces are
given a mandate directly for a strategic
responsibility but on a tactical level
they are always at the border in the air
on the ships carrying out their tactical
duties so to say that they've been given
a mandate to retaliate at will has to be
seen in that context you see her during
the Kargil conflict especially during
short of war situations as we were at
one stage rules of engagement do apply
and when you say a free hand to
retaliate you cannot let the Armed
Forces carry out an operation which
would have international ramifications
those are strategic operations for which
they require a definite political
mandate the Bali court attack was a
directive from the government it was not
a free hand to the military to strike
anywhere and go anywhere or do what you
will across the LOC even the surgical
strike the traditionally did with the
army that was a directive so you have to
be a little careful on this there are
tactical levels of response and
strategic levels of response in the Navy
we call it the rules of engagement
during the Kargil war and we were at the
precautionary stage of war we had very
specific rules of engagement well
Admiral do you believe like general
Malik just told us there's obviously an
election coming up do you believe if the
election was not so close by perhaps
the nature of the battle or the nature
of the talk that we're having in
politics would be different or is this
normally how politicians have always
reacted buddy I missed I missed that
point to click can you please repeat it
I will my question is do you believe
that the politics around this strike is
because the election is coming up well
you know that is I would say a given but
we also have to bear in mind that the
armed forces need to be left out of the
political discourse we are apolitical
then that's the way it ought to be we
are not part of the political mainstream
and we are best when we operate a
politically that is the way it's always
been that is our oath of allegiance we
serve the nation are in fact not the
oath ingrained in us is the safety honor
and welfare of the country come first
always in every time and that is the way
it ought to be that is my personal view
this very well put a chief marshal folly
major joins us is well you you a marshal
regio went to the government after 26/11
and and that story came out where you
recommended airstrikes much like the
ones we saw carried out last week at
that time you weren't given the go-ahead
do you believe that the go-ahead that
was given last week for last week's
strike are an indication of this
government's risk taking ability or its
political will good evening
Feifei i had this question has been
asked to me many times and we must get
one thing clear that anytime you have a
conflict situation like the one we had
in Mumbai
26:11 or the Pulwama attack or what you
did just now the armed forces are always
asked for a military response and what I
had given them were the Air Force's
options for a military response as to
why that was not accepted his best
answered by the government and not me
because we don't ask them whether as to
why they were not allowed to execute the
task which we had suggested so I will
not be able to answer your question but
yes coming and seeing what has happened
on 26 February it all boils down to the
will of the government and also perhaps
a better orientation about our
intelligence that we have gathered or we
have enhanced since 26 11 in the country
and for a strike like the one on 26th
unless you have impeccable intelligence
a strike of that nature would never have
been possible so perhaps these are some
of the reasons why I think the strike
was undertaken on 26th of February but I
do understand the general Malik could
hear us better general Malik the
question and this is a quote from one of
the politicians that said the government
waited until the 13th day and then
killed 250 terrorists in response to
pull Varma now again what I would like
the audience to understand that a strike
like this one involves strategy planning
working out scenarios a heavy
on intelligence this is not revenge and
also international law doesn't permit
this sort of revenge this was actually
strategic and a lot of the political
talk right now is muddying the waters as
far as that is concerned isn't that true
general Malik yeah that is true let's
face it that this was a preemptive
strike
it was a strategic mission deep inside
Pakistan territory on a given target and
the job was in - I would say twofold one
was to show our capability that we can
strike anywhere deep into Pakistan
territory against these militant targets
that I thought was achieved very well
now second part as far as the number of
casualties inflicted that slowly
gradually these things will become
apparent but today to start talking
about it discussing about it and asking
for exact figure is absolutely not
correct and yes it was not a revenge
definitely not a revenge
but it was a preemptive strike and I
would say it was a reaction to what has
taken place and the way our casualties
were in the way Pulwama attack was was
done by the by the by Josh Josh a
Mohammed so it was I would say
pre-emptive to tell the terrorist
elements as well as to the Pakistan
government whose strategic asset they
are absolutely and in fact I want to
bring in a Admiral Kumar I think about
if we consider right now international
law are specific to do with reprisal the
fact that this was pre-emptive it was
not revenge that Pakistan had been
informed about the terrorists operating
on its soil that we had given Pakistan
several opportunities to take action on
its own before we decided that we
preemptively had to take action on our
own all of this is in
important to international law
international law obviously that the
neighbor Navy is very familiar with
because you sail in international waters
all the time it's important again that
politicians be very careful about how
they word statements on this particular
strike is that not true very vague it's
May I'm sorry that my guess audio is
very blurred I missed the last part
please could you kindly repeat the last
part will these political statements
hurt our chances hurt our justification
in a hurt our use of international law
with having to do with these strikes yes
the Navy
unlike the Army and the Air Force always
operates in international waters now we
are getting into a very tense situation
where it is a short of war situation
developing and events as they are
unfolding indicate that both sides are
on a very high state of alert rules of
engagement do apply particularly on the
high seas because the navies operate in
international waters where other navies
are present this is an international
arena so we have very specific rules of
engagement and particularly so as we
approach a very critical phase we are
presently in a very critical phase and
I'm confident that the Indian Navy
having gone through this particular
drill during Kargil is well aware of
what the rules of engagement are in such
a situation if during this
highly tense situation or combatant
units which are on a very high state of
alert and well deployed to encounter
certain hostile action at sea they know
how to respond the rules of engagement
are very clear-cut in navies this has to
be so because navies always operate
internationally
besides that navies have a very
professional understanding amongst
themselves Pakistan Navy but know that
during the Kargil war when the Indian
Navy had deployed in strength that both
fleets deployed for action then the
situation was hunting up that tunneling
and tiger hill an uncoded message from
Islamabad headquarters game which was
intercepted by us to the Pakistan Navy
remain in harbour message was
self-explanatory navies understand the
professionalism that exists between them
they have a very clear understanding of
it so I'm sure that the rules of
engagement would similarly apply on land
the troops at the tactical level would
take necessary action as they always do
but if it's a strategic action if it's a
very very major action that requires a
clear-cut government directive and I
would have ramifications they are not
afraid that would require a government
mandate that is how I see it
a chief marshal major or we have to also
ask the larger question here while we
are all grateful that abandon has
returned on to Indian soil the larger
solution for Pakistan for terror that we
continue to face for the fact that
terror continues to breed on Pakistan so
do you believe
that there is a solution right now that
India can explore say before I come to
that question you've asked IIIi need to
clarify a few points please do I think
in this debate what we've done is we've
digressed a bit you know rules of
engagement and you know international
laws etc are were framed for the
classical hot war situations today this
is a war or terrorism and I slightly
differ from the Admiral that the action
carried out on 26 February was a
tactical action which perhaps resulted
in a strategic effect which any air
power application always does and
therefore rules of engagement in a fight
against terrorism but what what what
what what happened a couple of days back
and what happened even before that in
the cross-border strike by the Army in
2016 are not really warm and dated
actions and therefore there are there
are many many gray areas in this field
that is what I wish to clarify before I
answer your question about putting an
end to terrorism now that is not only a
military task but a whole-of-government
task to assess the situation in Kashmir
to assess the situation across the
borders and to factor in diplomatic and
economic pressures on Pakistan for
curtailing terrorism while the military
would play a big role because you know
if you if you go back in history all the
hum forces were structured for hot war
situations they were structured trained
equipped before a hot walk but
the conflicts having mutated from total
war to what we have today less than more
situations hybrid warfare etc have
changed the rules of engagements as far
as the Armed Forces are concerned and it
is very very difficult to lay down
specific rules of because there is there
are faceless enemies there are no
borders in between you're fighting a
terrorist and not any mini army or armed
force that this needs to be understood
very clearly in the present situation
but a quick question then a chief
marshal if if you say that the rules of
engagement are only for hot war
situations what is international law
then say about India going into Pakistan
territorial air sovereign airspace when
we are not at war we're technically not
at war at this point war on terror is
not hot war as you describe it
absolutely this was an action a tactical
action taken against terror we were we
mean target a military target we didn't
target civilians we targeted a terrorist
camp and and have you heard anybody in
the world say a word about him as the
United Nations said anything about it
and they won't because you haven't
carried out a military action across the
border you carried out a anti-terror
operation somewhat like what America did
in Pakistan to assassinate Osama bin
Laden but would either of the other
gentlemen want to respond to that before
we move to a next question general Malik
do you want to respond to how we ought
to deal with this from a point of view
of international law and strategy look
strategically I think everyone is clear
that this was is an action in
self-defense
we had been hit and hit badly in Pulwama
and we had clear information that's the
terrorists who had caused that mayhem in
Paloma where they were located so
whatever action somebody can call it
technically I would like to call it
strategic action that was done it was in
self-defense and that is one reason why
everyone in the world is supportive of
what we did and I think that must be
quite clear the rules of engagement may
be quite vague in hybrid war and we are
fighting a hybrid war with Pakistan but
as far as this particular action is
concerned it was preemptive and it was
in self-defense because we do not want
any more suicide trained people by the
is bull by Joshi Mohammed to enter India
and then cause another mayhem like
Paloma Admiral Kumar would you like to
add to that yeah yes Priya basically I
would like to just add that rules of
engagement but designed to ensure that
escalation is controlled you cannot
carry out an act of war and then expect
no escalation so that is why rules of
engagement are prescribed and I
generally agree with red malik because
we were there during cargill and we knew
how it went up step by step here it is a
situation the Cargill was the different
is limited war we actually went into a
limited war so we had different phases
of rules of engagement here we are going
straight into battle situation has made
Manik very correctly put it it was in
self-defense and you use the around
forces Armed Forces are meant for war we
are trained for war but you can use them
in self-defense also in a cold start
Paul out of full mama led to that and
therefore I believe that rules of
engagement are important to consider we
can't just ignore them and a decision to
strike at bonnie court was as general
malik also agrees with me a strategic
decision it was just not an ad-hoc
tactical move was well thought-out well
conceived marvelously executed by the
air force full marks to the air force
for doing a brilliant job but it has its
own repercussions because it was across
the border deep inside Pakistan
it was like an Israelis massive strike
don't that is the way I look at it rules
of engagement are basically meant to
control escalation thank you a chief
marshal like I see you shaking your head
do you not agree go ahead please with
great respect
Ellucian Kumar I do not because I still
insist that this is not a war like
situation this is a fight against
terrorism this is happening all around
the world and no country has declared
war on anyone any other country and
therefore a one-off strike like this is
a strong message to a country which
hobbled Havas terrorism and terrorist
safe havens that stop it I will keep
will hit you again we won't hit you or
your people we won't hit your armed
forces but we'll hit a terrorist
infrastructure or terrorists themselves
because we find that this is ruining our
state of affairs in our country and I
think that the I mean there are as I
said lots of gray areas in this nobody
in the world today I promise you will
he clearly defined rules of engagements
etc in situations such as what obtained
today in our neighborhood and also in
our immediate neighborhood as well as
extended neighborhood in many aspects
because as I said and as the journal and
the Admiral said that Armed Forces
basically what structured trained and
fight classical Wars but they had to
evolve over the past couple of decades
to even handle anti-terror operations
and when you and when you handle an
entity and what is happening is most of
these are handling I beg your pardon are
being addressed in them above a Pio J&K
as we call it now now at one time you
say that Bok belongs to us so we can do
whatever on earth we want in that area
and that is not war that is a insurgency
or a terrorism like situation a less
than war situation a hybrid war whatever
want to call it which you are handling
tactically and in windows of opportunity
but here's my I just would have placed
this before the panel one more time
Admiral Kumar reprisal under
international law which allows countries
the one time opportunity to take action
in sovereign space or territory of
another country does that apply in this
case and the reason why I'm bringing it
up is because what politicians are
saying today will jeopardize the stand
that the Ministry of External Affairs
has taken so carefully
digress a bit here then mention and go
back to the Parliament attack of 2001
December 13th I was then the chairman of
the Chiefs of Staff Committee when it
happened
not many know that the military chiefs
general Bob Donovan a chief marshal
tipnis and I met with British mission of
the NSA and Defense Minister George
Fernandes in the army operations room
and the first thought that occurred to
us was a repost and the target chosen
was inside deep inside the LOC across
the LOC was not inside Pakistan as was
the body caught operation but that could
not be conducted because an Intel input
last minute indicated that that proposed
target which was a training camp for
terrorists had been mischievously
shifted just before the Parliament
attack and located between a hospital
and a school though Prime Minister watch
my did not agree because there would
have been massive collateral damage the
next thing that happened was the Cabinet
Committee on security met and decided
that we would mobilize for operations
but from a situation where the
Parliament attack took place within a
few hours orders were issued for
operation parekara as you look at in
hindsight that was not the finest hour
for the military because it cost us
bitterly it was a mandate given to the
Armed Forces to mobilize without a
clear-cut director without any clear-cut
petit she came in mind it was as the
government thought would be coercive
diplomacy in a muscular fashion but
unfortunately almost a year went past
but the armed forces mobilized sadly I
think May
have achieved its aim do you see these
are situations which we need to ponder
over history as a lot to tell us about
how we have handling terrorism that was
a brazen daylight terrorist attack on
the Indian Parliament on our own soil
and I knew it came from across the
border because terror is in the psyche
the political psyche of Pakistan more
than that their military the army which
controls the deep state in Pakistan
pause the shots and therefore we have to
be clear in our mind that they are the
ones who are wanting to avenge the
humiliation of the 1971 war they
received at the Indian Armed Forces we
got to keep all this in mind when we
look at the further course of action
this could escalate because we are faced
with a bunch of crazy genders across the
border you mustn't forget that they
activated the teller ranges during the
Kargil war general Malik knows this much
by deftly handled the situation and
called the blood
of those generals I'm sure even the
president government has called the
bluff of thee of their nuclear threats
from across the border the one has to
even praise the president government for
the action it has taken very decisive
that's the way our how I look at this
overall yes situation today general
Malek during the Cargill operation
during Operation Vijay
the then Prime Minister shall be
re-watch if I decided that our Air Force
will not cross the line of control and
will stay on our side of the line of
control do you believe that this
government's decision to allow an
airstrike and we've never allowed an
airstrike of this kind in the past or to
Commission an airstrike of this kind is
in credit to this government yes I think
so
you know I must tell you that during
Kargil war we had at one time asked the
CCS the Cabinet Committee on security to
allow the Air Force to cross the line of
control to be able to engage the enemy
targets better but we were told no you
cannot do that
so we had to follow that I believe that
the present action that has been taken
by the government to go across and
strike the terrorist camp is definitely
not only taking greater risk but also
shows the boldness the determination of
our government you know Faye you asked
me earlier you asked a question very
relevant and very important question how
do we proceed further after what has
happened till now and Wing Commander
urban and then has come back let me give
you my own
impression on the whole thing that
getting these organizations Joshi
Muhammad then lashkar-e-taiba or their
leaders banned or imprisoned or banking
entirely on diplomatic channels asking
the United Nations Security Council and
other friends to take action against
Pakistan is not going to end the proxy
war that has been going on by the deep
state for such a long time we have to
fight our own battle against these
people because this is for them a cheap
way of undermining our stability in our
country so as far as I am concerned I
foresee a sustained operation of the
kind that we have carried out so far
greater determination greater resilience
and being prepared to strike not once
but maybe again and again the Pakistani
targets we have to ultimately bend the
Pakistani deep state the army into
believing that we are going to cause
greater harm to them and their
countrymen and then their work they have
been doing it so it is a sustained
operation and it requires a greater
amount of determination resoluteness and
honing all the instruments that are
available with the government the
diplomatic side the economic squeeze and
of course the Armed Forces whenever they
are required to carry out action so it's
a long-drawn affair and we have to be
prepared for this write up quickly or
taking the question also to admiral
kumar do you agree that we would need a
sustained operation and multiple strikes
of the kind we saw last week i entire
with the general wait Malik Faye this
calls for extreme resonance we have to
brace ourselves the whole nation has to
brace itself because terrorism did the
army its handmaiden the ISI and it's
strange bedfellows that Josh and the
Luxur and others and it's they are Hydra
headed monsters David have to be kept
under control this is a war on terror
yes and we have to brace ourselves for
considerable time to come because now
that we have started it and very
correctly so we have taken the bull by
the horns and we carry must not give up
the operation now must be on full alert
must carry on this is the well started
operation well done and it must carry on
must brace ourselves for it our chief
marshal major I have a different
question for you and I want to introduce
this to the panel right now there's a
careful balance and between politician
bureaucrat and the forces and gentlemen
like yourselves in the positions where
you're making decisions with within that
balance for your teams and for the men
who serve in your teams the question of
budgets equipment acquisition files that
perhaps bureaucrats are not moving as
fast enough that I do realize becomes
frustrating for all the politicians
right now who are taking credit for work
done by the forces would you rather they
pay closer attention to moving those
files and pushing decisions that may be
good for the forces instead hey that's
every uniformed man and woman's dream
that files will fast and you get what
you need faster but having said that you
know III look at it in a broad broader
perspective if you were to look at any
force in the world all Armed Forces
modernization sustenance their equipment
their Manning always has happens in
stages it doesn't happen the way we in
uniform wanted to happen and there is a
reason for that because everything that
happens in the Armed Forces also depends
on the cost to the nation but having
said that what is very very essential
and required in our context is that
there has to be a more proactive
approach from the support agencies
working for the Armed Forces or
supervising the Armed Forces from the
Defense Ministry and that needs to be a
greater you know coordination between
the Armed Forces and the Ministry of
Defence there have been many many papers
written on how well to bring this about
but very little has happened on ground
and I do hope that this government pays
a little more attention to that so that
your acquisitions your you know
retirement benefits your everything that
happens in the Armed Forces
gets a fillip and moves faster than what
it is at presently it was certainly
general monocoque comments is well on
the politician bureaucrat balance with
the armed forces and also while the
three of you represent our armed forces
there's the paramilitary that has a
completely different battle right now
for pension and health insurance and you
know more basic things that they are not
right they're not receiving your view on
how you'd want politicians right now who
are taking credit to put more effort
into those matters hey I think I'll take
your question in three parts the first
part is regarding the modernization of
the forces as well as adequacy of
weapons and equipment that the
three forces three services need
generally we have a formula of 30%
equipment which is comparatively old
vintage another 30% equipment which is
has seen good days but it is not
state-of-the-art I would say call it
mature equipment and the 30% is
state-of-the-art not we have to retain a
balance of these three types of
equipment and weapons that we have got
there is also the problem of inadequacy
and for a sustained action and for
capability of guitarists we require
adequate weapon systems and equipment in
under these three category that is the
first part for which as a chief marshal
major has said we need that files to
should move much faster than they have
been doing till now the second part is
regarding the civil military divide
absolutely it is something which people
have been demanding because we feel that
in today's environment strategic
environment you need much closer
interaction between the political
authority and the military leaders
you also need frequent more frequent
consultation so that they can keep each
other informed of what may happen in a
short time the world or the conflict
situation moves very fast these days and
thirdly I believe it is also economical
and it will create the right kind of
synergy that is required the joint men
shape as well as taking help of all
other ministries in time so that civil
military relations can be improved only
we have an integrated Ministry of
Defence and we are not dependent only on
the are talking to the political
authority through the bureaucrats that
is need to be that needs to be sorted
out and that we have been demanding for
a long
I'm including the requirement of a CD s
because once you have that things
probably will we all feel that things
will move much faster so there is a
problem in civil-military relations
which should be improved and the third
part you said regarding the paramilitary
forces look there is no doubt that they
are doing they are engaged heavily in
our internal security duties they
require good equipment they require good
training they require good leaders and
of course we have to look after their
welfare and morale so whatever is their
demand in terms of pension or in terms
of that must be looked at
sympathetically by the government of
India I am NOT trying to compare them
with our I think it is not a correct
thing to do but keeping these aspects in
mind we must look after their as I said
training their morale their service
conditions etc absolutely admiral kumar
i have been told by several people that
you are not an officer to pull your
punches you like to tell it as it is
there currently several cases of
litigation on in courts in supreme
courts and high courts but the
government themselves are fighting their
own officers questions like nff you for
example or other appeals of pension
appeals of compensation whether the
government commissioned lawyers are
fighting against retired officers also
if I were to read out from the Standing
Committee on defense it says very
clearly that the budgetary allocations
barely account for inflation and does
not even cater to the GST that the armed
forces have to pay when they acquire
various things that they are falling
shot the same the budget leaves us with
no choice but to either reprioritize
reduce our requirement as far as
security is concerned or to go slow on
acquisition is there a message you want
to send to the politicians today about
what the forces really need well faith
my co-panelists a chief marshal
poly major and general Malek a very
concisely explained what our thoughtful
and inadequacies are militarily in
equipment but I would like to just some
of this with one simple quotation from a
very well-known poet Rudyard Kipling who
mentioned sadly in times of war and not
before God and soldier we all adore but
when war is over and all things righted
God is forgotten and the soldier
slighted that is the sad truth and the
military understands this the best today
it is all about fighting terror and it
is the military that has to face the
flag hopefully the political
masters and the bureaucracy but remember
this moment
they must not forget what we have passed
through thank you said one quick
question I will smuggle in Air Chief
Marshal we lost 40 Jevons at 40 officers
at Pulwama and that was heavily written
about and talked about what we've lost
20 others from the paramilitary and the
military since then in encounters and in
other in other activities at the border
including one mi-17 helicopter that went
down with five Air Force officers on it
you commanded the mi-17
at various points in your career these
accidents that take the lives of our Air
Force officers are they avoidable should
we be able to do better here or
critically to avoid these accidents in
terms of equipment in terms of being
able to give our officers the very best
absolutely free I mean unfortunately the
the month of February has been very bad
for the Air Force as far as accidents
are concerned but in this business of
military aviation accidents to take
place sometimes at the wrong time or
they pile up very close to each other
that's a different issue but coming to
the main issue of equipment and the
quality of aeroplanes and you know what
we need to do most certainly we you see
the aerospace today revolves around
technology and technology in fusion in
the aerospace sector especially military
aviation is extremely important and you
know so far
well like general Malik had very clearly
brought out as to what should be our
technology levels in the Armed Forces 30
30 40
it's an it's today a pipedream as far as
we are concerned because we don't have
the basic defense industrial base
available in our country the kind we
should have to remain self sustained in
all our military and hardware and
software that is the unfortunate part
because we depend a lot sentencing
almost 60 70 percent of our equipment is
important until such time we bring that
down which will facilitate cost to the
nations to improve it's going to be very
very tough to maintain this technology
levels what we just spoke about but
having said that there are ways and
means to do this to improve the you know
it's it's just not the machine it's even
the man who counts a hell of a lot
because after all you may get the finest
technology in the world it's converted
into a capability by humans and
therefore it's a continuous process of
men machines and technology infusion at
a at a rate to keep up with your likely
adversaries and to keep up with how well
they are equipping themselves now that
is a issue which needs to be discussed
not in this debate but in perhaps 10
other debates to come to some kind of
conclusion
well that's very well said and
unfortunately we've run out of time
gentlemen this has been a complete honor
to spend an hour with the three of you
having this conversation and I'm sure my
audience has appreciated your time just
as much as I have thank you for being so
generous with your time this evening
and I do promise that we will have more
conversations conversations about NF fu
conversations about equipment about
budgets about what the forces really
need to help the larger part of India
understand what soldiers actually go
through on that note if you have
questions feel free to get in touch with
us here on mirror now and we'll bring
your questions forward the idea
obviously along with the fact that we
bring you information is to be able to
help us all understand
the compulsions and the situations and
the conditions under which our officers
and our forces are currently working

the meeting called by the Organization

minister Saud Mehmood Qureshi has said
that he will not attend the meeting in

Sushma Swaraj is attending as a guest of
honor meanwhile Sushma Swaraj has
reached Abu Dhabi where the meeting is
scheduled to take place it is for the
first time that India has been invited
there as a guest of honor my colleague
Meenakshi in oranges on the phone line
right now Meenakshi this this news just
came in that Pakistan is decided to skip
that meeting altogether what is the
significance right now of of Pakistan's
decision to skip the meeting and what
are you picking up from your sources at
the MA
when Larry you know this is usually
interesting on one hat we have Pakistan
wanting to act statesmen like and on the
other this is juvenile posturing coming
in of course we ignored for a fair bit
of time that Pakistan was mighty upset
at the guest of honor status being
accorded to External Affairs Minister of
India Sushma Swaraj
but to indict me pull out of this
meeting how will that sink in is
something which will have implications
for Pakistan because India by sending
Sushma Swaraj has demonstrated as to how
it is completely open to engaging with
the Islamic world and as I remember
Pakistan's act is coming in the backdrop
also His Highness Sheikh Abdullah bin
Zayed Al Nahyan
who is also the foreign minister of UAE
imploring both the countries to engage
in more dialogue and act wisely so
clearly this is something which a
Pakistan is demonstrating to the OIC
to showcase that it is upset at India
being accorded the guest of honor status
and this is happening when the epital
supreme commander of the UAE forces has
personally implored by calling the prime
ministers of both India and Pakistan
just Thursday fee and despite that this
act of Pakistan are categorically this
juncture appears to be very unstable
like as Meenakshi

Et5-Jxp-E_E,"Diplomats briefed on Ind-Pak situation, Pak PM Imran assures release of Indian pilot | India United",Pakistan has set the release of Indian Air Force wing commander Abhinandan. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has said that ...,2019-02-28T17:32:26Z,MIRROR NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Et5-Jxp-E_E/hqdefault.jpg,"Pakistan has apparently said that the
pilot release will be a peace gesture
the pakistan Prime Minister him Imran
Khan said the Indian Air Force pilot
will be released tomorrow we know that
this will be a massive reason for a sigh
of relief across the country for people
who are very concerned about the
well-being of wing commander a beam and
then but he will be released confirmed
by the Pakistan Prime Minister tomorrow
and this is this is I mean we were
talking this entire morning about
conditions that Pakistan wanted to place
India put out and India standing its
ground very clearly saying we will not
accept any conditions at all Pakistan
obviously is buckled now and said that
we will release him as a piece gesture
so really what Pakistan wants right now
is to deescalate the situation and this
is perhaps the best way to do that this
is information that's coming in Imran
Khan has made the statement saying the
Indian Air Force pilot
Wing Commander been and then who was
captured by Pakistan yesterday and has
been in custody of Pakistan since then
will be released tomorrow he has made
this announcement Parliament which is
very important he has said that they
will release him and they will release
him as a peace gesture of Anitha values
with me in the studio Vinay this is
extremely important this means that the
hardline that the our Ministry of
External Affairs had taken saying that
we will not negotiate with you has paid
off absolutely it's absolutely paid off
and it also tells you that the
international pressure on Pakistan has
also been a factor behind them realizing
the dangers and the damages of
continuing to hold him hostage and the
fact that he was you know there's been
universal condemnation of what Pakistan
did and support for what India did but
stands isolation has also played a big
role in that and I think the Indian
government's consistent position on not
negotiating I think even though if you
remember the Pakistanis did try that
saturation his comment earlier in the
day did talk about we will do it if it
brings down an escalation that was
conditional but I think the Indian
response about no conditions no deal
nothing you have to release him without
any conditions has paid off and it paid
off massively but I also want to look at
this portion of the comment that Imran
Khan is made which is that the release
will be a peace gesture so what he's
saying effectively is that he wants to
deescalate from here he doesn't
is going any further one is the
escalation for sure it will start this
wind is certainly Dias Lee the situation
but I think this is more of trying to
score a brownie point you know he's just
trying to pretend that also the reason
behind using this terminology is because
they want to have an immoral upper
ground in saying oh we did it because we
wanted peace so this is also positioning
but the fact of the matter is that this
has been done because they've realized
there is known maneuvering space for
Pakistan anymore and they are in no
position to actually carry out any kind
of a negotiation or to attempt a quid
pro quo from the Indian side because the
insight is extremely clear about about
releasing the man really living
commander unconditionally oh let me just
read out some of the statements that are
coming in at this point and I'll read
out you know Prime Minister Imran Khan
has said he tried to call Indian Prime
Minister Narendra Modi on the phone
because escalation is not on in our
interest or in India's interest I wonder
if that call didn't go through because
network has been so bad lately but to
say that he tried to call this goes
against what we know about you know
bilateral conversations they don't
happen and we sound like you pick up the
phone and attempt to dial ya know so I
think what he meant was that they have
sent a message to the Indian access
office that they want to talk but it has
not happened yet but I mean I think they
were trying to say that the message that
has been sent was sent because we wanted
this to de-escalate that's and he also
says and this is from PTV News official
from their verified account they're
quoting the Prime Minister he said in
our desire for peace I announced that
tomorrow as a first step to open
negotiations Pakistan will be releasing
the Indian Air Force officer in our
custody to nations with weapons of mass
destruction should not divulge on the
path of war I seek peace with India he
goes on to say I addressed the Indian
government do not force us for
retaliation
we are prepared for any eventuality and
response I beseech India not to force us
down the path of war he goes on to say
the mughal emperor bahadur shah zafar
chose to live in bondage Tipu Sultan
chose to die free the hero of Pakistan
is difficult and that's actually not
connected to anything else in any way
sorry random sort of PostScript
attachment to make to that statement but
to examine a couple of things that he
said our first step to open negotiations
he's used the word dialogue he's used to
word negotiation he's used to what let's
talk about it a lot does this mean
anything no it doesn't because I'll tell
you why because he is addressing his own
constituency right now in the Parliament
he's talking he there is a very
belligerent opposition that was already
gunning for him yes he's facing a
problem from within Pakistani people as
well the only slight handle that they
got was a ring commander a bit and
thence capture this was the only talking
point they perhaps got a little some
extent but the fact of the matter is he
said this all this is about addressing
is unconsciously he's trying to position
himself as somebody who was interested
in peace and trying to portray as if
India's the country which is expecting a
war yes which is pushing for war and
he's begging us reasonable major-general
PK circle is with us mr. general Hagel
obviously this is good news for all of
us who sort of had most of our thoughts
on wing commander pin and then and we
wanted him to come home his family is
going to be so relieved as well that he
is going to come home but the rest of
the statements being made by Pakistan
saying that we're releasing him as a
peace gesture we are releasing him as
our attempt to open negotiations what is
your response to that Pakistan has been
forced to make the statement primarily
because they were isolated there's huge
international pressure and India taken
up a very strong stance that there's
going to be no quid pro quo and there's
going to be no change in our stance that
there'll be no regulations whatsoever no
conditions will be acceptable and
Pakistan has clearly understood that
India's meaning business under the
circumstances I think it is a very fair
statement from Pakistan that we go to
release him tomorrow without any
conditions there'd be a huge jubilation
within within our country and I am very
certain this gesture of Pakistan will
not go unnoticed
it is bound bound bound to the our
carrot-and-stick policy will stand
further vindicated yes and of course
these stands that were taken by India
mediator of cycle where we said that we
will not we will not budge we will not
negotiate this is not room for
negotiation there will be no conditions
on the release of wind command appeal
and then all of those or stands have
also come through because the Ministry
of External Affairs did not blink they
were clear about what India stand was on
this in this psychological war between
India and Pakistan India India did not
drink but Pakistan is has actually come
down by several notches they will have
to compromise as far as the Indian
minimum bottom line is concerned we have
clearly indicated that we are not
against talks but for talks they have to
create a conducive climate and what does
that conducive environment climate we
said Pakistan must not allow its soil to
be used for terrorism or terrorist
activities against India secondly they
must stop cross-border violations
they've got to stop ceasefire violations
and they've got to make sure that
transparent action is taken against
Masood Azhar against lockrey and against
Hafiz say the perpetrators of Mumbai
petramco tannery unless and until this
is done
India is not willing to talk under any
circumstances
this is our never negotiating position
and Pakistan is getting the basis that
India is a different India under the
present dispensation as against the
India in the past had we taken similar
steps after the Mumbai yes
I think perhaps the situation would have
never come to such a pass we wouldn't
have suffered at the ends of Pakistan
for so many years we lost so many you
know sent lace because this gave rise to
Pakistan's terrorism because Pakistan
always took it for granted that ideas
are soft straight any other weeks late
India's a Banana Republic and can be
played around this government is very
clearly indicated that our patience has
come to an end and hereafter we make it
meaning total business and we go to
enforce the rules strongly in our hands
the narrative is change the strategies
change absolutely and I suppose you know
this is what it means when you're in a
conflict of any sort to the the the mood
changes constantly and you know the
one-upmanship is are constantly on at
this point India is in a position of
power just like Major General Zeng Kyle
told us who do you think Vinny now at
this point India has several options
before it will it consider saying you
know what you want to sit and talk this
is these are our demands and that's when
we will sit and talk at this point what
are India's options well actually to be
honest now that the Prime Minister of
Pakistan has announced this release the
real diplomatic government-level mind
will the real issue or the real tackling
will begin from tomorrow
once Wing Commander have been and then
is back on Indian soil safely with us
and with our authorities this is where
the real push and the diplomacy the
diplomatic efforts will start because in
many ways it is now up to India to lay
down the policy for future for good this
whole this small little blip in the
radar of what them having when it
matters now out of the equation yes now
Pakistan is attempting and pretending to
be a peace-loving country who's trying
to talk to India and contain terror in
all of that does India fall into this
pretension yet again or does India say
enough we've heard enough of these
pieces versus from you we've already
enough about we are serious about terror
it from you and we don't believe you
anymore and we will continue to maintain
a hard-line position of every time if
you do something like this we will go in
and hit your telecoms that is when the
real policy continuity of policy
initiative and the intent will come out
and I think that is why this is a very
turning point day in many
tomorrow because post tomorrow Union
government will perhaps open up its mind
on whether we want to continue with this
or we really want to go back to the
talking table so to speak in terms of
dealing with Pakistan right so this is
an opportunity for India to lay down the
rules for the future you don't want to
lose an opportunity like this you know
where you can actually drive home the
point and we've been talking about this
for the last 24 hours
that basically it's going to be
important at this point to make sure
that we solve the problem for the
long-term and we don't allow the
terrorism to sort of begin breeding
again absolutely so the first turning
point came when Indians Indian Air Force
went inside ball court they broke that
self-appointed line of restraint where
they said we would not cross over the
LOC we did we hit their target he did
well and came back the second big
initiative of the first game big point
was the union's very categorically said
that this was an act against terror it
was not an acting as the military it was
not an act against the civilians we are
targeting terror and we will we have
every right to do that in self-defense
so we've already broken one barrier
after that now with Pakistan being
economically at its weakest militarily
having to face a problem from three
borders remember they have a serious
problem because of Iranian border they
have a problem understand and now we
have India and international isolation
of Pakistan obviously now means that
this is and then now then blinking over
releasing Wing Commanders and then
without any condition as the Indians
wanted gives the option government an
opportunity to now drive at home to
drive at home and that will be the big
question of how how India drives at home
from here on I mean actually joins us
around my colleague in Delhi mean
actually what can you tell us at this
point about information you're picking
up from the Ministry of External Affairs
on the conversations or any sort of
response that India will make to the
Pakistan prime minister who's just
spoken in their Parliament well our you
know Faye this very important meet which
will be addressed by the three service
chiefs later in the evening today
already has a very very happy beginning
to it we have good news coming in from
the government of Pakistan and this is
happening in the face offer no-nonsense
policy being adopted by the government
of
we're today MEA sources clearly
reiterated as to how there is going to
be absolutely no deal making into the
release of Wing Commander AB in London
and that despite that we are hearing
this statement come in from Pakistan a
prime minister Imran Khan just making
that announcement a short while back as
to how he is seeing this as move towards
peace and he hopes that this will lead
to a further de-escalation but very
quickly some perspective for our viewers
this was building up since early morning
today fair remember their foreign
minister Qureshi a little earlier before
these announcements from a pakistani
prime minister came about in the second
half of the day in the morning there
were indications as to how the Pakistani
Foreign Minister was communicating the
desire of the Pakistani Prime Minister
about releasing the captain Avena Wing
Commander Abin and then and how they
were making attempts to perhaps consider
seeing the conducive atmosphere to have
a conversation with Indian Prime
Minister Narendra Modi that conversation
of course according to the Pakistani
Prime Minister has not did not take
place because he made some attempts to
call Indian Prime Minister last evening
which could not fructify but that apart
this is a very very important shot in
the arm for India given the fact that
the eyes of the international community
are on India and also on Pakistan and
for Pakistan this is also another
opportunity which the Pakistani Prime
Minister through his own speech he is
highlighting that the intention of
Pakistan is to not engage in continued
heightened tensions with India but
rather focus on the path to peace so
again the three service chiefs briefing
today which is slated for a little later
in the evening already has a big happy
beginning to it being commander Abin and
then all said to be brought home
tomorrow fee well I mean come on Robert
Annan said to be brought home tomorrow
we understand prabhu there else on the
phone line
mr. Dayal thank you for joining us on
the phone line we were discussing this a
couple of hours ago that India was
digging its heels in
you know standing its ground saying we
will not negotiate
obviously that stand has now paid off
well first of all let me say that I am
NOT just relieved I'm absolutely
delighted that Wing Commander a Bandhan
has been released because every Indian
was worried about the sort of treatment
that was being meted out to him there
were lots of questions being raised and
lots of things being discussed my
estimation and regard for Imran Khan has
gone up a thousand times I always had a
huge amount of admiration for his
cricketing abilities and I think that he
had also shown a large man and
leadership qualities he operating under
a lot of pressure there are of course
all sorts of signs that he is just the
puppet of the army but I have no doubt
that Imran Khan stand when this
development is very clear because he I
think has gone out of his way to perhaps
could use the army to talk to the other
segments of Pakistani society when there
was a new lighten that he is going to be
talking to our prime minister I had an
inkling that probably he just wants to
break some good news otherwise why would
he be become picking up the telephone to
talk to Prime Minister Modi they may
also have been other factors that play
the Americans were trying to intervene
there were other mediators that
go-betweens
but all said and done this is a good
development now what should we do I
think we should all should be responsive
you know there will be many occasions
when tensions between India and Pakistan
have skyrocketed you would recall that
in 1987 there was a lot of tension over
operation brasstacks and it was almost
as if the two countries were going to
war then president Lian has paid a
surprise visit to Delhi and also went to
Jaipur to watch the cricket match but
that one guess
depleted the entire attention balloon
that had started moving before everybody
and helped to deescalate tensions I
think in Rankin gesture of releasing our
fighter pilot I think is a very high
order and India must also be responsive
must welcome of course there are lots of
problems in our relationship nature very
funny relationship you can see many ups
and downs but it is important to try and
iron things out and this is a welcome
development I would like our government
to take a positive note of it and to
respond suitably what are the options
before India rights now obviously and
and Pakistan has said it's not once but
twice the amount and I said we want to
do this as a beginning of a dialogue we
urge India not to go down the path of
war we want to begin conversation so
what are the options before India at
this point well and the options are to
persuade Pakistan to engage in a
dialogue with the view to clamping down
on terror
emanating from Pakistan you know in the
longer term it is in our interest that
we get Pakistan's cooperation to
eliminate the sort of outfits which
operate from within Pakistan and which
are even beginning to hurt Pakistan
itself Pakistani society has been
derailed on account of extremist Islamic
outfits which are operating there in
just a few months ago after the Supreme
Court had passed a judgement acquitting
hacia baby in the blasphemy case jihadi
Alfred's extremist outfits that that
area labaik
had taken to the streets and blockaded
roads rocketed trafficking brought life
to a standstill
the government had to capitulate and the
government was not at all happy that it
had to cave in to the demands of the
extremists
these people had passed a sort of a
 against the judges of the Supreme
Court including the ones who had
pronounced the judgement acquitting
hacia babies and the Supreme Court had
to intervene and say that all these
 will be regarded as illegal now
it is probably something that we ought
to realize that Pakistan is undergoing a
very difficult phase and that the Prime
Minister of Pakistan is facing an uphill
task to bring things to normalcy they
are facing a very difficult economic
situation but more significantly they
are facing a very difficult internal
political situation of course the army
is standing against couple of things I
just want to bring in we're getting more
information we understand he would be
released at the Warka border that's
information that's just coming in ring
commander beam and then will be released
at the varga border the Prime Minister
is likely to address the country shortly
our prime minister was likely to address
the country shortly and that something
would be looking forward to and this is
what you were talking about when I that
they will put out details of which
border he would be brought to and what
that exchange the nature of that
exchange will be like as well yes so
when flight left in nachiket that was
captured during the Kargil the
International Red Cross is Pakistan
division was actually the agency which
reached to receive him first so the
first contact between Ana Chiquita and
the somebody else apart from the
Pakistani military was actually the
International Red Cross people he and
the Red Cross along with the Pakistani
security officers escorted him till the
Wagah border then he was taken across
the border put on a special plane then
brought to Delhi and he did it I think
he reached at around 10:30 at night the
plane reached it not in very night
because these things get a little
delayed at the border but yes there is a
precedence of that happening via the
Wagah border and that's perhaps what is
going to happen today official well we
also perhaps need to look at some of the
other things that have been said by
Prime Minister Imran Khan in his
Parliament and although some of it like
you said needs to be taken with a pinch
of salt because he is addressing his own
country at this point he's trying to
pacify his own opposition he uses the
word peace and awful lot sometimes twice
in one sentence so it's obviously
something he's trying to drive anything
don't you know force our efforts to
don't see our efforts to de-escalate as
weakness and Pakistan is deeply engaged
in peace process in Afghanistan just
like that we are deeply engaged and
invested in the peace process with India
but I must tell you this that I have
very very deep disagree with mr. Prabhu
there I mean he's been a very respected
diplomat as I don't want to counter him
on diplomacy yes but in in honest
assessment of Imran Khan I have
absolutely deep disagreements with him
and I'll tell you why yes he was a great
cricketer and all of us perhaps once
upon a time sorry you obviously keep
coming back to that India as a cricket
loving nation perhaps because I'll tell
you why I see some of that romanticize
exactly I do believe that a large part
of India has this romantic notion about
Imran Khan the man with the flowing
locks he's not the same guy and I can
guarantee you this mr. Prabhu the odds
interpretation of this is that Imran
Khan's it is his personal initiative
which is led to him announcing he's just
the face there is no question that he
has said so if the army was not in
agreement with it I cannot believe that
him nan Khan has taken a decision to
release ring commander of in and then
without the army and I say being on
board they are not going to let him
survive for a month if he is taken
decision against their advice so there
is this is clearly has been done after
has being discussed with the Pakistani
army Armed Forces and the ISI and it's
seconds it's a decision it's a strategic
decision his repeated use of the word
peace frankly is as old a bogey as we've
seen for the last four or five heads of
state that they've had whether it was
NEBOSH theory which was Musharraf is
also spoken peace I mean a man who
attacked India has also spoken about
peace he's also spoken about talks he
came to Agra to do us free stop talk and
we all know what happened in the agora
cemetery I mean what are all disaster
that was so do we do we have the sound
bite from the pakistan Prime Minister
and I think that we could play it
because just lay that out please

Bell again
well that was just the short you know
about it but we must remember and we
must remind our viewers the vilest
announcement is made we have to hold our
horses a little bit until a banana is
safely on Indian soil so while this is a
moment of relief and we are all grateful
and happy that he's going to be back
home let's treat this also with some
level of you know calm and you make sure
the idea is really that things stay the
way they are until tomorrow when he does
come home yes and also because
personally if you ask me I don't have
any trust of I don't have any faith in
personally they can go back onwards way
too quickly I although I can't believe
that if after Primus is announced do it
in the middle of a parliament session to
his people he would go back on that but
yes you're right I think once till he
comes back we should hold our horses a
bit yes in fact we understand that the
briefing right now the of the three
armed forces will also begin push anyone
to begin at 5:00 p.m. they since this
information has just come in they might
have had to revise a little bit of what
they're saying otherwise it's unlikely
that anyone from the armed forces would
be six minutes late for later so there
would be people already assembled in the
Ministry of Defence waiting for that you
know for our press conference to begin
about six minutes late on that press
conference but I'm assuming they're
working in details of a bananas release
Wing Commander be London's release who
is now going to come home to a hero's
welcome yes he's a hero for sure there's
no question about that he's India 0
irrespective of anything that may have
happened he's an absolute hero and the
fact that there is enough evidence and
more that he shot down an f-16 as well
he's done something which frankly has
not happened in a long long time I mean
we've not had a dogfight midair as a war
scenario for a long long time you know
there was this question and I suppose
it's safe to ask this question now and
there were some people who asked to
people like herself perhaps were
familiar with with what the ammunition
and the equipment that the Indian Air
Force has why was he chasing an f16 with
a mig-21 there is a there is a
misunderstanding on that I think people
haven't understood the mid-20 ones
Bisons
which are the upgraded version of the
mig-21 they are not exactly the Metra
demons of what we know
absolu bison is a more advanced plane
which has been retrofitted with great
much newer avionics much better payloads
and much better capabilities so it's not
that it's a bison is a very trusted part
of the Union force that is one to also
remember that your there are formations
and different kinds of planes are
located in different air bases which one
scrambles first also depends upon how
closest he is to the scene of the car
yes yes so but bison is not an equal
plane yes and also people who said that
oh you know what you don't want him you
don't want them chasing or dogfighting
in a Sukhoi or in a mirage because
they're too expensive it's not bad at
all but I think the I think the the the
the amazing thing is that we you know
even in Cargill there was no dogfight
because it was really the efforts was
doing being used only for bombing
operations and that is pretty much what
most Air Force is now do I used for now",True,en,223,0,0

like we're gonna stab with that visual
but it does seem that that press
conference has ended that was the
evidence presented it was a joint press
conference from the three services the
army the Navy and the Air Force it is
not usual that we see such a joint
conference addressed to joint media
briefing by the Army Navy and the Air
Force just to go over what was said the
Air Force spoke first it they mentioned
the fact that on the 27th of February at
about 10 o clock it was detected that a
large package of Pakistan Air Force had
breached India's airspace they were
flying at various levels Indian Air
Force responded promptly and in a timely
fashion we scrambled our sequoias our
MiG's and mirages in response the
Pakistani Air Force was intercepted the
Pakistani aircraft then turned around
their attack had been foiled Pakistani
Air Force was unable to cause any damage
they had been and this is an interesting
piece they had been targeting
specifically Indian military
installations one f-16 was shot down by
the Indian Air Force we in process in
this we know lost one mig-21 bison the
parachutes the mig-21 bison pilot a beam
and then as we know Wing Commander beam
and then parachuted into the Pakistan
Occupied Kashmir the Air Force then went
went on to dismantle some of the claims
that have been made by Pakistan as as
untruths or lies said that they
initially said the two of our craft had
shot died had been shot down that is not
true the Pakistan side also said that no
f-16s were used at all that is again not
true and the evidence of which you can
see on your screen right now the piece
that's being held up at this point is a
piece of ammunition which we understand
are we being told is called an Amram
this Amram can only be loaded and flown
on an f-16 the air force also saying
that the that every aircraft has an
electronic signature and the air force
has the ability to tell what aircraft
was flying and they know that f-16s were
in fact flying and Pakistan had targeted
our military installations and that
remains the most important part of that
press conference it also went on to say
that the air force remains vigilant and
is always ready for any sort of action
that comes from Pakistan side the army
then spoke and said in response to the
counter terror strike starting the 26th
of February 5:00 p.m. and then through
the night after that there were constant
cease fire violations from the Pakistani
side it went on to the 27th of february
where pakistan air force targeted
military bases a pricket base logistics
defense establishments the army
maintains we understand strict vigil on
the ground and in air defense and it is
constantly alert it has you know
mechanized forces that are on standby
and despite the turn of events and this
was an interesting thing the army said
that we are committed to peace in the
region and we will take action at anyone
who disturbs the peace and who has you
know designs of enemity towards India
Navy then spoken said the Navy has been
deployed on high alert on surface under
the sea and in the air and the it is
prepared to give a response resolute
response to Pakistan and any sort of
intrusion that comes from Pakistan at
which point there were the press
conference was opened to journalists who
asked questions they asked for example
if the armed forces viewed Pakistan's
action from the Pakistan Air Force as an
act of war that question quite frankly
was not answered very clearly and the
evidence that you see on your screen was
presented to the press in the studio
with me even a very even a very
interesting press conference several I
mean see this so the main points here
and there are smaller Easter eggs in
tone that we can pick on but the main
point here was the fact that Pakistan
did target military establishments and
our armed forces are on high a lot they
remain on high alert in spite of the
fact that Imran Khan has made what he
called a gesture of peace yes and I
think that day - eating the release of
wind commander bobbin and then from the
overall security situation I think
they've made it very clear that there is
their the only thing they said is
they're happy that our officer is coming
back and they've left it at that I mean
this is unconnected according to the
Indian Armed Forces at least and that
they will remain in the state of
alertness they will continue to remain
the vigilant in fact they even said
something operationally small but very
significant they even said that our
mechanized units are on standby no
that's that's
mechanized infantry czar pretty like the
army of course has an infantry division
they also have the artillery division
that is also mechanised division which
is the heavy and so on and so forth now
if they put that on standby it's sending
out a message that listen we are
prepared to go the whole hog and
mechanized infantry is is mobilized only
during situations like this when there
is a very serious worry of a conflict
you know it's very interesting that the
Navy was part of this press briefing and
India has an extremely powerful Navy
that has in the past in the history of
the two countries banished to bring
Pakistan to its knees so for the Navy to
come out and say hey you know what we're
deployed on the surface under the sea
and in the air is a very clear message
that they're sending out to Pakistan
that well you know it's not just the
border we're talking about anymore when
deployed across the border yes and I
think we should you know let our viewers
know one other fact you know it's very
very uncommon for a try services joint
briefing I mean even during Kargil when
there was a daily briefing that was
happening in the South block the foreign
affairs folks person used to be
accompanied by one member of one of the
Armed Forces as it happened yesterday as
it happened yesterday they would very
rarely would you see or probably never
would you see all three sitting together
so it's very so this is a very different
matter from it's a departure also I mean
although it doesn't really matter but
for them to be addressing the media in
this manner where it's not in a
controlled environment it's not very
erotic services like it's not and i
think this was part of perhaps the
optics i think they just wanted to show
we are out there and you know it is not
confined to a room we're out there in
public in fact there is this whole
regalia of rush 51 and South look in the
back in the back there is interestingly
this one these are not the Chiefs these
are the second in Saigon
all three of them so initially we were
told the Chiefs the three service ships
would you know would address
media briefing which
has almost never happened before it's
never happened but all three not like
this not like this not like this but sir
and I think I have a feeling that was
also a bit of a strategic decision at
some stage that I think somebody
realized that it's better you don't have
the all three services you've seen
because look it was supposed to be a
press conference and the in press
conferences questions can get asked and
sometimes you know Flowage there may be
no answer so it's not sometimes
appropriate for the head of the
organization to be not answering certain
questions I guess yes and one journalist
quite aptly said you know your statement
was fairly cryptic and the statements
were cryptic cryptic but that's to be
expected I mean so the Armed Forces can
be speaking very openly they don't hold
press conscious barrier at all so
they're very reluctant actually in fact
the only I think people they are
slightly uncomfortable with his they
can't look at you look at some of the
but we can say are clues that were in
the conversation when asked you know do
you trust that he will be brought back
and do you you know do you see this as
peace are you going to deescalate as a
result he turned around and he said that
we see it as a gesture in line with the
GMO connection which means that this is
what Pakistan is supposed to do they're
not doing us any favors absolutely so
that's a very important input line and
it kind of completely demolishes what
Qureshi was saying in the afternoon
about linking it to if you're interested
in distillation we will send it back and
all of that so they are basically saying
boss this is something you're supposed
to do in any case yes expect anything
from us the second point he said but
when when a journalist asked him about
again
Wing Commander B then then he said we
are very happy that he's come he's going
to be brought home
we'd be happy when he comes home when he
is handed over to us then we will make
further statements absolute again there
is a certain amount of you know
yes Pakistan has made that announcement
but there is you know some mistrust
there mistrust and also lack of trust on
the way they they can always say
something I do something else
and also they absolutely ensure that
there was no display of a new excitement
or happiness it's busy life is business
like it's business like that once he
comes to us we will see how much or what
happens because usually when up there's
no water turns there is a very long
detailed debrief that happens so yes
he's the put through deeply varies asked
all kinds of things that have happened
there so obviously whether how well did
did him or not is a decision that can
only be taken once you've spoken to your
mind directly you can't rely on some
second and a third and information the
third point that I do want to bring up
is the bellacourt evidence of the
mission accomplished at Pala court at
which point the Air Force said that
obviously we have evidence to show that
the mission that was accomplished the
targets we had in mind were hit but it
will be the government's decision on
when and how they want to release that
evidence absolutely because look it's
very obvious that a strike of this level
would have been videographed by some by
a plane also there are these you know
cameras which are there in fighter jets
where the trajectory of the bomb and
other things are captured I mean there's
a capturing process that happens in
every plane those if your eggs are
available so obviously all of that is
available and much like what happened in
Murray the political leadership takes a
decision on when to release that kind of
an evidence
oh the evidence that has been provided
to the media again this is very unusual
for a you know for a piece of ammunition
to be you know held up like this in
front of the media
it's an Amram part of an AMRAP
apparently there can only be flown on an
f-16 proving that pakistan did in fact
use f-16s the air force also said that
we the air force has the ability to read
the electronic signatures of various
aircraft and be able to tell which
aircraft is flying into our space this
was in fact an f-16 how important is
this very important and actually Aram
Amram is actually a missile that
Pakistan purchased just about I think 10
years ago it was part of the f16 package
and a Amram actually is installed only
in the f-series so f16 f19 f23
they are installed only in that and when
you acquire a plane like f-16 the
ambulance eye comes as part of the
ammunitions package did you buy
alongside so yes they had taken an order
of 500 such amra missiles and there is
absolutely no doubt that AMRAAMs
are only carried by the f-16 so their
whole claim that the plane has not been
down has completely been demolished
because it's the big the question
obviously that we are going to ask now
is about de-escalation did was there any
suggestion at all that India is anywhere
close to the escalation didn't seem like
it at all not that day I think the I
think this question did get asked and
they indirectly and they kind of said
very clearly that look our job is to
ensure that our borders are safe the
citizens are safe and we will do
everything possible to ensure that and
all three services are united in that
whether it's sea land or air
so they didn't quite get into this
terminology of escalation and discretion
I think that's more of a political
terminology for an Army officer for a
services officer they will obviously not
use these terms I mean it's not about
this escalating escalating their job is
to protect the country and they will do
it to the best possible way depending on
the level of threat that level of threat
right now is high and hence they are at
forward positions they've been there
they've put their mechanized divisions
on standby and that means they are an
absolute hundred-percent readiness to
move at a short notice should Pakistan
try something more adventurous so what
according to you was the biggest
takeaway when you know from this press
conference other than the fact that it
was an unusual press conference what was
the message that India is sending out
right now
oh well messaging actually is one of the
big messages in that sense there the
decision to put the three services
together in a public press conference in
the evening is in itself a departure I
mean they could have issued a statement
and not done anything publicly and
that's actually every quanti the display
of evidence is again meant to drive home
the point on how repeatedly Pakistan or
habitually lies about things I mean you
know they keep pretending and claiming
things even in a situation like this
where there's incontrovertible evidence
and I think that was one of the points
that the services wanted to suggest that
they keep lying
they keep denying even as they level
charges and allegations against the
others the other big message was that
the Indian Armed Forces have sent a
message across that we are not relent on
anything we are there we will continue
to be there we have kept everything that
we have at our command on standby and we
are ready at a very short notice to come
back and repulse you the third take away
the big tip occur is they have
officially an on record confirmed at
Pakistan attacked our military
installations remember the last
statement came from the MEA this is now
come from the Army yes they also
confirmed that they dropped their
payload within the Indian military
compound so the target was Jamnagar in
that sense yes and they did drop that
payload wouldn't they come out obviously
didn't damage anything so that is now
enforces confirmation if we can play out
some of the some bites from that press
conference which our viewers have just
joined us and they wanted to listen in
this is what the Air Force statement was
for today Pakistan army first resorted
to unprovoked ceasefire violations as
you are aware in sunder Bani rimbor gali
no sheera and krishna gotti sectors on
26th February with effects from five
o'clock in the evening and again during
the night
this was responded to by the Indian Army
in a befitting an appropriate manner as
my F was counterpart has elaborated on
27th February 19 the Pakistan Air Force
attempted to target our military
establishments in J&K specifically they
targeted a brigade headquarter a
battalion headquarter our defenses and a
logistic installation however given the
high level of preparedness along the
line of control and the immediate and
punitive response given by our own
forces the Pakistani Air Force's designs
were foiled I wish to assure the nation
that we are fully prepared and in a
heightened state of readiness to respond
to any provocation by Pakistan on 27th
February 2019 at around ten hundred us
Indian Air Force readers detected a
large package of Pakistan Air Force
aircraft heading towards the Indian
Territory towards general area jungle
they breached the Indian airspace west
of Raj ori in the Sooner bonnie area I
have fighters including mig-21 bison
Sukhoi 30 MK and Mirage 2000 who were
tasked to intercept the including
Pakistan Air Force aircraft the Pakistan
Air Force aircraft attempting to target
our military installations were
intercepted by the IAF fighter aircraft
which foiled their attack
although PF bombs have fallen in the
indian army formation compounds however
they were unable to cause any damage to
our military installations in the aerial
combat that ensued one f-16 of Pakistan
Air Force was shot down by an if' mig-21
bison aircraft the f16 crashed and fell
across the line of control in Pakistan
Occupied Japan Kashmir the IAF lost one
mig-21 in the aerial engagement and
though the pilot ejected safely the his
parachute drifted into the Pakistan
occupied jnk where he was taken into
custody by the Pakistan Army there have
been many factually incorrect statements
that have been made by Pakistan the
first blatant disinformation was the two
IAF aircraft were shot down by Pakistan
and three pilots of Indian Air Force
were down this figure was later revised
downwards to to IAF aircraft and two
pilots the fact however is that Indian
army units had reported sighting two
parachutes falling in P okay vo J&K
which were of two f-16 pilots the
aircraft which was shot down by the
mig-21 secondly Pakistan claimed that
they intentionally dropped weapons in
open space where there was no human
presence or military posts the fact is
that Pakistan Air Force aircraft
targeted military installations Pakistan
also stated that no f-16s were used in
the operation and no Pakistani plane was
downed by Indian Air Force there is
enough evidence to show that f-16s were
used in this mission through the
electronic signatures and
thereafter the pockets Marcus tan is
trying to hide this fat also parts of
amraam air-to-air missile which is
carried only on the Pakistan f-16s was
recovered east of Raj Ori
within the Indian Territory if' has also
learned that Pakistan has announced that
Wing Commander of anandhan will be
returned to India tomorrow if' is happy

good evening you're watching the urban
debate and letter now fetuses are thank
you for joining us it has been a day of
continuous development between India and
Pakistan as has been pointed out in the
information that we brought to you
Pakistan
aircraft this morning crossed into
Indian Territory and Indian airspace
violating Indian airspace and were
chased back by the Indian Air Force one
f19 aircraft was shot down by Indian Air
Force and according to the Ministry of
External Affairs was seen by ground
personnel crashing into Pakistan
territory we also found out that in that
engagement India lost one of our own
aircraft the pilot of that aircraft is
currently in Pakistan custody a question
that now arises is what happens next
India's priorities as of now would be
bringing back the Indian Air Force pilot
the escalating the tension between the
two countries at the border and most
importantly putting an end and
dismantling Pakistan sponsored terror
that is breeding in Pakistan Territory
what are the options on the table before
India at this point and what are the
likely choices on the conversation with
me a Marshall SG lambda analyst
raghunatha former ambassador Nathan go
CLE national security expert Afghan and
general good meets Singh is a defense
expert in Vinatieri
our consulting editor at The Times that
work gentlemen thank you for joining us
mr chalene am there my first question to
you obviously it one of the priorities
at this point will be to bring back the
Indian Air Force pilot who is in in
Pakistan custody but since and given
that we started off with a very clear
target that was to dismantle terror and
its influence on the other side of
Pakistan how do you think the government
is now going to approach its
decision-making
ah good evening fee really good to be
back here this was a bit of a shocker
when I heard about this news in the
afternoon about young urban and inverter
man having been shot down but that's
that's to be very frank it's so much as
somewhat of work-in-progress
you go into war you go to conflict
getting shot down getting captured it's
it's it's all in a day's work it's it's
unfortunate but it's all in a day's work
to get accepted like that hangout is
alive tango DS well and I'm quite
certain the Pakistani is well aware of
the Geneva Charter would take good care
of him at least could to the extent they
can and he'll come back to us safe and
sound but the question that I do want to
put forward one more time and after yes
my question was this do you believe this
will now weigh on the government's
options as it goes further do you
believe that the government is now or
will now look at de-escalating the
situation I think this collision is has
already started the escalation is
already in progress and as much
Krishnaswamy said yesterday and I
entirely agree with him I would have
been very surprised if it hadn't but
when you bring in a plug air power in
any form offensive air power escalation
is built into it that is going to happen
and that has happened the idea is to not
get out of the situation or dilute the
problem but to face it square and see
what we're going to do next what are the
basic objective of the whole thing what
the objective was stick to that aim and
if you had to pay the price for at any
price we should be prepared to pay for
it
so do you believe then emotionally numb
that that the goal of dismantling terror
would perhaps require further escalation
because as far as India is concerned the
target that we hit at Bala court had
done the job so do you think that India
has achieved the target it set out to
achieve and so now the focus should be
on bringing the pilot back there I think
there are if talking about focus I think
there are multiple force I in this case
one focus is getting the pilot back the
second is to pursue with vigor and
determination what we set out to do I
think Bala could strike successful as it
was was only a select semicolon there is
much more much more much more work ahead
of us to do if you if you want to
achieve that aim if you want to achieve
that objective we've had to press on and
do what we had thought of doing earlier
along with their first to get younger be
London back I hope we do get him back
safe and sound but that shouldn't stop
us from achieving our aim which we had
in mind you can do set of the game yes I
will bring in the rest of the panel
right now but I do want to remind our
entire panel that while the Ministry of
External Affairs has not confirmed the
name of the officer in Pakistan custody
at this point so on the channel we
haven't used the name or the photograph
or the videos because we want to respect
the privacy of the family that is
involved
we're also you know advise our audience
to not forward those visuals or those
videos to whatever extent you can every
night the very same question to you will
you know India set out to dismantle
terror the Bala quote attack was part of
that you know plan to dismantle terror
what has happened post that has possibly
been an exchange of escalation at this
point would you say the government's
focus should be to de-escalate yes and I
think I'll take my entire cue from what
the government said first officially on
record yesterday post the Bala code
a strike the statement was very
carefully worded and I think we should
really that is the only indicator you
have of what is in the mind of the
government and the current strategies
that are actually deciding the strategy
statement very clearly said it's an
intelligence led operation that is aimed
and targeted at a it's a non military
intelligence raid operation aimed and
targeted at a terrorist camp which was
operating because we had advanced
material news that they are planning
more efficient attacks was an act of
self-defense in anticipation of an
attack on your Republic it's as simple
as that if the government in its mind as
a strategy had a a cyclic excavation in
mind they wouldn't have worded it in
this way pretty much the government has
said our objective was to go after the
Jewish camp because that was the one
responsible Obama and in the process of
forming more attacks and we've now gone
that and smashed it and achieved that
objective the only change that has
happened since that position now is that
now you have one of your right pilots in
the custody of the Pakistani Air Force
the question in front of the strategist
should be or would be and I'm sure this
is what was discussed when the meeting
was going on the PX house what measure
and what level of escalation or
de-escalation track - or track one do
you use to get the pilot back that's the
only objective for me the objective of
the government in terms of going after
terrorism Bala court was met yesterday
because they have clearly said so I mean
there is they've no ambiguity in their
statement at all and I to me that was
job done that mission was accomplished
there was no further mission left field
so far as this particular event was
concerned well yeah yes the question now
would have bring to the rest of our
panel Annelle saguni at all of yesterday
we were told repeatedly that if Pakistan
in retaliation to Bala court were to
decide to attack any of our military
installations or any of our civilians
that would be an out in our declaration
of war now while it has not been
successful in doing so
the Ministry of External Affairs has
confirmed today Pakistan attempted to
attack our military installations does
this mean India will respond does this
mean Pakistan was declaring war how how
do we understand what happened today
well the thing is
as we all know the the chain of events
India successfully carried out an
operation against the terrorist outfit -
Mohammed which is located in Pakistan
and that has been done there after we
were expecting and that's why we were in
the full state of preparedness for any
eventuality coming from Pakistan side
and Pakistani leadership had also said
that they will retaliate
now they retaliated in a way because for
their own domestic constituency and they
wanted to show to their people of course
they were not successful in that because
of our vigilance but a different factor
has come in that is about the pilot I'll
not touch upon it right now
but what what is going on now is that
India was not lodging a war or waging a
war against Pakistan per se but it was
trying to tell the Pakistan that if you
are not going to do anything and you
have not taken any cognizance of these
terrorist outfits which are attacking
India then India will be forced to take
action and this has been endorsed by
rest of the world as we have seen from
various statements so India is in a
strong position now in my view that
immediately after Pakistan has done and
both sides have down one plane each what
I believe is that the immediately after
that the statement coming from the
Pakistani Prime Minister again asking
for dialogue or repeating is this thing
that we should talk is also he they are
under tremendous pressure therefore I do
not think that currently we could expect
a greater escalation of course one cyber
rattling will continue for some time and
it is also possible that in some of the
other sectors there might be some more
incidents as is happening at the line of
control but I think the both sides are
trying to look at the possibility where
the message is loud and clear our
objectives are served which has been
done as you know in the de March that
was made with the Acting High
Commissioner of Pakistan and that what
are our objectives we have clearly
outlined those and then we have clearly
also conveyed that India will not allow
any further aggression into our
territory or any miss adventurism with
Pakistan by Pakistan yes they then go
clear joins us as well he's a national
security expert mr. Cokely I just want
to read out from the ministry
External Affairs note that was put out
today it said the Acting High
Commissioner of Pakistan has summoned
this after it has been summoned to this
afternoon to launch a strongly worded
protest by India and the unprovoked act
of aggression by Pakistan including
violation of India's airspace by
Pakistan Air Force and targeting Indian
military posts do you believe that India
would feel the need to respond to this
or is this protest the the means of
response would would India be focused on
de-escalating the tension at this point
no I don't think that is the objective
and I won't - first before I come to
what you asked me
I want to disagree a little bit with
Vinay that our objective was only when
we hit the Jesse Mohammed camp in Bala
court was achieved I think the objective
was that Pakistan must take action
against terrorist groups operating from
their soil and we haven't seen any
manifest action from Pakistan instead of
that Pakistan has actually tried to
target Indian military installations so
I think it's the objective is only
half-finished
India when it started this initiative
this this event has obviously had some
end objective in mind and I think we are
not even one-fourth the way there it's
unfortunate that one pilot has gone into
Pakistani custody but that
notwithstanding India still cannot
decide whether it wants to de-escalate
because Pakistan is not showing the
intent it needs to show in effect what
Pakistan has done is that because India
attacked very clearly and precisely a
terrorist camp and a terrorist outfit
Pakistan is responding to India
militarily as if it is defending the
terrorist outfit because it was attacked
by India so actually Pakistan is still a
protector of those terrorist outfits and
particularly jaish-e-mohammed so India
cannot sort of release that pressure
that has been put on Pakistan both
militarily
by thereby India's action at Bala coat
and also diplomatically diplomatically
today Pakistan is under much greater
pressure than before no country has
condemned India's action in fact China
Pakistan's always a friend has has
issued a very muted statement asking for
restraint rather than condemning India
the Russia India China joint statement
also speaks about sort of not using
state policy and so does the US
statement which is in favor of India or
in support of India France is trying to
take up another resolution in the United
Nations to name Masood Azhar so in this
favorable condition my personal view is
that India should not ease that pressure
and Pakistan is given India that
opportunity not to ease the pressure by
trying to use a military aggression
against military targets and trying to
very cleverly use that we did not target
we targeted non-civilian non-military
places in India
what are those non-military non-civilian
places we do not have terrorist camps in
India so I think it's a very ingenious
way ingenious way that Pakistan is
trying to fool everybody and trying to
work on the lobbies in India to say
let's deescalate let's go for dialogue
this is not the time for go to go for
dialogue it is a time to keep up the
pressure
well left-hand general goobies Singh
what are the options on the table before
India now what is India likely to do
next if we carefully look at the
diplomatic damash which was very strong
today it has clearly said that today's
action by the Pakistani Air Force was an
act of aggression and it gives the
legitimacy and the justification for the
response that we need to plan in fact I
would say when one looks at the options
still the entire fight against terror
which has been anchored by Pakistan Army
by ISI but there is groups in Pakistan
and the terrorist groups which are
operating in the Kashmir that is still
unfinished I would say that the first
time that India has taken such a
historic step they taken a strong action
the war on terror has started but it is
unfortunate that after such a balanced
statement by a me to say it was
non-military it was pre pre-emptive
action and execution also conveyed that
it was targeted on the terrace camp but
unfortunately what Pakistan attempted
today was they locked on to the military
target although they dropped the bombs
at place close by wanting to indicate
but the intention was not right
in fact to me I look at it this
opportunity at this moment that we have
to be prepared for all options the
diplomatic offensive which has been
launched against Pakistan not only by
India but by US China France if we look
at the commonality of all the diplomatic
pressure which is on Pakistan today we
find that everyone is telling them that
take action against terrorist groups in
fact I would say that diplomacy is one
of the element of is it's a one of the
element of war or power but as you asked
me category on what are the military
options I would say all options are
still open it starts from the edge of
covert operations
it starts from it includes the counter
proxy war and now that they've done
Hamlet reaction I think it is a it is
well within the options with India and
if we recall in the evening there was a
meeting of Prime Minister NSC and with
all the three chief obviously to decide
on what is the spectrum of choices that
we got and I'm definite about it that
this moment when the pressure has been
and we must ensure that the Pakistan has
got to change the very thinking and the
no tality and the center of gravity of
terror and proxy war choice which
they've had this is one chart we should
not let the pressure go and we must act
actually the culture of action culture
of proactive action has started and they
actually say across the threshold is a
paradigm shift and we should not track
back to that era of tolerance on these
things well a martial another do you
agree that all options including
military options are open and on the
table right now for India how fades like
this it's like this way one knows much
about having done it before how a
situation is analyzed how it is
appreciated how the options are worked
out and how the options that have worked
out are prioritized and based on this
process which is very very time proven
exercise time-tested exercise you the
Air Force would have proposed a certain
number of options in the sequence to the
government and when they were given the
go-ahead for this particular mission all
those options must have been deliberated
thought-out and dissected and bisected
then arrived at a final set of options
in the sequence they ought to be adopted
or put through those options I'm quite
certain are still alive and government
of India and Indian Air Force would plum
for one of those options in the manner
they deem fit in as the situation
develops both politically diplomatically
and militarily on the ground the options
are still open and one of those options
I dare say is to up the ante well you
know I just want to remind our viewers
why this why the voice of air marshalene
and are so important he's a former vice
chief of the air staff former commander
in chief of Eastern Air Command and the
former commanding officer of seven
squadron battle-axes that took part in
yesterday's mirage 2000 operation but I
don't want to ask you this now I know
that the whole country is currently
preoccupied we
you know with the one pilots the Air
Force pilot who is in custody of
Pakistan you did say in the beginning of
this conversation that it's part of it's
all part of the day's work for the
Indian Air Force and for the Indian Air
Force pilots are they prepared or do you
file it's trained mentally and
physically for something like this is
this something that the families of you
know the members of the Indian Air Force
are also prepared for in some way
because obviously for civilians right
now a lot of that information is
worrying and disturbing but is it
different in the way that air the
officers of the Air Force the pilots and
their families approach these situations
you know as a as a parent I would be
very distressed at what has happened to
my son or to somebody's son that's one
part second part is I'm very very very
happy and will grateful to God that he's
alive and in good shape physically fit
and third is I'm very proud that it's
happened to this boy the way that it has
played out the way he has gone out and
did his best to shoot down in his 16
which is not a it's not a small matter
it's a great red feather and fighter
pilots cab having done that the options
that are now thrown open to the
government and the Air Force would of
course include getting the young pilot
back but over and above that along with
that they would have to follow hard
options which they have worked out and
thought out to take this campaign or
this matter to its logical conclusion
for once and for all
you can't leave it halfway through no
way is there a reason irrational Onaga
why you believe that this campaign is
currently only halfway through I beg
your pardon I didn't get there you said
that we shouldn't leave the campaign
halfway through is there a reason why
you believe the campaign is only halfway
through and not nearly completely more
complete no no I'm not saying I don't
know the options which were thought out
I don't even know what the final
objective was but if that object was not
achieved in the eyes of the government
and their force if the if the campaign
is yet to reach pursuit to achieve those
objectives then the captain the the
campaign must be pursued with all vigor
and not determination if that is so I'm
not sure about that I don't know about I
don't I'm not privy to that information
but if it is so then we have no choice
but pursued with all the vigor at our
disposal
well other than yourself most of the
panel seems to think that a Bala court
was only part of what India needed to do
and there's a lot more to be done and
the capture of this one pilot shouldn't
actually stand in the way of or cause
India to pull back do you disagree with
any of those points no I mean of course
I agree that the the the capture of the
pilot shouldn't stand in that way I
think my only question mark is over
whether the Indian government will
consider today's attempt and I am
highlighting the word attempt they were
not succeed successful the Indian Air
Force successfully beat them back inside
their own country so they weren't really
successful now the question is should
the government of the day treat and
adventurism as reason enough to go back
and hit them harder or should it's think
whether this will lead to a further
escalation and may then spiral into a
pretty unknown zone because remember
Pakistan is a very unpredictable nation
I mean we don't even know fully their
command and control structure we don't
even know who actually manages that and
who handles that so there is a bit of a
problem with you we're not dealing with
the normal country it's a it's quite a
banana republic in many ways no one
quite has a clue what predictable and
given actually you know this is
something we should bring up given the
difference in comment that has come out
and the kind of things that Pakistan has
said and they've rolled back a lot of
things they've said including from the
prime minister who said we have two
pilots in custody and then the army came
and said no we have only one pilot in
custody it's an unpredictable entity
also a very unprofessional identity I
mean how often will you see a country
which is pretty much locked in a
conflict in another country where the
president both over there the prime
minister in the army disagrees within
six hours on us on a fact so important
as the capture of an enemy pilot I mean
the B Prime Minister says - as you
rightly said and within five hours the
army statement came out is saying
there's only one pirate I mean so there
that in an incoherent
also I think in the Union I'm very sure
than in government is weighing one other
aspect imran khan is a man who lacks a
descent of experience he has no except
for what he has done in the last
humans so he doesn't he hasn't really
been an administrator research he
doesn't have the political wisdom or the
sense to understand how to move so in
that sense he's being pretty much guided
by what the army is doing and saying he
doesn't have a mind of his own and he
has one nobody is listening to him in
the army and I think this will weigh
down on the Indian government that's my
sense so my only question mark on the
slight disagreement is yes I don't think
the Indian government that the only
question is whether the Indian
government will treat today's attempted
adventurism as provocation enough to go
back and retaliate yet again or will
they believe that this is an adventure
ism which has been repelled and we
should leave it at the condemnation or
at the protest that they've done by by
that strong dommage that was issued to
their acting high commissioner well
anything if you'll permit me to ask you
a very very basic question on behalf of
a lot of our viewers who are asking this
question what does escalation now mean
people want to know you know sitting in
Mumbai or Delhi or Bangalore or any of
the other cities are we at risk there is
you know there was a lot of nervousness
caused around the high alerts in the
airport's caused around the extra
checking that's being done in our big
cities should regular civilians in all
of the cities in India be nervous what
is what do we mean by escalation when
we're talking about to countries like
India and Pakistan well that question
should actually be answered by the
military professionals who are in your
panel but by two limited points I want
to make and I'll leave that judgment to
their wisdom is this that while India's
reserved it's right to retaliate if
Pakistan shows one more act of
aggression and in today's dommage which
is the correct thing to do that
India regards this as a military
aggression as an act of aggression as
something against the military
installation while India had not done
this against a military installation in
Pakistan so that is very clear so India
is very clear what India will do if
something more happens but my fear is
Pakistan and I here I agree with winner
and that Pakistan is an irrational state
irrational nation in many ways because
of the asymmetry it has
the India in almost everything its
economy is much smaller in dire straits
its military is half India size but
punches much about its weight given that
it thinks that it has nuclear arsenal
and also the fact that India is doing
economically far better than Pakistan
that notwithstanding my fear is Pakistan
will try and use its proxies the
terrorist outfits on all the terrorists
for something spectacular in the rest of
India if not Jammu and Kashmir and that
is what we had to guard against if that
happens then what does India do because
India has now set a template that if you
carry out a terrorist strike against
either a military installation or in a
civilian domain we will hit back with
our military might like it was done or
at least part of the military might like
it was done in the surgical strike post
story and now it is done by the surgical
strike wire air at Mallicoat so
therefore for the rest of India and for
common citizens the escalation means
that if something of that nature happens
then India will have no option but to
strike hard against Pakistan which is
protect Pakistani army and the Pakistani
state which is protecting and giving
shelter to the terrorist groups
so therefore the citizens across this
country must be completely alert and
also of course the law enforcement
agencies the intelligence agencies
because that is where Pakistan has the
strength and the ability to either do
terrorist strikes or do coordinated
cyber attacks or even indulge in
information warfare as they have started
today like Russians they they can try
and influence Indian elections and they
already I think I suspect they have sort
of activated some of their sympathizers
and proxies by advocating this line of
thinking that now that you have done
what you had to do we have done what we
have done so now let's deescalate I
think that is something which we have to
guard against as a nation I think
decision-makers will take all this into
account and will take the right and
appropriate decision but I have already
made my view clear that the pressure
should not be released at the moment
okay left hand general debate saying
same question to you what would it mean
right now for an escalation of the
situation if if that's what we want to
call it in fact if we look at the
current scene at the moment the center
of gravity of what we are doing is
against the terror
it is against that proxy war which has
been engineered by Pakistan we have
taken a very bold decision this time in
fact 26 1166 were killed and we never
took that bold decision till how long
will we bear that thing till how long we
define the situation by enough is enough
I think give us a time there was a need
there was it there was a need to have a
result there was need to change the
track there was a need to have a strong
narrative the hard option which was
India was compelled to do was executed
in fact I would say when I look at the
entire the paradigm actually there is a
paradigm shift you know and I'm off this
belief that this is one opportunity
which has come across us at this moment
that the track which Pakistan had for 70
years but in particular about 30 years
that it was on the mission and the track
of proxy war they adopted terror as a
strategic tool they adopted terrorism as
a state policy they twisted the religion
to jihadi extremism and fundamentalism
and they've been inflicting this thing
for very long but now the situation is
different now I think the decision has
been taken
let me tell you one thing very very
clearly that the track that we have
taken it must take to take us to an
environment or must shape the
environment
Pakistan has got to drop this choice of
death which they have had for themselves
in fact if we look it from Pakistan
point itself
what scene they had in the Parliament
what this scene they had in the media in
fact their Prime Minister themself told
Pakistan Air Force what have they done
but today's episode also for them and
they were found sleeping in fact
Pakistan we told the Pakistan Air Force
that they were sleeping if you compare
the professionalism which has been
exhibited last few days of Pakistan Air
Force and Indian Air Force there is a
marked difference Indian Air Force has
shown that professionalism that
precision whatever political military
decisions were there directions were
there they're executed does not ground
in fact the entire arrows which are
there to compel Pakistan to change the
track but it's a diplomatic --all if
it's an info aspect whether whether it
is a military action everything is
compelling them to change and I
personally feel this is a prime time and
on top of that today they have done a
massive mistake they've they have not
understood the thing that India's
intentions are very clear if you compare
this I see PR of the earth the what the
prime minister said today and how Indian
spokesman of the MEA said precise
pointed thing he said he said he gave
the rundown of the event and he said our
pilot is missing in action if you look
at the previous ones insect if you look
at the high spear is throughout the day
they were still on denials yes oh
absolutely
yes still unfinished man yes I just want
to bring in a new question now to the to
the panel I'm putting this to the whole
panel very I will start with you the
diplomatic route at this point to
isolate Pakistan even further because
like the panel has all have all agreed
you know Pakistan at this point has not
found any support internationally within
the international community no one has
come forward or nobody in the
international media scan
there's action against suggestion
Mohammad very clearly so we have the
upper hand there that is that diplomatic
route there is a route to economic
sanctions even further and there is
international law because there is proof
of terror activity in Pakistan it's
terror activity that has not just
affected us it's affected other
countries as well so is there another
route through diplomatically through
international law that kids shall be
taken by India well never before has
Pakistan been so isolated globally for
sure and also there is one other factor
never before has Pakistan faced a
situation where there are three hostile
borders for them remember the Iranians
are extremely upset and angry with them
they have grannies have been angry and
upset with them as well for a while they
blame them repeatedly for a lot of
attacks that happened within Afghanistan
and in Kabul and now you have India as
well so they are also hemmed in even in
the sense of the borders all around so
they've never been as isolated as ever
and as you rightly saying I mean the
manner in which they've gone begging for
literally money from the Saudis is a
testament of how the US aid drying up
the Chinese linking their strategic
interests to despite having starting
this is not coming out in open support
of them is actually deep is possibly
deeply distressing for them and I'm sure
the price any government realizes how
badly isolated they are this there's not
found a single voice of support at all
post what India has done so yes I mean
there is never a better time frankly to
drive home the advantage in Raj is
already on the job she is in China she's
having those conversations mister mister
through idiot obviously there is a
larger role to be played here by
diplomacy and by the pressure that can
be put on Pakistan by the international
community well indeed that as we know
that all the statements that have come
in fact the statement first statement
that came from the US and President
Trump said that we are expecting
something very very big from India and
this is precisely what he meant and I
think that several countries have also
shared the intelligence about all these
with us and every single country has not
nobody has said anything is India that
what we have done but they have always
told Pakistan that they should
contain the terrorists today mrs. sushma
swaraj was there at the RIC meeting in
China and there the statements that have
come out of there are very clear and
clearly articulated on the other hand
the France UK and US are trying to once
again pitch in in the UNSC to to declare
Masood Azhar as the terrorist and I hope
that that should pressure should be
maintained so that that is done rather
quickly while China is still not fully
geared up even though it might abstain
or something but it will it is possible
that this can be declare and that will
also solve the problem to some extent
because then Pakistan will be forced
like it has been done recently in the
case of the Ju D and others to take
action against Masood Azhar so what we
have done is the the international
community is today on India's
understands and appreciates India's
concern they also know that the India
will take any action and is authorized
to take any action to protect its
territorial integrity and against
terrorism and that is something really
good I mean so far as you know there is
the comprehensive convention of
international terrorism we have been
trying to bring in to some conclusion
but today even in the RIC statement it
was clearly that both Russia and China
are on board with us even Saudi Arabia
and the some Arabian countries that have
not been on board have come on board for
that also
so that'll also give some more teeth to
US or international community to define
what terrorist is and how because that
is our biggest problem with Pakistan is
that they are pandering to terrorists
and their terrorists are attacking us
with their help and that we know and
we'd they also know after arre and after
Mallicoat that India is going to
continue to do that I would have
probably it would have been better in
this context if we had eight three or
four locations in one go so we would
have been done with decimating them to a
large extent if we have the correct
intelligence at the time but I think
that India is in a position of greater
advantage and we could possibly get the
things going our way if possible if we
continue to pressure them emotionally
number I saw your hand go up and you
used
getting an allergy last night when we
were talking about Imran Khan does he
find himself isolated that he's on the
team by himself because technically he
has no support in the international
community see in this t20 a one-day game
of cricket theatre under of all his
bowlers his fielding is running out of
all his bowlers the batter not getting
out I think he's out of his depth
basically he's out of his depth in this
new game which is playing he's never
played before I haven't understood a bit
of it all the flamboyance all the
popularity in the world of cricket an
unquestioned eminence in cricket he was
a great player
I think he's clearly out of his depth
and this situation the most interesting
that can happen to all of us including
Pakistan in India is that he being
completely submerged by the others in
the government or in the Pakistan Army
that's one point second point is no
matter what India does now as a report
or in response it must not be seemingly
or otherwise as as having been provoked
by Pakistan and in what Pakistan did
today we shouldn't do anything out of
provocation whatever we do or whatever
we have made mind to do should be a
product of a very cold calculated plan
in sync with what we had planned earlier
pursue that plan coolly and methodically
without seeming to get provoked by what
Pakistan does now and again because that
that may be there exactly intention to
provoke into something precipitate
without giving the thought but that's
not a style of working it's there
started working and we have to consider
advantage to Pakistan a big advantage to
Pakistan unlike us they're dealing with
the far more for a bigger and far better
opponent far more mature opponent oh I
also want to ask you this Marshall
another the statement made by Imran Khan
today where he said I asked India about
the weapons that you have and the
weapons that we have can we really
afford such a miscalculation if this
escalates things will no longer be in in
my control or in mr. Modi's control what
is your reaction to that statement
novi we have the initiative we have we
can't have that initial initiative
listed from us he started the whole
thing we must keep the control
escalation controlling our hands
if this collision occurs so be it but
the escalation control must be in our
hands
it can't be conceded to India Pakistan
under any circumstances no way it has to
be in our hands the escalation must take
place on our terms and if Pakistan wants
to paint itself in a corner whatever it
is doing and there's a huge groundswell
of support nationally internationally in
our favor what are we doing we must do
something to justify that to exploit
that explore it to the to the hate we
can't just let that groundswell of
support dissipate into something on
utilized or on an unexplored how huge a
groundswell of support and we must
exploit that fully whatever we do so
when you say we must exploit that fully
what would that entail I beg you pardon
you said we must exploit the groundswell
of support we have what would exploiting
that support entail explosion support
would mean sticking to the plan which
had made earlier if that is if that was
the only plan you had of striking one
target or two targets so be it but if
you want to take this to a logical
conclusion to stop this thing from
occurring every other day every next
week every next year every next month
then we have to something which I think
the world experts us to do something big
if Trump said it I think so many others
who haven't said it but I have meant it
that maybe it's too it suits everybody
else or like his large number of people
outside India to see that happen and
Pakistan being taken care of at least
changed into doing something stopping
doing something which it is been doing
over the years that must be achieved if
you don't want to disappoint our
supporters outside not getting provoked
by them either all right that takes us
to the next question and I'm still
reading out of Imran Khan's statement
the Prime Minister of Pakistan where he
said we offered India that we would
cooperate it's not in Pakistan's
interest to let our land be used for
terrorism and
there's no dispute there yet I still
feared that India would take action and
therefore I warned against aggression
and they said we would respond like any
sovereign country would and he goes on
to say I invite you we are ready we
understand your grief from poleramma we
should sit down and settle this with
talks do you have any reason to believe
that these talks will be different from
any of the other false offers of talks
we've had in the past but look virtually
every paragraph the Hoffa statement was
laughable I mean to say the least I mean
honestly this is this is the most
laughable piece which we I think we've
heard like so many times you can almost
predict it's like the airline safety
announcement you can you know exactly
what's going to come right you can
predict it is exactly like that that
it's happened again how much more
evidence do you want us found Osama bin
Laden in Abbottabad okay living just
half a kilometer away from an Army
Garrison and an army cantonment with
them claiming they didn't know about it
right repeatedly there has been evidence
given by various countries including
India afterwards is 11 after Paulo an
attack about the Pakistani involvement
and the culture of inculcating
terrorists says okay I mean to continue
to say oh but we don't want terrorism to
come but to happen on our soil is
laughable I mean this there is I mean
the world now knows it I don't know
pretend that you're completely surprised
by it absolutely even the suggestion
that there is if the world did not know
this why would not one word of support
come from anywhere else in the world the
fact that India has got three sounding
support all over is because the world
knows that Pakistan has been a harbor of
terrorists they have been a breeding
ground and they've always and repeatedly
done that so this statement is as
laughable as it can get
yes and and the other statement that he
did say was we've offered you in the
past whatever investigation you want
whatever you know help you want from us
collecting your proof will help you
again we've had instance after instance
where Pakistan has made this offer yes
and it's always turned out to be so when
I see itwhen for hijacking Monophysite
was released and when your mother was
released and when he landed in Pakistan
within half an hour of him landing in
Pakistan there was a rally which
attended by 20,000 people in the heart
of the city right that man has moved
around free in that country after 26/11
he was allegedly supposedly kept under
house arrest no one quite knows what
that how does house arrest meant it
probably even just meant being at the
hospitality of the government and even
the courts that have overturned the
verdict to actually even have that
notional house arrest in that sense so
I mean I don't understand what they mean
I mean this is so such a you know such a
poor repetition of some very old facts
that it's just it probably doesn't even
deserve a response listen Coakley did
you see the statement made by Imran Khan
has veiled threats to India or a weak
attempt perhaps to deescalate I see this
as a attempted conciliation or
reconciliation with India and yeah
exactly
he's hoping that India will you know
accept his offer and deescalate and
that's exactly the mistake that India
should not make because as I said it and
I repeat that this pressure must be
maintained having got the advantage this
pressure should be applied and
maintained going further notwithstanding
that India is going to get into an
election season because without a
sustained pressure on Pakistan and
visible and demonstrable action against
terrorists and terrorist outfits India
should not let go of this opportunity
where you've got Pakistan in a corner no
matter what the provocation is we should
not react in haste and I'm happy that
today despite the aggression shown by
Pakistan India has not reacted hastily
by launching some cross border incursion
or a cross LOC strike although we don't
know whether if that has happened but on
the face of it we haven't done that and
I think we should play it in a very cold
calculated manner and let not Imran Khan
or the peaceniks the usual suspects who
will come bearing some offer of the
other from the Western nations
thankfully that is reduced a bit and a
lobby in our own country which will
advocate peace and you know but just
because of one pilot is in their custody
we should deescalate or we should not
you know sort of look at a military
option or a kinetic option I think we
should just
I knew this pressure having got this
advantage having shifted the old red
lines of not going into crossing the LOC
or going into Pakistan occupied German
Kashmir or beyond which we have done so
we should press home the advantages what
my view is all right we have run out of
time on this conversation and I do want
to thank our panel gentlemen thank you
so much for making time for Matt around
this evening and for our viewers and
helping us understand the situation far
better I look forward to speaking with
you more often in in the future in
conclusion I believe if we take
everything that has been discussed in
the last one hour by a panel and we pick
up the analogy used by a marshal in aMDA
it's very obvious that Imran Khan began
playing a t20 match only to realize that
this is a Test match it's going to run
over several days and he's already ran
out of resources and out of options
our batsmen are still at the crease
simply put as a nation we need to stand
together we need to stand strong and we
need to stand convinced and determined
that we will see this truth through to
the end as we say good night our
thoughts and our prayers with the young
Air Force pilot the officer the Wing
Commander was currently in Pakistan
custody we pray that he be sick and
returned to us very quickly our thoughts
are also with his family and we pray
that they have a good night's sleep
knowing that we stand with them in the
meantime as the government of India
decides on its next point of view and
its next course of action we need to be
vigilant and responsible as citizens
with information with public spaces and
with each other good night

nNEvcFQ2DXk,Pak PM Imran Khan: &#39;IAF pilot to be released tomorrow as a gesture of peace&#39;,Pakistan has said that the pilot release will be a peace gesture. The Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said the Indian Air Force ...,2019-02-28T14:02:26Z,MIRROR NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nNEvcFQ2DXk/hqdefault.jpg,"thank you sir hey Pakistan has
apparently said that the pilot release
will be a peace gesture the pakistan
Prime Minister Imran Khan said the
Indian Air Force pilot will be released
tomorrow
we know that this will be a massive
reason for a sigh of relief across the
country for people who are very
concerned about the well-being of wing
commander Arvind and then but he will be
released is confirmed by the Pakistan
Prime Minister tomorrow and this is this
is I mean we were talking this entire
morning about conditions that Pakistan
wanted to place India put out and India
standing its ground very clearly saying
we will not accept any conditions at all
Pakistan obviously is buckled now and
said that we will release him as a peace
gesture so really what Pakistan wants
right now is to deescalate the situation
and this is perhaps the best way to do
that
this is information that's coming in
Imran Khan has made the statement saying
the Indian Air Force pilot
Wing Commander be London who was
captured by Pakistan yesterday and has
been in custody of Pakistan since then
will be released tomorrow he has made
this announcement Parliament which is
very important he has said that they
will release him and they will release
him as a peace gesture over net values
with me in the studio Vinay this is
extremely important this means that the
hardline that the our Ministry of
External Affairs had taken saying that
we will not negotiate with you has paid
off absolutely it's absolutely paid off
and it also tells you that the
international pressure on Pakistan has
also been a factor behind them realizing
the dangers and the damages of
continuing to hold him hostage and the
fact that he was you know there's been
universal condemnation of what Pakistan
did and support for what India did
Pakistan's isolation has also played a
big role in that and I think the Indian
government's consistent position on not
negotiating I think even though if you
remember the Pakistanis did try that
savage the Qureshi's comment earlier in
the day they talked about we will do it
if it brings down an escalation that was
conditional but I think the Indian
response about no conditions no deal
nothing you have to release him without
any conditions has paid off and it's
played of messaging but I also want to
look at this portion of the comment that
Imran Khan is made which is that the
release will be a peace gesture so what
he's saying effectively is that he wants
to deescalate
from here he doesn't want this going any
further one is the escalation for sure
it will start this wind is certainly
Dias Li the situation but I think this
is more of trying to score a brownie
point you know he's just trying to
pretend that also the reason behind
using this terminology is because they
want to have an immoral upper ground in
saying oh we did it because we wanted
peace so this is also positioning but
the fact of the matter is that this has
been done because they've realized there
is no maneuvering space for Pakistan
anymore and they are in no position to
actually carry out any kind of a
negotiation or to attempt a quid pro quo
from the inside because the inside is
extremely clear about about releasing
the man really giving command or
unconditionally oh let me just read out
some of these statements that are coming
in at this point and I'll read out you
know Prime Minister Imran Khan has said
he tried to call Indian Prime Minister
Narendra Modi on the phone because
escalation is not on in our interest or
in India's interest I wonder if that
call didn't go through because network
has been so bad lately but to say that
he tried to call this course against
what we know about you know bilateral
conversations they don't happen and we
sound like you pick up the phone and
attempt to dial so ya know so I think
what he meant was that they have sent a
message to the Indian access office that
they want to talk but it has not
happened yet but I mean I think they
were trying to say that the message that
has been sent was sent because we wanted
this to de-escalate that's and he also
says and this is from PTV News official
from there verified account they're
quoting the Prime Minister he said in
our desire for peace I announced that
tomorrow as a first step to open
negotiations Pakistan will be releasing
the Indian Air Force officer in our
custody to nations with weapons of mass
destruction should not divulge on the
path of war I seek peace with India he
goes on to say I addressed the Indian
government do not force us for
retaliation we are prepared for any
eventuality and response I beseech India
not to force us down the path of war he
goes on to say the mughal emperor
bahadur shah zafar chose to live in
bondage tipu sultan chose to die free
the hero of Pakistan is Tipu Sultan
that's actually not connected to
anything else in any way sorry random
sort of PostScript attachment to make to
that statement but do you examine a
couple of things that he said our first
step to
open negotiations he's used the word
dialogue he's used the word negotiation
he's used to what let's talk about it a
lot does this mean anything no it
doesn't because I'll tell you why
because he is addressing his own
constituency right now in the Parliament
he is talking he there is a very
belligerent opposition that was already
gunning for him he's facing a problem
from within Pakistani people as well the
only slight handle that they got was a
ring commander abandons capture this was
the only talking point they perhaps God
well it's to some extent but the fact of
the matter is he said this all this is
about addressing his work honestly he is
trying to position himself as somebody
who was interested in peace and trying
to portray as if India's the country
which is expecting a war yes which is
pushing for war and he's begging us
reasonable major-general PK circle is
with us mr. general Hagel obviously this
is good news for all of us who sort of
had most of our thoughts on wing
commander pin and then and we wanted him
to come home his family is going to be
so relieved as well that he is going to
come home but the rest of the statements
being made by Pakistan saying that we're
releasing him as a peace gesture we are
releasing him as our attempt to open
negotiations",True,en,1010,3,16

news right now NSC Ajit Doval has
chaired a high-level meeting which was
attended by Home Secretary Rajeev Kumar
IB chief Raj chief Gen and raw chief at
the PMO so that is you know that is a
high-level security meeting and one can
expect these to be to happen more often
at this at this point yes and this is
again again part of expected procedure
that is followed every time has internal
security issue is there and now with an
external threat as well it just becomes
more important and I think the good
thing is that in the last four or five
years or so the coordination the
interagency coordination is improved
there has been a lot more cooperation
between various intelligence agencies I
mean during 26/11 for instance there was
a very incoherent sharing of information
between various intelligence forces and
that is actually something that a jido
will has been credited listen you have
to give that credit that they have
certainly improved that dramatically I
mean and in fact intelligence as a
concept works only when it is shared and
it is shared fully it doesn't work if
the raw is aware of something and they
don't share of the IB the effectiveness
of information goes down so this credit
taking yes Home Secretary the IB chief
and the raw chief so this is largely
internal its its internal security so
right now the concern is in doubt
security linked with external because
raw of course operates in external
community areas as well so the it's
interlinked in many ways and that's I
think that's the good thing that there
is a cohesion in terms of sharing
information
so in fact Ashman is with us right now
on this information that's just come in
Irishman a meeting that was shared right
now what are you picking up in Delhi
well right now that after the meeting
that was chaired by Home Minister
Rajnath Singh or the internal security
chief who went on to me - Ajit Doval at
the PMO it has being said that they were
briefed
they breathed Ajit Doval on the security
posture to the country at the same time
the board respect also at the same time
we are being told that Ajit Doval would
be there in the CCS meet where he would
be telling what information he has got
from the internal on the on the internal
security front and that this meeting was
important because it comes just ahead of

temporary stalls or structures
constructed at the venue were not
following the fire safety standards the
notice was issued on the 19th of
February and just four days later a
massive fire broke out at the parking
lot at this venue gutting 300 vehicles
so AGL has refuted the fire department's
claim saying that the notice referred
only to temporary structures inside the
venue and it had no mention of the
parking lot per se also added that the
task of disaster and fire management was
assigned to the fire department to
confirm that necessary measures were
being taken well let me go across to

phone line meanwhile those are the
pictures of 300 vehicles getting cutted
in that fire in the parking lot in a
show organised by Hindustan Aeronautics
Limited let me go across this region now
Raja so there are statements and claims
and counterclaims coming in first from
the fire department and now I believe
HAL has also made a response saying that
there were no violations of the safety
standards what exactly is the big
takeaway now from this entire exchange
because nobody seems to be interested in
taking responsibility well absolutely
this is considering the fact this entire
show was event was organized by beef in
this pan aeronautical limited we
understand that it comes the onus comes
on them to ensure that they obtain a no
objection certificate from the fire
department which is mandatory as for the
guidelines and remember we're talking
about where the arrow so began on 28th
of this month it went about for about
there four days and we see on 19th of
February just a day ahead of the arrow
strokes we see some of the fire
officials did inspect in fact all the
days and they did give a report
submitted a report to the head field by
saying that they will have to secure in
fact enough people from the officials of
the fire department but the only
Takamiya tale that they say to take that
NOC by saying that for no for so long
have never taken a no see from the fire
department Sam again they are not going
ahead with a nose peel it should work
will be should by the fire so this is a
shocking response that's coming in from
DHA and itself and once as far as the in
open systems and he simply releases on
19 September lead this particular notice
was given to facilitate clearly stating
that the the place in fact that they had
inspected does not add air to or the
fire safety standards and that they have
to ensure that the fire workers would be

missing in action and they have also
confirmed that Pakistan has claimed that
that pilot is in their custody so this
is as serious and as important as it can
get and it obviously means that the
Indian government would want once first
to get a confirmation whether indeed
their pilot is in their custody or not
and to to then begin the process of
securing his release
very similar to what perhaps happened
during Kargil in the 1999 during Kargil
in 1999 there was one of our pilots who
had been held in captivity in Pakistan
yes
how how drastically does that change the
conversation between two countries what
see well yes so during Cargill 1999
flight
I mean he's now a group captain but he
was then flight left in a Chiquita whose
plane was shot down much like this
incident here in fact one of the engines
had caught fire at the pan I'm very
close to the the LOC there is a process
of reigniting the engine that pilots are
trained to do he attempted to do that
the plane veered a little bit and he
actually fell in in a no-man's area
ironically in a tractor beam that Sakata
was able to evade for at least five or
six hours any sighting I mean he wasn't
captured then and he was actually able
to hide for quite a long time it was his
bad luck in that since there was a
Pakistan foot patrol which spotted him
and then they took him in custody and
that then became a fairly prolonged
discussion so the process that was used
then was there is a concept of a hotline
that exists between the DGA most of both
countries and director-general military
operations there's a hotline in the
Indian sides are outlined the Pakistani
side and whenever something like this
happens the hotline is used to
communicate the concept of hotlines
essentially means that this
communication is not official it's not
something that is considered a formal
communication it's just to keep the
lines of communication open and that's
how they initiate a contact where both
sides the dgn was about contagion
diseases what country talk about it post
that's if it requires there can also be
a flag meeting between the Dodi GMOs
where the terms of negotiation release
are discussed and they are thrashed out
in Kargil I think it was released after
about 10 days or so he wasn't released
immediately I remember he was brought
back to Delhi in a special plane that
came in and was escorted by some Air
Force and ministry government offices as
well so if this is going to be a little
prolonged it's unfortunately if it gets
confirmed that he is in their custody
it's not going to end so soon we will
have to do it on a diplomatic level as
well as at a digimon level also
obviously the government is taking its
time and as it should to confirm that
this pilot was missing in action and
that is out of sensitivity to the family
of this pilot who shouldn't find out on
what's happened shouldn't find out on
the media and should find out through
official channels of communication so my
appeal to everyone watching and to
everyone who's looking at your whatsapp
at this point is to spare a moment for
the family of this pilot as tempted as
you may be you may be to forward things
at this point out of respect
or a young pilot who has done so much
for the country let's let's treat this
entire situation with some respect we
understand also if we just we just we
have the ability to repeat the statement
that was made and played one more time
for our viewers who have just joined us
if we could just do that please
India had informed about
counterterrorism action it took
yesterday against a terrorist training
camp of just a moment in Pakistan based
on credible evidence that just remember
intended to launch more attacks against
this counterterrorism actions Pakistan
has responded this morning by using its
Air Force to target military
installations on the Indian side due to
her high state of readiness and
alertness Pakistan attempts were for it
successfully the Pakistan Air Force was
detected and the Indian Air Force
responded instantly in that aerial
engagement one Pakistan Air Force
fighter aircraft was shot down by a
mig-21 bison of the Indian Air Force
the Pakistani aircraft was seen by
ground forces falling from the sky on
the Pakistan side in this engagement we
have unfortunately lost one mig-21 the
pilot is missing in action Pakistan has
claimed that he is in their custody we
are returning the pair well that was a
statement from the Ministry of External
Affairs and the Air Force that just came
out and they just agree to give you an
update it confirms the government has
confirmed that one Indian mig-21 has
been lost and the pilot is missing in
action
Pakistan claims that they have the pilot
in custody or that claim has not been
verified by the government as of now
joining us in the studio probably are
from
diplomat in annoyed or studio mister
there I'll thank you for joining us so I
appreciate your time
this is obviously very distressing
information that one of our pilots maybe
you know is missing in action as
confirmed by by the government we don't
know as of now whether he is in custody
of of Pakistan what is your reaction
right now to the press conference
features heard Elfi I'm quite concerned
and in fact worried at the turn of
events we were really awaiting
confirmation till sometime back from our
government and that confirmation has
come because the Pakistanis had claimed
that they had shot down a big and they
had also claimed that one of our pilots
is in their custody the unfortunate part
of such situations is that whenever
there is a conflict truth is always the
first casualty and in this situation
things were getting murky it was not
clear to anyone really where the truth
lay now it has become evident and very
clear to everybody that the situation
has escalated and therefore I am worried
about the turn of events of course of
course it's beyond doubt that the
provocation came from the Pakistani side
they had been provoked provoking us with
many acts of overt and covert hostility
and the Palama terror attack was
absolutely they're our last straw and of
course there is a lot of truth in the
old saying that if you want peace be
prepared for war so we had to make it
clear that we were prepared to hit back
and we did because we launched this
attack by our aircraft on the terror
camps of the gesture Mohammed but then
of course Pakistan took it naturally as
an ego issue and they of it they tried
to head back and there have been claims
and counter
I think the time has come for both sides
to reflect on the situation and
deescalate matters because it would be
very unfortunate if things go out of
control or if the tension escalates to
level from where it becomes very
difficult to bring down the levels of
tension so my own view is that why we
have to remain prepared for war and I'm
quite sure that our government is taking
every possible step to counter Pakistani
maneuvers and aggressive activities but
at the same time it is very important
that the leaders on both sides take up
Statesman like position because the war
is going to be extremely expensive for
for both sides and if we can avert a war
like situation then we should do so I
don't mean to say that we should appear
weak-kneed I don't mean to say that we
should appear to be capital ageing far
from it but it takes a lot of bravery to
make peace it is easier to make war than
to make peace you need a lot of
statesmen like qualities and I think
that the need of the r is for the
leaders both of India and Pakistan to
work their way out of the situation to
dissing entangle the imbroglio and to
make sure that things do not head in the
wrong directions because the cost of war
would be beyond imagination
it is true that India is militarily much
stronger pervez musharraf had himself
said that pakistan cannot afford a
military strike on india because we
would hit them there 20 times more but
why have such a situation in the first
place I think it would be
far more wise and far more courageous to
prevent war and I think that history
will remember our leaders more for
preventing war than for getting involved
in one that is my preliminary reaction
well what other panelists also have to
say yes very obviously this yeah this
news is going to take some time to you
know for India to digest this is like
quite rightly pointed out by mr. they
are unfortunately in distressingly part
of engagement across the border and
their countries don't have to digest
this information again there is
information coming in from the other
side that we should be very very careful
about isn't that we should be and I
think this is something we've been
stressing all all day or yesterday as
well that it you know war is not a
solution war has its collateral damage
on both sides lifes are lost
Indian lies when perhaps and ran a risk
of getting lost as well but I guess the
bigger loss in a situation like this is
also the information loss and the
complete taking over of all kinds of
misinformation that spreads around and
that adds to the pressure on governments
it has to the pressure on authorities
and that's not the kind of distraction
or divergent they need at this point of
time you know the ability now on both
sides of the border with everybody
having has a cellphone to just make a
video of something or the other put it
out to pretend one video that was taken
maybe years ago is of something that's
happened today actually you know what
you said it puts pressure on government
at this point to communicate far more
than they would be comfortable doing at
a time like this absolutely and I think
you see that the other thing is that we
should ironically yesterday the
political class acted way more maturely
then perhaps a lot of the citizens the
opposition was very mature in the
responses and other him said anything
which was you know could be construed in
another manner and the government was
also fairly responsible and muted in the
way they informed the country about what
had happened yes it's actually the
public pressure that comes sometimes
doesn't and most people don't even
realize what it means it's not a cricket
match on the ground you know we should
also take responsibility here because
the media hasn't covered itself in you
know glory in there
Rudi's either no they have it doesn't
involve ama oh absolutely I think this
warmongering is not this I mean this is
not the way because this puts a lot of
pressure and you know a lot of people
watch television a lot of people consume
that content and it puts unnecessary
pressure and I'll give an example when
Kandahar hijacking happened the Indian
plane the Indian Airlines plane got
hijacked on 24 December 25th December
was Christmas holiday it was also watch
base birthday on that day 26th of
December 25th evening all the family
members are large number of family
members of the victim plans on the plane
actually landed up at Race Course Road
and sat on a producer now that was not
the time when media was as huge and
heavy as it was now but there were a few
channels even at that point of time the
minute that live coverage of families
grieving and getting upset started
getting beamed it put pressure on the
government and that was in many ways a
big reason why the government finally
capitulated and ended up releasing
masood azhar because the public opinion
was certainly turning against them and
there was a lot of pressure purely
because that the images were going out
like what you think effectively is what
you do on Twitter at this point and on
Facebook and your outpouring of an
emotion puts unnecessary pressure on the
government as far as public you know
opinion is concerned which the
government doesn't need it needs to be
able to make decisions based on what is
right for the country not based on what
you know the general population feels
like it once yes and I think the good
news for mother for all Indians should
be that Indian diplomacy in Indian Armed
Forces are the best in the world they
are very very good they're professionals
they know exactly what to do how to do
it and I guess we need to trust them
fully in being able to handle the
situation which is appropriate I mean I
remember there was a lot of criticism
even when for instance the Prime
Minister went to the airport to receive
the the Saudi Arabian premium yeah but
you don't understand what that is
exactly most people don't understand
what that actually means because there
is a there was a need for something like
that to happen and a prime minister
doesn't do something like this without
the advice of his diploma diplomats who
know the subject way better than all of
us do so I guess we need to know learn
how to trust them we really do have some
of the best diplomats in the world we
really do have some of the best Armed
Forces personnel in the world and I
think we need to back them I think
that's the best thing we can do is to
just back them in whatever decision
they're taking and
know that they're doing it for the right
reason yes in fact Brigadier Ramallah
here joins us as well
prettier than here are many many thanks
for your time especially on a day like
this
I'm sure you've you're familiar right
now with the press conference the MEA
just arrest addressed saying that you
know while we managed to foil the
attempt of Pakistan to attack our
military installations and RAF was
responded in a timely fashion
one mig-21 bison was you know was lost
in that in the end our engagement and
the pilot is missing in action your
reaction to that said that it happened
and you know losing an aircraft when we
do not have far too many aircrafts is is
of course a loss but you know the pilot
going down and being captured I am sure
they will treat him humanely as per the
Geneva Convention and not mistreat like
they did in Cargill but I think that
this is part of the game if you if you
are into something if you are trying to
defend India in in the process some
losses or some hardships will be there
I'm sure the soldiers and Amon and the
sailors wouldn't mind undergoing that
kind of a thing and it's a matter of
pride for the family that their son went
to went to the battle went to battle and
and tottered the Pakistani Air Force
nefarious designs this is the problem
with Pakistan is here is this
we had a legitimate target which
Pakistanis could have morally ethically
or otherwise defendants Pakistan on the
other hand has no legitimate legitimate
target on our side it has been made very
clear the whole world understands what's
happening and why India had to go
actually in my personal experience of
having worked a military diplomat and
also in think tanks having met a large
number of people every time people used
to say when would India stop taking
terrorism from Pakistan without giving a
credible answer
so many of them would have been today at
least satisfied that that India has done
right secondly if India wants to be a
leading power or if India is hailed as a
net security provided in the provider in
the reason India must be able to take
care of its own security it's only
thereafter that others will trust India
to do this so I think that is good and
mr. noodle and theory both were saying
right that what is definitely not a
solution of whatever I've studied in the
military history people call them just
towards good walls bad words I mean just
wars and other kinds of walls but I
don't think any war has been good that
has done good to humanity but then it
takes two to tango and war in any case
is the most fundamental decision that
any government has to make going to war
and stopping the war fortunately we have
the experience of stopping 71 war when
when the military objectives and the
political objectives are achieved we
stopped it and stopped it at once so I
don't think other and in the absence of
rhetoric fortunately it would be
difficult to stop this kind of madness
Pakistan understands actually when this
yesterday said on the televisions that
wait for a wait for a surprise from us
and all and I was hoping I was singing
that they will announce that we have
taken note of the jihadis working from
our soil operating from our soils and
that hereby we undertake a global
community to make sure that the jihad is
no more operate from that that whatever
a pleasant surprise
yes give us any pleasant surprises yes
no but I do want to ask you this breed
and I I do want to ask you this we
understand that the airports are being
opened to the north of Delhi the
airports are closed this morning for
civilian commercial traffic does this
mean now that that both countries will
deescalate you know from from where we
are I think
actually I think you know quite a lot of
things happen you know under the under
the table as or should I say behind a
curtain many of us don't know I mean I
don't know you don't know others don't
know but things happen
back and forth communications continue
even in case of war their communications
continue I'm sure that when they when
this is opened it shows two things one
India is in a position to handle if
there is a deceitful action being
planned from other side and if in the
process there is a little bit of a loss
we will take that loss because that'll
strengthen our moral position and then
we will be in a greater we will have a
greater haften handling Pakistan
thereafter and and we will say we
trusted you there and you again
you know breached our trust that's
number one second I think there must be
some kind of a understanding on both
sides now that look whatever has
happened has happened you took an action
because you felt aggrieved we know that
war is not in our good for any one of us
and let's not accelerate the problems
and and and things are cooling down I'm
sure the second one is that is a better
option and I would pray for the second
thing if it has happened that if they
genuinely feel Buddha country somebody
must be talking to both together and
because what I also happen if you see
that Pakistan is totally and royally
isolated today I mean oh I see was
prepared symbolically was the last
bastion practically China was the last
bastion Turkey can't do anything because
Turkey itself keeps going after that
after the Kurds Kurds in Syria and in
Iraq Saudi Arabia is going after
terrorists in in the in the name of
terrorists at least they are going to
Yemen
China has millions of woo girls in
internment camps who supports China
Pakistan in this this endeavor of
nurturing jihadis in the backyard so
they are royally isolated and I think
they they must be realization in the
mind that look it is not a it's not a
good occasion to really flex their
muscles secondly which people probably
don't know very much Pakistan is
desperately short
of precision-guided munitions and
munitions of many kinds if a war takes
place they cannot sustain their forces
for a week
now this is my assessment of following
as to how their defense expenditure have
gone what they have spent the money on
and all that then extremely is in a
precarious situation militarily well it
is a precarious situation but yes I do
see your your hand go up mister there go
ahead you want to be in well you know
big India is at fury right the thing is
also fascinating in egg-like which is
foreign diplomat agree that has ego
problem there yes
mr. Dayal go ahead please brigadier is
absolutely right that us to interact
with foreign leaders and foreign
diplomats are often asked why do we
tolerate terrorism coming from Pakistan
the fact of the matter is that we don't
tolerate we counter-attack whenever we
need to and we have done that in
remarkable fashion during the last few
days of course we have all along shown
restraint also because we have ensured
that our counter action does not
escalate and become a problem in the
sense that retracting it is difficult
now sometimes these situations develop
in such a manner that two sides are
drawn into the classic ego trap you
would you don't want to appear weak need
if you work towards the escalation
I think our task is very clear-cut first
of all I don't expect
that jihadi outfits in Pakistan will
ever cease to exist they will always be
there we will always have to take care
of them and counter their activities
secondly having said that we should and
this also is true for Pakistan both
sides should not allow things to get out
of control we have to be prepared for
the worst but we have to work out of a
situation where the worst is the
scenario that confronts us domestically
there are many things that need to be
done you rightly pointed out Fay that
the media has not really conducted
itself in a manner a which really
behooves itself I think it could have
done much better at the same time the
political class also needs to realize
that it's not the sort of situation from
where mileage points need to be drawn
rather the need of the RS for the
political classes to all come together
I've watched any number of television
debates in the last few days and the
ruling party representatives and the
opposition representatives clash over
even small things I think the need of
the are is to put aside all such
differences and to come together because
at least as the nation in this sort of
crisis we should be seen to be all
standing together hand in hand yes I
would even wish for a foreign national
government because a national government
could ensure the participation of
leaders of all political parties and
together they could all work towards
what is the National good I do not know
whether that sort of thing happens it
has happened earlier in other countries
during times of war times of crises I
don't think
yet that we are in a state of war but we
are certainly heading towards a
situation where things are going out of
control and that is not desirable from
anybody's point of view of course
Pakistan has done the wrong thing by not
raining in the jihadi outfits in their
terrorist activities against India but I
think the way out of this particular
situation is that having shown Pakistan
that we can hit at these camps of the
jihadi outfit the need of the artists
for the leaders of the two sides to
somehow talk to one another to find a
way out because escalation of the
conflict would not suit anybody the
message has been sent across loud and
clear the Pakistan is also claimed to
have sent a message so as far as the ego
issues are concerned I think matters
have been taken care of but now is the
time for cool reflection and the leaders
of both sides have a great
responsibility not to let things spiral
out of control well for everyone who was
calling for more over the last 14 days
since poor Varma I think this is a
moment really to sit back and realize
the war involves real human beings and
real families who have to take up the
the task of what needs to be done so
authorities really we our thoughts are
really with the Indian pilot who is
missing in action as of now as confirmed
by the Indian government we're going to
take a very quick break but we will come
back and we'll stay with the story
India is united and we need to stay
united not just an opinion in
information and alertness
but in what we do really for the best of
our country stay with us
[Music]
good afternoon you're watching mirror
now a day after the air strike at
Pollock or across the line of control
the Ministry of External Affairs today
has said that India successfully foiled
attempts made by Pakistan to target our
military installations in India in a
media briefing the Ministry of External
Affairs spokesperson Harish Kumar has
said that India was on high alert and
that the Indian Air Force detected the
Pakistan aircraft movement and shot one
down one f-16 of the Pakistan Air Force
has been shot down however unfortunately
during that engagement one mig-21 bison
went missing the Ministry of External
Affairs has also said that Pakistan
claims that the pilot of that aircraft
is in their custody as of now the Indian
government has only confirmed so far
that the pilot is missing in action
Indian authorities are still attaining
the facts of what the status of that
pilot is probably the Alfama diplomat -
joins me on this conversation so this
brigade yatta here strategic affairs
analyst and Vinay Tiwari in the studio
with me tonight
when we when we have this conversation
yesterday it was very clear from all of
our experts that if Pakistan were to in
any way target our military or civilian
installations that would be an outright
declaration of war we understand now
that Pakistan has attempted to target a
military installation what does that
mean yes I mean so the Foreign Office
statement says so in as many words that
they made an attempt to target armed
legislations and because the Indian Air
Force was in a state of high
preparedness they became airborne and
they chase them out it was in fact
during this chase that this mig-21 fell
and we have a pilot who's gone missing
in action so well technically you can
look at it as a escalation of hostility
by Pakistan it's also an intent of
almost attacking India because remember
the Indian official position has been
that we did not it was an intelligent
operation against in a non military
operation so that's been our official
position in visa we what happened in
bulk or yesterday that this was not
meant at our army installation it was
neither meant at civilians it was purely
- aimed at a terrorist camp so there is
that distinction that while India went
in at actually attack just a terrorist
camp Pakistan chose to retaliate by
actually going after our military assets
which is almost
declaration of a hostile intent so it's
great provocation and even the second
part of the statement confirms that
India did what it meant what did you
know a defensive one when this was not
an attacking maneuver in the morning we
were responding to their aircraft and
trying to chase them back out of Indian
airspace and that's what and when that
something went wrong and a plane went
down so even now if you see this way
Indian position officially is that we
are still acting with the restraint and
despite the fact that they have chosen
to try and attack Union military
solution we have not gone into an
offensive that is pretty much the
situation and I think we need to read
that into the withdrawal of the NOTAM
where the air traffic / civilian craft
has been reopened why the CV because I
think it's very clear that the
government wants to de-escalate the
situation and not let it go out of
control the government wants to
deescalate the situation it's the same
question and and we do know that the
Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan
has made a statement and we will just
get that statement ready for you in in a
little while but probably our former
diplomat we said well what is your
reaction right now a - the statement
being made by Imran Khan where he
basically said if we let this escalate
any further it will no longer be in our
hands we make an offer one more time to
sit down and talk about it and
deescalate what's your reaction to that
welfare I said earlier - that although
it is a very big challenge but the need
of the are is to meet the challenge and
having conveyed the message to the
Pakistanis that we can hit the terror
camps inside their territory and
therefore they should wind up such
terror camps having conveyed the message
it's equally our responsibility to
prevent the situation from going out of
control as I said a little while ago
these jihadi outfits will always exist
in Pakistan they will always carry out
the handiwork of the Pakistan Army
because the Pakistan Army will use them
as their cat's paw
carrying out the proxy war so overall
the situation will not change but I
don't agree with twin earth at this time
the Pakistanis have done something new
in the sense that they have attacked our
a military installation because the
Pakistani jihadi outfits have been
targeting our military installations for
quite a long time you know patent code
Ori Baramulla
Pole vana were all attacks on our
military of paramilitary outside
we had to convey a very strong message
that things had gone too far and that
the Pakistan government had the
responsibility of reining in these
jihadi outfits and keeping the Army's
propensities in check we did send out
that message of course it takes two
sides to behave responsibilities if we
hold out an olive branch then the
Pakistanis have to be sincere in holding
out the olive branch from their side
what I heard Prime Minister Imran Khan
say does hold out a real folk but the
problem is that the Prime Minister of
Pakistan doesn't count for as much as
the unforce is do now what is in the
thinking and the strategic planning of
the armed forces of Pakistan is very
very important to figure out my own
hunches that in any conflict the biggest
casualties are taken by the armed forces
so while the Pakistani armed forces
would like to provoke us to the hilt but
I think they also realized that it is
better to stop short of actual war
because in every single war which
Pakistan has fought with us
it has taken very heavy casualties of
course we have also taken casualties but
the Pakistani casualties have been more
numerous
so at this juncture rather than try and
gain a sense of one-upmanship rather
than escalate things I think the need of
the are is to realize that from our
point of view we have sent across a
message we have made it clear that if
linearizes we can strike at the jihadi
terror camps we expect Pakistan to rein
in these terror outfits the United
Nations has spoken very clearly and
categorically against the Jesse Mohammed
so by implication other they are the
outfit the Financial Action Task Force
is taking action to prescribe the jihadi
outfits which have become a nuisance
globally because they have a global
terror potential so at this juncture
while putting out these messages it's
equally important to prevent the
situation from spiraling out of control
because I'm sure that neither sides
wants a conflagration to actually break
out a military armed conflagration
involving the full-scale might of the
two armies as I said in my first
intervention at the beginning of your
program it takes more courage to make
peace because for making peace you have
to make a compromise you're in a
compromise no side has faced way
entirely but it's a matter of
give-and-take
it's a matter of give-and-take so we
have to figure out how much we are
prepared to give and how much Pakistan
is prepared to give because questions
like that I'm afraid things will spiral
I want to ask you this question when we
say a de-escalate now and peace what is
that entail because we know that India
is not going to have a conversation with
Pakistan
unless that conversation is about
dismantling terror that has been our
official diplomatic stand does that
differ at a time like this village no
just just because mr. Dayal just mention
one point very disagree with me I just
want to just clarify on that yes
Pakistan's attack on Indian military
solutions have always been now lately
through jihadist through terrorists yes
a uniformed officer is never attacked
administration since 70 but since
curriculum in many ways right that in in
that sense what didn't government today
has said today is a big departure
because this was a partisan Air Force
plane according to the u n-- statement
which is trying to attack in a military
solution whether it was patent code or
whether it was any other base that we
were attacked with labor terrorists that
was not a pakistani army officer or a
Pakistani Air Force officer who's
attacking us so that's a big change and
this can't be taken lightly because you
have actually used your Air Force to
come and target our military
installations and in that sense the
Pakistani have have kind of ratcheted up
the hostility against India in response
to what happened in bulk code yesterday
but the de-escalation process the time
that the question that you asked me
personally was look Imran Khan's
statement can in that sense is one
indicator of that now he his statement
very obviously and I think if you notice
because we haven't put it out but the
feed that was coming in but it means it
always edited you can see there are jump
cuts in between because very obviously
he says more than he should and the
armed somebody cleans it up it's not
very well done because you can see the
jump cut so very obviously all the
statements are never live and they
always snip it out so I don't know what
he said in original but what they've put
out is actually it's like a it's like a
double-edge it thing is he's also
indirectly by see he used one staple
where he said you have certain kept
weapons and I have certain weapons he
did not use the n-word yes but he said
you have some weapons and I have some
weapons and can you guarantee that it
can't get missed there can be no
miscalculation or that so it's also a
threat in that sense the old nuclear
threat that they keep coming back with
yes but at the same time is also saying
let's go back to the table and talk
something that the Indian government is
now fed up with they really do can't
talk anymore because they've said what
do you talk about they keep talking
about talking about terror but they
never really do anything about it so but
clearly you can see that they I mean in
the sense that they there is some
conciliatory at efforts being made as
well now to ensure that did I mean the
clearly these making miss again he's
trying to indicate that let's not take
it any further because this can only
lead to some kind of mistake
or a miscalculation and that can prove
very costly for both of them in fact we
will have that Imran Khan's statement
for you and we'll play it out in in a
little while but Brigadier here my
question to you is this do you see this
perhaps as Pakistan's army vayam ranked
on saying that you know what let's stop
now because we don't want to take this
any further this is a clear call perhaps
to de-escalate fey as an optimist I
think I hope that that's what they
really mean but there is often been a
difference between what they say and
what they mean and like it was pointed
out earlier he is not his own master so
what finally the military decides that
will prevail
that's one he also never mentioned in
his statement that yes there are jihadis
on Pakistani soil that yes Pakistani
establishment is using jihadist for
their strategic ends he never mentioned
that now that puts his whole statement
under a question mark as to whether he
is sincere about it or not
you see Pakistan main goal has been
somehow take away Kashmir at least the
Kashmir value from India now that is the
ultimate goal let us say and the second
of course the in the process one very
important step has been engaging India
acknowledged get acknowledgement from
India that yes it is a disputed place
and that we have to talk and we need to
talk and the lower order is engage India
into talks and carry on
so that and that's why the Sharad of
uninterrupted and uninterrupted will
talk which I personally don't believe in
that they can't be uninterrupted
undrivable talk when you keep killing
our people so that is one so there is so
far at least there is a doubt whether
pakistan khan is sincere and whether his
word will be carried at all or not
however let me say that it's a any
adversity a leader is sometimes emerged
and if this is an opportunity for imran
khan to call the bluff of his own army
and say look I am the elected prime
minister
howsoever you may have helped me a lot
in becoming prime minister but now that
I'm a prime minister I will take my
decisions and I want peace with India
and this word can be conveyed to the
prime minister directly having said this
two things I had come back to the same
one is how Indian public and media have
behaved
fais I mean I appreciate you a good
judgement but at the same time let me
say that despite all that hype and all
that Indian media and in in public in
this particular case had behaved
extremely well there hasn't been that
kind of a jingoism which which says okay
let's march to the border let's march to
Lahore and all that kind of thing it's
fairly restrained unproven beings and
these you mean they're you know they're
their pride is hurt so many times when
our own people are killed in our own
country by others and if you go if you
don't give them that freedom of even
celebrating a little bit of happiness
then then what's the use what kind of
people are we they are not trained
diplomats to hide truth in national
interest or they're not trained soldiers
who are supposed to control their anger
and control their fear and master it I
mean these are common people that's
number one number two as far as war is
concerned nobody understands the horrors
of war better than a soldier have you
been a soldier I know how bad war is and
how bad it is for the families but to
rule out war for the sake of appearing a
good boy is not something that I will in
any case vouch for I would say that if
war becomes a necessity we must fight
and win at the same time try and give a
chance to peace and and if you have to
choose between the two
always and every time choose peace
that's what India has been doing our
Foreign Secretary's statement did not
say anything awkward
in fact they provided a face-saving to
Pakistan I listened to the Prime
Minister twice yesterday one a true and
then it is Khan temple what a dignified
way of putting things across and I know
that people at least in churu were
expecting much more bellicose kind of a
statement it triumphalism of a kind on
display but he
he extrude that kind of a thing I think
he was extremely well restrained he
behaved six men like yesterday I mean
he's good in many ways as it is but
yesterday in particular I was highly
impressed by his body language or not on
the other hand if you there's a viral
photo viral off of the Pakistani cabinet
we're in the Pakistani Prime Minister
slouching in the chair when a red scarf
and all that like I mean that doesn't
really think may give a primary serial
kind of a look so I think overall we
have behaved extremely well we have been
we have been truthful in saying that we
have lost a big fighter and that our
pilot is missing meant all this I think
this is a restrained behavior of a
confident country and I am sure that
will carry the day bringing bringing you
back when I to the statement made by the
Pakistan prime minister where he said
we're inviting India back to the table
to talk he also like you said sort of
suggested weaponry he suggested quite
worrying me for for a head of state that
once you start a wall you don't know
where it will go and you know you don't
really have full control over that
situation what's your reaction to those
statements yes and and linked to a
question begin a sub mentioned that
Pakistan the rongkhun should call the
Army's Bluff and I wish any Prime
Minister in Paris on can actually call
their armies Bluff I mean he knows it
better than I do that Pakistani Prime
Minister's however democratic elected
they may be have absolute no role I mean
they just go to unseat you the minute
you start flexing your muscles as as
simple as that I mean they didn't
they've done that many times they'll
probably do that again so he's as much
of a puppet as if they come especially
in the way in which he won this election
with the hardliners support with the
Pakistan army support another and this
particular statement in many ways you
see is a reflection of that it's really
what the army wants him to say what he's
ended up saying the trouble is and
aggregate is have rightly said Pakistan
can't be trusted they say one thing and
they do exactly the opposite this is
maybe the hundreds the time that they're
repeating this whole offer of the
so-called talks I mean this is been
going on since the Shimla agreement when
they keeps talking about holding talks
they keep talking about saying oh give
us proof and we will you know act
against this in terms of terrorism but
they never do it I mean whether it was
Parliament attack or whether it was
26/11
we've never they've never acknowledged
anything and and I think the trouble is
that even government now cannot trust
that I mean they really
have no faith on that these are two
press conferences we had two statements
one from the Pakistan Prime Minister and
one from the Ministry of External
Affairs back home now the Ministry of
External Affairs Ravi Kumar who spoke
with the with the media has not in any
way given any suggestion of what we want
to do do we want to de-escalate what is
our you know what is our aim right now
has not been has has not been suggested
at all and is that something you expect
will be told no so look its if the
briefing is being done by the foreign
ministry spokesperson it is not this
kind of a comment will not come from
pharmacies because this is really a
brass tacks briefing where he is just
clarified a few things that have been
going around in the media since morning
and they will stick to that because this
is not in the remit to go and say oh
whether you you do you don't give away
your future policy or strategy at all
certainly not in these briefings I guess
this kind of a comment can come from a
political leadership certainly but it
would not come from the bureaucrats
bureaucracy at all they will stick to
the operational details and they will
stick to the details they want the media
to know or to be shared with the public
at large so that won't happen I think we
need to await and I don't know when that
will happen when the first Indian
political comment comes through the day
if at all it does I mean my personal
senses it may not come at all it's quite
possible I don't think it'll come at the
premises level but it may come at some
other ministers level but I think that
would be a far greater significance
because it's the political class that
actually ends up indicating the mood of
what the government isn't is it
customary to have the Pakistan head of
state speak so often in this manner they
tend to speak way more than Indians I
mean they they are they are I mean in
the sense that this because that's part
of the machinery that's part of the
propaganda machine they they do so every
crime is to if you see there they speak
way more or address the nation way more
than perhaps the Indians do I mean I've
seen that happening for a very very long
time they tend to speak more and this
and if non-gun particularly is you know
because they want him to say a lot of
things he's as I said he's he's almost
like a puppet
who's being guided by what the Army's
army wants him to he he keeps addressing
the the public at large and he always
addresses in a very I mean there are
very he's a very unconventional in that
sense I mean he's unpredictable and yes
people are not really sure what he's
going to end up saying you know in terms
of the words that he chooses yes for
example things like all wars are
miscalculate
no one knows where they will lead to
World War one was supposed to end in
weeks and it took six years similarly us
never expected the war on terrorism to
last 17 years
I asked India with the weapons you have
for the weapons we have can we really
afford such a miscalculation it's an
interesting choice of words if this
escalates things will no longer be in my
control yes which is a very scary thing
yeah it's not in mr. Modi's control but
frankly it's completely in our control
it's not in their control 11 so he said
something bizarre he's saying it's not
in my control just so you know ask that
question mr. mr. Dayal as well mr.
Prabhu they are this statement that's
coming out saying that you know all boys
are miscalculated no one knows where
they will lead to with the weapons you
have in the weapons we have we can't
afford such a miscalculation what is
your reaction to that well I do think
that was always results from
miscalculation either from one party or
from both parties for far too long have
we appeared not to be reacting to the
provocations which were coming from the
Pakistani side of course these
provocations were directed by the jihadi
outfits because it was the gesture
Mohammed which took responsibility for
arre Opel vana for Pathan code for the
attack on our Parliament but at the same
time the jay-z Mohammed was doing
whatever it could at the behest of the
Pakistan Army there is an unblinking
relationship between the Pakistan Army
and did you have the outfits of course
when I was right in saying that this
very very recent incursion by the
Pakistani aircraft is the first sign of
the Pakistani military machine being
directly involved while earlier it was
the jihadi outfits who were carrying out
the
Timothy's against India but the fact
that the jihadi terror camps and
launching pads are located so close to
the border shows that the jihadi outfits
were doing the handiwork of the Pakistan
Army it says so there is a very um
little relationship between the two the
problem is that the Pakistan government
pretends that these are non-state actors
a sincere dialogue would necessarily
entail a responsibility of the Pakistan
government to clamp down on the jihadi
outfit if it does not then there is no
way out of the situation because it can
claim that it is it means well towards
India but there are these non-state
actors which are carrying out and that
the bowl of contention is Kashmir and so
on so forth if there is a sincere
dialogue then I think there is a
possibility of reining in the jihadi
outfits but of course if the position of
Pakistan continues to be insincere two
sort of distinct itself from the
activities of these outfits then I think
there is no no to any sort of progress
which is meaningful now we are getting
into a situation unfortunately where the
Pakistanis are unwilling to take any
responsibility for the sort of attacks
which are taking place on India and we
have been confronted with the situation
that we appear not to be reacting at all
I think we have come to a stage where we
have shown that we can we can act
against this outfit the Pakistanis have
shown that well they are prepared to
retaliate to I don't know how a
situation developed where our aircraft
was shot down because I think I don't
know so much about military maneuvers
but if it could have been avoided then
we wouldn't have been in a situation
where perhaps one of our pilots was in
their custody but the need of they are
all said and done is to somehow sit down
and work your way out of the situation
because not doing so would increase the
costs would
escalate the tension would let the
situation spiral upwards and I don't
know how easy it would be to bring
things down when the situation has gone
out of hand it is better to clamp things
down now
we have sent across a message they said
they would also take a retaliatory
action that's they've done so I think
wise counsel now should prevail and the
two sides should sit down and sort
things out because it is not impossible
to find a way out of any problem
particularly a political problem not
finding a way out
increases the costs of course as a
nation we would be prepared to pay the
cost if we have to but can we not find a
way of not getting into a total war
situation we have faced many wars we can
face another one the cost gets higher
and I think wise leadership should pull
the two countries out of the brink of
all that is my hope and that is my
council but we are waiting for another
briefing we understand from the Air
Force perhaps and and we get that in in
a bit of you we go to have some more
guests join us but okay join us on this
conversation first of all a marshal
thank you for joining us in good
afternoon and really just one thing just
one second Brigadier I'll come back to
you ever obviously for most of the
people in the Air Force right now their
thoughts are going to be with the Indian
with the Indian pilot from Eden Air
Force who is missing in action this is
going to be a moment of great concern
and great worry
you hear me all right somehow when we
are told that the guest is ready and the
lines are through it's not always the
case when I obviously everybody's minds
now including on social media is with
the one pilot who has been you know
who's missing in action this is what we
know there are claims again unverified
from the other side of the border that
they may be more than one but we're only
going to go and the the right thing to
do here is to go with what the
government has told us absolutely
absolutely so there is only one pilot
which the government's confirmed as
missing they still haven't confirmed
that he's in Pakistani custody even
though the Pakistan is maybe claiming
that yes but the usual process in case
that gets confirmed I mean I think the
Giddy's have alluded to that some time
back there is always a tractor that
happens behind the scenes even in a
situation of a conflict and I'm almost
certain that that process has already
started happening it can become a little
more formal when the dgo must start
talking to each other to why we are the
hotline there is a hotline that exists
between the two countries for precisely
these situations you could even have a
Digimon level meeting that may happen
between the two because that has
happened in the past if you remember
they were in Kargil a flag Renacci Gaeta
was his plane was shot down and he was
captured by the Pakistani army and he
was released after six days and all
these activities had happened then
between the Indian government and the
military DJ a most bit of the two
countries so that process is there the
only thing is the government has to
officially ascertain whether he's in
their custody or not and then it will be
a protracted negotiation because it's
not as if the Pakistanis will
immediately agree to it I think the DJO
level contact is also done because it is
it's customary for a country to call up
another country and remind them of
Geneva Conventions because after for
conventions one is meant for precisely
this kind of a situation where an enemy
plane has been shot down and somebody's
been captured there is a protocol that
you need to follow in terms of whether
it needs cygnus whether he has to be
hospitalized where he has to be treated
given humane treatment however how much
of that is done or not is another issue
but it's certainly the procedure you
have to remind the other country that
you got especially if a plane has gone
down and if he's in require medical
attention then that medical attention
must be provided not just provided you
also have to treat the man as dignity
and a man who's not in combat the Geneva
Convention says there's a minute
somebody's is found behind enemy lines
and has doesn't have his weapon on him
he's laid down his arms he's considered
not a noncombatant so in that sense
since his plane has gone down and he's
been captured he should be treated as a
non-combat and he cannot be treated as a
combatant he can't be tortured he cannot
be taken as a prisoner of war all of
that so there is established Convention
and D GMOs usually or the government
track to a level they are reminded of
that now obviously I don't think they
will say this as of now because the
Indian government hasn't verified this
claim yet Pakistan is and I think that
we're gonna take a very quick break here
a minute now but we'll come back
immediately after this and we'll stay
with this with the story India is united
right now with the forces and of course
with the one Indian Air Force pilot who
has been confirmed missing in action on
the other side of

shift in policy towards Pakistan
let's debate
there are several questions to be
answered including those coming in from
our viewers today but yes it is a day to
appreciate the skill that has been
displayed by the Indian Air Force
joining me on the show right now to
begin with is Air Marshal SG Anandi
he is not only the vice chief of the of
vice chief of the air staff he joins me
right now could evening he also
commanded this exact squadron Squadron
seven the battle axes of marshal Ananda
thank you so much for joining us and
good evening there are a lot of our
viewers who would be curious about this
particular aircraft that we're talking
about certainly today about the the kind
of activity that took place this morning
so my first question to you is this what
is the Mirage like as an aircraft what's
it like to fly it what's it like to
command
squadron 7 which I understand is among
the best of the best in the Indian Air
Force
Emily number can you hear me
we seem to have
that audio I apologize to my viewers but
we will come back to that conversation
when I obviously you know this in this
entire I think that's played out today
we've had enough people sort of analyzed
the whole thing but it does prove that
the Indian Air Force important equipment
and in training and in skill is far
superior to anything that Pakistan has
right no doubt and I think that comes
from relentless training I mean even in
peacetime and remember Indian Air Force
has not been used for an offensive act
since Kargil in that sense the Indian
Air Force as just as the army
carries out relentless training all this
while there are scenarios that are
practiced there are maneuvers that are
practiced there is a lot of dummy
testing and flying of it and various
kind of other maneuvers that are
practice all the time and all this hard
practice and a real-life simulated
condition practice that happens over the
years repeatedly comes in handy at a
time like this where you have a very
short amount of time to plan and execute
an operation and you're able to go there
and do it with precision and come back
absolutely unscathed so this this tells
you the remarkable ability of the
discipline and the skill that the Indian
Air Force pilots which are perhaps one
of the best in the world and they can
display that at any time interval short
notice as well right we have other
guests with us at this point probably
they are former diplomat joins us along
with Vinatieri who's in the studio with
me we also have Manu poppy is the senior
editor of the economic time psycho Tata
who joins us as well along with Marines
with an AJ and a Marshall math issue
Aaron who will be part of this
conversation going forward probably I'll
here's my question to you this obviously
changes how we deal with terrorism and
this puts India in a different category
altogether a lot of our viewers have
been asking if we expect any sort of you
know reaction from Pakistan one of the
questions that did come in from the wake
was is it possible to know how many
terrorists were eliminated now here's
the thing and we have to bring this up
it is our responsibility as journalists
on one hand we had the press conference
that was addressed by a bureau by the
Foreign Secretary mr. Cokely he was he
you know while he did say that several
terrorists were eliminated he did not
release a number the numbers that have
been doing the rounds in the media of
300 or 500 or 600
are so spaced from government so there
is no confirmation right now on how many
terrorists are in terms of pure numbers
have been eliminated what would your
answer be to that question do we know
how many or how could we find out how
many well my answer is that the only way
we could have a figure is on the basis
of intelligence reports and I'm sure
that before we took the step of
launching this air strike on the
launching pad of Jesse Mohammed we had
done our homework very well and we knew
exactly how many terrorists were housed
in that place so if the government is
saying that 300 terrorists were killed
or whatever number that must be based on
intelligence reports that had been
received in advance now the question is
why was such a facility located so close
to the line of control
it was located there because these
terrorist outfits are hand in glove with
the Pakistan Army otherwise the Pakistan
Army would not allow the existence of
such structures so close to the line of
control in fact it is well established
that these terror outfits like the Jay Z
Muhammad the logical automa are proxies
of the Pakistan Army and I think by
striking at the facility where such
terrorists were housed a message has
been very clearly sent to the Pakistan
Army that we will hit your proxies and
if you escalate then be prepared we
could hit you to the Pakistan Army had
always taken it for granted that they
are more aggressive than India's
pussy-footed that somehow we will not
retaliate I think time and again now the
message is going across that we will hit
much harder than what they expect and
moreover for us this is just the
beginning we can continue doing that
believe me the policy of the Pakistan
Army is not going to change and earlier
panelists during the earlier discussion
had said that if the army in Pakistan
which rules the rule
the fact of the matter is the Pakistan
Army is extremely hostile to India has
served in that country I've dealt with
Pakistan in various capacities and I
know for a fact that the hostility of
the Pakistan Army will not change
Imran Khan when he became prime minister
promised Anaya Pakistan
now that Naya Pakistan whatever form it
takes will never be a Pakistan where the
army becomes less hostile to India it
will never be a Pakistan where that
these terror outfits are not used as
proxies by the Pakistan Army so as far
as we are concerned we have to be
extremely vigilant for what will come
back to us and we have to continue
hitting much harder than what they can
expect or what they want us to yes in
fact we have a Marshall SG Nam there
with us right now I understand he can
hear me better for a quick introduction
to our viewers a Marshall enum there was
a former vice chief of the air staff
former commander-in-chief of the eastern
air command and also former commanding
officer of the 7 squadron the
battle-axes that took part in this much
this morning's Mirage 2000 precision air
strike that we've spent most of the day
or the better part of the day talking
about good evening sir and thank you for
joining us obviously our viewers are
curious about the aircraft in question
they're curious about the squadron 7
which we understand is among the best of
the best in the Indian Air Force what
was it like to command squadron 7 why do
you think the Mirage is particularly we
would like to believe that picked for
this particular action and not say the
Sukhoi the Mirage we understand was
bought in 1983 is it still the best
aircraft or specifically designed for
something like this the Mirage is a
multi-role aircraft and this particular
role the ground strike ground attack
strike role the maracas done so well
take for example the Kargil conflict
Tiger Hill was hit for the first time
and probably didn't have to hit again
after the mirages hit it with laser
bombs it's a very lethal weapon very I
could at weapon and the only way the
sangil's could be the Sanger's what do
you call them those
on top of the ridges could be tackled
struck was it the marriages iron bombs
wouldn't have that kind of accuracy or
damage effect it is a very good aircraft
all the way all wrong the sensors the
electronics the avionics the weapon
carriage the accuracy the range you name
it it's a beautiful aircraft it's been
upgraded now almost constantly
especially in the last few years I you
know I I do want to ask you this
I'm sure you've spent also a fair amount
of time actually looking into all the
information that's come out of today's
our today's a strike we understand that
the AWACS were fired for flying before
and after we also understand that the
Mirage is a you know specific capability
that can block you know GPS you know
targeting and it cannot be detected
could you tell us what about this
technology makes the aircraft special
the technology that has gone into the
Mirage from the beginning was fun time
it was inducted into the Air Force and
over a period of time has been upgraded
modified upgraded it has very very
powerful electronic surveillance
equipment very powerful eavesdropping
equipment very powerful ESM equipment
electronic support measures eccm
equipment it's a it's a quite a
storehouse of a combination of all these
technologies to handle the threats today
and maybe some of the threats tomorrow
well you know we I was reading through
what well you know what this aircraft
does have the we also understand it has
something called a digital scene
matching area correlator that allows it
to find the target and match it to a
pre-loaded or a pre given photograph of
that target so the precision of off
targeting is is is brilliant and we do
understand that the Defense Minister of
Pakistan turned around and said we
weren't able to detect this aircraft
because it was dark so quite clearly
here if the Indian Air Force has not
just embarrassed to the Pakistani Air
Force
but out does it in every way I don't
know what was more embarrassment or fear
either way the Mirage is a very very
formidable adversity to cope with for
the Pakistanis and the more the Mirage
is explored and exploited by the Indian
Air Force the surer you are off one is
of positive results the proof of the
pudding is in eating it what happened in
Kargil is going to happen now it's
happened this morning it is a very
powerful platform every which way so uh
you know we do know that the Air Force
had made this offer to various
governments in the past at various
occasions saying this is something we
can do here is a plan allow us to do it
this is the first time really that any
government has given the Air Force the
nod or the go-ahead to go out and do it
do you believe this changes the way
India will be viewed in the future this
changes the way the Indian Air Force
would be viewed globally in the future
you know your difference preparedness or
your ability to strike or to strike fear
into the enemy's hearts has two
components one is the intrinsic
capability of the Air Force or the
aircraft system that you're operating
and will to operate that system or that
capability put that capability to use
the capability has always been there and
as the chief said few days back a week
back we are very capable and we are very
prepared it's the will that was lacking
sometimes was not liking sometimes but
that is a decisive factor in how
powerful the system is how powerful
their forces capability is always there
is - will that sometimes lacking and the
live the will is in sync with the
capability oh it's a lethal combination
and that's what happened this time I
guess because happened in Kargil - so
please stay with us as I open up this
conversation to the rest of my guests as
well and of course our deep gratitude
and congratulations to the Indian Air
Force for the skill that it has
displayed
then I obviously this precision AK accra
a strike that like the marshal was
talking about changes a lot of things
but I first want to focus on the huge
embarrassment it puts Pakistan in not
just the Pakistani army but the Pakistan
government that has been making these
jingoistic statements over the last
several weeks saying what do you think
Pakistan will just be sitting back if
you attack we will be forced to give you
an answer and we're capable of giving
you an answer caught on the back foot
caught napping and not even able to
detect our aircraft yes and I think for
them it's a huge embarrassment because
they have a domestic constancy to which
they have to talk to remember Imran Khan
as a politician has had the backing of
the radical elements during campaigning
he's was openly backed by Taliban all
through he's not the Imran Khan that a
lot of Indians know while he was playing
cricket on the ground very much he's a
very different Imran Khan and and he's
got that reputation now to live up to in
many ways because the Pakistanis have
rewarded him for that hardline you know
position that he took whether the
elections were genuine or not but the
fact is he's a hardliner and now this is
extremely embarrassing because for a
hardliner
Prime Minister to be hammered like this
within their own territory with no clue
of what has happened is a deeply
embarrassing thing for them and I think
this is what what where perhaps the
Pakistani military and establishment
will have a tough time answering in fact
as we speak Pakistan's the may
journalist if Kapoor who's also the
spokesperson he's just in fact given
this dramatic statement wait for our
surprise that's what he says get ready
to be surprised this is his statement
just now two Pakistani journalists
wasn't this question he said the
response will come wait for it we have
our own plans it should be also point
out at this point that you should never
tell someone that you're going to
surprise them it tells you that they
have a pressure they have to address
their own country they're journalists
were very hostile today in the press
conferences they were asking very tough
questions and they really had no answers
to that psycho doctor South Asia editor
of ratio times exactly thank you for
joining us obviously Pakistan under
tremendous pressure both internally and
externally but if we look at what's
going on internally they've had trouble
answering any of the questions that were
asked of them today see
a post operation Neptune spare which the
US SEALs carried out in may 2 2011 the
reaction of the Pakistanis at that time
was that look most of our radars
are pointed towards the east which is
towards India which is why the Americans
managed to surprise us but we will not
be able to be surprised any further so
in some ways we have to understand that
what the Indian Air Force did today was
not really to kill too many militants or
terrorists in the jaish-e-mohammed camp
nor was it to show what is the power of
the Indian Air Force etcetera I think
the real message was that India is
willing to change the threshold
completely unlike what it has done in
the past that's point number one point
number two the fact that despite
whatever claims the Pakistanis have made
since the last operation by the
Americans that you could go such so deep
into a province which is the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa and scary out an operation
like this is another message that has
gone that India is not only willing but
India's also has the ability to do
something like this
also remember Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is in
some ways the main base of the villain
this is a province which his party has
been rooting for a long time and it also
sends among other things a message
directly to him but also a word of
caution which is that unlike the moody
surgical strikes the one thing that
nobody should be doing right now
especially in India is to turn this into
a political fiasco and use this for
votes because moment you do that it puts
enormous pressure on the soldiers and
the fighter pilots and the military and
it actually ends up reducing our
strategic options and that should not be
done at all well we also have a Marshall
math Ishwara who's with us joining us
out of Cochin so thank you for joining
us obviously and and we've seen this
play out today at least the opposition
stood with the government there was
absolutely no disagreement in any way
about the action that was taken there
was a procession for the Armed Forces
specifically the the Air Force so so far
at least
nobody has gone down that route of
playing politics with this but it is an
important message that we've sent not
just externally but also internally to
the people of India that this is
something that we are no longer going to
tolerate and marshallmatters should go
ahead
thank you for yeah absolutely
it's not about you know what you have
destroyed and ground on how many people
you killed etc it's more about
demonstrating a resolve that India is
change tack it will respond to the
terrorist strategy that Pakistan has
been following for the last 30 years
with a very firm application of force
and it's going to make it harder for
Pakistan and make it make the pain count
much more for Pakistan so this is
something we should have done long back
you know we should have done in 2001 on
the aftermath of the attack on
Parliament we should have done when
Mumbai attack took place in 2008 I think
it's never too late
the I think all congratulations the
political leadership we have taken the
final decision we cross the Rubicon of
depending on the air power to strike
immediately and this is something that
should be done it is not enough to
demonstrate just once I think we should
now indicate that this will become the
strategy and we will not hesitate to
apply force where it hurts the most and
I think we should just target the
terrorist outfits track the terrorist
leaders get there put a price on their
head and get them out at any cost I
think we need to you know stick with
this policy consistently and do not you
know go about you know using it as a
political you know game playing between
the parties I think that should be
stopped and I'm glad that all political
parties are together than this we should
analyze what has happened and we should
dress we should expect to the Ferguson's
to react and the whole thing is about
calling the bluff of the Pakistanis
retaining escalation control with us in
the nuclear Bluff should be called and
show them that we will hit them
metals most if they try and resort to
the kind of things that they've done so
far for the last 30 years mr. Taneja
with the BJP joins us as well mr. Kurita
obviously the opposition stood with
government all through the day there was
in fact widespread appreciation for the
Armed Forces specifically the Air Force
and the government for the will and the
ability that was displayed in doing this
so quickly catching Pakistan by surprise
and bringing all of our pilots back
completely safe so it is a testimony to
the rest of the world that we can set
aside our political differences when it
comes to it oh yes I mean if you look at
the history in 1971 when the then Prime
Minister took that decision you know to
go into what is now known as Bangladesh
you know just dig into archive and see
the statement made by BJP leaders most
particularly by you know later she hurt
and very much pipe so I mean that's
that's the has been the tradition of the
country when it comes to when our
country's under attack we are all united
so today it's not about BJP or Congress
or CPM and all that is about India
it's about our country it's about the
public of India and even the decision as
you know that this is a the way we look
at it in BJP and the government is say
it's a non-military non-military you
know action that we have to take is more
kind of pre-emptive because we knew
these are terror bases there as we know
they were preparing to you know strike
not only Jammu and Kashmir but in
different parts of the country and we
were left with no other alternative to
go and take take this action and as you
know under the international law I mean
it's a country if you are failing if
facing a threat from such terrorist
groups you can take action is permitted
by the under the India that's precisely
what we have done and of course to sell
you to to to avail or and you know
professionalism of Indian Air Force in
particular our own forces and that this
is a very decisive and strong leadership
our prime engine are in the moti so and
that's the user prime minister for
everybody whether you are in Congress or
CPM or BG
and all that is the Prime Minister of
Republic of India so he's very decisive
leadership and very strong leadership
and results are there for everybody to
see but he's as he said it's about the
country and he said it's a message to
Pakistan it's a message to Pakistan that
don't mess up don't stop doing what you
have been doing all these years all
these decades in fact otherwise then
India today of 2019 is very different
India and we will if required we will
take action they are issuing threats and
they're talking the way they are talking
and some leaders are even talking about
you know all kind of stuff including
nuclear and all that India is prepared
the people 1.30 billion in 1.3 billion
Indian our armed forces our government
people every single Indian is prepared
so and they should know that we are
prepared yes we are prepared manu
Pahlavi does this change of course
everything going forward because now
this is the country that we are this is
the response that people give out so any
any further escalation and including
Pakistan saying things like a wait we
will also surprise you the response to
that as well will now be aggressive the
interesting part here is that Pakistan's
retaliation options are very limited see
we have not struck a Pakistani military
target that's why the important
statement with a foreign secretary is
saying that we run a non military
preemptive strike so when you're not
striking the military of Pakistan and
you've struck non-state actors the
Pakistani establishment has not much of
a choice on retaliation because they
don't admit that they have terrorists on
their soil so if somebody dies there
they cannot really you know take revenge
for that so their valuation we are
expecting would be similarly to what
followed say the surgical strikes you
know remember after surgical strikes two
months after that there was another
terror attack in a groat Ivanych an army
camp was attacked
so Pakistan's favorite tool for
retaliation seems to be to use its
non-state actors so we could see a lot
of more aggression on the LOC
we could see maybe more terror attacks
sponsored by Pakistan but what has
really changed is that you know by
bringing in this air dynamic we have
changed the whole way that we ruled ALC
with them as of today it was all about
ground-based attacks it was about you
know army troops facing each other
bringing
the element has run a surprise it has
put the Pakistani Air Force and the
Pakistani military off balance now what
they do with it has to be seen the other
option they have is you know post Kargil
when we lost a few fighter jets we lost
the fighter jet and a couple of
helicopters we took down a Pakistani
naval aircraft the Atlantic that was
after the Kargil war so a similar action
could be planned by Pakistan remember we
are a lot of helicopters and small
aircraft flying around the elsi we have
troops to support there so they have a
few options on the table but yes
escalation is most likely going to
happen but I would not imagine that they
would strike an Indian military target
because then that could mean an act of
war and that's an escalation that can't
be controlled by either side then which
could blow into full-scale conflict
well mr. Patel I just want to bring up
you know one piece of information to the
roaches of my off of the audiences well
the acting spokesperson of France's
Ministry of Europe and foreign affairs
has made a statement saying France
recognizes India's legitimacy to ensure
its security against cross-border
terrorism and it asks Pakistan to put an
end to its operations of terrorist
groups established in its territory so
this is very very strongly worded you
know statement coming from France mr.
Dodd this now obviously the West will
begin to now give us their statements
because this is just about waking up and
hitting the office at this point but
this as the first statement to come from
Europe is strongly worded for in our
favor well the French have already
indicated how they think about the whole
matter because they had said that they
would sponsor a resolution in the UN
Security Council against the Jesse
Mohammad and they did so of course the
United Kingdom and the u.s. also joined
them the French have also been very
helpful because they have been putting
pressure on Pakistan in the financial
action task force now as regards this
question of Pakistan retaliating of
course we know that they want to
retaliate this is the Beyond and end-all
of this policy the Pakistan Army has its
declared policy of wanting to inflict a
thousand cuts on India and all these
terrorist outfits which act as its
Roxie's say quite the same thing we know
that they want to hurt us but we should
hurt them many times more sacred my very
dear friend said that the intention was
not to kill it was only to change the
perspective I think that if they kill 30
of our soldiers or 40 of our soldiers we
should hit back big time and kill 300 of
this that's the only language which
Pakistanis understand if they inflict a
thousand cuts on us they should know
that we will inflict a million cuts on
them
and I think the message has started to
go across and the more and more they
suffer in all respects economically
politically by being isolated and
militarily the more the chances are that
they will come to their senses otherwise
the Pakistan Army which is so hostile to
India will continue to work hand in
glove with these terrorist outfits to
try and hurt us and earlier this
panelist in your discussion had said
that we have to be very vigilant they
can carry out little attacks and and
terrorist acts all over the country of
course every Indian has to be vigilant
because we can't afford to let the guard
down but we have to take every possible
step to send the message across to
Pakistan that if you try to hurt us the
cost will be too heavy for you and
unless we do it in a very very
determined fashion Pakistan will think
that this sort of attack is one-off and
they can continue to pursue that policy
of promoting covert warfare or terrorist
warfare against us yes a martial Anantha
obviously when Pakistan says that they
are going to surprise us and we should
probably wait for a surprise from them
every possible retaliatory action would
have been weighed in as part of
intelligence as part of the planning
this do you do you expect right now for
all the agencies to be on on high alert
and what would that look like
you know you can't put an agency or a
particular wing of the unfortunate
perpetual alert it loses the very impact
of alertness there is a limit to which
you can keep
elastic stretched but once you keep keep
it stretched for a long time it loses
what they call the young's modulus comes
in and then you do not have any us
inner-city elasticity left you have to
depend on intelligence inputs and
periodically engage in activities like
wargames exercises activations to convey
an impression that you are brushing up
your alertness
brushing up your preparedness your
readiness for war very regularly and
there is no known letting your guard
down that is different from being on a
24-hour alert seven days a week 12 once
a or you can't do that even Americans
don't do that on North Korean border
they have a stand up stand down there
they have a stand to there but there's a
pattern to it they can't be on a
permanent alert permanent stand wire for
operations within within these two there
is a space in which one can be alert one
can be watchful and be ready for instant
action what one of the Chiefs had called
a cold start that's possible and what
stage of readiness do you believe we
would our forces would be at at this
point as Macca's
one could expect them to wean when the
retaliation were Pakistan is only to be
expected how when and where it's
something that time will tell but that
they will be repost that there will be a
revaluation deliver reaction it's it's a
given to expect it not to be put we're
living in a fool's paradise and this I
am quite certain with her experience
hindsight to the last 40 years the no
country can do it India certainly will
not do it certain India hasn't done it
I'm quite certain about you can't let
your guard down not with the way the
Pakistani army is built their only
ambition in life is to sort of sort out
India in fact a friend of mine once told
me in one of my visits overseas in these
conferences that Kashmir is not an issue
between you and India you and Pakistan
Pakistan and India even if you give
Pakistan on a silver platter to Kashmir
on a silver platter to Pakistan
the army will find something else to
keep it's a keep keep having areas on it
for it to win existence does not just
Kashmir it's the very clean of Pakistan
army the problems not the Pakistani
state as I see it is the Pakistan Army
and this something happens to that
something is done to that this problem
will never go away
it can cannot be wished away as I
clearly said and the way we must
acknowledge that the Pakistan Army has
always been very powerful it's it's more
powerful than in other countries it's a
volatile state it's always gone back and
forth between martial martial law where
do you see or how do you see the
Pakistan Army actually reacting now to
this embarrassment and being part of the
obviously they would be at the forefront
of any sort of retaliation that's being
planned yes and the old joke oldest joke
about that is that every country has an
army Pakistani army has a country so
that pretty much tells you the
relationship that the Pakistani army has
with its stablishment I mean they run
that place there's no doubt about that
even when there has been periods
intermittent periods of civilian rule
it's pretty much the army that runs and
decides everything it's a just way too
powerful and and obviously a lot of the
policy decision-making and other
activities that happen there are guided
by Pakistan Army and the eyesight is
really an extension of them they're not
really separately part of the Army in
that since and that's why but I think
generals have said it very rightly bad
habits return and I don't think we
should get accomplished and they have a
tendency of coming back so just because
we've gone in an attacked bulk or
doesn't mean we've seen the last of it I
mean they are going to come back with
something new because that is the only
way in which they can survive and retain
the relevance and the other perspective
we have to give our our audience this
evening is that while Imran Khan will
show up to a briefing after an attack
like this wearing a leather jacket and
red stuff and you know he's all Swagger
that he used to be on the cricket field
this is not that same man this is a man
who is backed by extreme you know arms
of terror by the Taliban while he was
you know while he was campaigning this
is this you know you have to be very
careful about how we deal with this man
yes and also because look he has no real
administrative experience I mean he he's
he's a he's a newer politician in that
sense I mean he's not like say
hypothetically is Nawaz Sharif who's
been there and done that
for many many years I mean he's a new
politician who hasn't administered
anything he's got no intuitive
experience at all and the way and the
manner in which he came to power in
Pakistan pretty much tells you that he's
almost a hostage to a lot of others
kinds of elements including the army and
I would even say some of the non-state
forces that exist in that country he's
pretty much a hostage to them so if he's
unpredictable in that sense and the kind
of pressure that he perhaps has from
them will determine the food next course
of action
psycho death are the balance between
Pakistan's prime minister and the army
at this point how important is that
going to be to any sort of let's say
surprises that they're planning for us
so what's in race
Pakistan has made it very clear that
they will the pockets of all of no come
on Authority tomorrow so this is a fair
it's a psycho Tata please this is a fair
amount of indication that the Pakistan
is yes they've called for a meeting of
the National Command Authority tomorrow
and as a result this is a fair
indication that they are very keen to
retaliate you also have to understand as
when has been talking about this that
the Pakistani army uses India as a bogey
for its own existential purposes to a
large extent so any kind of an attack of
this nature raises a lot of questions
and creates doubts in these minds of the
Pakistani citizens about the
capabilities of its military and this is
something that they'll be acutely aware
of and to ensure that these kind of
doubts are set aside I'm sure the
Pakistani army would be thinking of ways
and means to regain some of the prestige
that they have lost today and and as we
have seen during the campaign
Prime Minister Imran Khan has always
been sort of protal even he's been
speaking about the Taliban he's also
been fairly close to the military and in
many ways he was used by the Pakistani
army to edge out Nawaz Sharif and the
other civilian parties which were there
so there is a close relationship and and
it's a symbiotic relationship so that
will create a completely new mix as far
as India is concerned absolutely yes
emotionally not never forgive me you
wanted to add something please go ahead
no I just wanted I agree with them
entirely
if the Kashmir issue is a no-show
tomorrow if there is no point of
contention between the two countries
Pakistan army has a problem existing
they have no reason to be around and
they would be facing demobilization a
big time because there is no reason for
Pakistan to even have an army or Navy or
Air Force the way it has today if there
is no conflict in India and Pakistan I
don't think they can ever afford to do
that and having tasted blood once or
twice since it's kind of Wizards time of
running the country bring the biggest
beneficiaries
the state we get stockholders on the
Karachi Stock Exchange because real
estate holders in Pakistan everything
now that we go and that they can't
afford to do there's no way there is let
it go and any Prime Minister comes to
power in Pakistan it's it's academic for
the Pakistan Army he'll only front for
them as well as he can in the terms they
dictate the army dictates tomorrow if
Iran Khan doesn't wants to buck the army
chief who the de-facto head honcho of
Pakistan I don't think in ranking him
will last too long
not at all they're not showing that door
will it make any relevant do something
and he knows it he knows it very well
what what he also knows is that being a
very fearsome fast bowler in his earlier
years throwing that little red cherry at
the batsman of the Furious speed he was
only going to hurt the batsman or the
batsman is going to hurt the ball in
terms of throwing it to the boundary in
this case the batsman is good throwing
the weapon sat or ball at he's going to
come and hit him back that doesn't
happen in cricket
that sort of repose to his personal harm
or body how about the party house that
doesn't happen in cricket
nobody ball get the ball you only get
thrashed to the boundary that that's
different ballgame
reading the red guy in the wrong place
right k the wrong place oh the wrong guy
in the wrong place Manu Bobby a senior
editor with the economic times do you
agree right now that Imran Khan finds
himself in a difficult situation and all
the experience from the cricket field is
not going to come in handy here he
possibly shouldn't use the experience
from the cricket field so clearly he
calling the shots on this one you know
it's gonna be the Pakistani military out
and out and for them you know even the
denials that nothing happened the kind
of pressure that they are in to
retaliate it's humongous remember that
the strike took place at a place which
is very close to Abbottabad you know
they have already got a one strike there
one from the other border so the public
is asking questions and you know there
that is what they need to answer but
again as we said earlier the their
options are limited but you know I think
in this case if they do do something
overt the escalation then will not be in
their hands and you know the Indian side
at this moment the way that they have
reacted to these terror attacks of the
past they are willing to go all out so I
think that all is weighing in to both
sides it's a game it's a mind game
between India and Pakistan but on the
Pakistani side it's definitely the army
chief and the ISI establishment that is
doing all the thinking Imran Khan in
this case would just be somebody who
would say the right thing at the right
time and keep it at that the same time
of course we have to see what kind of
you know talk has been on in the Western
world you talked about the French
statement remember there's been no
condemnation for the Indian strikes and
in fact diplomatic sources have told us
that they are more or less okay with
this because they reserved they think
that near reserve the right to retaliate
so when there's no international
pressure on India the Pakistani military
establishment it gets even more
desperate to show that they are safe
they can strike back it's a dangerous
situation but definitely the military is
doing all the thinking you're not Imran
Khan for sure well I have one quick
question for a marshal and I'm there
obviously
Pakistan has made renewed army yes made
weak arguments about the fact that this
didn't really happen and we have proof
in fact the last thing that was said in
the press conference by the Pakistan of
you know defense minister was we have
helicopters ready we'll take the
international media with us to show you
the location but right now the weather
is not good so we can't take you there
so actually all of the arguments were
fairly weak but you understand the
aircraft in question really well there
is of course electro-optics of
photographs of videos at home the word
would have been made through the entire
operation so all of the things that
Pakistan says right now will obviously
be false and would could very easily
prove be proven us so if India chooses
even to to acknowledge any of these
statements with with the response you
see the operative word is PSD a post
strike damage assessment that is the
proof of the pudding what happened is
captured in photographs and footage
everything and you also have pictures
taken from satellites all this put
together
it's the ultimate proof that something
happened on the ground the way India is
claiming and if and when the government
of India therefore deems it proper
appropriate they will bring it out and
once that is brought out I don't think
they'll when you're room to doubt what
happened you're right they have to have
that proof and they've another proof you
can't send a strike without having that
substantive amount of proof about the
damage assessment it's it's integral to
the plans integral to the action it's
been it's been so for a long long time
it's all in it so it has to have been
captured in photographs and films so
obviously Vinay there is there are
photographs there is film the government
will decide when it is appropriate to
actually release all of that and it's
also I think interesting here to view
that the government has not acknowledged
any of the things that Pakistan has said
during the day about oh this didn't
happen or oh there's you know it none of
the eyewitnesses will give you any proof
because our Air Force will have all of
the documentation it will have like you
know the Air Marshal was telling us it
will have photographs it will have video
will have satellite imagery which like
you've pointed out is much better now
than it was in the past India has great
satellite capability as well so in terms
of embarrassing for you son are you
smarting Pakistan both in technology in
skill and here in intent Pakistan has
lost the day hasn't it oh they have and
and the satellite imagery superiority
that India enjoys and a massive security
that they enjoy it would have come in
handy even in the planning of this thing
because remember Pakistan has been
shifting around its terror camps in was
Afra bad in other parts of be okay and
to have position aside information
requires that kind of high-resolution
image
India has a huge superiority over in the
last seven eight years or so we've made
huge progress and rapid strides on that
for sure
liban remember listen Pakistan as a
country has this and even during Kargil
and I think psychic will bear us out
because he was there even you're in
Kargil Pakistan when to the extent of
actually burying their own uniform so
just to hide the casualty number they've
gone to that extent they have known to
have done that they have known to have
not allowed any evidence of to remain of
how many people actually died in there
so they've done something as costly as I
can say as that to actually prevent
evidence so there is no guarantee that
they wouldn't do the same thing again so
you want it all surprised by the fact
that they denied everything this month
oh absolutely not I mean that's the only
option they had what else can they say I
mean look they denied it but just about
an hour and a half back simcha for
actually accepted it that the Indian
planes came four or five miles not much
inside so they've also accepted it yes
the only quibble can be over the number
of casualties but then that's easy I
mean in a mountainous region which is
inaccessible it's aware of civilian
areas a Pakistani army is entirely
capable of actually hiding the number of
people who died there burying their
bodies some somewhere around and not
showing it to the international
community which they are claiming they
will take them and show so that's not to
be trusted at all I think the real fact
is that they have acknowledged India's
gone inside Linnaean Army Air Force has
struck them and the fact that they are
now sounding that rattle tells you that
the desired impact of what should have
been done has happened I think the other
thing we must acknowledge in Marina
Tunisia is here the pre this sort of
communication that came out of our
governments today was so very well
controlled and orchestrated and mature
they were various ministries that were
involved in the planning of this
operation but communication entirely
handled by the Ministry of External
Affairs the Foreign Secretary making the
statement initially to begin with then
we had suspicions Faraj we understood
was the minister was speaking to other
members of the international community
very maturely very carefully handled and
for that again we must acknowledge the
work done by the Indian government to
ascertain Asia yes yes absolutely I mean
if you look at it you know there is a
difference between India and Pakistan
India is respected the world over for
peace for very mature conduct of
international relations and for showing
patience I mean the world acknowledges
they know
that you the action that we have taken
and we repeatedly said at the level of
the you know foreign secretary and other
that for us this is a non-military
action we were forced to take it because
they were preparing a planning to attack
us
so in self-defense we had to do it we
have not attacked any military
installation Pakistani military or
economic and severely problem done we
haven't done that and we don't have any
you know terrorist camps in India that
they're in return for instance if they
want to retaliate they will attack we
don't have any such things now the point
here basically they're three broad
points I would like to make here number
one is that you know look at look at the
reality on the ground in Pakistan their
economy is in a very bad shape it's in
shambles they don't they have hard
currency you know or hardly for seven to
eight weeks even beyond that they would
be neither need to go to China or to
solve the Arabia and Saudi Arabia would
also tell them the same thing that
looked down to skillet China has already
in a way very diplomatically conveyed a
message to them after all China is
invested so much in Pakistan they would
not like like any kind of his collation
and they are china-pakistan economic
corridor actually passes through the
area that is known what they call
whatever but we call it is our Kashmiri
spy you know Pakistan Occupied Kashmir
they have invested so they probably are
not going to tell them they're going to
tell them don't escalate and the second
point is that look at the international
reaction France you just mentioned look
at Australia but Australia had to say
look at other Western countries and also
even China our foreign minister is on
way to China she will be in China in
next three hours and talking with the
top leadership in China also with the
Russian leadership because she is there
to attain you know India Russia and
China summit now more the third
important point here is that we have
conveyed it to the world repeatedly the
world knows it's a well that as far as
we are concerned we all we are telling
Pakistan we've been saying for years now
please you know shut down all those
terrorcons though terror schools jihadi
schools these terror factories so we
have been telling this and now we have
been compelled we have been forcefully
to this action we have nothing against
the people of Pakistan absolutely
nothing but they have to shut down these
terror camps and all that if they can't
do it if they think they are helpless
then we have to take action
absolutely and
action India has I want to thank my
panelists for being kind enough to give
us your time especially on a day like
this in conclusion India has taken very
decisive action and India has stepped
into Pakistani territory to send a very
clear message that we will not tolerate
terror and we will do whatever is
necessary and whatever it takes to shut
down terror completely the India knife
was proving superior in every way in
skill in equipment and in intent the
Indian government backed with the
opposition showing a united front that
India will do what it takes to protect
her people well simply put Imran Khan's
bowling has been logged for a six by the
Indian Air Force
today he lost to the India one thanks

D.B Shekatkar on Indian Air Force strike on terror camp across ...,2019-02-26T07:46:44Z,MIRROR NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9NLN4TmRVRU/hqdefault.jpg,"joining me on the show right now is
Major General PK Sehgal who joins us in
this conversation
major circle thank you for joining us we
did hear of course the foreign secretary
briefed the briefed the press very
careful use of words they're very
carefully worded briefing and it did it
did it does seem of course a far clearer
than the messages or the responses that
are coming in from across the border at
this point he said very clearly that it
was non-military there were no civilian
casualties and the target was maulana
yusuf a sir the brother of Masood Azhar
and that target has been destroyed
major-general Sega this action by us he
gets very many things yes this action by
us clearly depicts very many things
firstly Palama has been a wedge in a
very significant manner secondly we
inflicted a huge amount of losses on
Pakistan in terms of physical casualties
we destroyed two to three hundred
business of their tariffs we destroyed
three of their donor centers from where
they were controlling operations in this
area the physical infrastructure has
been destroyed weapons have been
destroyed and Buddha's mother has been
killed it is also displaying to the
world and to India and to Pakistan
the political will which has been once
again displayed in very very clear terms
after after worried Pakistan always
thought that India rose but does not
right now they know that India had not
only rose but attacks and X in a very
very well thought through manner what
the Indian Air Force has been able to
achieve is a virtually unparalleled
Pakistan was enough for war alert its
air defenses are deployed its combat air
patrols were patrolling the skies 24
hours a day
its operational readiness platforms are
in place despite that we carried out a
strike and succeeded in totality 12
aircraft went at three different places
and at every place they hit with
precision and were able to destroy out
Pakistan targets in pitch darkness and
come back in totality
like the previous surgical strike
everybody who went and came back
safely this is something that Pakistan
had not thought of Pakistani
spokesperson as always have gone into a
denial mode
they said they scramble their 60s The
Mirage eastern turtle and drop their
weapons prematurely but the visuals are
showing something different the very
fact that two to three hundred people
have been killed on the Pakistani side
is clearly indicative of the success
that we've been able to achieve and what
is very important is that India is a hit
only the terrorists there has been no
collateral damage to civilian property
or to military property or to the Air
Force property under these circumstances
India is very category he told the world
that we exercise the right of
self-defense and the world is with us
Pakistan has has no business to
retaliate at all because what will it
hit we did not hit any civilian targets
or Air Force Army or any industry of
theirs so what to tell you civil
Pakistan carry out with a small target
they should they do anything it will be
a huge escalation for which they'll be
accountable and responsible and they
will be in for universal condemnation
and we've clearly shown them the
superiority of the Indian Air Force and
the Indian Indian decision making the
type of targeting that has been done the
type of routing that we picked up we
were able to avoid detection action by
most of their at us and the aircraft
flew over aircraft flew over areas which
are the least possible air defense
concentration all the dense air defense
concentration areas were avoided with
the result that he could do nothing to
the mirages
on their route way in Iran the way out
was the terrorist training camps were
hit they were very aware they were there
and become fully aware of the fact that
they Indian Air Force had got it
even then they could not intercept them
or destroy them on the way out
my huge compliments to a very
professional work done by the Air Force
I for the 71 for myself as a pilot with
the Indian Air Force as part of the
European the difference between then Air
Force and now is minus 200 even that
time the Indian Air Force was very
professional and we were the ones who
broke the back of Pakistanis both in the
eastern theater as well as leviston
theater and once again
F was a displays its this has
demonstrated its professional equipment
without any doubt left in anybody's mind
whatsoever and one good thing unlike the
restrike surgical strike after worried
the opposition had gone to town by
saying that we have not carried out
anything like this and they wanted
proofs now the entire country in
unanimity is standing with the forces
there's a rejoice across the country
even Rahul Gandhi has gone on to say
that I compliment the Air Force for
their not very professional job but my
my question to you me also beer also
joined right now by leftenant general
Shekar who joins us welcome to this
conversation
my first question my question goes back
to major-general say girl we have seen
Imran Khan and the other you know and
other messages from Pakistan over the
last couple of weeks talking about how
they are on high alert how they've put
their entire or their forces again on
the border on high alert the fact that
our Air Force managed to go in and come
out and achieve its target without
detection how commendable is that and
what what sort of equipment would have
been used how did we manage to do it in
your opinion accepts exceptional
professional acumen has been displayed
it is clearly indicated that Pakistan
does not have the wherewithal either to
detect us against the type of electronic
warfare that must have been used against
the type of routing that we took took
against the type of targeting that we
did and their f-16 do not have the
capability to take on the Mirage f-16
has a hazard look up and look down
capability and shoot up and shoot down
capability far inferior to the marriages
there I just could outshoot them and out
out again them before that before the
f16 could close in the garages would
have destroyed them out of the sky with
the result that f-16 that was scrambled
moment they saw this large concentration
of barrages they infected turtle and
went back and said of the Indian sir
that as claimed with Pakistani attorney
telling turtle which clearly indicates
that Pakistan armed forces are not that
professional as the Indian Armed Forces
that is the reason why they got a
licking in 4865 71 and 99 till today
they are stunned and feel humiliated at
the type of licking licking that we
inflicted live in the past force and
should they show the courage and the
guts to take up consoles with us again
the outcome would be similar to the
previous force let they would not be the
slightest or doubt in Pakistan's mind
absolutely Major General we we also have
left an energy gb shaker car who joins
us right now left hand chair of shaker
card India showing its ability to give
the enemy a bloody nose if necessary yes
madam I will not go into technicalities
of these and details of the thing I'll
basically concentrate on philosophy the
philosophy of punishment to our enemy
technical leader of no use to anybody
first and foremost Pakistan
unfortunately did not leave us with any
other choice but to respond and to
respond well secondly Pakistan never
thought did not anticipate that we will
go to the extent another blunder they
committed thirdly they think they can
get away in the same way in future also
they have been telling us before I have
been in 65 war for the war same area
where this strike has taken place not
very far from there in 71 I have fought
the war I was controlling these
districts as a major-general
so I know everything about it that is
not the issue at all the issue is why
are they taking the ability with us this
philosophy of Breed India by thousand
cut it is ok for you we are now given
you shown you that we can give you one
cut this is not the cut this is only a
touch if we start giving you two cut and
if we just give you 100 cuts the map of
Pakistan may have to be chained
the political map would you like to
invite this we leave it to Pakistan the
next point might have been this it's a
philosophical point we lost valuable
lives from 17 states of India the
children have become almost orphans the
lady wife has become widow should we
accept this and dead to a third-rate
country which claims to be our enemy
number one well if you are calling
yourself enemy number one then we will
have to think twice now should we behave
with you keeping this in mind the
government was left with no other option
but to us their force and also the army
to be ready to respond and when you
respond you respond well they were under
accusation many I am don't want to go
into the political aspect of the thing
oh well there's a past
nothing has happened many time the
surgical strike which is conducted this
also Air Force surgical strike we had
done earlier but was the defender strike
it can take two years to plan but this
has been done like within half an hour
or aircraft and across the line of
control they are wide order all the
detection they probably misled there are
lots of Pakistan army they hit those
areas where we were sure that the
terrorists are there their supporters
are there their leaders are there we did
not kill innocent people and then within
half an hour after doing the job our
pilots came back and was not at one
place they have a hit at different
places I don't want to tell deliberately
where all they have gone the Pakistan
will never tell you they will not tell
you in fact they will say we never went
there so good luck to them that is okay
perfectly fine from their point of view
the point is madam this is just a signal
if you invite us again we will come back
to you in a different form in different
modes we are not hit
therefore basis we are not hit the
villages we are not anybody else
we are target has been only terrorists
and terrorist sponsoring places that's
all so don't force India to retaliate
even now is the time to behave the world
leadership is telling you to behave your
supporters are telling you to behave
your finances are telling you to behave
those who have given you weapon they are
telling you to pay those who are giving
you money to create a nuclear bomb
they're telling you to behave if you
want to commit suicide even the God
cannot help you and this government and
the people of India are not going to
take it back now let this be very sure
those days are gone we lost four hundred
and more than four hundred boys at
Bombay in the form of gossip and we kept
on giving lectures we will do this we
will do that question banks in general
say the government is chained the
people's need to change which is general
sagal obviously and I want to take it
back to what you said earlier you said
the f-16s that the Pakistan Air Force
flies obviously is no is no match for
the mirages that are that our Air Forces
is flying but I want you focus right now
on the fact that there was of course the
the AWACS step of flying this morning
was picked up by civilian apps as well
that there was some activity on our side
we were on high alert would it be
possible that we were expecting some
sort of retaliation from the Pakistan
Air Force early early this morning
around along the bottom no we've got to
be fully alert because Pakistan if you
recall everyone current gone on record
to say loud and clear that if there's
any any punishment by India or any
retaliation by India they will retaliate
he said I have no doubts but it will be
full Rd on their part to retaliate we we
have retaliated after having thought
through for 12 full days the targets
were selected was great amount of care
the planning was done with great amount
of anything then done currently where
Pakistan would ask for devastation on
the part of Pakistan we will be able to
break these back of theirs
now the indian air force has also gone
on an alert western air command the
combat air patrols are in position
round-the-clock the operation already
place these platforms are being
maintained but our pilots are ready to
scramble within five minutes
air defense weaponry has been destroyed
deployed under these circumstances any
action taken by Pakistan would be
suicide for Pakistan and I don't think
they will succeed they may have
attempted to do something early early
morning I am NOT I am not aware of it
but they would have recoiled seeing that
they would not sense not succeed under
any circumstances as I said it warm a
you got to think through very carefully
every plan has to be well made every
sort of a contingency has to be looked
into and rest and over asked to ensure
success then you do something at a
moment chance in the instant except
except for suffer suffering major
casualties they would have gained
nothing whatsoever yes in fact in the
comment that you read earlier the
opposition has also been appreciative of
the immense work done by the Indian Air
Force through the night and early this
morning mr. Mallikarjun car he is making
a statement to the press right now who
just listen in okay which eye and bring
that back to give our viewers an update
of what's happening we now have an
official statement from the finance from
the Foreign Secretary mr. Vijay Goel who
has put out a statement that a hard copy
of the statement is now with us
he said information regarding the
location of training camps in Pakistan
and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir had been
provided to Pakistan from time to time
India has been repeatedly urging
Pakistan to take action against the
Jesse Mohammed and prevent jihadis from
being trained and armed inside of
Pakistan territory
Pakistan has taken no concrete action to
dismantle the infrastructure of
terrorism on its soil he went on to say
it isn't it was an intelligence led
operation in the early hours of this
morning
India struck the biggest training camp
of Jasher Mohammed in balla coat this
operation a very large number of Joshi
Muhammad terrorists trainers senior
commanders and group
of jihadis who were trained for Faden
action were eliminated this facility at
Pala Court was headed by Maulana Yosef
Azhar or Asad curry the brother-in-law
of Masood Azhar the chief of JM the
Indian government firmly and resolutely
committed to taking all necessary
measures to fight the Menace of
terrorism
hence this non military pre-emptive
action was specifically target targeted
at the GM camp so medicinal cycle very
clear again that way clear message being
put out saying the government of India
is firmly committed to taking all
necessary measures
so this needn't be the last this is an
example of what we can do and and if if
necessary and when necessary that the
Indian government will not shy away from
taking action
this mess is gone very clearly that
India's meaning business
there'll be zero tolerance for any
Pakistani method messing up with India
hereafter and this is not lost upon
Pakistan or that lost upon the Indian
opposition that when we ever decipher
government in place and a decisive Prime
Minister who believes him doing what he
says earlier there was lots of
credibility gets Pakistan always thought
K India rose but it does no it does not
have the capacity to direct no India is
clearly demonstrating a capacity not
only to it but to inflict horrendous
damage on the perpetrators of such
highness crimes Pakistan has suffered
grievous losses or almost two to three
hundred of their letters have been
killed several commanders have been
eliminated Moses Moses brother-in-law
has been eliminated the infrastructure
has been destroyed their nerve centers
have been destroyed
and then they never recorded very badly
and unfortunately for Pakistan we have
given them no option or no possibility
of retaliating at all there's been no
civilian casualties at all there's been
no damage to the Air Force or to the
Amin first rupture of any sort at all
with the result whom would they strike
when they strike India the escalation
would be uncalled for and they will be
in for international condemnation today
Pakistan centric terror creating chaos
and mayhem across the globe not only in
the Indian subcontinent or near on
Afghanistan and in India but in every
country in the world if Strait takes
place in Russia Pakistan hand is
involved if it takes place in America
Pakistan and is involved if it takes
place anywhere in Europe London or Rome
or Britain
Pakistan Hanzel is there but there is it
with the result entire world is today
standing up with India as for terrorism
is concerned and the world today is
beginning to acknowledge and recognize
if there's any country in the world who
can act very strongly against terrorism
and terror set in India it is imperative
that the United Security Council know
passes certain resolutions which
strengthens India's capacity to act very
strongly against Pakistan and it's time
that Pakistan is if is resolutions
passed
calling Pakistan and terror state and if
these united nation doesn't do it the
Indian Parliament when it meets next
rain should pass a resolution declaring
Pakistan and terror state moment we do
that very many countries will join hands
with India in declaring Pakistani a
terrorist state absolutely in fact we
have information coming in right now
that the External Affairs Minister
Sushma Swaraj is called for an all-party
meeting at 5:00 p.m. this evening god
there's an all-party meet there has been
called obviously the opposition will be
briefed as well
Sushma Swaraj they're putting out
information that she has called a
meeting at 5:00 p.m. or it's an
all-party meet that will take place in
Delhi the briefings from what we
understand are still underway the Prime
Minister has met with the president and
the vice president and given them a
brief as well as to the action that has
been taken by India we were referring
earlier to Vijay go clear the foreign
secretary who has also put out his
briefing interviews my life was a short
briefing was then clear was very clear
message to the international community
as well of the fact that this was first
of all an intelligence led operation
that took place that it struck
specifically at the training camp he
also said it was a heavily wooded area
it was not anywhere near any sort of
civilian presence so there were no
civilian casualties and he also
mentioned the fact that it was a
successful strike that the target has
been achieved that the facility at Bala
court which was headed by Mawlana yosef
azor has been completely destroyed and
he went on to say that suicide you know
the the India had received credible
intelligence on the fact that Jesse
moment was attempting another suicide
terror attack in various parts of the
country
and the Fedayeen jihadis were being
trained for that purpose specifically in
this camp in the face of eminent danger
the preemptive strike is
absolutely necessary all right we're
gonna take a very quick break here or on
Mira now and come back as we stay with
this extremely important story",True,en,8388,50,120
bGMfTJ_kKtg,Sterlite Activist S. Mugilan goes missing after releasing documentary,Activist S. Mugilan who is known for his work in the Sterlite case and against the sand mafia has gone missing since the 15th of ...,2019-02-25T12:29:49Z,MIRROR NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bGMfTJ_kKtg/hqdefault.jpg,"well it's not even a tamil are what an
activist known for his work in the
Sterlite case and against the sand mafia
has gone missing
namu Gillen had released a video earlier
this month which allegedly showed the
involvement of top cops in Tuticorin
police firing which killed 13 people
namu cannon had addressed to press
conference following which he went
missing the Madras High Court has issued
notices to the Chennai police
commissioner and senior police officers
of concha Purim and velu forum on the
other hand cops have also produced CCTV
footage claimed the Mogollon was seen
leaving eggman railway station
it sure is very confusing because Mullen
is a prominent activist and
Environmental Protection activists who
took part in quad uncle of nuclear power
plant again set up a power plant for
this protest and then also he's like a
have played a major role in curbing sand
mafia and this recent a play was about
the coup de la costura light a police
firing in Tuticorin where 13 people were
killed what Moglen did was that he
categorically created a video
documentary for 45 minutes where he has
taken visual CCTV footage and along with
timecode and everything he tried to he
has created a kind of a version stating
that it was not the public who were
involved in arson in front of Tudor
Korean collector office on that
particular day but were they were other
miscreants and not just said he's also
bringing out the names of top comps to
be involved involved in this particular
case post whist on 16th he goes missing
and that's become a very big concern
right now activists have gone ahead
they have protested in front of
commissioner's office seeking and like
our to find out immediately where he is
but it's on 16 he went missing today is
25th and there is still no whereabouts
however on the corpse site what they
have done is that they have provided
CCTV footage say to that instead of
Moglen living on ignore ignore every
station he is coming out that's the only
evidence the police could provide them
his cell phone as he mentioned has gone
like a switched off near Chengalpet till
now there is no collection of like there
is no information about where mogul

disappearance of Mogollon is related to
this particular video

copper smelter there was a set foot in
our town and has been disastrously
wreaking havoc on the people and the
environment of tio2 Karuna and just
before he went missing the same day he
had spoken unequivocally on the
involvement of some high-level police
officials and of certain others in the
whole issue he had brought to light the
involvement of these guys and he had
asked justice and the same evening the
same night he boarded a train from
Chennai late night and he went to BC

produced CCTV footage claiming that he
didn't even board the flag I mean the
train from Eggman railway station what
else are you looking from the government

is mogul in then where is my giving he
was seen coming to the railway station

showing him going out of the station

bonanza sorts for homebuyers after much
consideration the GST Council has caught
GST rates on under construction flats
and particularly on affordable housing
GST or under construction houses has now
been reduced to five percent while for
affordable housing the new GST rate will
be 1% the changes in GST rates come into
effect from the 1st of April normal
housing may be now i TP k without ITC
the GST payable for flats under
construction will be 5% yeah your
recommendations he gmpm locally except
currently so umber of housing covered or
a triangle do not be na ITC Karanga
normal housing 5% or affordable housing
1% this will come into effect from the
1st of April 2019 so 60 metres
carpet area
in metros and 90 meters outside the
metros so which approximately translates
into a two-bedroom house in the metro
and a three-bedroom possibly outside
depending on the size or 45 lakhs is the
agreed well a couple of challenges were
facing the real estate sector overall
which is why the GSD council meet was
decided to be held given the fact that
number one our developers were meeting
or facing a lot of for margin stress or
facing a lot of problem actually getting
funding for new developments and number
two at the amount of inventory as far as
real estate was concerned especially in
the metro areas or something that was
really high and the government wanted to
you know ease the burden as far as
builders were concerned the other thing
of course you need to know one of the
key factors was the government actually
wanted to make affordable housing and
housing in itself are quite affordable
as far as the entire middle class was
concerned so on the back of that you
know the GSD council came up with two
important proposals or number one the
GST rate on normal housing not
affordable housing is now at 5% and this
is without the input tax credit earlier
the net effective rate that was being
divided on normal housing was 12% and
more importantly you know we are talking
about the affordable housing impacting
our the public at large now if we're
talking about this particular into this
particular segment of the GSD council
rate is now at 1% and again this is
without the input tax credit this is you
know this particular rate cut is
slightly better than what the street was
anticipating and definitely what was
being anticipated as far as the
buildings are close concern so this is
something that is expected to give a
fillip as far as the affordable housing
space is concerned more developers will
now be encouraged to come up with more
affordable housing projects and also
given the fact that the government has
taken a slew of measures over the last
couple of years to actually ensure that
funding for affordable housing is now at
a lower rate so you expect to see more
affordable housing projects",True,en,326,7,1

Cleveland 16th of June many may have
already marked the state on their
calendar the day India and Pakistan are
supposed to lock horns on the cricket
pitch but tonight the big question is
should we play with Pakistan or not to
boycott Pakistan or not should we say we
refuse to acknowledge anything which is
linked to Pakistan until our label mends
its ways and cracks down on taro which
is growing on its soil or should we use
this opportunity to at least beat them
and embarrass them at the World Cup on
the cricket pitch well Pakistan really
change if we don't play cricket with
them are we insulting our soldiers and
their families their sacrifice if we go
ahead and play cricket with Pakistan
right now even when the families of
those forty martyrs haven't stopped
grieving they are still in mourning
chilly then cut off all ties with
Pakistan arts music trade all sports
diplomatic ties remember this over 400
soldiers have been martyred since 2014
in Kashmir can we ignored that Pakistan
is everyday training funding and sending
terrorists to destabilize our country
maybe just maybe someday the two
countries the two neighbors will learn
to live in peace and harmony but until
our neighbors see that do we really have
to play with them even if it means not
playing the World Cup BCC iron
broadcasters losing money and perhaps
and they are not being able to host the
next World Cup is that more important
tonight as a nation let's debate this
sure India play cricket with Pakistan
this World Cup season
let's see delivering to Alan Sippy
former cricketer dalip Tahil actor
unsure more comic will be with us
shortly sweet ago da reformer is in
marathon champion and we've got very
very our consulting editor in our mumbai
studios Marie I'm gonna start with you
first let's just try and understand what
are India's options right now at this
stage when we have on a trade front
taking a step back we re looking at our
water sharing you know treaties and how
we can use our own water better we are
getting in touch with diplomats and for
you know other nations Bureau
diplomatically speaking trying to
isolate Pakistan when it comes to
cricket and the World Cup what are our
options
well three options then we pretty much
one is that we go ahead and play the ICC
World Cup because we're scheduled to do
that and we are a signatory to the
agreements that you have with different
boards have agreements with ICC to you
actually go to the World Cup but you
forfeit your match against Pakistan
which means that you'll first you'll be
docked your points to in a round-robin
format it will put you in a back foot
you might actually hand over an
advantage to Pakistan because they'll
start with a +2 point advantage and
three you and to a in many ways is that
you then you run the risk of wondering
whether you may end up meeting Pakistan
again in the knockout stage and then you
have to forfeit another match in case
because once you've offended one you
look at a 4-week the other and the third
option on paper again is that India just
simply by cross the world cup itself now
in both the number threw in number three
options you pretty much can be certain
that you'll invite sanctions you'll
invite a bit of an isolation in the
global sporting stage and you will
definitely run the risk of actually
losing the right to hoarseness next
World Cup which is supposed to happen
here for sure because that's what they
were limping charter which the ICC used
to draw its charter from will be invoked
we've seen the same something similar
happening in the shooting Championships
today in the World Cup where we did not
give visa so two shooters and that's
what can happen on paper can be pretty
much okay so these are the consequences
in fact to that one point that you made
Vinay that we will end up forfeiting our
two points because we are slated to play
with Pakistan and if we boycott that and
that effectively may give them an
edge over us we will in indirect ways
end up perhaps helping them reach the
semi-finals that's the point that even
such an Tendulkar made earlier today why
he said that for me country comes first
and whatever the government decides I'm
alright with it but he did say that
perhaps it will be a lot more satisfying
if we are actually able to beat them
rather than giving them those two points
but on a larger concept Alan sippy where
do you stand on this debate should we
play with them
should we not play with them do you see
that we among a man come in that the
country's in complete unison when it
comes to what has happened the terror
attack the company the country knows for
a fact that the army the people have
been hurt and in and people have died so
as far as the country is concerned we
are in complete unison that some action
or something should be should be taking
place now if you look at such in
gentleness tweet now he is talking as a
sportsman so there are two sides to this
as a sportsman he is feeling and he's
rightly in that in that fashion is
rightly feeling that as a sportsman he
feels that Indiana is in a better
position today or like it was in the
past to beat them so he's thinking I'm
the sports front and on the other hand
if you look at the people who have lost
their lives their families who have lost
the sons the soldiers they must be
hurting as well because they're thinking
that we are sitting here and talking
about having a debate that whether India
should play or not so their feelings
will be completely different to what we
talking about playing Pakistan because
it's a very sensitive issue the entire
country right now the emotions are
running extremely high everybody is
wondering that I mean majority of the
people feel that we should not play
Pakistan but the one thing is for
certain the entire country knows that
the the Pakistan has committed a crime
they had the they continue to harbor
terrorism and they do not chastise they
do not pinpoint at exactly where it
example Imran Khan the other day I said
he says that please give us proof now
the entire world knows that part
harbors terrorism so for him to say a
pastor statement of that it clearly
shows that he's not in complete command
he's a puppet on the string and he's
been controlled by the army of Pakistan
right so for me I think we should leave
it to the government because the
government is in the right state right
now to decide whether we should play
cricket or not the government is the one
who should take a decision that they are
trying to protect us okay silence if he
says we should leave it to the
government to decide the Lita hell where
do you stand on this debate are many
from your film fraternity have taken you
know very clear stands to say we will
not release our film sir we will not
walk with Pakistani actors or Pakistani
singers and so a similar debate is also
always going on within Bollywood as well
do you think we should play cricket with
them or should we cut off all ties music
movies sports everything well first of
all a very good evening to you and let
me say at the outset that I
unequivocally condemn the cold-blooded
murder of our Jevons in poleramma and I
think post poleramma
in there should definitely begin to re
visit and re understand its association
with Pakistan whether it be trade
whether it be sport or culture having
said that the World Cup in this
situation is a bit different and the
reason for that is that the World Cup is
already planned Pakistan will come and
play the World Cup because the ICC is
not going to drop them at this stage let
me tell you that in World Cup language
if a team does not show up to play it is
a walkover we AG if we should be doing
Pakistan no favors if we do not go to
play we are handing over two valuable
World Cup points in Pakistan's hand they
will have the last laugh cricket and
limited-overs cricket cricket is a very
uncertain territory what happens with
those two points and what and how the
tournament actually finishes is
anybody's guess I am saying that India
does not benefit in not playing Pakistan
I think we should play Pakistan keep our
head held high as we all
to get onto the field as professional
cricketers and send the pakis packing
from the World Cup and the other thing
is we don't play the World Cup we are
giving ammunition to the to the PR
machinery in Pakistan to say that we
were scared also on the world stage of
sport they will say that you have
interfered you have mixed politics with
sport and that will have its own
ramifications so I think not playing
Pakistan does not benefit India at all I
would much rather see in there go out
there and play and defeat Pakistan you
know to the point of a very limited
point that you made about people saying
that we are mixing politics now and
sports let's also not forget that often
Pakistani players themselves have used
this platform to make political
statements maybe to appear to please
their own you know government or army or
the the ISI I remember very distinctly
in 2016 when China 3d was asked and he
made it very clear that they have won
this t20 match because of all the
support from Kashmir and he's repeatedly
done that so I mean if it is about
politics and sports it often gets mixed
and both sides end up doing it in their
own ways but let me go across to our
other panelists and Sarita both are as a
as a sports woman what's your view when
there is at one point terror and he in
many ways a proxy warrior or a constant
state of conflict with the country
should we be playing cricket and to the
point that you know the little hill race
that you kill forfeit your points once
what happens next what happens when we
reach semi-finals and Pakistan is there
again will we not play the semi-finals
see first of all I would like as a
player I would like to say that this
sports forum is not not the right forum
to fight Pakistan first of all
government has to think you know we have
to hit them and take them on where they
are we finances
business and like now vomit is taking a
chill and water that is perfectly all
right because garment has to put
pressure or IOC with it's not only
cricket
we have Commonwealth Games we have Asian
Games we have Olympics we have
international tournament tournament in
hockey football golf everywhere we have
to buy card then why only cricket so as
the sports person what we learn
sportsman spirit fighting a straight
beat the opponent that's what we learn
and that's what we do so the right forum
should be put pressure on IOC and Bend
Pakistan from all these faults can we do
that
is it possible so we have to think first
of all we have to strengthen the army
the government has to think about Army
facilities ammunition give them all
rights whatever they deserve because I
am also Army officers wife my brother is
in India but full police so I know what
they are going through
so first strengthen your army and if you
really want to buy car then put pressure
on I see put pressure on international
sports bodies right wycott Pakistan yes
because you know why I live with you and
I would perhaps that's what I see oh I
decided to do today and by sending that
letter and then releasing that letter to
the ICC where they have said that you
know nations who Harbor and encourage
terror must we must sever our ties with
them for future tournaments not for this
tournament but for future tournaments
the others think that they said is there
a security concerns for our player
players to come and play in this World
Cup so perhaps those mild attempts are
being made to get Pakistan out of these
tournaments but it's a long way to go
what have we done when it comes to the
Olympics the shooting World Cup that's
happening which are in our country right
now we refuse to give results to two
Pakistani shooters the Olympics
committee turned around and said well
you can't hold any more world events in
your country because you are banning
people from different countries and
you're not allowing them to come and
participate so that's the repercussions
that we are looking at right now now
and two more do you agree that what the
government has to do deal with Pakistan
on a military basis on a diplomatic
basis should not be mixed with sports no
actually
no I have a slightly different view
first of all I don't subscribe to this
whole idea that you know we should play
them and then beat them you know at the
World Cup and that'll be some kind of a
you know moral victory or whatever
because you know if if you go by that
logic then we might as well go to a
Pakistan and beat them in their own
country because we will beat them you
know that's the fact we are much better
side so I don't really subscribe to that
having said that I also recognize that
it's a very tricky issue right now for
everybody involved right for BCCI for
the government because cricket is also a
very emotional piece and then what has
happened with these terrorist attacks is
also deeply deeply emotional for the
country right so just to create that
balance I can understand that there is a
lot of confusion right now my personal
stand on this is yes we should not play
Pakistan because unlike in any other
sport this is a very big event this is a
global event India is a very very strong
participant in this and if we are able
to then put a stop to playing against
Pakistan then we are making a huge
statement at a global stage about
terrorism and Pakistan I said it earlier
in your show also that apart from just
not playing Pakistan as I think we
should because BCCI is very strong
enough also put a lot of pressure to
have Pakistan out of the World Cup with
support hopefully from the other
countries who will I'm assuming you know
support initiative against a terrorist
state so you know this is usually forget
what has happened I love cricket
I love watching India Pakistan matches I
love all of that but really it's about
time that we took a stand and that stand
has to take you know you have to take
that stand everywhere it's sports it's
trade it's the international level we
really need to take a start fair enough
I get your sentiment and and that's
largely also the sentiment of many
people who are calling us all evening
we've had a phone lines open and most
people are reflecting the the sentiment
that you just presented untrue but let's
let's look look break it down
practically
and very few could come in here oh how
practical or to what extent is it
possible that we are able to get the
other countries to boycott Pakistan at
this stage after all we are also talking
about a multi crore multilateral event
will the other countries back us on this
if you ask me today no they want the
Indian cloud over the ICC has
significantly declined in the last seven
to eight years when mr. Srinivasan was
actually in the BC say India had a way
bigger and way better clout within the
ICC now we don't enjoy that cloud in the
last two major regions that have
happened in the last six months or eight
months or so we have lost votes very
badly in fact we lost the last one
thirteen is to one which was about the
finances that the ICC is to share with
India India's share of money was reduced
by the ICC
it's an unthinkable thing two years ago
they wouldn't have had the courage to do
it the Indian position in the ICC has
weakened having said that it is true
that India still remains the fulcrum
around which the finances the global
finances of the cricket world moves
there is no doubt about that I mean the
fact that the ECB itself which is
organizing the World Cup is banking
heavily on on India and the
india-pakistan match itself now that was
the first mess that got sold out long
back and the whole economy of that
country almost survives on the Indian
diaspora which strong's every single
match when India visits them so in fact
if you see the ECB finances only when an
Indian team is visiting the UK subcon
the continent do they actually shore up
their revenues than the rest of the
series bilateral series they don't get
as much money including even the ashes
so look there is no doubt that India has
financial muscle even though it's
slightly reduced but having said that my
whole confusion is about three things
than view number one why would you want
to buy quite a team the obvious answer
is you want to isolate a country that is
an enemy country and that has actually
come inside your country in punt and
actually kill your citizens and your
soldiers the idea is to punish them if
the idea is to punish them the question
next question should be will this punish
them really I have two parallels
examples in the past which are
references for us India was fighting
Kargil war in the May of 1999 we played
Pakistan on 6th of June 15 days after a
war which killed 500 of our soldiers in
2008 India Mumbai was attacked by
Pakistan we played the 2011 World Cup as
well what actually hurts Pakistan more
is the cessation of all by lat
which have already happened remember we
don't we haven't played a series with
Pakistan for 12 years now we do not
allow any Palestine ridiculous to be
part of the IPL we have even banned
somebody like a Ramiz Raja to comment
during the match even stars for doesn't
hire them that has killed Pakistani
cricket way more than you stay away from
a multilateral tournament that's the way
to punish Pakistan multilaterals are not
going to punish Pakistan at all done be
okay so that's the other side of it so
either go that I let me let me also turn
the question around to you and ask you
why should we play with Pakistan why is
it so important to have that to play
that one match or even to play in this
tournament why should we do that at a
time when you know the sentiment within
nation is you know it is so angry
we've lost 40 soldiers we've lost 400
soldiers in the past five years why
should we play with Pakistan see first
of all I want to say that country has to
take decision if they want to they
should by court or they should give
policy such policy so that India is not
going to play World Cup first of all and
then government has to decide that what
will happen for other tournaments all
international it's not only this World
Cup other tournaments big tournaments I
am talking about everywhere wherever
Pakistan is coming then we should Pike
what so if you want to send message take
the decision fast make some policies so
that that message goes to the world that
we are now we cannot take anymore
also whatever Pakistan is doing it's not
acceptable to us right so by court but
just doing debates and just just
thinking that this is he I will take the
decision BCC I will not take this
decision on their own either i ICC has
to take decision or government has to
take decision or they have to order okay
the other thing before otherwise will
happen before I ask this
questions are also to the leap tile
person okiya my views are yes this oh no
I had another question for you sir my
silly talk without ever since you said
that you you have you know you have
family who are in the forces and often
the argument that is made from the other
side is that we are insulting our
soldiers we are insulting the sacrifice
of our soldiers and their families
we are insulting the martyrs are and
their memory do you do you understand do
you agree with that sentiment I know it
can be from an individual to individual
I also come from a family background so
it can vary but you understand actual
portion about these things
yes what happens with Tanvi what happens
in touch made with CRPF Jevons you know
stone pelting and they are bullying the
CRPS Garron yes I just am condemning all
this and I I'm also emotional because
I'm a music question my brother is also
in the forces so but who may take the
decision who will take the decision
government has to take decision by
giving clear-cut policies and they have
to strengthen army they have to get some
deliberately - army what army general
now they are saying they they have to
act now permit has to act just by
cutting the sports will not give you any
answer and it is not the solution you
know the sports is not the forum to
fight Pakistan and sing again and again
hate them where they are weak mr. Thal
would you agree with that that this is
not the four oh man and and I will
expand that conversation when I come to
you to say even the even the film
fraternity even music and filmmaking in
all kinds of arts that is not the forum
to send any message across it's not the
question of
what I'm saying - please be very clear
about what I'm saying I'm saying after
Palama India must boycott Pakistan in
every single way so that Pakistan hurts
there's a way of doing it we have to get
international consensus we have to make
people aware so that any international
tournament any international sanctions
financial aid everything comes into play
that does not translate to this World
Cup this World Cup only demonstrates
that we will actually be handing the
benefit over to Pakistan don't you see
it it is exactly what the Pakistanis
want that the pressure that they put on
on poleramma
it makes us give them to World Cup
points it doesn't it doesn't correlate I
agree they should be boycotted but not
in a sport if an international sports
committee or an international sports
platform invites Pakistan and we can do
nothing about that and if you are
playing Pakistan we must play them and
defeat them and nothing to do with
trying to make a moral a moral statement
that the gentleman said it's about
playing the sport okay I have to be able
to go there and play the sport like we
know the sport and keep politics aside
and do what we have to do as
professional sportsmen and I feel very
strongly that we should not give
Pakistan these two World Cup points on a
platter I just disagree with that but I
say yes we must develop an awareness to
boycott Pakistan across the board right
mr. Kile I must tell you this though
I do see merit in your argument there
are a lot of viewers right now who are
writing in to us who believe that we
shouldn't play Pakistan who also are
very confident that irrespective of us
giving them this walkover and giving
them these two points is something to
change Pakistan's fate and it's not
going to change our fate in the World
Cup that's the kind of confidence people
seem to have in Virata Kohli and his
team right now but that being that that
we can said and she won't you our
response to water you know the little is
saying that let's not give them this
even this much
no actually I agree with all the viewers
who are calling in frankly even if you
give two points to Pakistan I don't
think they have any chance of doing
anything at the World Cup but but on a
more serious note see my whole point
here is that it is it's not about just
playing that one match right it's not
about just sport or any other arena it's
the scale at which this is hell it's the
impact of your statement and I believe
that World Cup in India making that
statement because India is a very strong
competitor in this in you know in this
sport it that makes a difference that
makes a difference that passes of our
message anywhere we can do that we
should be doing that whether it is trade
whether it's films you know for example
films and I'll go to this point films
are still you know we're still talking
about Bollywood right which is limited
to just Indians and people who speak
Hindi or understand Hindi let's say even
Pakistanis but this is bigger than that
this is global scale this is you're
making a very strong statement that's
the only reason I support not playing
Pakistan in this because because of the
impact of that statement and two points
frankly I don't think it's gonna make
any difference to Pakistan everybody
they're not going beyond the first
problem yes well that seems to be the
sentiment as well but everybody's taken
it's very clear stand here mr. Allen CP
except you so I'm going to come back to
you and ask you that while of course
it's not on any of us I cannot decide on
shoe can't decide mr. Kyle can't decide
Bob the government has to decide at the
end of the day I'm not even too sure if
Co I by themselves will take the
decision if you can't decide but I mean
if the team is not going to follow what
should you decide convey yes yes so mr.
Evans if we take a stand tonight tell us
what you think you you you you've played
on the field you've played with this
with the other nation tell us as a
cricket or what's your true sentiment
okay I think that's very fair question
to you see as a cricketer my heart tells
me as a cricketer you know when you
you'd start blink with it or you start
playing sport the first thing you want
to do in life is to compete so I said as
a
portsmen the first thing a person wants
to do is compete and win you know so as
far as cricket is concerned against
Pakistan there is no question that the
Indian team myself included the public
whoever was watching cricket whoever
likes cricket will love practice love
India to beat Pakistan the Indian team
for example if you give Ravi Shastri
vertically a chance to play against
Pakistan they'll be chomping at the bits
building they'll want to beat Pakistan
so there's no question as a sportsman
you want to play and compete against
anyone and men mostly against Pakistan
because their rivalry is it's not it's
incredible so as a cricketer as a
sportsman yes I want to pay Pakistan but
I come back to the point of the
government because I think that this
decision to to play them but not to play
them has to be taken by the government
today the BCCI has told the that they
need some more time the reason they need
at the time this is the only reason that
they have taken some time the reason
they need the time is that they have to
consult the powers-that-be they have to
consult the government the government is
the one that will decide the external
affairs the home industries these are
the people are going to take a decision
for to protect us because these are the
people who are going to look after the
country they have to ensure that
Pakistan doesn't attack us in future
it is it is that it's a catch-22
situation as a sportsman I would love to
play Pakistan and beat them and yes I
believe what exactly what mr. Dilip
Alice said we should go and play them
and beat them but as a patriot of the
country as a citizen of the country I
feel very strongly that we should wait
for the powers that be for the
government to take this decision
we should not not take a gung-ho
decision on this and be patient that's
what I prefer are Kohli is watching
these comments he's going to be secretly
thanking you for putting all this
pressure on him to deliver on this go
and play and then beat them or maybe not
once but multiple times and that's the
expectation of the entire country I
completely agree with you there let's
bring in some viewers as well mr schima
Kumar is on the phone line from
Bengaluru boy mr. Shiv Kumar what do you
think to boycott or not yeah
- we everyone he asked couple of points
to make I've been hearing the debate for
quite some time
so my view is firstly what we need to
what we can try is my suggestion is
instead of India you know not playing
against Pakistan we should make we
should try to put all pressures from all
sides from UN from from the government
to ensure that Pakistan doesn't play the
World Cup you know that's the first
thing we can do
put all pressure because they are big
into their into terrorism everybody
knows that insure that Pakistan doesn't
play the World Cup if that doesn't
happen then the second the second thing
what we can do is India should not play
the World Cup at all when India is not
going to play Pakistan then we're in you
know in a disadvantaged position so if
you don't play the World Cup what
happens is that in England we all know
that there are a lot of India and
Pakistan is there and if if we start
putting pressure and spread the word
then people won't arrive in the ground
you know wake up would be you know I
understand your point mr. Kumar but let
me also be slightly realistic here the
UN is we've not even managed to get a a
most wanted terrorists tag for Masood
Azhar that China keeps blocking for its
friend Pakistan so highly unlikely that
we will be able to build pressure to get
Pakistan out of these tournaments I
don't completely agree with your
sentiment on that front thank you for
calling covent is on the phone line from
Pune Govind to play or not to play with
Pakistan yeah I don't think we should
play as a Pakistan you see as a as a
nation we need to do I mean hello yes go
ahead please we can hear you yes he has
a mission we have to take the first step
why are we expecting you know others to
take a step if we take a stand we are
conveying something to the world the
light of our fight it's not the world's
fight and we are the ones who have to
stay strong in this it's not correct to
say that we have made mistakes in the
past okay we have done something 10
years back they've done something 20
years back but today we have to take a
stand and this is a stand which we have
all as Indians have to have to fight it
out I know you think you're not playing
this this one match or One World Cup is
going to matter
to a nation like us yes okay um thanks
Govind for calling so when I am going to
come back to you with that same question
that I asked our some of our other
panelists why should we play Pakistan is
it really that important let's just say
is this World Cup also how important is
this World Cup
well look I mean it is extremely
important from a sporting point of view
of course if you put it in perspective
of a terror attack of course it pales
into insignificance there's no doubt
about that but okay again I'm making the
same point look Syria is a terrorist
country isn't it it's the perhaps
supplied more terrorists to the world
than any other country it has
participated in every single Olympics so
far Iraq has been a terrorist country he
was was locked in a war with Iraq they
still participated in Olympic Games my
point is this the question is what are
you going to achieve by boycotting or
not playing in a tournament the idea is
that I'm going to isolate the country
one corner said we should force other
countries to join us that's never going
to happen because this is a bilateral
issue most countries have already
actually said so indirectly this is the
problem between US and Pakistan
why should England or Australia or New
Zealand become a party to it so that's
never going to happen ICC's never going
to cancel or force Pakistan to get out
because their charter doesn't allow for
something like that so that's not
happening anymore
yes India can theoretically withdraw
itself from the tournament completely
and hurt the ICC's finances because that
will happen if India doesn't participate
in the World Cup
definitely the ECB in the ICC's finances
will get impacted don't forget that even
Indian Finance is right on it there is a
very large mega sporting powerhouse in
broadcast powerhouse that is controlled
but that's based in India which is going
to broadcast this so there is money in
that but of course when it's a question
of forces when it's a question of lives
of soldiers money is not the argument at
all yeah the argument really is how
should Pakistan be punished should it be
punished on the military field shouldn't
be punished at a diplomatic level should
it be punished at the sporting level
I'm all for banning and not doing
anything bilaterally you should stop the
raucous Nani film artists from coming
here you don't have to do anything but
really don't allow anything of that sort
that's going to hurt them that's going
to affect them that's going to impact
them but a World Cup is not about
Pakistan at all and tomorrow morning the
Olympics has 172 countries participating
parison is one of them will you not go
to the Olympics because they are
participating there as well the question
is that's the Olympics or World Cup is
not about Pakistan Pakistan is not that
import
the country that that whole world cup
should be considered about them it's not
about them they're not important they
are insignificant country who believes
in terrorism and that's how we should
treat them and I think in the past and
that is the reason that we why I'm
saying that sometimes people we give
less credit to the government
governments are a little more mature
than people in many stages that's the
reason why if you see the Indian
government so far has not taken a
clear-cut position because they know
it's not an easy one to take yeah
otherwise they would have nuts the PCs
are you all ready to say we're not
participating they haven't done it
because they know that it's not an easy
one to take yes it is on 16th of June by
then we would have had a the big cycle
of elections as well and the decision
could perhaps be then taken after that
there is no hurry there it's a tricky
one like you said when I to take this
decision Shibata their ROI on the phone
line from navi mumbai quick word from
sugar that there and then we will wrap
this conversation up yes go at this I
believed it Pakistan the match between a
person and a in reason why I believe
them this is because this is a sporting
event what influence and cricket
actually have I wouldn't yes we can hear
match that the match can have we have a
bad line with you but I think I broadly
understand what you were trying to say
that boycotting a match is not going to
make any difference what influence will
we have we will have to find other ways
of hitting Pakistan where it hurts I'm
going to thank okay we've got Shashi
Karn on the phone line also from Mumbai
Shashi what's your what's your call
should we play with Pakistan on 16th of
June or not no I don't think so because
I don't think the two points are worth
the forty lives that we have lost and
all these people who are talking about
the two points do not deserve to be in
India all right very clear it is view
short and crisp you there thank you for
calling in I'm going to thank all of my
panelists but here is what I think about
this it's up to the government to decide
whether or not we should boycott that
one match
frankly I'm with the rest of India who
believes that we can beat Pakistan but
even if we fulfil those two points we
will still manage getting ahead of focus
on in this World Cup and so that
shouldn't be a concern but it's for the
government of the day to decide what
their larger policy is I would though
hope that the government focuses more on
hitting Pakistan where it genuinely
hurts well this is more of an emotional
sentimental issue how can we play a
sport or game with a country whose
leaders are pushing terror across our
border and killing our own people
I kept the sentiment and I respect that
sentiment but I would hope that the
government uses this sentiment
government uses this anger uses this
opportunity to hit back at Pakistan
where it will hurt them diplomatically
economically whatever needs to be done
to ensure that Pakistan is forced to
take action against those terrorists
forced to crack down and destroy those
terror camps forced to not fund and back
people like Massoud other our government
needs to devise a policy to do that now
please don't be mistaken I am NOT
sitting here and advocating war or not
that is for the government to decide
what they need to do but let's not boil
down this issue to simply saying we will
not play with Pakistan and we will take
their most favored nation status away
this is not where it has to solve the
larger problem still remains every day
our soldiers are still battling
terrorists are still battering the
support that they get local support that
they get in fresh meat 400 and more
soldiers that was account before the pol
Varma attack have been killed in five
years just in Kashmir
they are fighting this battle every day
we need to find a solution to that
irrespective of whether or not we decide
to play with Pakistan in the World Cup
that cannot be the answer to this
problem thank you so much for joining us

Wnq9j1F8mxA,Team ‘Mom &amp; Co.’with Sakshma Srivastav at their candid best | Its Entertainment,Zoom Studios' show Mom and CO starring Neliima Azeem and Ayush Mehra tells the story of a mother and son through a ...,2019-02-23T14:57:19Z,MIRROR NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wnq9j1F8mxA/hqdefault.jpg,"one two three moment cool moment cool
moment go home and go gangster I think
yeah I think that'll be very interesting
I think you can play a pig hello
everyone and welcome to it's
entertainment
I'm sarcoma and today I have with me a
bevy of talent from the show Mom & Co
yeah that's you entertainment now let's
ask the captain of the ship the director
tell me a the story of you know a parent
and a child is something that has been
explored in films and shows many times
before now because I was lucky enough to
have a peak in the show I know it's so
much more than that but I want you to
tell the audience why this is such a
special story that needs to reach them
and why they need to watch the show
firstly it's all based on the basis of
writing yeah it's very real and honest
and everyday story that happens in our
houses yeah about a mother and a son why
this is a special show is because of
these two who fell right into those
characters and enhanced them like
another 10 20 times maybe we have those
stories from the sets but we'll get to
that later
coming to the both of you you know nila
Maji sometimes people say that because
she's a mother or because she is really
what she's in real life it's easy to
play that character but it really is not
that every character has so many layers
which are not who you are tell us about
the complexities of playing a mother on
screen and the character well in context
to this yeah first first thing is the
first point is that you're playing
someone else true so if one decides that
the mother and me will lend shades to
this character it doesn't work like that
so you need to understand the world of
so ah sneezes oh she so she was that
Shiism
Rushton woman okay living in a
particular kind of a society which is
very remote from my you know circle of
friends or my my life basically yeah and
and Marathi isn't that she is she is a
Bharati I mean it does it isn't as if
you are going to be playing a woman and
it should show that by acting or you to
make it look so natural
yeah and so there were so many emotions
to play in this and yet don't let it
become a caricature sort of a thing by
you know so all those things and yeah
and I think the the relationship that I
use and I have shared as Nina the Thea
also has so much of graph to it and it
rarely happens that you connect so well
with the director and your co actor and
I think this is the first time you are
living a particular character for so
long because this is your first show yes
yeah so tell us about getting into this
pace of another person like she said
living a new life and all of that before
before playing characters obviously you
start acting you do workshops and stuff
like that and they they teach you how to
get into a character obviously when
you're doing ads and when you're doing
these one go sketches you don't get a
chance to seep into that so you always
like it ke and because the script was so
nice it was so simple it was so well
written and and you know when we read it
only there were so many things which
would come out of it man used to give so
many inputs on the layers of course she
has experience of I don't know how many
films and stuff like that so you know
having such an experienced actor on that
front so you don't only think a high
linesman predominately he'll direct
something soho jaga so it's something
which is so deep and while doing the
scene you are not thinking about the
lines then you're thinking about what
I'm feeling at that point of time so it
was also very beautiful things that you
said before we started rolling the
camera beautiful
[Laughter]
was very nice he said that you know
there are a lot of scripts that are
offered and they give good money and
stuff but do you feel like if you're
here for a longer time you want to go on
then set and create something beautiful
and you don't want to work for the money
please when you're young you want to
take risks yes and this is the script
that even before auditioning I saw it
and something connected yeah : tell me
what was that it Rudy has to be
something that connects on a very deeper
level for you so I just remembered my
mother at that point of time because I'm
really connected to hope you know I'm
really close to my mother and in the
show this is completely opposite so it
was obviously challenging in that front
and that's the level where I feel it got
connected to me care if I have to start
something I have to start it with my
mom's blessing and my second mom's
blessing on the show so you know there
were so many similarities my mom keeps
feeding me all the time all the I'm a
pampered child I was on the set and I
want to thank all three of you for
creating something which is beautiful
and extremely meaningful and I hope to
see the three of you entertaining us for
many many more years to come and all the
best for all the other episodes that are
yet to come
yes yes doing it's it's I'm pretty
spoiled I just love to keep what is it
it's called one two three moment moment
moment go
okay you want to wait wait for the music
so they were like any suggestions yeah
so then what would you do is the piglet
but then you also have to do what you
would do as a band yeah we are I would
happily do it but thank you so much for
being here I had a lovely time and so
does the audience please please please
keep entertaining us and inspiring us at
the same thing such kind words thank you",True,en,659,0,12

employment data under the scanner 20
days since governments think-tank nathie
ioq dismissed the NSSO data on
unemployment India is yet to get a
definitive data point on job creation
beneath the ioq data showed India's
unemployment rate rose to a 45 year high
in the 2017-2018 period now one of the
leading dailies Indian Express reports
that the government plans to junk the
National Sample Survey office report on
unemployment altogether instead the
Indian Express report claims that the
government plans to use findings of the
labor bureau's survey earlier the nithya
oak had questioned NSSO data claiming
that the new wage jobs driven by
internet were not accounted for in its
report the VPI of also pointed out that
they were still awaiting data of 1/4 in
2014 Ola had 37 thousand registered
partner drivers across 20 cities now it
has grown to over a million registered
driver partners across 110 Indian cities
in March 2018 so it's grown from 37,000
to a million and Oba has over 1.2
million registered partner drivers in
Indian cities it has created more than
2.2 million employments over the last
four years US businesses which are often
it being pretty much shiny black bright
star which don't formally take you onto
a payroll but give you a good living
working earning opportunity we're now
asks when will the center make
employment data public will the
government introduce new parameters to
present job data why is the government
planning to junk the National Sample
Survey office report on jobs has the
Modi government created enough jobs
let's debate
[Music]
well it's been quite a while since the
government said that it has not approved
the NSS so data which is not which is
why it has not been released to us and
it will approve it what happened then
why hasn't it been approved and why
hasn't it been made public the minutes
of the tenth meeting of the Standing
Committee of labour force survey that
was held in Kolkata released by semester
the journalist with business standard
says very clearly the approval of the
annual report of the periodic labour
force survey draft had been presented
and approved and this is on the 4th of
December last year but the ministry in
the Minister of Labour actually
responding to a question raised in
Parliament said the report is still
under finalization net-net we don't have
the report yet and to make matters worse
we now have worse news report in the
Indian Express that says the government
might choose to junk that report
altogether never release it how
convenient that the government is able
to do that at all
at the end of the day have you created
jobs or no why is it that hiding reports
under your sofa cushions seems to have
been the only last resort for this
government on the show Bhaskar gosh for
the BJP so make sure the special
correspondent for the business standard
who's been breaking all of those stories
since those marathon a professor of
economics at the Center for informal
sector and Labor Studies it's eme that
tracks data has also put out substantial
data about jobs we also have Daniel
Powell who is the All India Students
Association PC Mohan is a former
chairperson of the NSC who will join us
as well and see him was a former finance
secretary I become all of you to this
conversation thank you for joining us
first question - so Misha so which you
put out on your Twitter handle the fact
that the minister's response in
Parliament was not accurate when he
turned around he said on the 11th of
February that the report is still
the finalization you said you have
access papers that tell us the report
was finalized could you take us through
how you access that document and why you
believe that the government oh yeah so
they were two set of they have been two
set of data on jobs which the government
has withheld right now
one is the jobs data produced by the NSA
so and the other is the jobs data which
is produced by the Labor Bureau so the
god the government has approved both
both the reports the Labor Bureau report
and also the report by DNS so but they
are not releasing it in the Parliament
what the Labor Minister had said was
that the data on jobs produced by the
Labor Bureau first 2016-17 is still
under finalized finalization but that is
not the case he was lying in the
Parliament and the data has been clearly
approved by the requested authorities
and he himself has approved it by the
end of December last year he has given
his approval on the data but the
government is not releasing it second is
the NSSO report which was approved by
the final authority which is the
National Statistical Commission and it
was approved in the first week of
December and this is the data which the
government is again not willing to
release so that is the short story it's
yes but as long as the government
refuses to release data the stories will
be very very short because there's no
data to discuss Baskar gosh please tell
me why is the government of india hiding
data from us oh I really don't have any
answers why they are hiding it I think
for them they are being uncommon was -
Bhaskar Ghosh of the BJP
mr. Ghosh why is the government of India
hiding data from us okay so no idea
I think this question was well answered
by the Honorable Prime Minister in the
Parliament and as well as latest nithya
Oakes press conference see there is two
different system initially there was no
system for no collection of the data
collection system was different and this
time we are having a computer-assisted
personal interview interview system for
collection of datas secondly what Prime
Minister has told in the parliament that
this last 55 years there is no standard
system for the data collections and data
analysis and they only takes about seven
to eight tooken industries from seven to
eight took an industry they used to
clear take the samples and they used to
form the data's suppose for example our
organized sector is about ten to eleven
percent and balance eighty-five to
ninety percent is basically an
unorganized sector so if we say that
about 1.25 core employment has been
generated estimated ly 1.5 commercial
vehicle have been sold 27 lakh new autos
have been given the tourism sector has
getting 1.5 crore of the job we've heard
that all facility I oh no no my question
to you is that me let me rephrase the
question where is the NSS so data that
the government said it would approve and
then release so where is the NSS so data
mr. Ghosh why hasn't it been released
yet
no that's I'm telling you the NSS so
data which they have the suppose I am
giving an example of this now the knee
TI wants that about fifteen point five
six crore data extrapolated o verse
fifteen point five six mudra now what n
is also has done is a collection of
analysis of data in the previous systems
now if you go to the current systems
that event for the mudra beneficiary if
you extrapolate a world fifteen
testing that the NSS was doing was the
an Assessor was doing wrong calculations
this entire time and the knee theäôve
had to kindly step in and remind them
their jobs what about the Labor Bureau
data why hasn't that been released I
can't use all you is know is not very
clear
okay I'll ask I'll ask again you said
the an Assessor was collecting data
perhaps in not the best way which is
shocking because it's the government's
statistics arm but what about the Labor
Bureau data that report why has that not
been released
dr. Bhaskar coach can you hear me I'm
sorry it's the more you failure okay
when you get that audio fixed and then I
will ask you this question exactly in
the same way all over again mr. Santo
Professor Merrythought professor Santosh
Morozov CMI you want to respond to
asking or saying that the NSS was data
collection method was wrong I want to
respond but I can't hear you hold my
question I just part of a part labor so
if I'm 45 years we've been using yours
back I can really answer it with proper
you know my question is to Professor
marrow through Professor my rotor go
ahead yes faith for for at least 45
years we've been using a methodology
which is well established by the NSSO
and it is a similar method methodology
across the 45 years and the only change
that has happened is that this time the
data is being collected using tablets in
the past it has been collected in a
normal way and then it has been filled
in later into computers that doesn't
change either the questionnaire or the
sample size or the methodology them the
mark the sample size the methodology and
the questionnaire is they still
the same so just you know how you enter
the data whether it's tablet or it's you
know in paper and then you later
transferred into a computer makes zero
difference to the results 0.1 0.2 you
know when repeatedly we are told by the
CEO of the nithi i/o by the minister by
whoever in Parliament outside of
parliament that so many Ola over jobs
have been created so many mudra jobs
have been created so many Chartered
Accountant so many doctors etcetera
etcetera are all these people seriously
telling the NSSO that the NSSO was not
capturing these very people within their
sample for forty five years these pypy
kind of people self-employed people have
been captured in the survey so
hula-hooper jobs as well as mutrah jobs
as well as other such platform economy
jobs have all been captured in the
annual survey of the Labour Bureau as
well as in the NSS Oh 17 18 so I am
sorry to say that this doesn't cut any
ice at all that the NSSO methodology is
wrong for 55 years we never had any many
methodology and now suddenly you know
all wrong methodology has been used in
NSS so therefore no no in fact NSS was
capturing all the wrong data and and the
government has all the right data how
come how come
point two point three the NSS Oh data is
telling us that the share of self
employed in the total workforce of
meaning total employed has actually been
fallen now it's interesting that all the
examples that are being given by the
government officials whether it is mudra
or Ola or uber or Chartered Accountants
these are all self-employed people
well the self-employed share has
actually been falling systemic of
systematically for the last ten years
and that's exactly what the NSSO 17-18
data is also showing so in other words
all that is happening on account of Ola
Oberer and mudra is that people who were
doing something else are now doing this
these are not new jobs bottom line is
this this is not new jobs having said
all this no one is contending it's no
one's case that new jobs have not been
created the real problem is that the
number of entrants into the labor force
looking for work has increased after
2011-12 and the jobs that are being
created are not enough other otherwise
how do you have a situation where the
open unemployment rate rises the
difference the definition of an open
unemployment rate is the difference
between those who are looking for work
labor force and those who are in the
work force how does it I mean how can
the unemployment rate rise from 2.2
percent into 1112 to 3.9 percent in 1617
according to the Labor Bureau annual
survey and all the way up to 1718 when
it rises to six point one percent the
open unemployed in this country has gone
from about 10 million in 2011-12 to 33
million in 1718 that's a 23 million
increase in the open unemployment yes so
in fact in fact up I just wanna one is
trying to tell us
Oh methodology is wrong Oh this
gentleman is eijah this gentleman just
told us just one last sentence Lawson
yes this gentleman just told us from the
BJP that oh they were covering only
seven or eight sectors that is true only
for the quarterly economic survey which
in any case dropped about a year ago Hey
the annual survey covers the entire
economy unorganized as well as are
organized and the NSSO covers both there
the entire economy in fact I have PC
Mohan and with us the former chairperson
of the National Statistics
organization mr. Bonin good evening and
thank you for joining us massacre gosh
of the BJP has told us that he didn't
believe or the government didn't believe
that the National Sample Survey office
was using the right methodology in its
report in which is why that report is
likely not to be released according to
the Indian Express and I'm sure you've
seen this article it says that the nithi
ioq has decided to look at mudra numbers
instead and look at the labor ministry
numbers instead instead of the report on
unemployment what is your response to
that look at the employment from each
survey no problem like in their
reporting unduly okay we seem to have a
problem with that audio with mr. V
Seamon and mr. Vaughn and we heard what
you said but my team will try and
improve the quality of the audio I have
this question to ask mr. cm Vasudev as
well he's the former finance secretary
which of us if this this point has come
up several times if the government
approving or somehow clearing the NSSO
report and unemployment help us
understand this once the NSS who has
actually
finished its report there's anybody in
the government or the cabinet approve it
is it subject to approval from someone
from the government how is this normally
worked until now no certainly not if
you've got a professional organization
like in NSSO and you've given it the
responsibility to compile the job data
then whatever compilation they do with
that report I I can't imagine that there
is any provision for that report to get
approved from the government it has to
be given to the government for
information that is fine and it also is
normally given to the government for
information before it is brought into
the public domain so that the government
doesn't get to read the report from
newspapers but other than that to say
that this report has to be approved by
the government before it is released I
don't think that is that can be the
correct situation on the ground
so whatever the report of the
professional NSSO is that should be
brought into the public domain but that
does not mean that there cannot be
questions that can be asked with regard
to the methodology that is used and sso
also has a responsibility to bring in
public domain the methodology that it is
using for compiling this data because
the indian economy over the years has
undergone so much of a transformation
that comparing 1970 to today when in
1970 the share of agriculture now GDP
was almost 50 percent plus and now it is
down to less than 18 percent share of
manufacturing is around 20 22 percent
and more than 60 percent of the share of
service sector so obviously the
methodology that is useful or use the
world over for compiling job data
relating to manufacturing sector which
is more easily captured through the
employment exchanges and the like
and the EAP PF oh and there are so many
formal ways to capture the employment
numbers in the manufacturing sector you
cannot just say the same with regard to
capturing the data and the agriculture
sector or in the service sector or even
in the central province of methodology I
am NOT - I am NOT an expert in that area
I cannot say that but I did still want
to say that the methodology needs to be
brought into public domain and people
who are experts on both sides of the
argument comment on that yes and then
the method mister vassily if the reports
are not released at all economies is
still if the reports are not released at
all how will anyone even look at the
methodology if the report has been
junked on together and I also want to
ask you one more question mr. Vyse they
both report has to be released no has to
be released yes that point I made in the
beginning that report has to be yes the
government can say that you have to
approve it before you can release it yes
I have one more question for you
according to the Indian Express today it
says that while the government is
decided to junk the NSS or report the
need the ioq has asked the Labor
Ministry to conduct a survey on its
findings based on the numbers of the
mudra loans and extrapolate that to jobs
now what is the nithi ioves place here
as a politically appointed organisation
to decide what report will be released
and what reports the ministry will
administer EES will process know you
know there are two things one of course
is that when you say that the government
or the Indian Express says that the
government has decided dump the remote
what I make out of it is that the
government is not agreeing with the
findings of that report and the
conclusions to that rapport then it
government is quite justified or
anybody's justified in saying that I
don't agree with the findings and they
need to give to bring in public domain
the reasons why they are disagreeing
with the findings whether you got an ETA
of trying to do that is obviously a
bullet
they want to bring out data which is
more favorable from their point of view
whether the mudra scheme which was
lodged with so much of fanfare whether
it has created in job but somebody I
think our little discussion has rightly
mentioned that a lot of these jobs must
be just replacing existing jobs what is
their additionality to the jobs that are
being created so nithya oak I don't
think has any major role or any
significant significant role to play
with regard to capturing the data on job
creation certainly it can do whatever
studies are doing as part of a think
tank job but that cannot be an authentic
report with regard to job creation but
the the professional organizations like
NSSO I think the methodology which
should which needs to be brought in
public domain and the nature of the
economy and to compare 70 with today
those reports I think is really too far
fetched the economy has changed so much
so I think we need to have a little more
professional discussion on the
methodology rather than on the findings
per se and the other point also I want
to mention is that whatever jobs are
being created could be as a result of
policies which will put in place for
five years ago because this is not jobs
cannot be created by pressing a button
by this government today and tomorrow
jobs are created so if you have a low
job creation it could be the consequence
of policies four or five years ago
okay and what policies are being put in
place today they could create jobs three
four years let me let me let me go back
to mr. PC moment is doing a job is today
that also is not very fair okay mr. PC
morning here's my I want to come back to
I just want to put my points one second
mr. Ghosh I'll come back to you mr. mr.
Ghosh I'll come back to you but I have
mr. PC Mohan and now the former
chairperson of the NSC who's on the
phone and he can hear us clearly now and
I'm told we'd be able to hear him as
well mr. mornin' do you want to do you
want to respond to the fact that it's
possible the government might junk the
report altogether and criticism that the
methodology was wrong because now we're
using computers and tablets in
of paper which is why it needs to be
relooked at he let me tell you the
methodology has not changes a metrology
of the NSS all involve visiting the
house and asking questions about that
DVD for each and every person
what is changes in store recording it on
a paper they now record it on edge what
is called a mobile phone I come to play
that machine there is happy they call it
this is the interview process or the
process definition sample selection
nothing is change what I said this only
the manner of recording the data and
transmission to the office and the
entire process of tabulating writing
everything is a change so the person of
discussing the methodology after so many
years is something which is very strange
not to me the report should be released
people and if there are enough things in
the report it is not just employment
unemployment it also talks about the
eternal tennis shoes as mention our
Education's those things change we
analyzed once the report is out in the
public domain the nationality is not
something which is now that you were to
be questioned without religion very poor
shop yes that is true we cannot question
the methodology without releasing the
report at all mr. PC my owner while you
were at the NSC you you resigned as well
because you said your job was not being
taken seriously you did you overlook
this report did you actually take a look
at this report when it was submitted to
government what was the reaction that
you received you believe that the
government is scuttling this report
because it's not complimentary right
before an election you look at the
report we had a long discussion
representation was made by the NSS
offices about the findings of the report
we looked at the report and I did not
find anything which is out of the way
because it solved many many good things
in the report especially the increased
full attendance of the youth and
therefore the delayed participation in
the labor force by this news because we
are still in the colleges until around
the age of 20 to 23
just not the case earlier now when you
have a highly educated kind of higher
educated people naturally your
unemployment rate will go up and we have
killed that in the case of Kerala Kerala
used to have the highest unemployment
rate also and it was always much more
than just 21 usually around 8 to 10
percent all the time because Kerala had
the is traditional highly educated
workforce
now when the education participation
increases everywhere it's quite natural
that they look for open man they look
for formal jobs and that way the
reporting of unemployment will also be
foot high this is a known fact and that
is what we saw in the draft report also
patient education is gone out and
corollary is that there will be more
often on unemployment yes so mr. PC
moanin who had resigned from his
position at the NSC because the report
was not being released in his position
was not being taken seriously Bhaskar
gosh I see your hand up miss pal I will
come back to you as soon as Bhaskar Bush
has an opportunity to rebut Bhaskar gosh
why isn't the government releasing the
NSSO data what are you trying to hide
from us okay now I was sorry I was away
from the discussion because of audio
problems what I want to ask my my
honorable panel members the government
the economy is growing at a rate of 7.2%
33 percent increase in the rural
expenditures
there are a huge number of increment in
the income tax payee they are a huge
number of increment at a huge number of
a steer GST payee and as well as
collection of GST is over now what I
want to ask all of us question with a
question if nothing is happening this
country or it is going down why the
economy is going up why the job by the
number of income tax payment is going on
buddy why their job has not being
created difference between terms of the
agriculture
mr. Ghosh if everything is so beautiful
then release the report country mr.
Gordon if everything is so beautiful
then release the report why are you
afraid of the data if you're telling us
that the GDP is great let's ignore the
fact that you readjust that the manner
in which GDP is calculated if yours that
was you other where is the report why
would you released it hey I have to say
the report didn't include lot of facts
which has a government foreign of yours
what are these facts that is generally
my point what are these facts that it
ignited in mudra scheme
no no missile scheme there is 15.5 she
stopped doing embroidery with the data
and actually answer this question the
methodology for this report has not
changed in 40 years
how have you suddenly decided now before
an election that the methodology is
wrong there is three parts of the entire
report one is a collection of datas one
is the processing of the data and third
is the interpretation of the data
yes mr. Ghosh anybody who went to a
statistics class in college will tell
you that but why is it that when we have
a National Statistics company that
actually puts this data together that's
independent of the government you have
actually buried a report that you
believe is not complimentary because you
don't want it released before the
elections and now you're making uses of
unorganized job there is no statement of
unorganized job did was such reverse
it's supposed to have a statement of
unorganized jobs because let me point
out the author of the report is on the
panel right now so I will warn you
before you make any more statements mr.
Ghosh
no audio problems
yeah that's it's called that audio
problems I know nobody nobody's saying
that jobs are okay so my job first then
Santhosh marrow throw so we shall go
ahead yeah yeah so what what I was
saying is that the nithya yoga is
getting so much involved in the data set
that you know the nithya of CEO Amitabh
Khan was also a part of the NSC national
statistical Commission and had there
been any problems in the methodology or
in the way the data was collected he
could have easily flagged it off in one
of the meetings but the fact of the
matter is that he did not attend any of
the meetings of the NSC and especially
the meeting which had given its consent
to this initial jobs report so if there
was any problem with the report he could
have easily flagged it off so I mean why
he didn't do it at that stage and he's
doing it right now I mean it's hard to
understand professor Murata faith please
ask mr. Ghosh to answer the following
question in I had said earlier that jobs
created by mudra create self employment
self-employed people are in the
unorganized sector he is saying telling
us now that the NSS does not capture
unorganized sector I am trying to
exploit right to explain to him at the
very beginning of this program that the
unorganized sector is part of the sample
of the NSS as well as if the annual
survey of the Labor Bureau if it is that
means the mudra loan jobs have all been
captured have already been included and
yet and yet there is greater
unemployment now than there was in
eleven twelve point one and point two
these mudra people and Ola were people
who are in the unorganized sector who
have been captured that are
self-employed and the share of
self-employed in the total workforce
meaning of all people employed the share
of self-employed has fallen how do you
explain this only way you can explain it
is that these new so-called
self-employed mudras self-employed Ola /
self-employed yes people who were doing
other things earlier and now are
self-employed doing this which is
exactly what the Labour Ministry people
have themselves said in other words
there is no purpose served by the
government on or the party consistently
claiming that Ola Luber is not getting
captured Chartered Accountants are not
getting captured mudra is not getting
cash yes all of them are captured in the
NSSO and yet the unemployment rate has
risen
what does yes what does he have to say
to this yes in fact I do have to take
the question also to Sedan Thea pol who
joins us from the All India Students
Association miss pal thank you for
waiting so patiently could you take us
through this the easy sort of denial and
the ostrich behavior of the government
to pit information and not make it
public does it change the reality on the
ground as far as jobs are concerned
being a student all I can say is right
as mr. Bhaskar gross has said that the
unemployment rate in India has gone
downward the employment has increased
but actually it's not Solek if I want to
say like over 60 lakh government jobs
are lying vacant more than 82 percent
men and 92% women are earning less than
10,000 per month and right now as the
government is saying that the mudra
scheme will be the parameter for
employment so let me say that over 800
people have been grieving loan under
mudra scheme right
and among the loan 93% of it is hardly
two thousand twenty three thousand now
tell me with 23,000 I cannot even set up
a show for pakora or pun so there is no
point that the government can hide hide
its face all the government jobs like v8
railway be it SSE be its school Service
Commission everything is relying back in
their huge monetary scams being involved
in these things and even like when it
comes to teachers recruitment faculty
recruitment the government has
implemented 13 point roster system that
there is no school for SD SD obviously
students teacher as getting recruited as
teachers in colleges universities right
now this is the condition of the country
right now like whether you use NSSO data
or use mudra schemes yogena whatever you
whatever you use but the fact you cannot
deny that the youth right now in the
country is sitting unemployed I'm a
fresh graduate from JNU but I do not
have a job I do not have nowhere to
apply and that same with all my
classmates and my juniors and my seniors
there is no recruitment absolutely no
recruitment in central government does
the position right now right now your
channel was showing that for I think a
few hundred 40 or something sweeper
posts 1600 people have applied and among
them there are MSE people so what do you
want the fresh MSC bachelors fresh ami
bachelors face BTech bachelors will they
be Ober drivers will they be polar
drivers no sir we won't be so we want
jobs with dignity and this is right now
the crisis in the country that there is
no job with dignity and the BJP
government will have to answer it before
the coming election that when they come
to us for vote they will have to answer
there have been the jobs that up Chabad
moody circuit voltage there was vote
last year the huge people huge number of
people they gave vote to Modi government
okay having open faith that the
government will serve the youth right
now India has the largest number of
youth but there is no job okay I
actually want to ask a very actually a
very simple question - Bhaskar Goshen
anyone else who wants to take a stab at
the answer about this mudra Yojana now
they've been different numbers
circulated about the mudra Yojana as
well the needy ioq has said fifteen
point five six crore mudra beneficiaries
as per official records
they've been other BJP spokesman who
have called it eight crore mudra
beneficiaries on the 7th of February in
his boat of tanks and looks about the
Prime Minister himself said mudra yojana
has four point two five crore people
who've gotten jobs because of loans in
this scheme so is it 15 crore 8 crore or
4 crore mr. Bhaskar goes if we are going
to rely on the mudra organize our only
yardstick of measure of success and job
creation
what is the number see as you rightly
say that what neatly Isle has mentioned
that it should be the finding has to be
extrapolated over fifteen point five six
it should be extrapolated over fifteen
point five six crore among the
beneficiaries so that is why the even
nuclei he was very specific on this and
in the figure which you quoted about ten
point something perhaps there is an
switchable from the self-employed job to
the formal job so therefore it is
lagging about five crores it becomes ten
point five six but what what Prime
Minister has mentioned is about four
point two five crore people has got the
jobs so that is perhaps the same figure
which neatly I have is also mentioning
so it is when you do the extrapolation
so it is coming to the fifteen point
five six crore figure that that that's
perhaps answer for that anybody wants to
rebut that Professor maro through I
don't think it needs that here Ibaka
I've said it repeatedly that all mudra
jobs are already captured in the sample
of the annual survey as well as the NSS
so I don't think there's any further
rebuttal needed end of story
so any claim anyone who's claiming that
mudra job creation forget about the bad
quality of the jobs that are being
created by mudra and I think as the
young student rightly pointed out that
with 23,000 lawn or 17,000 that was the
average size of the lawn and in 1516 the
first year of the mudra and then it rose
on the average rose to about 47,000 in
in the following year and in any case
there's hardly any mudra loans now being
given because the banks are run out of
money in this regard the point is
regardless of what the size of the loan
is and they are all small size loans the
fact of the matter is that they have
already been captured and obviously if
the share of self-employed and these are
all self-employed mudra loans all over
if the share of these self-employed in
the total work force has fallen while
the labor force participation rate is
falling then obviously these are people
who were earlier doing something else
yes they were casual workers and now
they have become self-employed these are
not new jobs yes in fact I want to take
this question to PC mornin mr. Mallen if
the government is going to use mudra as
a fig leaf at this point shouldn't it at
least have a clear number of that mudra
loan beneficiaries between 15 crore and
8 crore and 4 crore the government
itself doesn't know how many mudra
beneficiaries there are in the country
very familiar it'd be the way the
macguffium was but all that I know is
that you know Madras scheme UK case a
tip small amount of loans to expect that
this will generate for my job is
something you know they all mine
nation because yes I'm late the what
would be the rate of return on this kind
of a loan and how much jobs can be
generated and there's narrow threshold
Affairs also wants a job the capture to
be another slave all of you
self-employed for located on may be an
additional the job he provides for
somebody that is exception delegate and
if you want to estimate the employment
from Madras kind of projects it needs a
very very specialized kind of school it
cannot be simply based on the number of
Dawn's your sanctions will be sought me
a kind of metrology with the level all
over is doing it that will be known only
when to have and the report of that
study is available so far I no idea what
what's in the methodology they're doing
but doing this doing this usually on the
basis of the number of loan sanction
will be based on some very well the kind
of assumptions which will not have any
sizable yes well my question no III
realized that mr. Bosley was something
to say former finance secretary mister
Vasudev go ahead please no I just wanted
to say you know there is no question
that as somebody mentioned that all jobs
whether they are in the unorganized
sector of the self-employment sector or
mudra or whatever are captured in the
data that is compiled by an SSO but the
issue really is the robustness of that
data
I think they the NSSO should also try to
indicate I don't know that mr. Mullen
can indicate that now what is the margin
of error my own feeling is that the
margin of error in the manufacturing
organized sector data will be much less
maybe three percent or so and in the
case of unorganized or the self-employed
or other sectors the margin of error in
data collection may be pretty high may
be of the order of 15 percent or so it
is so it is not a question whether those
jobs are getting captured or not what is
the margin of error with regard to the
data really
two different mr. Mohn interpretive time
but mr. Bonin will answer mr. Mallen
what is the food I have got one more
point to add one more point um let's get
this answer from mr. Bonin what is the
margin for yeah no no no it's not enough
nice extra dose of Italy then we approve
a report of the grid look at the
estimates and homogeneous error and
these four parts of the reports so that
no people who can accept the figures can
also look at what is a margin of error
and we have personally seen that you
know whether the margin of error and
organized sector and the other one is
different the margin of error in the
unorganized sector is much less because
that is a much larger proportion okay
now all these are given in Genesis
reports the last part of the nurses
report you the margin of error for
different range of estimates correct
that it and we are Ravinder the approver
report we have satisfied that these are
within act those are the methodology
issues no no you know we've run out of
time but I just want to point out one
thing to mr. Vasudev mr. vaslov has kept
raising the fact that they might be
methodology issues with the NSS so data
but nobody can examine those issues if
the data is never released if the
government never releases the report at
the end of the day we know that on the
31st of January after senior members
from our National Statistics
organization had resigned because the
government was burying this report the
nithi I hope came out and said nobody
you know the government has to approve
this or verify this data it is widely
known within government that when the
National Statistics of the NSS who
releases a report
nobody from cabinet or government has
the option of verifying that data
because the data is already there so
that first of all was challenged
secondly they said that the data or the
report will be released soon where is it
why haven't we seen it yet and if there
are questions of methodology
release the report and then let the
authors of the report defend the report
that they have released
but what you're doing right now is
burying data because it's inconvenient
and that does not look good the
government cannot decide last minute
that you want to use mudra loans as a
yardstick of measure for unemployment or
employment or job creation when you have
a report sitting on your table that you
refuse to release and even if you are
going to use mudra loans as your
yardstick of measure is it 15 crore 8
crore or Fork Road mudra loans you
should get a fix on that at the end of
the day the question is about jobs and
unemployment
it is a promise you made in your
manifesto when you came to power now
that five years are gone it is only fair
that the citizens ask for a progress
report burying the data and your head in
the sand is not going to solve the
problem thanks for watching

simply resource at the Enforcement
Directorate has registered a case of
money-laundering against the management
of the ex management of our NFS has been
conducting raids at the homes and
offices of the ex management according
to agency reports this this case was
registered based in the UW of Delhi
police that have alleged that there has
been forgery and cheating on the part of
the management of this company since
2010 for the last eight years the
management has been accused of MIS
reporting income conducting dubious
transactions and increasing their own
wealth of the cost of their investors
and employees now this is important
because ifs could just be the biggest
financial problem in our country
unfolding before our eyes the company
borrowed ninety one thousand crore
rupees from banks and mutual funds and
investors some of which has also come
from the employee Provident Fund it's
not in a in a position to pay that money
back this was discovered in June last
year after defaulted on one loan and
post that things have gone south banks
alone might have to write off about
thirty thousand crore rupees in this
financial year alone
sixty-three thousand crore rupees of
loans are in the red category which
means that the chances of them being
paid back are slim the questions that
have to be asked now are these if there
was forgery and cheating that have been
taking place for over eight years why is
it the biggest shareholders of the
company LIC and SBI who have members on
the board did not notice how is it that
the banking regulator the RBI or the
Capital Markets regulator the SBI are
Sebby I beg your pardon
were supposed to be keeping an eye on
these companies missed this all together
and how was it that the top auditors
we've been looking at this company
missed the financial irregularities also
rating agencies that have given it a
triple-a rating for several years
together did not in any way indicate
that there is a problem with this
company the reason why we have to talk
about it today is because in some way or
the other as a country we will have to
account for the 91,000
four rupees if it cannot be paid back
half of it or some of it may be
recovered by liquidating the assets of
the company but is our financial system
right now so big and so weak that one
company could actually question all of
it the reason why we're going to bring
this up is because we're gonna try and
understand if there are bits and pieces
of our financial markets that perhaps
need reworking and if really the system
is designed to help the rich and the
powerful joining me on the show today
Pascal Ghosh for the BJP we also have
Jian Gupta managing director of the
stakeholders empowerment services for my
executive director at CB the markets
regulator cm Vasudev is a form of
finance secretary so gotta go she's
associate editor of The Economic Times
and Sanjay Haggard a senior advocate
with the Supreme Court gentlemen thank
you for joining us on the show I do want
to start with mr. cm Vasudev mr. vaslov
thank you for joining us and good
evening my question to you is this how
how worrying is the iron efest problem
right now and the 91,000 crore rupees
that it might not be able to pay back
does it indicate that our regulators
perhaps either don't have the full power
or are not able to do their jobs two or
three two or three things I want to
mention one of course there is no
question that there has been a lot of
miss Cardinals in il FS and in BA in
banking parlance term what is called
asset liability mismatch that has
happened there borrowed money from banks
which have shorter tenure and they have
invested in projects which will start
yielding return off for much longer 10
yrs so there is a what is called an
asset liability match which has created
this problem for them I don't think
anybody has tried to figure out how to
find out that this 90 1000 crore
exposure that they have to banks and npf
seas and other institutions how much of
the 90 1000 crores is backed by assets
that have been created with that
it's a different matter that those
assets have not started yielding any
return as yet because they are long
gestation whether there are roads or
other infrastructure projects which take
six seven eight years for their turns to
start growing in where the bank's money
that they are borrowed may be over three
four five year tenor so that type of a
mismatch is there under somebody is to
try to find out what is the value of the
underlying assets which have been
created by I left it is very difficult
to say or to come to any conclusion that
there has been any diversion of money or
any leakage of money I think we somehow
tend to go overboard when there are
defaults and banks as if everybody the
wilful defaulter he everybody's a cheat
who is not able to pay money they are
commercial reasons sometimes there are
miss governance issues as as in this
case but too classy I would be I
wouldn't at this stage say that il FS is
a wilful defaulter it is a default er
certainly yes but it is a defaulter
because of poor commercial decisions it
has stretched his whole system so much
created 250 companies but it was a
pioneer in many ways by my career
setting up a toll roads and all that so
but those investments have not started
yielding results so I would say that
these are bad commercial decisions bad
governance of the company which has
brought it to this pass but the
underlying asset I am sure are worth
90,000 close if not closer to that so
got that do you agree that there will be
underlying assets because the last
report says banks would have to write
off about thirty thousand crore rupees
that sixty three thousand crore rupees
is in red and the underlying assets
would actually amount to maybe another
thirty thousand crore rupees or
something to that amount one really
doesn't know yes one really doesn't know
as far as the elephants is concerned
what brought them down was miss
governance mindless expansion and
certain ethical issues like directors
taking fancy salaries buying their best
cars even when cash was drying out in
the company so these things and when the
bubble burst all these things came to
the fore
but tell me some
has has actually said in Delhi that
there has been forgery and corruption
and cheating taking place in this
company between 2010 and 2009 article
issue forgery and cheating and forging
your numbers is actually a crime right
but we have the press release
there is another a fire which has been
filed the UWA fire yes if you restrict
to that then we don't know whether it's
the allegation by an aggrieved investor
who was led up the garden path and found
himself holding a lemon or really there
was a money laundering in the sense
there was an entry transaction where ifs
gave bogus orders and got back there so
explain to me this we do know that there
are mutual funds who have money in this
you know that which is actually money of
ordinary citizens that are watching at
home the public property or the employee
Provident Fund which is salaried
employees Provident Fund is also in this
if you're saying and and if mr. vaslov
is saying that it's possible the assets
will actually amount to this much that
would mean there's no reason to worry
that the money will come back is that
true yes but the point is there as far
as the regulator's are concerned
particularly RBI and as far as rating
agencies are concerned this would have
blown the whistle much before I'm not
saying that you downgrade the company to
default but at least do a few down
grades keep it under rating watch so
that the investors fund managers are
alerted that there is something wrong
you can't keep it a triple a and then
downgrade by 11 notches in one go yes
then come to the shop so something was
being hidden yes something was being
hidden not in the sense that they were
complicit because of huge shareholder
presence was it was it completion see
was it malice are you being very guy
India well you had the largest
shareholders HDFC I am LIC I would have
been investment fund Oryx and every time
when the company faced problem they came
out and gave cash rights issue to yes to
repay the bonds this time the music
stopped we don't know why the LIC agreed
that it would subscribe to the rights
issue but at the last moment it just
didn't yes mr. Jain Gupta Managing
Director of the stakeholders empowerment
services will shareholders
ordinary citizens finally wind up
holding the bill because I just want to
remind you that the public that the
Provident Fund will actually be paid off
last if at all these assets are being
sold you will actually have the banks
that will get paid off and then the
others will get paid the actual ordinary
citizens will come last will we wind up
holding this bill at the end of it mr.
Gupta good evening say I would say this
problem is very very complex and it has
to be broken into a small small part
first
I agree partly with the previous two
gentlemen is solution is a part of there
that we have to differentiate between
intent and result now if there was any
criminal intent or any diversion of fund
or any personal benefit a shoe at the
cost of company it is certainly very bad
other could be that going was good you
are expending right left center without
bothering but one thing with mr. Goss
they've said very simply that liability
asset liability mismatch now assess
liability mismatch is not the only issue
in LFS it is there in many many
companies all infrastructure companies
in the country are having a issue of
asset liability bill Smith because you
borrow for five years and you invest in
20 or 30 years repayment period
infrastructure asset and you keep on
borrowing every five year or two years
or three years as long as you are able
to rotate it is going is good the moment
rotation stops the problem comes and il
FF is victim of that the second is very
clear the case as pointed when the
company is not doing good what is the
responsibility of the investors in the
company or directors in the company to
see what is happening wrong rather than
putting cash every time I think nobody
ever took a pause and said let us pause
and see what is going wrong nobody did
that be it beetle I see beat SBI beat
and if you never everybody in there
the third issue is
very clearly that what happens when
something stops everybody becomes
panicky now with in this panic when
rating downgraded there was no option
with mutual front or other investors to
withdraw money because at the law they
cannot invest in it download it they and
they have to provide for in their
account write-off
so everything you started chain reaction
the issue very clearly is that we got to
look at a situation in a holistic manner
in our country we we as we stand on an
operation table all the four direct
doctor bonnet surgeon manassas when in
medicine they are not working in
cohesion and everybody goes into a
different direction as a result the
patient dies all agencies had to do
first and foremost in this entire crisis
I would put the biggest blame on RBI who
had been sitting it is a non it was a
systematically important and we have see
what RBI is looking into it what credit
rating agency we are doing what bankers
were doing I would say every agency is
involved when you talk about semi it was
an unlisted company so Chevy's role was
minimal in that of course said there are
some underlying listed companies there
but I would say that amongst all the
regulatory agencies Chevy had the least
role but just say we also had a role so
my issue is that that unless until you
keep on working in different direction
you will never find a solution in this
particular case what happens even if the
assets were there but since the panic
situation is created at ten thousand
crores asset will be sold for three
thousand corrode in a distressed so in
the seven thousand code with loss which
was not there will certainly come to the
book because this money will go to some
other buyer who will buying it as a
distress at it and will try to make
money in the future so in this
particular case the issue is identifying
the assets which are really good and not
selling them at a discount otherwise
what will happen
banks will have to write off money
Sanjay agree
from the point of view of the law is
this is this a matter of competence and
ethics of is this matter of malice and
and crime all right now the
investigation on is on to see what
crimes if any it can be proven and
whether to file a charge sheet or not
there was one transaction in which one
particular investor was duped that is
with the economic offences wing no doubt
as investigators proceed further and
more and more forensic audits are taken
so you you may or may not see a money
trail round tripping through several
companies and whether the some parts of
the money actually reached any of the
people in management but whatever be the
stealing or in from the company Oh
overall there are structural issues as
the other panelists have pointed out
structurally what was being done was
that you were using short term money to
finance long term projects and long term
projects which would possibly hear it
revenue directly or indirectly now just
to give you an example one of the
earliest projects that the LFS took for
was the noida toll bridge now the noid a
toll bridge was used to collect tolls
and that was a general generally a
revenue honor then it then the matter
then the right to collect or was struck
down by the Allahabad High Court
thereafter the matter has been pending
in the Supreme Court and revenue there
has dried up when revenue dries up they
a and there are no repayments coming
back in the same fashion then obviously
when your short term interest mounts up
you are going to end up with a huge pile
of debt and as some of the other
panelists pointed out the underlying
assets do not then look that attractive
they have to
be resold and whoever is going to buy
them is not going to give you full
market value for that let me if I were
to digress from my LFS a little this
same pattern has been repeated for
instance in the a in the JP fiasco the
JP group of industries spent a lot of
money building that expressway the
returns on the expressway were to come
out from the development of the
adjoining land now on the adjoining land
you have huge apartment complexes built
up but there are not if there were
buyers at one point of time who are also
hoping to make a profit but now there
aren't enough people who are willing to
go and live on it the underlying asset
has got eroded the assumptions have gone
for a six this we are now in a situation
where you have one of India's biggest
shadow banks going down and probably
threatening the integrity of much bigger
financial institutions you spoke only of
the employment a Provident Fund what
about the LIC Day that is 26 for a
person shareholder out here where does
the LIC money come from it comes from
the insurance premiums that you and I
have paid to the insurance company the
state insurance company so we are all
going to pay end up paying the bill for
this and in the meanwhile there have
been some people like the auditors who
are either sleeping on the job or were
complicit
they were only concerned with their fees
and who did not do their job properly do
you also have management which probably
like some little mistakes here and there
you you can of course bring them to
criminal court you may send them some of
them away for a few years after after
many years of trial etcetera but the
underlying process as far as ILF is
concerned will have to be governmental
intervention if you have a government
smart enough to do it by
you you must remember that the UPA
rescued Satyabhama rescued Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac saying they were too big
to fail yes yeah that they were too big
to fail the question is whether the
Indian government considers IL FS too
big to fail but let me just for the
benefit of our audience who don't know
what IL FS is n FS the full form is the
infrastructure leasing and financial
services limited it is a company that
finances big infrastructure projects
like large bridges or highways and other
such infrastructure projects so what it
fundamentally does is that it borrows
money from banks via bonds it also
borrows money from citizens and
investors mutual funds the Provident
Fund things like that it puts that money
together and uses the money to finance
large infrastructure projects that's
fundamentally what this company does and
it has found itself in a position but it
is unable to pay back one loan and then
another and then another and that's how
we've gotten to this point
Pascal goes of the BJP does the
government feel that this company is too
big to fail how is it that the RBI did
not notice that these securities
exchanges regulator which is said it's
the semi did not notice that the
auditors did not notice is our financial
system fundamentally broken if something
like this is going on and nobody noticed
mr. Ghosh I want to I want to answer the
question - two different - two different
phases number one let us understand the
structure of this company this is the
first private partnership company PPP
having exposure for around 1.8 trillion
dollars and these companies are managed
by the shareholders like LIC SBI and
aurochs crops but they have got a very
very I can say beehive model of around
160 nine different subsidiary companies
which is exactly very tough for any any
regulator or any mod free agency to
monitor but still their market caps
and based on their performance they were
rating press reading was pretty good now
the first time our government the IT
department 2018 has spotted an
irregularity of you know these fake
contracts there is two part of the thing
one is because of its own structure and
the borrowing and the lending and the
borrowing pattern the whole edifice is
going to press like lemon Brothers and
second is the corruption into the
systems which is further eroding or
further critic father making the whole
problem more critical this you know 300
crore have been siphoned off by giving
the fake contractor and all the first
Delhi Police Crime Branch EOW has filed
in a fire based on that Edie has has
slammed enquiry and they have also
arrested so this is our government 2018
the IT department has given indication
there's a huge 251 crore of contract
have been managed by only 22 lakhs of
the overheads so this company was formed
30 years back his operating in the Indus
India is for last 30 years but this
electability what we found in 2018 later
on it was grabbed so first question the
government is taking all possible
measures all possible steps rather in
order to curb or order to unearth what
is the criminal part of the entire
things now coming to the structural
portion your question was the entire 90
1000 crore is divided into 50 thousand
crore which is for the bank borrowings
and the rest is the market boring
through different bonds and everything
and what our Finance Minister has told
that as the entire instrument is
superannuated so that has to face the
market the market realization or
depending on the market response now the
challenge in front of the back in the
government is to ask the RBI to write of
the 30 thousand crores and so this 30
thousand crores was not built in last
five years it was built in last 30 years
and the contract which they have failed
is basically because of they don't have
cash and they have a cost overrun of
different projects and lot of their
projects have been stuck because of the
land issues so there is another very
important let me ask you mr. baskin if
if you were if you keep telling us from
the government of india that
infrastructure is being built their
rural electrification and rural roads
are being built that we've actually gone
hammer and tongs at infrastructure and
done a fantastic job then why is it that
according to what you just said that
India's biggest infrastructure funding
company right now finds himself in a
position where all of its projects
according to you say I'm I'm answering I
am answering that only though Government
of India has given so much of contract
of tunnels and roads but because of
their poor management because of their
corrupted management they are not been
able to conclude or complete the
projects that is why the cost overrun
and lot of places they were also
strangled into land issues so overall
the running and the management of the
company like one chaired ex-chairman was
arrested
that is those Government of India has
given a constraint supports that is why
even the PF fund was invested LIC SBI
was one of the major investors money
that you say the fifty thousand crore or
the forty thousand one second mr. Ghosh
that it that will need to be written off
that the RBI is going to ask the banks
to write off at this point where will
that money come from mr. Ghosh when the
when the government decides to
recapitalize 12 PSU banks and let me
point out actually that yeah where will
the money come from whose money is that
that's why I'm telling you now this is
the new solvency test which has been
formulated by the new board and MCA
according to that when they put in two
new solvency insolvency tests so there
have been they have been caught
now the government of India is now
discussing at that onde level that what
is the effect of this thirty thousand
crore right off right there are so many
measures could be there in order to you
know reduce the impact but my question
is that the Government of India the our
government present government has taken
all initiatives to identify otherwise it
could be a much bigger scam mama must be
an exposure of in in a you blow this
back one second one second mr. Bhaskar
Ghosh you're talking about writing off
thirty thousand crore rupees which
basically means you forget about it's
not going to come back who pays for that
money the forty eight thousand two
hundred and thirty nine crore rupees
that the Finance Ministry is going to
pump into the public sector banks whose
money is that where does that money come
from is it not the money of the citizens
of India doesn't the government of India
have a responsibility towards the
citizens of India to make sure that
companies like LIC and SBI that are
actually publicly owned which means that
that is our money is better run that
there's better management that there's
better accountability instead of
constantly writing off and constantly
turning these loans around and
restructuring these loans and putting
more money in the P issues but making no
difference whatsoever and how it is run
and how it is managed it's a long road
now it's a very long road because some
assets have to be sold the money will
have to not only return there will be
haircuts huge answer by yeah please yeah
so let me answer these questions Fay let
me answer these questions first of all
is the public the public money yes
what about the public money yeah now the
public money which has been which has
been pumped in for discs for for into
this company that has to be recovered
that is the priority of Government of
India and I can tell you that in a 1.8
trillion dollars turnover or market caps
at least because of our very fast and
very timely initiative we have
restricted to 90,000 crores number one
number two is that there are you know a
lot of measures are there like NC LT is
there doing the monetization process for
the assets and all so lot of a lot of
measures have been taken so that by
selling the assets or by you know ma the
market operation of those bonds or the
market realization of the bonds maximum
money
is trying to be recovered but the
question is to think that why it has
happened it is running for 30 years
where our government was not there in 30
years but during the course of our
government we have pinned down this
crisis we have identified the
corruptions and then we are trying to
take as much as measures as possible
right so that the common common common
should not go to Dre okay if someone on
the phone line right now who doesn't
want to give us her name but she was
apparently a former employee of the
company go ahead we can hear you good
evening go ahead we can hear you if you
can hear me
go ahead yeah Hyman yes what would you
like to say actually I was working with
the company for some time we would start
by saying the government is not a ton of
money and still are there Michael each
one will give us remedy for how many
months were you not paid your salaries
would you would you switch off the
television in the background please and
tell me for how many months were you not
paying your salaries
like we use a bit of collecting on
stream on children sorry you didn't get
your salary for three months and did you
were you told by anybody in the company
as to what was wrong okay we seem to
have a bad line we'll try and get that
back and I so that I do want to ask you
this there is like we said mutual fund
money there is pension money there is
money of other investors if we go piece
by piece and I think the most crucial
bit here is the pensions now the good
thing about the pensions the EPF olds
that it has a sovereign guarantee so the
government will pay the pensions of
whoever's money is lost so what happens
to that money does it get recovered do
the citizens in any way get affected and
as I was saying it's a long road you
have to sell the projects piece by piece
there could be gold plating for instance
the project methylating the inflating
the project cost okay if some of these
allegations of bogus contractor true and
then you'll be receiving say one-third
or half of that money the people will
have to take haircuts they will not get
back whatever they have invested and the
parallel the EDD investigation will go
on now these kind of charges which have
been made bogus bills and other things
they tend to take a serious turn because
we have very harsh laws now yes we have
Prevention of Money Laundering Act we
have benami laws and people can be
dragged for questioning detained and all
this thing will happen and the things
can be even more complicated if Edie
goes and attaches those property in that
case the banks and Eadie will be
fighting among themselves who will get
the property and how to recover it yes
so all that thing I mean for the
investors so actually if we take this
piece by piece what will happen now is
the IDI will seize all the properties
the Enforcement Directorate will
actually put anything under
investigation and actually start that
when the banks actually have access to
liquidate you're saying that you only
recover about a third of what was
invested one doesn't know what doesn't
that's what mr. Vassa Devon was saying
that one really doesn't know the value
of the assets how much it would fetch
out of the money that has recovered the
banks get paid first did the secured
lenders there the secured lenders they
get paid first
after which who comes next what about
the pier
what about the mutual funds will the
mutual funds recover any of them money
well they have been if they have
invested it in cities which has secured
thing instruments in that case they also
come up the banks along with the banks
so if I'm someone who's worried about my
Provident Fund do I have to be worried
in order in this case we didn't front no
but investors mutual fund investors have
already taken the hit the values of
those mutual funds have already fallen
so it's important for you to realize
that even though there was Provident
Fund money in this company you as an
investor you as a salaried person will
not have to take the hit because your
Provident Fund is guaranteed by the
government and you will still get paid
your pension when it is due this is
basically the people who managed it who
will now have to find a way to recover
that money but it doesn't come on to you
as far as mutual funds are concerned
specifically debt mutual funds that is
invested in these bonds they're the ones
who have already lost value in that hit
has already been taken mr. Vasudev
here's my question to you as far as the
public money are the funds that are
being used to run LIC to run SBI and via
these companies run companies like iron
FS to refund or to recapitalize our PSU
banks is there enough of a push from our
government to be more responsible about
management well you know when you got
the basic problem of public ownership of
these banks these public sector banks so
if they are in difficulty whether they
they are not able to meet the capital
adequacy norms and therefore they are
not able to expand their business or
whether they have written off for a lot
of loans and made provisions for a lot
of loans and therefore the capital has
been used for that purpose and therefore
if the government is the owner of these
banks it is the owners responsibility to
capitalize the bank so government here
is only sort of in a way discharging the
ownership responsibilities if it were a
private bank and it had a similar
situation then the shareholders of the
private banks would have to chip in more
money so that enough cap
available in the bank mr. Biswas if the
government is the owner of these banks
along with you're absolutely right
putting in more money along with putting
in more money isn't it also the
government's responsibility to make sure
these banks are run properly
correct
that is the problem so the police is
here the government the bank's roli they
are run the way they are structured
where the the way the appointments are
made there are all political
appointments of the directors of the
chairman and everybody else their board
of directors and therefore their
accountability to the other shareholders
and to the accountability to the
investors and all is not there they are
only interested in say ensuring their
accountability to the government so the
starting point is the public public
ownership of these banks so I think if
you are really looking for fundamental
solutions we have to go the way of sort
of reducing government ownership in
these banks and make them run as
companies you know these public sector
banks are creatures of an act of
parliament unlike other banks which are
creatures of the company law if you are
a creature of the company laws and all
those laws apply to you your
accountability to the shareholders say
be regulations vary the other things
follow but here you are a creature of an
act of parliament so you so the first
thing is to make these public sector
banks as companies under the Companies
Act they remove that shield of public
ownership let them do the business as
other private banks are doing so that is
the starting point and as long as you
are not able to do that and these buying
banks run into problems they run they
are short of capital who else is going
to put in money
only the shareholder can put in money or
you start closing down the banks with
the economic and not afford so that is
one part of the problem the other I
think you are talking about
LFS investment I think the world over
the practices that the pension funds and
the and the Provident funds they are
entities which have access to long
duration
because people invest in inch pension
plans and Provident funds and they take
it only at the time of retirement so
these type of entities the world over
are the ideal entities for investing in
long gestation infrastructure projects
so there is nothing wrong if insurance
companies or pension funds and all
invest in this but the problem is they
the governance of the institution was
not good enough it had so many
shortcomings that they were not able to
use that money properly they invested in
long term projects borrowed short term
from banks and mutual funds and it is
largely a large proportion I feel is a
liquidity problem of ifs of course now
when you have to make distress sale then
whatever assets you have those assets
will not get the market value so you
will have to take a haircut if they have
to take the haircut
then all others who are put in their
money will have to share in that haircut
but certainly if the company goes into
liquidation then the statutory dues will
rank highest there are Provident Fund
and all or statute rules they will rank
higher then the secured creditors and
then the others and of course it last
will be the shareholders who will have
to who are at the bottom of theme but I
don't feel that I LFS will reach that
situation where you will need to
liquidate the company you may have to
liquidate some of these subsidiary
companies and all that but LF as an
entity has sufficient underlying assets
maybe the investors the banks and all
will have to take some haircut if the
liquidity problems are to be resolved by
selling of business assets at less than
market price but otherwise the
underlying assets the investments made
are very much there mr. Jain Gupta had a
point to make mr. Gupta go ahead please
yeah
there are not many issues here the first
issue is that the gentlemen were talking
about the private ownership and
something
Ayelet that had two private shareholders
also oryx corporation of japan and HDFC
so it is not the kid that if you are a
PSE or if you are a private everything
is good no it's not the case here the
issue was that there were too many
owners but nobody taking the lead that
equity was divided between four or five
percent so nobody was owners so this
company was managed more by
professionals than anything so in theory
there are two things there are the
ownership problems and there is an
agency problem so il FS is a typical
case of agency problem where the agents
who were managing the company failed the
investors the second issue is this it is
a situation like a parent having 193
children now the parent would not know
what 193 children are doing so we have
been always saying that limited number
of subsidiaries should be there how do
you manage a company with 193 subsidiary
the board of director who meet for four
hours for a board meeting can't be
looking into 190 disciplinary so
somewhere or nine this structure is
wrong the other thing is very clearly
that again repeating one does not know
at this stage what is the level of
corruption what is the level of gold
plating what is the level of loss but
certainly if the assets are sold at a
desperate measure there will be much
more loss so ideally going forward the
issue would be that put a certain SPV
and at the fair value fair market value
removing the gold pretty part of it that
is much then again go into the stake
because all these investors would have
some directors from the board can we
question those directors that why you
could not follow some prudent norms and
find out what was happening because and
similarly credit rating agency now how
it is possible that till yesterday they
were triple-a and next day they
Camby and now it keeps keeps a panic
reaction in the market because the
mutual fund withdrawn money nobody wants
to renew that loan so what happened
everybody think it was yesterday healthy
becomes a dead body today so my issue is
this and secondly I would say the
Reserve Bank of India always treats and
BFC is a it is a very important and busy
but let well look at the regulation
banks have regulated very much whereas
an BFC regulation is not and why most of
the companies are becoming bigger and
bigger and bases because they do not
want to become bank and get controlled
by RBI so it is a very easy route for
running a company which is a finance
company as good as Bank and many NB C's
are much bigger than the private banks
have a smaller private banks but then
because there is no regulation to they
are thriving somewhere a balance has to
be brought between the regulation for
the bank and something and lastly when I
would point with me that today banking
sector regulation is very very different
it's like a Jew you have a different Act
to regulate statement you have a
different Act to regulate IDBI you have
a different Act to regulate other public
sector mint you have a different Act to
regulate private sector bank and within
the Reserve Bank of India for private
sector bank if you are born in 2000
there is a different regulation if you
are born in 2009 there is a different
regulation I think somewhere they need
to Club everything Banking Regulation
Act in 1949 vintage so nobody has
bothered to bring them up to the date
yes banking division has not been
amended even to bring the changes of
company that yes how do you say that
nobody had paid attention everybody says
okay so so fundamentally I may have put
put very interestingly by mr. Gupta that
there are in fact too many children at
the table and nobody is able to pay
attention to every children 193
subsidiaries are too complicated and of
course there are too many class monitors
so there are too many regulators and
there are too many laws it's too
complicated fundamentally it boils down
to another massive right off that our
banking sector is going to have to do
and what does that mean really for the
general
health of our financial market I want to
thank our panelists for joining us on
the show and helping us understand what
is going on with the INF s problem as
the Enforcement Directorate continues to
now begin raids in people's homes in the
homes of the ex management to find out
if in fact there were crimes that took
place of forgery and cheating over the
last eight years to hide the truth about
our enemies",True,en,8783,43,165

broke out at our godown a Paragon
Footwear near there nah clumped south
railway station and kuchi the fire force
units were pushed into spot and efforts
are still going on to bring the blaze
under control so far no casualties have
been reported but fearing the
possibility of the fire spreading to the
nearby buildings residents in the nearby
areas have already been evacuated my
colleague Vivek now joins me on the
phone line we wake what is the status
right now has the fire being brought
under control yeah at this moment what
we understand from the cops and those
officials out there is a fire still not
brought under control at the same time
the fire the fire school officials have
managed prevent the fire from spreading
to the nearby areas also we understand
that you know the cause of the fire
taking here in this rubber core down it
is the shuffle company called Paragon
one of the begins to go down in Kerala
and it's next to be the inoculum South
Station and it is a short fuse which
actually has less to this fire or about
the story building and all the fiber the
fiber of the file I mean the first five
the flows of this particular building is
completely being gutted in the fire and
okay there is a huge loss that's been
estimated we still don't know how much
how much is the estimation is still not
being counted as of now but our what we
understand is that you know around 18
fire force of a fire force vehicles have
come from various parts of the district
in inoculum and to make sure that this
particular fire is under control it's
house but still even now the fire is
raging but one thing is that they have
managed to somehow prevent the fire from
going to not spreading to the nearby
areas and they've asked all those people
paying in the nearby vicinity of the
five kilometer visibility to vacate from
them okay if you can also help us
understand the area a bit if you can
also take us through the area that this
site is in we understand the proximity
to the inoculum the recession is very
very nice
so what are the areas what are the
building surrounding this place that the
fire has broken out this particular
building is located in the inoculum the
next to the inoculum south railway
station and it is you know it's the
heart of the city yes there are a number
of building nearby especially hotels
largest flat and it is next it's this
particular area near to the Jos junction
which is supposed to be the heart of the
city and and there are large number of
people actually staying in this place is
a very congested area the South Central
Station there are small number of small
small shops small vendors roadside
vendors in this area and what we
understand is that nearby areas the
nearby shops are not being affected
thankfully in this fire that is mainly
because of the kind of intervention by
the fire force officials they managed to
restore in the first 15 minutes the fire
has broken down due to which a huge ok
loss you know he has been averted by the
officials as of now what we managed what
we understand is that in the next 2 to 3
hours the fire force officials will be
able to douse the fire and only after
that we get to know what extent what is
a total loss
that was incurred in this you know a
particular action all right so eating
fire tenders there at this part the
firefighting operations still
continually come back to you to make for
further updates on the car
situation and a massive fire that has
broken out at a footwear go down in the

good evening waters one of the new
challenges for the Election Commission
this fall season will be tackling fake
news regulating social media content the
evil giant that is called the fake news
is well entrenched in our company
country by now it's like a wild forest
fire waters you try and douse one inch
off the fire it intensifies at another
place tonight we will talk about fake
news we will talk about misleading
propaganda and we will talk about
political acts but before that to
illustrate why they're doing this to
illustrate my point about fake news just
take a look at the amount of false news
fake news that was simply generated
around the pole vomit terror attack and
I'm giving you this as the most recent
example from fake videos to pictures and
even false theories and attempts to
divide people this is the first one to
13 2013 Patna blasts video was used to
say that the PM call a martyrs wife
let's go on to the next one videos from
Syria from elsewhere were used to say
this is the terror video there was one
video that went viral that many of you
may also got which talks about the army
now torturing the terrorists which was
actually a video of a pakistani commando
who was undergoing training prowl
Gandhi's image was actually photoshopped
but the alleged picture of the
terrorists Tercel see he's already posed
with this terrorist who carried out this
attack
there weren't numerous counts many that
we picked up from all news the other
from boom news morph image of the slain
terrorist was circulated they actually
took the outlined body of another star
and put a man's picture on it said this
is the terrorist who was behind the pole
vomit at all of this obviously to rile
up your sentiments to to do to pick on
your prejudices to make you feel a
certain way and react in a certain way
if but now blast video was also used in
a similar manner
so these are the various examples that
we've collected for Pulwama terror
attack for misleading courts to
fabricated reports to fake accounts and
fake news websites it is all happening
this election season now I speak of this
tonight because this platform has become
a big political tool for the parties and
their social media armies today Google
Twitter and Facebook told the Bombay
High Court that they're bringing in new
rules new stricter rules to make
political advertising more transparent
so for example they will pre verify
before you can actually put out a
political ad on any of these platforms
they will check who you are where are
you from what is your address what is
your identification physically
authenticate this before giving you the
permission which is why we are saying
start applying right away they will also
have a public library that key will keep
a record of sorts of all the ads
political ads that they're getting every
time there is a political ad that will
pop up in your feed they will say it's
sponsored it's promoted it's paid for
there are lots more which are running on
the screen right now as I speak with you
the question tonight is will this really
be enough in the light of the example
that I've given you about fake news in
the way that tool is being used well
just saying that political parties to
label their ads as ads will that be
enough now there is a petition that has
been filed that says social media Giants
should not be allowed to put out any ass
48 hours before we go - what does that
really work how will that help what
since once it's out on the internet it's
out on the internet these are some of
the questions that we will be discussing
tonight from regulation or social media
to battling fake news in this election
season let's say good evening to our
panelists abhishek mishra leader of BJP
Dowler an alloy with the supreme court
the VEX reins ruin assistant news editor
with attempt with time City Limited he's
part of The Times fact-check team and
their job every day is to identify these
kind of fake news and tell people that
the
post pictures of videos are fake sagar
casita he's a lawyer who is representing
the petitioner who's gone to court with
a case demanding that the social media
giants not be allowed to carry any
political ads 48 hours before watching
savage on joseph co-founder for the teen
banda the digital marketing agency to
give us an insight into just how big
this industry is and how it really
functions let me go cross the sagar
casita first and ask him this question
why is it that your client has gone to
court do you really believe it will help
if you say Facebook or Twitter shouldn't
put an ad 48 hours before voting what
there are so many ways otherwise how do
you how do you stop whatsapp for example
toggle the breathing can you yummy
okay we're just gonna fix that audio
issue with you sucker we can't really
hear you at this point of time so I'm
going to come back to you in just a bit
but let me go across to Vivek Solyndra
as well we make you know every day and
we've been also carrying a lot of these
news that you all have verified and
identified the fake news and put it out
it's a huge huge challenge in such a
scenario to say a few rules about
political ads will that really make any
difference this election season I don't
I don't really think so because ads are
paid for I mean these platforms are here
to make money in the end right so
they'll they'll find a way to bypass all
the rules that are being made even if
let's let's just say that that's not the
case and you know if if a rule is made
and it will be strictly followed but
there are still other ways to bypass it
for example whatsapp the content I send
personally to another whatsapp number is
encrypted there is nobody who can see it
not not what's up not anybody else so if
it's not a big task to to get a team to
do this on a large scale and so recently
what's up
I had gone attended a press meet why
what's up where they were trying to
control this bulk activities but I don't
know how effective this would be yes
absolutely and that you know that's what
we wanted to understand in fact last
week I had a conversation with former
CEC was a recycle issue and he said yes
it is a big challenge I know that the
Election Commission is in conversation
with these social media giants but but
the fact of the matter is we don't know
how much we can really control and
regulate at this point of time let me
see if I can go across the saga now saga
grivna can you hear me yes I can
okay sorry could you explain to us or
what what is the idea behind the
petition you file for your client in
fact the reason being is this because
during the law for the election is this
that the last for the last 48 hours
nobody can campaign the reason behind
enacting such a law is this because
during the time of election the
environment is that one political party
say this I will do this for the public
the other political party or the
candidate says I will do this for the
public in between this the individual
voter get confused whom do I would so to
give a voter a peaceful environment the
Parliament has enacted such a law that
for the last 48 hours nobody can
campaign so water can think in a
peaceful environment and can can cast
his vote today now what is happening is
that because of the emerging of the new
media name - social media the political
parties and the candidates have also got
a new medium or platform to campaign and
that goes on to the last date so we are
seeking in LA so we have filed a pl that
same law should be made applicable on
these social media websites ok but you
you do realize that you know once it's
on the internet and on some of these
websites is very difficult to get rid of
them or once it's already made into a
clipping and forwarded on whatsapp even
if what say our Facebook or Twitter
takes it down it won't help
yes definitely
ok because what yesterday is that any
individual can post anything and
Facebook will sponsor it okay I'll let
me bring in Savio as well sorry we've
had a lot of conversations when the
whole Cambridge analytic are you know
controversy broke out and at that point
we discussed whether or not India is
ready
you know how clearly do we know what is
being shown on on our social media
websites of course we've come some way
from their Facebook now has details if
you see an ad on your feed it does tell
you
the advertiser is whether they are
verified or not and all of that stuff
but is that enough or can voters still
be influenced by profiling them and
putting content that can change their
voting decision tell me I for sure I
think if I have to put it one way we
have moved forward from what it was you
know with the camp Cambridge in Attica
issue you know a lot of pointers that
were made by the fellow panelists I
think and even you started off saying
that you know what stays on the Internet
is always round I think I just take a
step back and understand the rules in a
certain way right so I think 48 hours
not campaigning 48 hours prior to the
elections has been with has been around
for quite some time I still remember I
think in 2014 there was a lot of
confusion around that but the candidates
can talk about it or not so I think that
this rule still makes sense because at
least there is a rule in place right so
you cannot advertise you cannot talk
about anything so that I think is a
progress then always be you know it's
it's a double-edged sword right so the
other side of it will always be question
saying whether we can curb it or not you
know I'm not very sure where the
political parties are not allowed to
advertise because you know in the past
we've seen you know parties coming out
with full-page ads on the day of
elections now that's that's one way to
look at it the other thing is you're
stopping people from doing ads or you
know sponsoring content but you know
there's a New Age influence of marketing
that's taken over right so as an
individual I can probably go out and say
that you know just what for XYZ
candidate that doesn't stop me it's
exactly like how in an offline world
just outside the booth I can just tell
this to someone so I think we of course
it's it's not it's difficult to track
everything at at this given point in
time but I think measures have been
taken by by these platforms and you know
if you go back and see you know what it
was you know almost six seven months ago
and we discussed this on this very
channel that Facebook Google all of them
will look at these elections very
closely because a huge market you're
talking about what's happened
Facebook Indian
users are the highest so this is anyway
gonna be was was was going to happen
Google's implemented it from the 14th of
February
Facebook's gonna implemented from the
21st of February also the important
factor over here is you know if you
would have noticed when now you cannot
forward more than five messages message
at any given point and time on face on
whatsapp this was implemented in India
first you know back in July or August
and in January 2019 is when it went
global
so even platforms are looking to take
measures but you know it's technology
right it's it's they'll always be ways
to kind of work at broadcast these steps
in a way you can still wat cast isn't
it's a view I mean I mean I have so
forwarding may not be may be a challenge
but you can still grow to us at the end
of the day you know in the light of what
the Paloma attack we all got the same
forwards we we all heard the same rumors
and I honestly I think whatever it is
that they watch said whatsapp claim or
Twitter claim that they're doing did not
work and that is a life example example
right now and we are living it and it's
not what are they quick yeah a true true
no no absolutely a quick point on that I
think my only thing over here is as I
mentioned I think you know it's it's
extremely difficult to curb everything I
take any given point in time as I
probably as I mentioned I think we've
come steps ahead but having said that
there is a lot that needs still needs to
be taken care of you know you just open
Twitter right now you know it's it's
it's just you never know what used to
follow because you are absolutely filled
with a bunch of things so again I
probably have to you know put it this
way saying that you know the progress
for sure that is progress but has can it
be curbed 100 percent I don't think it's
it's it's possible with with technology
around on that one often we okay mister
Oliver and wanted to come in go ahead
please what's your view on this
yeah look I think to start with one has
to realize that you know there is
section 126 of the representation of
people's activities been around for a
long long time which already says that
there shall be no campaigning last 48
hours now around 2004 or so the Supreme
Court
they said that this would apply also to
advertisements on on on TV channels and
stuff like that so there was already
being up a sort of peak preclearance
system with the Election Commission in
force since 2004 by virtue of Supreme
Court order and that I would imagine
that would apply to all social media in
any case now I mean I am sure this is
probably what Google and YouTube and
everybody else is saying they're
probably already covered by this so this
would deal with the problem but then I
think the real thing is that this is
dealing with a small aspect of a much
larger problem the multi-headed Hydra
that is fake news see there I mean it's
a positive steps for sure in the sense
that you know at least fake news by
candidates themselves and by political
party is dealing with political issues
they will be there will be a some sort
of accountability and I think even more
importantly that lying I'm faking you so
to speak if it is traced back to a
candidate or to a candidates campaign
could be classified as a corrupt
electoral practice with greater storage
I mean with greater storage and whatsapp
tells us that there is absolutely no way
right now they can share with how they
you will track it back who started it
how do you track it back and especially
to the candidate a candidate can pay
somebody sitting in another city and
other state yes okay go ahead please
what I was just saying was that look of
course this means that that's what I am
that's what exactly what I was saying
this is this hits directly on on on
campaigns and on candidates and and
political parties but of course there's
always the problem of of a proxy person
like you like you just attested and the
real truth to that is that that would be
almost impossible to do don't forget
that you know we are actually there are
two competing interests here and as a as
a free speech person at the liberal this
has to be on the top at the top of our
mind at all times I mean you see the
entire point of having elections the
entire point of our democracy is that
people should be allowed to say and
influence others if I would like you to
vote in a particular way I should be
allowed to say that if I am a political
party etcetera or if I am putting my you
know something wrong or something bad
that is a different thing altogether now
don't forget that if I am
something which is the like so to speak
Peters hate speech that is already
covered by a certain provision of the
IEP see if that influence is an election
and I mean I'm sure the burden of proof
for this would be pretty high if you
know what I mean but if somebody is able
to prove that a certain of a certain
fake news propagated by XYZ influence
the election he could fight the case
fight an election petition and say that
this is the corrupt electoral practice
which it actually is but then like I
said the larger issue would be almost
impossible to deal with because for
example if if I am just saying something
which out of my conviction because I
feel that may be the truth it would be
really difficult for us to kind of curb
that at any time been such a big problem
everywhere and again now coming to the
social media Giants yes but now we are
talking about organized propaganda and
organized way with this structure in
place with drone army is being built to
really ensure that in the least amount
of time you're able to reach out to
maximum people and you do it in such a
smart way that you just tweak a few
words there you just tweak one part of
the video or one part of the picture
that people will not even realize and it
becomes so difficult then to make out
what's true and what's false so I think
I just want to give a few examples let
me go across to uh you know articles for
the last panel yeah I'll come back to
your honor and I just want to highlight
what happened in the run-up to the
Karnataka election and the same by the
way also happened in the run-up to
withdraw elections a short video
showcasing BJP leaders who allegedly
consumed or endorsed beef was was made
as a content as a video that was shared
all over locally in smaller groups and
then the other side then DGP hit back
and they made you know or their
supporters made a similar kind of a
video that was then shared Congress then
came out with a series which said recipe
for disaster
where's they spoke and you know cooked
up these stories about yogya that
they're not and and there is no way
really to trace back where it's honestly
choir coming from who has the time by
the time you crack down on it the damage
is already done people have already
shared it discussed it thought about it
and made a decision on it this was in
Karnataka same thing happened in the
Gujarat state
elections where videos work it's
circulated on Twitter on whatsapp social
media giant I'm not blaming them I'm
just I'm just right now saying how this
is being used I'm absolutely not blaming
them right now I'm saying this is what
is happening on those platforms so
Abhishek Mishra do you think there is a
way to stop this at all all political
parties have mastered the art of using
these tools and at this point it just
looks like the authorities are catching
up then we must get some facts what I
think to the window if they're
responding yeah yeah yeah so the topic
of the debate is whether FB Twitter and
Google are putting up a smoke screen now
you have to get some facts right here I
think nobody has debated that till now
Election Commission of India in
September and October had put up some
set of recommendations to these bodies
in that recommendation the EC I had
clearly said but you have to first of
all give us a mechanism where if there
is any objection all content we can
strike it down second Dec I had clearly
said that whatever political ads you
will be advertising on your platform
will have to be first cleared by us so
your question whether it is most clean
first of all it has come from the EC I
don't know if that these these are these
platforms these commercial platforms
from abroad have decided on the own to
do some good for the election so first
of all I was clear it was IEC I
recommendation secondly today in the
Mumbai High Court
what they have said is they have not
exactly a dirt - what IEC I said they
said not at what coming you see I will
clear will put they are saying we will
have our own mechanism Facebook will
have its own mechanism there will have
an advertiser official accredited
advertiser only if he gives us an ad
whom we are verified will we put up the
advertisement on a platform and will
give all the details so first of all
water EC I recommended has not been
fully followed by Facebook 2:10 Google
secondly one understand these companies
are commercial entities they have
nothing to do their stake is their
profit you have to be very clear on
which not Indians rugged emotionally
attached these companies these are
commercial entities who want a larger
share of the Indian people so say so in
our Indian elections Election Commission
of India is competent enough it will
take the right decision there's already
a PIL filed by the person who's sitting
here we shake one minute please can i
what we have listed out right now is
what the representatives of Google
Facebook and Twitter after all the
either the High Court or they have
already implemented it in some cases
this is not what the Election Commission
has recommended on the basis of what
they have submitted in the Bombay High
Court the Bombay I've got one minute
please let me finish my boy let me
finish my point on the basis of what
they have submitted today the in fact
the Bombay High Court has asked the ECI
that you tell us within the next one
week if you think this is enough or more
needs to be done so I am right now not
debating what the ECI has said I am
right now talking about what these guys
have claimed they are doing what they
have done yes it's a smokescreen yes it
is a smokescreen they are not doing what
is exactly required there what's your
daily doing
who is Facebook to self-regulate what no
no so EC I had clearly given the
recommendation that all the political
ayats you put on your platform will have
to be verified by the Election
Commission of India now saying the
complete authority and EC I is the
competent authority for elections in
India not a failure to die let us be
very clear on that Facebook Twitter has
to add her to ECI okay so a via once you
tell me they are not self entities to do
what they want okay so I I think of
course they are the point made by by the
BJP leader if I am not mistaken if I
call that right yes of course there are
commercial entities and I think that's
absolutely fine because at the end of
the day they are running a business it's
it's it's it's it's a little amusing
because BJP came riding on social media
wave in 2014 so I think saying that you
know and of course
even on the day as I said you know you
look at the way things have turned
around in the last six seven months you
know I think you know the Twitter CEO
has been served notice by the Parliament
parliamentary panel as well so at this
given point of time saying that you know
it's a commercial entity they're doing
wrong or right you know is is I don't
think is is the right way to put it out
of course you know as you know it's at
the end of the day it's technology and
it's a platform there will be ways
people could probably find it around to
do things but to kind of just push them
in the corner and say that you know we
haven't and especially when you know not
even Modi is is is probably the first
social media prime minister of India so
the BJP party at this point in time they
end up saying or any party for might
refer friends are saying that there is
something wrong on that side it is not
about technology it is about procedures
Election Commission of India has a duty
towards India the people of India
towards the position of India they
should hold elections in a proper fair
responsible manner
if a company runaround be absolutely
sure regulate it is not it is all about
who gets what benefit absolutely oh
don't try to be a bonafide it is like I
am using you being a representative from
BJP are currently so walked up about
what these guys are not doing because if
any party has mastered the art of using
the social media tools it is your party
you don't even have to have a direct BJP
account or directly BJP actually giving
ads to Facebook you have thousand and
one BJP supporters this monthly
supporter and that one three supporter
groups who are doing it on your behalf
so of course you want the procedures to
be followed for BJP because you have
thousand and one Roxie's doing it for
your party
on behalf of your party with the money
for my party that being the point now
rauner Island wanted to come now down
the Ryan wanted to come in ten years but
the rules have to change how you hearing
what I'm saying
I am not disagreeing with you I'm not
saying I'm not even debating with you on
the procedures I'm just saying it's
slightly amusing for me to see
BJP talk about suppose you want
procedures to be followed because you
have thousand and one proxies of BJP out
there campaigning and advertising for
you which is also not against the rules
so that's also fine so happy or one
minute piece around Orion wanted to come
in so let it make his point and then I
will come back to you and to Vivek yes
yes sorry I just wanted to say I just
wanted to add that that social media for
example at at the end of the day is just
a tool the people who are actually
spreading the fake news are the people
who are actually doing it so while I
agree that there should be greater
accountability in terms of in terms of
you know for example regulating or
controlling political messaging in the
end everyone has to see that the people
who are actually spreading the message
they the message has to go back to them
which is why I suggested that if there
can be an amendment of the
representation of people's act to make
this a further corrupt electoral
practice that if there is a huge
misinformation campaign which is
benefited you and you are able to prove
that this is the other party is able to
prove that this has happened then the
election should be struck as void as
regards anything else you know like I
said it's very difficult to say if if I
want to forward something because I want
to forward it and I am a member of 25
groups on whatsapp and I I have to be I
should be allowed to do that in any case
it's very difficult for people to say
that you can't do that period and as
regards I mean like I said this will
this is a great tool to control activity
by candidates themselves and by
political parties but it may not really
necessarily affect the individuals were
a part of social media or means or
different political parties and whatever
whatever they do okay like I said it's
almost almost impossible to control it
and like I said to blame them it's not
fair so then who will control them if we
if we if you cannot expect these social
media Giants to do it
who will do it if they refuse to give
access to our authorities if they refuse
to give access to the Election
Commission of India oh then who will who
will ensure a crackdown
yes I wish it - you know and the
refusing at all actually there's there
there they are going to be bound by the
same rules as other people Abhishek we
should replacing they will be bound
why I think it is smokescreen can we can
let us come to Tokyo debate Election
Commission of India in its
recommendation and clearly said give us
a mechanism give us a mechanism wherein
we can delete objection content from
your platform if we think it is against
the rules of the ECI now today in Mumbai
High Court Facebook Google and Twitter
have not told them where I quoted how
they are going to give a mechanism to
the ECI so they are trying to hit up
another High Court just take a way out
they say that we will do something on
our own don't put ECI front of us I
think Facebook Google Twitter will have
to give a mechanism to delete and remove
of any objection all content and that is
how it is not in what you see I said
Facebook to tell Google should comply
okay is that is that for political
campaigns and ads or is that also it is
important is and misleading connivance
yes so that's okay so here is where I am
trying to draw a larger parallel to say
even if let's just say even if Election
Commission manages to come up with a way
to to track and to observe political ads
by parties on social media
let's say just let's just agree on the
fact that the the pre verification
program the pre certification program of
the social media joints is successful
and they managed to do it for official
election campaigns or electoral ads what
about the rest of it what about the
thousand and one proxies that each unit
of each party in that area uses what
happens then Vivek it's a sea out there
it's an army that is being used by all
of these political parties can we really
stop at the Election Commission was
forced to come out and give a
clarification we have not issued any
poll dates please don't believe the
fakeness that you're getting exactly so
i-i'll make I'd like to make some a few
points here one when we talk about fake
news on social media it is a it is a
huge problem why I am talking now about
Facebook and
the number of people using Facebook and
Twitter in India is quite quite large
but if you ask me if people see fake
news on Facebook or Twitter and then get
influenced and then it leading to a
change in the voting pattern I am not
really sure what I can tell you is that
fact checkers should come in there are a
lot of them now times internet started
times fact-check in august there is alt
news that's been running for like three
years
there is boom live india today has one
fact checkers are trying their best to
bust fake news facebook we are working
with facebook whatsapp google all of
them and and they are all doing their
bits but the kind of reach fake news
gets on whatsapp and and there are there
are more dangerous platforms here say
tick tock and then there's something
called share chat these these are
platforms we have not even explored we
have not even started exploring but
those who want to spread fake news they
are very clear how to do it and they
will try to do it in that sense so now
we are trying to make a pattern or make
a setup where we send the fact checks as
forward messages so that it also get
that kind of reach but otherwise it's
very tough for anybody to control what
people are telling other people it's
just like you can't control what I'm
telling my friend you know they'll find
a way to do it okay
in fact you know let me pick up this
another example even for viewers who
understand what is it that we're talking
about yeah I'm coming to you only Sabu
so let me cause my question and then you
can address both both the things but
this is a story that scroll has just
done and they have put out and it's
called the the headline says clean the
nation inside the face group group that
plotted to get anti Nationals sacked and
prosecuted now this is what happened
viewers in after the Palama attacked
that there was this group that came
about together on Facebook
and they said that they will target
people on social media right away leave
everything else let's just start looking
at people who are having a critical view
about the attack on the government or
are mocking it or taking a negative line
on it and let's target them let's
complain to their employers or let's
complain to the authorities and bring
them down the entire concept of this
group was to target the so-called anti
Nationals and to bring them down and we
do know that in many other cases not
through this group complaints have been
filed sedition cases have been fine so
my question here is is there a format to
deal with these kind of you know
concerted organized campaigns then then
go outside one minute we wake wanted to
comment on this point and then I'm
coming to you
yes Vivek yeah I just came across a
tweet by hewlett-packard
of India this morning where it said it
is the company has fired an employee for
making certain comments I I went through
those comments and there was nothing
objectionable in that at least according
to me and I did tweet and asked HP why
this person was act he was sag just
because another person who did not agree
with this person view this person's
views complained raised it to HP and he
was fired I don't know how this works
if in if that's the case things are
going to work then lot of you a lot of
us won't have jobs yes I I don't know
how this works
yes so Savion my point is will they be
ever be you know possibility where
Facebook or or the said social media
platform is actually able to track this
concerted effort and maybe raise the red
flag over there okay a quick thing
I'll come to the question tell me that
you raised a few things before that I
think I've been hearing the debate I
think most importantly you know you also
mentioned this that it's you cannot
blame the platform the platforms used by
the people that's ours right and and
with the politicians if we probably have
to put it out there there are there are
guidelines on ground right so when a
politician's out there campaigning
during elections that is someone from
the EC monitoring that person regularly
and there is a budget sheet that's
probably kept aside so that the person
doesn't overspend that's that's one
thing second is also the fact that you
know places that the candidate goes in
addresses that also is recorded where
the where the candidate is kept in check
by the EC here are the same thing so
candidate probably need to follow the
guidelines that are set by the EC it's
the platform right it's the way I am on
this television you know there are
others speaking over here the same thing
goes for the internet platforms or the
social platforms it's a platform so at
the end of the day it's on you how you
want to talk about it because I can
probably say what I want and and you
know so that needs to be coming from
responsibly from the political parties
and the politicians you know coming to
your question in terms of what scrolled
reported today you know there is there
is if you ask me can it be cracked down
I don't think I don't think it's
completely possible because you know
you're talking about you know such large
base we're talking about 300 million
users in India for Facebook it's the
largest it's miles ahead of miles ahead
of us a and 200 million active users on
whatsapp so what are we talking about
it's difficult to cope so as it needs to
be responsible from both sides right
also to address you know the fake news
which probably is has taken over you
know all possible platforms beat on your
phone or beat on your desktop or
wherever it is you know it's it's
important along with you know I was
reading the street somewhere it's
important that along with the good
morning message that you send or you
will see on your family group you also
need to send a fact check message so you
know so that's that's where you probably
need to you need to up your game as a
user as well because a lot of my time
through the day and I just actually
doing that responding to most of these
who were forwards that I get
where I go back for sell them this is
fake please don't spread it and then we
people to tell them why it is fake it
should be back yeah yeah yeah you know
you probably back it with something
which is like certainly most importantly
the platforms like the fellow panelists
mentioned you know that stick talk and
share chat that still is probably out
there you know and then the universe is
so large you know we're talking about
the top platforms or apps in India but
what about the others that are out there
which will be used so I let me just
elicit few more of these fake news you
know examples that we have collided
together you know BJP leader giving out
saying shed a fake news that say that
was supposedly from a website sounding
similar to BBC would not be BC with said
Congress is the most corrupt party in
the world or something like that
and that post went viral there was a
report that came out saying the EVM
malfunctioned in utter Pradesh but there
was actually a Chhattisgarh video that
was doing the rounds and nothing had
happened not to Pradesh or the other way
around there was another one which
happened in BJP Bihar unit actually used
a 2009 picture of a project to say see
this is the development that has
happened under us now there was an
example where again Parrish I will the
actor who who is a vocal supporter of
the current government use this data
which is false and misleading to say
that there have been less terror attacks
under the current government the fact of
the matter is and Abhishek this question
is to you that if we can't blame the if
we can't blame the platforms should we
as leaders and political parties be
slightly more responsible of what we are
tweeting including some of our ministers
who cut copy paste the other day we had
pratik Sinha here on our channel showing
how they got into one of these documents
that are shared on what subgroups they
changed a few text lines here and there
and you are Union ministers sharing
tweets that made absolutely no sense
criticizing their own government
what I find shocking is that you are
only giving a census of people some
mistakes but done by some people from
the party at the party
there to understand their lot of data
going on the leaders are always busy
sometimes some things here and there may
happen this is a very huge country and
small mistakes if 99.99% of the tweets
are accurate and right the point once
something goes wrong in ten years you
cannot make it out and so don't be
selective give me examples of the
Congress party of the BJP is in power
and center and in majority of the states
right now and I hold the authority to
accountability not those people who are
not relevant and taking decisions for
our voters which is why I am quoting BJP
examples I don't care what Rahul Gandhi
tweets right now he is not a minister
he's not taking policy decisions I don't
I don't have any faith in him as my
minister or elected leader go ahead
please but you understand the larger
point restrain from the political
parties is what I am asking you so
detain to us yeah no no no you see
political party I can speak for the
party and the party
we have always use social media for the
good other people and our intention
always has been to put out the right
facts front of the people and always
create a larger vision for development
of India now instances here and there
you cannot take novel you mentioned some
critics and not these are people who
have a leftist you know they are people
who are you know focused who somehow try
to discrete the government and you
cannot take people who are you know
working in the you know in the luteal
Delhi and try to discredit a comment and
give me the name so I don't want to
uncertainly what petitioners or anyone
of that sort of written now the larger
question is these social media companies
they are used by large section of the
people of India definitely they must be
monitored by the Election Commission of
India
definitely they their personal agendas
must not be you know people should not
be confused by that and I think it's a
right step of the ECI is doing an Bombay
I cry I I think that congratulate the
lawyer sitting for the person has given
the PIL at least he has taken into the
Mumbai High Court and told them why I
could give direction to these companies
at all right agenda can use this
completely okay fair enough running out
of time so I'm going to thank all of our
panelists
you are therefore the BJP representative
had to say the onus is on Election
Commission and on these social media
Giants definitely not on the political
parties and I agree with them because
they are not going to change so don't
expect your political party to suddenly
stand up one day and say oh vehicle only
going to tell you the truth we are not
going to peddle any lies we are not
going to peddle any malicious campaigns
any smear campaigns we are not going to
mislead you because they are going to do
all of those things now what you as the
water can do is find out whether what is
being shared with you ten times 15 times
in a day on your Twitter feed Facebook
feed or whatsapp feed find out if it's
actually true we are on the last word
have been repeatedly telling you ways of
squatting fake news and we will continue
to do that in the run-up to these
elections look at the URL look at the
picture reverse google that picture to
see or if it's been used elsewhere don't
just believe anything that you randomly
get on whatsapp there's a lot at stake
here
false rumors and lies can trigger
violence riots and even get fatal it can
also change voting patterns people can
decide who they want to vote if they get
convinced by this so think about what
you're sharing even in your friend
groups and family groups we on our part
will continue to make not just the
political parties accountable but also
Facebook and Twitter and Google and
continue to question the election
commission or if they are doing enough
to crack down on social media this
election season thank you so much for
joining us on this debate
before we wrap up the ladies on the big
story we've been tracking here all this
week for the first time since the terror
attack in Paloma Pakistani Prime
Minister Imran Khan spoke out today and
he obviously not surprisingly denied any
Pakistani hand in the attack that
claimed lives of 40 crpf soldiers he
asked India not to blame Pakistan
without any evidence
remember it's Jai Simha mother's already
claimed responsibility for this attack
Jessie mama that functions out of
Pakistan they'll adopt the Pakistan
kazama Gaggia knock we evidence knock we
so jockeys can the Pakistan cacao
fighter a good Pakistan eat the
unconference carrot or it may visit to
Crown Prince Khadija home it'd mean
there's a plan currently we vodka riga a
pre-conference co sabotage technically
or nabi hope you visit Pakistan Kusaka

reacting to Pakistani Prime Minister's
response that neither condemned the
attack nor off for any condolences
finance minister Arun Jaitley said that
at a time when the entire nation is in
mourning Pakistani Prime Minister is
asking for evidence and that shows his
lack of sympathy
Jaitley further added that Pakistani
Prime Minister will find evidence in his
own home craft there is not even
a pretext of an outright condemnation of
the incident a very shallow logic that
provide to us and actionable
intelligence as though the origin of the
crime is not known actionable
intelligence can only provide some clues
here the perpetrators of crime have
admitted to the crime and both
perpetrators are admittedly located in
the country of which we call it the
Prime Minister we evident within your
own home that is a wrap for this edition

q9hp849j74w,Kulbhushan Jadhav case: Pakistan to present it&#39;s case today,The international court of Justice will continue hearing the case of Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav who was sentenced to ...,2019-02-19T07:02:25Z,MIRROR NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q9hp849j74w/hqdefault.jpg,"the International Court of Justice will
continue hearing the case of Indian
National Coal Bhushan Jadhav who was
sentenced to death by a military court
in Pakistan India presented its
arguments on Monday saying that the
Pakistan story was largely based on a
rhetoric Harish Salve a senior advocate
who's representing India's case at the
court said that Pakistan failed to give
any specific evidence against Jadhav
to connect him to any act of terror who
they Pakistan is accused of espionage
India had moved the International Court
of Justice to block the other set
sentence and maintains that he is only a
retired Army officer Pakistan is
scheduled to present their submissions
today I will resist the temptations are
to engage with the allegations being
made as to the passport issue and the
legal assistance he should be on saying
it would really be for this court to
decide in the first instance whether
part to what extent Pakistan should be
allowed to use these hearings as a
platform for propaganda without
establishing the legal relevance of this
warrant and allegations Pakistan is
obviously embarrassed to disclose the
judgment given in the jawed of case the
specific charges against him the
evidence against him and while the
statement of the advisor on foreign
affairs to the Prime Minister's Office
of Pakistan makes a slew of allegations
against Java in relation to the
incidents that date back to 2014-15 the
Pakistan story has always been strong on
rhetoric and blurring on facts well now
deputy news editor Meenakshi Raja
joining me on the phone line Meenakshi
India's hoping for two things of course
first the annulment of the death
sentence itself and then the immediate
release of Col Bhushan Jadhav can you
take our viewers through the main
arguments made by senior advocate Harish
Salvia the International Court of
Justice is a very high state matter for
the government to figure which will go
to a lot of applications and yesterday
we saw about nearly three hours of
argument implemented by us our espalier
attention is focusing on three or four
major points point
but this how about that has this
constantly floating article 36 of the
vienna convention which says that people
purchased by is no exception to having
access to come feature and secondly
they're also focused on how despite the
intervention of the ICJ the last time
the family of for promotions other
benefit to make meters other in pakistan
was treated in extremely shoddy fashion
it also relied upon the fact as to how
the proposition fashion has derived in a
conscious manner there is no direct
material evidence that exists which can
justify participants argument of charge
of speakers by of course today is a to
at the ICJ where we will see a pakistan
now for this position forwards over for
this almost all this panel or for the
international to that we will see in
their participants both i get another
opportunity to wrap up their arguments
by way of concluding submission another
first time there is a final verdict that
is going to come from the ICJ but the
interesting part here has been as to how
very savvy struck of a positive note
yesterday after having the argument and
i quote unquote absolutely and he's also
said that Pakistan has made wanton
allegations we just heard that little
clip from offer reached solve it but I
want to understand from you I mean
actually you said you know in terms of
the timeline it's going to take six
months for the final verdict to come out
but this is this is going to be a
four-day trial in your side of the
submissions have been made today
Pakistan will make its submissions
following that like you said there will
be an opportunity for both sides to make
their counters and rebuttals now this is
coming at a time of heightened tension
between the two countries
what is that stake here it's not just
the conversion case in that sense isn't
it there's much more that the two
countries have at stake
well yes absolutely of either the
atmosphere is completely surcharged and
you correctly referred to the fact as to
how tension between into Pakistan
perhaps the all-time high and for
Pakistan interestingly we will also keep
an eye whether Pakistan even attempt to
raise the pool Varma incident although
it would be well advised to not do so
because the issue at hand is pertaining
to collusion jars of alone because we
have seen statements of Pakistan in the
past pertaining to pure gamma
but remember Pakistan is fish facing as
we speak international backlash their
countries after countries failing
Pakistan on different forums for
multiple reasons we don't understand be
that if there be that even the United
States which has talked all aid to
Pakistan and is talking tough to
Pakistan pertaining to not giving access
to the little outfits from operation
within its own soil so a Pakistan is in
in the midst of its finding himself in a
very uncomfortable position
internationally and therefore for India
it is very important that provision
Jarvis case is attains an outcome which
goes on to showcase to the international
community furthermore olicity all for
actions of Pakistan and the words that

this is the face of that is being fought

after the Delhi hotel Inferno killed 17
people more hotels may face this as the
government has asked the fire safety
department to inspect all of these
hotels and to check whether they are
following the fire safety norms or not
right this is now the NOC that has in
fact been given to 30 hotels that has
been cancelled my colleague ayushman
who's been tracking the story very
closely joining me on the phone line
with more ayushman good morning what
more can you tell us yes Norfolk on
briefing he said this that leaves I no
see that was obtained the government is
looking into the matter and has also
done a fair amount of checking in this
process and that is why they have come
to the conclusion this number of hotels
their licenses will be canceled at the
same time Sanjay also said that the
hotel owner hasn't been yet steady yet
and that remains a concern for the state
government because they image the hotel
is encompassing dbgap and that is why he
is at large and the question is - why he
hasn't been interested and yet the
minister also said that the fire
department got a call almost 45 minutes
later the fire took place and at 3:15
the fire tenders reached our pet hotel
just again in Africa briefing the
minister briefed counting action being
taken by the Delhi government over the
hotels were not are not following the
norms in the fire department and that is
why to take a taking a cue from past and
liberal on and ensuring these incidents
don't get repeated a good number of
hotels license have been cancelled and
they've been told to come back with all
those quiet necessities in place and
then something in bigger indentical
right I respond thank you so much for
for bringing us those updates
four days after massive fire on a Delhi
you tell claimed 17 innocent lives
the police have held the hotel owner
response
for all the lapses and have arrested two
managers of the hotel now they are no
owner along with the licensee of the
hotel are still on the run but as the
owner solely responsible for the lapses
mirror now confronted officials of all
the departments to identify who was
accountable for all these lapses now
this is how a process works to get a
license for a structure in the national
capital the owner has to first get an
NOC from the Municipal Corporation of
New Delhi the clearance is given only
after certain parameters are checked but
in this case there was a rampant illegal
construction on the hotel rooftop and
the height of the structure was 15
meters above the permissible level
sources of also told mirror now that the
MCD will now begin an internal inquiry
into the matter and the Delhi Fire
Service issues a fire safety NOC after
the structure is built they then conduct
an audit every three years to renew the
NOC sources of told mirror now that till
2010 the Delhi Fire Service conducted a
yearly audit but following complaints of
corruption the law was changed and now
the audit is conducted once every three
years the local police can verify
property related to documents and fire
safety violations any time now they
cannot take action but have to inform
the concerned agencies which in this
case would have been the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi Delhi fire services
or the excise department but in this
case the police had failed to alert any
of these agencies the excise department
then conducts checks euerle on hotels
and then issues in NOC in this case if
the check was conducted before renewing
the NOC the question arises as to how
liquor was actually being served in
illegal restaurants on the rooftop and
the basement of the hotel the final
agency in the Train is the licensing
authority now every restaurant owner has
to renew their license yearly the
license is only renewed after getting an
NOC from all three departments in this
case the licensing authority failed to
conduct a proper check of the hotel
before issuing any kind of license",True,en,485,1,7

about the action that will be taken he
also went on to apologize to the local
people of Kashmir for the inconvenience
that they will have to put up with over
the next few days as security is
tightened even further but I want to cut
across to my colleague Pradeep who joins
us right now from Jammu Pradeep grieving
and thank you for joining us Jammu did
have a fair amount of unrest through the
day today that we understand now has
been brought under control could you
tell us what happened please miscreants
who are trying to take advantage of the
situation and they are trying to disrupt
the communal harmony in the region and
that is one of the reasons there today
some of the protesters they came out and
vote for certain areas and they also
taught certain vehicles and damaged some
some of them and after that curfew was
imposed and right now the curfew is
imposed in Jammu district and army is
also doing a flag must ensure that no
untoward incident takes place already
administration had been telling at the
station as well as the senior police
officers are telling people to maintain
calm and come in harmony because they
want people not to fall into any kind of
a trap
although the internet connection has
been snapped reason being that whenever
such incident takes place normally the
some people try to spread fake news or
somebody try to unleash a propaganda and
use social
networking tried to carry forward their
fake and false propaganda and in order
to prevent that thing from happening the
internet connection has already been
snapped in Kashmir Valley as well as in
Jammu region besides is there also
getting involved in dialogue process
with different communities telling the
people to also use their good offices to
prevent people from coming out on street
and just trying to create a kind of a
Thermage on the road that leads to
impaired communal disharmony in the
region they want that this should become
and already there has been a dastardly
terror attack they do not want any
international forces to use this
occasion to rip up sentiments and
emotions in different parts of the state
so that there can be in fact a backlash
and there the Brotherhood that exists in
this region can and the composite
culture can be snapped so that is these
are the mediums being taken right now
the curfew has been imposed but all I
can say is that many people here of
their own they had tweeting each other
there instead sending SMS is asking
people to maintain communal harmony in
fact of their own they are taking
certain majors we saw that few hours
back the people from the different
communities they came up and they had
their press conferences jumbo chambers
office and they also had been appealing
people not to come out on street and if
you have to protest you should protest
peacefully because that is their right
to protest against the terror related
activity that a single place but they
should not get involved in any kind of
violence related incident because what
actually has been the strength of India
and Kashmiri is the coexistence of a
different faith just fight here or
attacked you in the last three decades
it has been ensured that nobody is able
to tear of the composite culture and
pluralistic character of this region so
right now in fact both administration's
police as well as civil society is
working in this direction curfew is
being imposed and situations right now
seems to be normal but here's a guest in
the attack we saw that people came out
and straight there started raising
slogans against Pakistan and they in
fact had been demanding that some kind
of way and decisive action need to be
initiated because they are the one who
had been facing the brunt of our
terrorism for the last three decades
they said how long such incidents will
countries because one can very well see
this was the heart-wrenching vigils
coming out and then we saw the family
members all
feeling to the Government of India this
is a high chance that decides vigilance
military action need to be taken and
that was reason that the people were
agitated and upset it is each and every
Indian is right now upset and feeling
that pain but what is really very
important is that despite being
grief-stricken feeling that pain they
are resolute the family man percent is
more important in even at this juncture
and what is important about the country
India is that it is all right apples in
India because whatever we may be having
differences with each other but we are
standing together all for our soldiers
yes absolutely
many tanks predicate Arabic for bringing
us that update from Jammu present at our
life from Jammu bringing in a sub tie an
update of a riot light situation that
was created in Jammu earlier today as
some members of the civil society did
come out shouting slogans and burning
vehicles but that situation has been
brought under control probably Pradeep
telling us that Jammu there has been a
curfew that's imposed in Jammu as well

don't say or about you Chad meet about
Nick admitted well there are other
stories of martyrs that we will bring to
you as our reporters and of course every
and I spoken with families as each of
these forty men have left behind
grieving families wives very very young
children and aging parents but first my
colleague Freddie my colleague Farid is
back with us Farid we understand of
course that the Jammu and Kashmir Police
is making several detentions for
questioning across the state
specifically are in around Srinagar
right now is this routine in an
investigation like this yes faith is the
routine when you talk of any incident of
violence and especially militancy you
have a case where people are picked up
for questioning and there is a mechanism
as far as the police is concerned where
they pinpoint people whom they feel are
connected or there are credible inputs
with them that these people would be
connected with this kind of an attack
because as we were in fact elaborating
the fact that this is not a candy work
of a single person there would be a
complete backup as far as such an
incident is concerned people who have
helped in many ways as far as ensuring
that the plan first of all the
conspiracy is hatched and then bringing
it to the level where it was executed
there would be many people who would
have helped and it is that network you
call it the overground
worker network of the militant outfits
that the police would be after because
once they get them and question them
then they'll get crucial leads into the
complete network of the joshi muhammad
so these arrests would be in that
connection though let me tell you after
every in such incident are these these
things are pretty should i say these
things to happen and the police not only
these seven but i am sure in the coming
days there will be many more people who
will be picked up from for questioning
and especially people who are from
Pulwama from south
mean maybe Avanti Papa mama or in the
vicinity as far as this attack is
concerned because not only them but we
spoke to some eyewitnesses some
shopkeepers who were around they said
that even they were questioned by the
police and by the CRPF about the
incident and that that's the way these
investigations happen as far as
militancy is concerned every time there
is an attack these things to happen so
this this is an ongoing process they'll
get evidence they'll get proof and then
that will uncover in fact more proof and
more arrests and this as I said is an
ongoing process and as far as nie and
other teams are concerned they'll stay
in the Kashmir Valley till the time
they're completely satisfied that
they've gathered everything from the
spot of this blast so that is the other
aspect of these investigations as I said
it's a multi-agency synergized effort
now it's not just the J and K pulley so
all of them will try their best to crack
this case and ensure that the people who
are behind it are completely exposed and
then maybe an operation is launched
against them to really get to them
before they start or thinking about
another attack similar one as we saw in
Paloma yesterday farid there has been of
course a fair amount of sort of
confusion overnight since our last
report last night the newspapers this
morning well into the into the first
half of the day about the death toll in
this particular case it was it was 44
last night it settled back at 40 this
morning very very unfortunate reports
actually told us that in some cases the
bodies were just not found because of
the extent of the damage and which is
why it took longer to actually release
the list of the deceased is is that true
was that what the confusion was about
have you had a chance to speak with the
heads of the CRPF
in Kashmir
yes absolutely that was it was a
situation of utter chaos and confusion
because the the crime spot or should I
say the spot of this attack was an
absolute or should I say it was it was
body parts everywhere mangled remains so
for vehicles and especially it is
absolutely gory scenes that we witnessed
there as we have been saying in fact
yesterday when I saw that those pictures
initially it was like I told it was some
scene from Afghanistan or Syria was on
it didn't look like Kashmir because we
haven't had such attacks there were some
of them but never long long way back but
off late we haven't had this kind of an
attack so it was something that took a
while for the CRPF and for the security
agencies to compile but till late last
night they they had completely failed to
come out with a figure because as I said
these were the difficulties they were
facing and still let me tell you this
death toll will increase because we've
been told that three to four people are
still unaccounted for
they're completely missing this the
nature of the blast was such that they
would have been blown up in smithereens
in literally in small bits so that
that's been that that's the kind of
intensity this blast had on the bus let
me tell you when I visited the spot this
morning the vehicle in which this these
explosives were being carried and in
fact that event of that is nowhere to be
seen but even the bus of the CRPF which
it hit it is absolutely nowhere it is
smashed it has been blown into pieces
literally and what we only could found
was the chassis the few tires and the
chassis of that vehicle so that really
really explains in itself the intensity
and the kind of impact that blast had on
that bus so it is quite obvious that
some offer DC appeals Jevons who bore
the complete brunt of that attack they
would have been literally blown up into
pieces and those pieces would have gone
literally far away and that's that's
something that locals also told us that
they saw see appear French security
agencies literally really collecting
those body parts from far away from the
spot of the attack or the blast so
this is self-explanatory on the kind of
impact and that also really means that
or explains why the CRPF was finding it
really difficult to come up with numbers
40 is the number right now they've given
the complete list with photographs but
as I said still some some some people
are missing they're unaccounted for and
probably they're still searching for
them in and around the blast site they
but for it stay with us because
information that was coming in which I
referred to you was the Jammu and
Kashmir Police of detained seven people
from the polymer district of South
Kashmir in connection to the attack we
also understand that the NI team that's
currently in Palma investigating this
particular attack has been collecting
you know details or has been collecting
articles from the debris that they
believe will lead them clear or give
them a clearer picture or read them
perhaps to the perpetrators in this
particular case Farid again yesterday
there was some confusion about whether
or not the the Scorpio in this case was
carrying a hundred kgs of explosives and
in one case someone said 300 kgs of
explosives is that clarity now on what
kind of explosives Eva these were and
how much was in that car that that was
used in the attack
I had a chance to speak with some people
in the police and the people who have
had vast experience while dealing with
such attacks in the past if talk of the
Kashmir Valley it has seen many in the
last 30 years of insurgency they told me
that a hundred more than 100 kgs is not
possible it would be anywhere between 50
to 100 kgs what exactly it was that
really will be told by the investigation
once the investigation of the foreign
six is complete then only we will know
exact nature of the explosives but it is
quite clear that these were very
powerful explosives could be anywhere
from RDX to plastic explosives to TNT
but yes sophisticated explosives there's
no doubt about it
and this they also further added that it
would take a very strong break brain
someone who was a war veteran or someone
was in-depth knowledge of explosives to
really go through and really make an
idea of this nature so that is something
that the police is quite clear about
that they have someone who's very
experienced in making bombs and IEDs in
their ranks and it is only a handiwork
of a very experienced person with
complete knowledge of exclusives who can
make such a deadly IEDs such a huge ID
now it's not a small idea we're talking
of a value of around 50 200 kgs now if
would have been more than that it would
have literally melted the busts the
indications would have been different so
that's that's what the experts tell us
that was anywhere between 50 to 100
latest explosives what exactly that was
that we'll know in some time once the
four and six complete their
investigation but he has a deadly blast
and probably the XUV or the Scorpio that
was used for this was chosen for the
size and for the fact that it could
really take order it's it's it's the
kind of size it has inside or space it
could take that much of explosives and
it can easily could conceal it so that
it can pass security barriers or it
could could could be taken to the target
site so all that was very well thought
out it was very well planned obviously
not a case where it was done overnight
it would have taken days of basically
planning of really getting those
explosives the circuits and all the
other things that come in come from
configuring an ID so it's not an amateur
job it is a job that has been done by
professionals so who have got all the
support in the form of explosives now
the other part is whether those
explosives came from the other side of
the border or whether they were locally
procured and if they were locally
procured who really gave them how did
they manage to get that so all these
questions in need that's why this
investigation is really crucial to
really get those answers and then act
accordingly Farid we understand that
this was a convoy carrying two and a
half thousand Germans you know across
that highway of which the bus that was
attacked had 51 Jevons on it
was this bus a target because it had
more more individuals on the bus than
others was it any random bus that that
the terrorist picked out do the police
have the investigators have an idea of
whether or not this particular bus was a
target for some reason well faith the
whole convoy was the target it was not
that that this particular bus was
selected and also let me add here it's
not that the CRPF was specifically the
target any forces convoy would have
passed at that time would have been the
target unfortunately for this for the
CRPF it was their convoy their cavalcade
which is passing through that bad time
and that's why it was hit now why a bus
was said see it was it's not just that
is the only buses are part of the
cavalcade there are trucks there are
bunker vehicles bus was targeted because
obviously it had more people inside it
it would have caused most more
casualties and exactly that's something
that has happened because a complete bus
was shattered it was smashed was blown
into pieces so one can easily understand
that they were around 40 45 crpf Jevons
in that bus and all of them have either
died or have been very grievously
injured so it is quite clear that he
purposefully hit a bus to cause maximum
casualties and also importantly
associate say that this vehicle was
following the convoy for the past two
three kilometres so he hit at a location
where there was a steep curve and the
speed of the convoy stopped in fact
became less and that also helped in
ensuring that the impact was big so all
these things were very cleverly taken
care of as far as the attacker is
concerned and as I said he he was very
well briefed he was indoctrinated and he
was indoctrinated to the extent that he
became a suicide bomber which is not
easy to do and then the way we found out
with the Jash releasing the statement
the local inputs of the police that he
was a local so that is another big
aspect that the security agencies need
to focus on because you don't find many
instances in the past where a local has
been recruited and then turned into a
killing machine into a feline by the
Jasher these are multiple things that
are very worrisome and are really
causing a lot of worry for the security
agencies but yes to your question it was
a very well-planned attack and he
purposefully hit a bus because it had
maximum number of people traveling in
this maximum number of CRPF Germans and
the intent was to cause as many
casualties impossible and that could
have only happened if he managed to hit
a bus and that's why a bus was hit not a
truck or any bunker vehicle of the CRPF

complete calm an uneasy calm that is

that his brother doing his duty to his
country you see CRPF that lost the 40
briefs in the attack in the memory of
the martyrs today formations of CRPF
observed two minutes of silence the CRPF
flag was flying at half-mast today and
the CRPF has tweeted off its official
handle saying we will not forget and we
will not forgive we salute our martyrs
of the pol Varma attack and we stand
with the families of our martyred
brothers this heinous attack will be
avenged shaky Varma who's the defense
expert joins me on the phone line was
for my good evening and thank you for
joining us the investigation is
obviously underway and like we were
being told by our colleague in Kashmir
who's tracking that investigation that
now the investigators are looking for
those who aided and abetted people who
helped with the Assembly of the
explosives people who helped with
bringing a hundred kgs of explosives
perhaps across the border or acquiring
it and putting it together in your mind
how difficult is it going to be at this
point to flush out these people from
wherever it is they're hiding in fact
any any terrorist attack done by action
agents however there are always support
agents this week all OH
workers or sleeper cell whatever we call
it but in intelligence order they are
the support agents and no action is
possible without support agent here here
mister other here idle must be helped by
the support agents will acquired this
much of explosives that may be 60 kg
that will be 100 kg explosives arrange a
car for him and all these things were
done and this is the primary duty of the
security forces to to identify these
sleeper agents and they should be taken
to task and this is very important
otherwise these support agents are going
to again and again help the absent agent
though mr. Varma there's there's now
reports about the fact that the
intelligence reports were perhaps
ignored intelligence had already warned
the various arms of other various
agencies that ID was being assembled
that they did have a tip-off that ID was
was perhaps going to be used with an
attack is that enough evidence to
suggest that intelligence reports had
been ignored I won't say that
intelligence report was ignored
however I can say yes there were
intelligence report that Jesse Mohammed
or other journalist organization are
trying to make to do to carry out some
big terrorist activity in the area
and the forces were alert for that
however the terrorists were able to
carry out this unfortunate incident and
mr. Vadra in this this obviously others
we've noticed a certain amount of unrest
in Jammu today and they will they will
be some
business across the valley for some time
to come what do you think should be top
of mind as far as the security agencies
operating in Kashmir are concerned right
now security agency should say that this
must be restored in the valley as well
as all of India and this will be one
action second sleeper agents should be
identified and punished thankfully book
that is another action at this time we
must retaliate with the force our cover
forces and certainly entered in
pillowcase or there can be some aerial
attack on the terrorist camps in the
okay however we should take little more
time because terrorist games move from
one place to other very fast that's why
it's need to make an aerial attack then
you must have the pinpointed position of
the terrorist camps however some action
has to be taken although I am aware that
MFN status has been taken back and India
is also meeting with with several
diplomats and high commissions of other
missions but it is got enough the public
wants that some retaliation strong
retaliation must be taking Thank You mr.
Varma
and I appreciate you giving us your time
this evening mr. Sheikh Ibrahim as a
defense expert who has served with the
Indian Armed Forces moving on China has
condemned the attack in Kashmir but when
asked on its stand against JJ Mohammed
chief Masood Azhar it is said that they
will follow protocol as far as the
United Nations Security Council
terrorist sanction list is concerned now
remember China is a veto member of the
UN Security Council and has consistently
blocked India's attempts to designate as
her as a global terrorist here is a
report
that explains exactly why Masood Azhar
is one of India's biggest enemies and
how we came fairly close at one point
making sure he didn't hurt us again

to all possible diplomatic steps
which have to be taken to ensure the

in this gruesome terrorist incident the

been granted to Pakistan stands
withdrawn the Ministry of Commerce will
issue the necessary communications in
this regard the Ministry of External
Affairs will also engage with the
international community to make sure
that the comprehensive Convention on
international terrorism which has been
pending for over three decades before
the United Nations particularly because
of the definition of the word terrorism
is now adopted as the country mourns the
deaths of the four TCRP of Jevons who
lost their lives in that attack we stand

like the Home Minister was saying that
they would be an inconvenience to the
citizens because of the security
measures that have been brought into
place there is an investigation that's
currently taking place at the site of
the attack
besides which the rest of Kashmir is
obviously at heightened security made
Fareed my colleague joins us now from
either para and Srinagar
maybe they're furry if you can give us
right now and good evening to you if you
can give us right now
an idea of the kind of security measures
that have been put in place incurred in
Srinagar and the rest of Kashmir to
begin with what's happening on the
highway officially you know where the
attack happened and what is the
situation in the rest of the state for
security will be on
president hood security measures that
have been initiated after the attack it
has had its effect on the security
apparatus here and it seems that panic
buttons were pressed yesterday itself in
a lot of security we saw as we move
towards the spot and this morning again
a lot of security in fact unprecedented
device a unprecendented is because
airport road which already is very
heavily secured today instead of just
one barricading that there used to be
two frisk vehicles there were at least
three barricades that were erected now
not at all so to do with the visit of a
high-level dignitaries in fact you talk
of the home minister he along with that
he had brought a delegation or four
officer senior officer so obviously that
was also a reason why there was so much
of security but otherwise also a lot of
tension if you took off for the Kashmir
Valley lot and in fact through the day
today there was very less civilian
movement as well on the streets so
people are also feeling the tension and
then if you have the Home Minister of
the country talking about civilian
moment being restricted whenever there
is a convoy so obviously people have a
reason to worry because there is a
feeling that this attack of this leave
was perpetrated we know who did it
but it is the common man who was being
punished for this attack which is
absolutely not done so that that is
something that the people are feeling
right now because imagine these these
convoy movements really happen 24/7 you
are BSF army crpf so does that mean that
people will not at all be allowed
because there was one such attack now
such an attack can happen anywhere it
has been happening in fact across the
world and in fact even if we talk to
various parts of the country you have
had bomb blasts and attacks but that
does not mean that the common man will
be put to task and in fact he will be
punished for what he has not done so it
seems that kind of a message has been
sent
obviously yeah well but it tell us this
obviously Kashmir's main business is
tourism at this point they would have
been several people although the exams
are on in school right now so it's
really not peak season in India but if
someone does have trips planned to
Kashmir is there an advisory that has
been put out
government or by by the governor's
office on what tourists should be doing
at this point I will know advisory as
far as tourists are concerned now there
is also a message in this for a tourist
in fact yesterday if you remember you
had put this question to the governor he
said that tourists have absolutely no
worries there they can come they can
they're free to move around in fact
we've seen that tourists even during
worst of the situations have been
welcomed by the common man because he
understands that tourism is a mainstay
and people here are hospitable there is
no need to really repeat what has been
happening in fact in the Kashmir Valley
as far as the guests and the tourists
are concerned so tourists obviously
there is no advisory as far as tourists
are concerned but if you look at long
term ramifications of what has happened
in Palama yesterday yes it seems that
the government is prepared to go for a
long term some long term measures as far
as security forces and their operations
in the Kashmir Valley Valley are
concerned since morning Fay we have been
hearing even the Prime Minister talking
of giving free hands free hand to the
security forces but the fact is that
orderly there is a free hand to the
security forces had not that been the
case they would not have been have been
seeing so many militants killed across
the Kashmir Valley they were under
pressure and such an attack was expected
though not to the scale or magnitude
what we've seen yesterday but they're
very expecting that they may try to hit
back because their morals are sagging
their Carter is depleting so they needed
to do something to ensure that they show
their presence such an attack was
expected yes you have failed as far as
generating intelligence is concerned is
a big security failure but you cannot
really put you you really have to look
within and ensure that such a kind of
failure does not happen again but for
that you cannot punish the common hand
by restricting his movement so this is
something that the government needs to
look at it yes yes very as NT people by
taking such measures just one attack
really going for such knee-jerk reaction
so all
these things needed me to be balanced
when they take these decisions common
man cannot be put to suffering so this
is something that they'll have to
balance but as of now it seems that the
day they've decided to take these steps
because of the kind of response across
the country and also importantly because
this is something that has not happened
after in fact for a long while such big
magnitude and so many casualties in fact
if we look at the screen right now the
life visuals coming in from Delhi that's
the Raj Verdun rathole the Union
Minister for sports and information
technology right before him was Rahul
Gandhi the president of the Congress
party and before him were the three
Chiefs of the forces the Army Navy and
the Air Force paying their respects at
polymer port to the forty deceased of
the CRPF who we lost in the attack that
took place yesterday I just want to
quickly go back to Farid about the
investigation that's underway Farid we
do know of course that the ni a has sent
out a team that's assisting could you
tell us if the Jammu and Kashmir Police
is leading that investigation is at the
NI a leading that investigation and have
they completely cordoned off that area
at this point what what do you know
about the investigation so far
well Fay this is a multi-agency effort
now it's not just restricted to the
local police or the local security
agencies rightly say there Nighy is into
it now because for them it is a terror
attack and every a if this happens in
any part of the country and I it does
make it a point that they do go there
and take up the investigations now in
this case they we're on the spot they
did try to collect whatever evidence
they could and not only and ia talk of
Central Research Laboratory team which
is highly specialized and have all the
right tools to really be part of such
investigation they're there on the spot
again they try to collect whatever they
could from the spot though as far as
this case is concerned there are many
things that are wide open it's not a
closed or a blind case you have the
Joshua claimed responsibility we also
know
how they did it through a car bombing a
suicide car bomb but we also know the
person who did it so there are certain
aspects of this case that a wide open
they do not need a rocket science to
figure out but you have to go through
the procedure the right procedure as far
as these investigations are concerned
there is a late procedure and these the
agencies are following it it is a
multi-agency effort as I said because
this really involves everyone now
considering that this is massive this
has been an unprecedented kind of an
attack biggest in the history of CRPF
and it has shaken one and in fact
everyone across the country so obviously
the response has been big as far as
security agencies are concerned these
teams will keep visiting Kashmir
whenever they want and as I said now
it's a multi-agency investigation so all
of them will pitch in and try to ensure
that no angle is left untouched
obviously lot of homework now needs this
needs to be done by the security
agencies because as we have been saying
this is a massive security lapse it is
not possible that the kind of
intelligence network and robust grid
that they have that they missed such
such such a big attack and they had
absolutely no idea about it now
obviously they say that they had certain
inputs but they did not it seems there
has been complacency at some point at
some level and that has led to this
extreme intelligence very very quick
question Farid obviously we also saw the
input that came in yesterday there was a
warning that they might be such further
attacks that would suggest that the
intelligence has reason to believe that
they may be other explosives that have
been hoarded in some parts of the valley
have do have you received any
information about a progress that have
been that might have been made in that
area have they discovered other
explosives are these searches going on
in other parts of the valley
over the years there is a very well
oiled mechanism and grid as far as the
anti insurgency is concerned so those
operations are ongoing even as I speak
to you it's not that this attack will
really change that mechanism is just
that the urgency will be more now if we
talk of south Kashmir areas Pulwama
where this attack took place it is a
hotbed of militancy and has been for
quite some time now so these intense
agency operations search and combing
efforts continue almost 24/7 yesterday
there was a news that some areas of
Pulwama have been completely cordoned
off and search and combing effort
continues but the fact of the matter is
that this is not routine we're not
talking a physical or logical who are
there there is a local veteran presence
as well this is Joshua Mahmoud and let
me tell you these people they do not use
social media to that extent and they do
not really leave their traces so this
this this will require some effort as
far as security agencies are concerned
to track them down and especially the
people who made this ID so obviously
they have the expertise they obviously
also have the explosives to make an ID
so if they have done it once they can do
it again so that that is the big
challenge how to stop them these efforts
will continue they will continue to
search your the areas of Kalama where
they have inputs of Jash presence as we
have been saying is this is the observe
guru squad or for the joshi mohammed
people who are mostly fighting or have
been trained to kill literally killing
machines so they'll be there and
obviously I'm sure that in the coming
days that these efforts will be sensor
fired by the security forces they have
some inputs so obviously I spoke to one
senior officer they have some inputs but
they need to really go after those
inputs and I am sure that in the command
is operations will be intensified as far
as that belt of south Kashmir is
concerned all right Freddie do stay with
us and I hope you're warm this evening
because we do understand this very cold
in Kashmir as well which possibly is
adding to the challenge of all of the
security services that aren't actually
being beefed up across the state our
bureau chief there Fareed joining us
live from Srinagar information coming in
there Apollo Hospitals has put out a
notice saying that it offers free
which meant to Jevons injured in the
poleramma attack for recovery and
rehabilitation at any of the polar
hospitals across India of course the
CRPF will have access to government and
army hospitals but that note is coming
in there from Apolo hospitals and you'll
see the visual on your screen right now
this is Paula my port in New Delhi where
the remains of the 40 martyred deceased
crpf Jevons have been has been brought
and giving people in Delhi in the
national capital the heads of the forces
an opportunity to pay their respects we
see Rahul Gandhi on the visual as well
as mr. Rathore
the Union Minister we understand that
the Army Navy and Air Force Chiefs are
also there you can see them standing
next to Rahul Gandhi as they each walked
up to as they each walked up to those
coffins to lay a wreath and pay their
respects we believe that the presence of
the Prime Minister's awaited at this
point and from the visual you can see on
your screen that does look like security
or the SPG which is the special
protection group for the Prime Minister
it's possible the Prime Minister is
about to arrive as well and those are
live visuals that you can see on your
screen the Prime Minister will also pay
his respects also a which I believe
that's Arvind Kejriwal the chief
minister of New Delhi who has arrived in
his signature sweater and he pay his
respects at this point I've in case you
bother arriving at polymer ports Chief
Minister of New Delhi to pay his
respects to those 40 coffins you know
the visual actually coming in through
the day as first these coffins were
assembled in this sombre manner in
Kashmir where the Home Minister mr. Raj
Nath Singh play paid his respects and
also at one point lent his shoulder to
carrying one of the coffins for a short
distance and perhaps giving it you know
the respect really that that is that it
deserves by carrying the coffin Raj not
seeing putting himself as a grieving
sort of placing himself as a grieving
family member
really for that Japan put this visual of
40 coffins 40 dead men is perhaps a

arriving at polymer port mr. Raj Nath
Singh the Home Minister and mr. velocity
Raman the Minister of Defence coming in

returning from Srinagar where he arrived
this morning he's had a very long day
he's had meetings and briefings with
security agencies he's spoken with the
press he's reassured the press he's met
you know with representatives and the
leads of the CRPF as well
he now arrives in Delhi to pay his
respects again showing really that this
is the most important thing as far as
the government is concerned and it
perhaps is in the corridors of power
right now in New Delhi the most
important thing it's something that
preoccupies the minds of everyone there
the Home Minister Rajnath Singh paying
his respects again
also with mr. Rajnath Singh arrived mr.
Mueller ctrockman the Minister of
Defence of the Government of India there
you see her walking up to the coffins to
pay her respects it is a fairly cold
night in New Delhi
Nirmala Sitharaman the Minister of
Defense when our reporters across the
country have actually been at been been
to the villages which are now eating the
remains of their loved ones these 40
Germans came from different parts of the
country from Tamil Nadu Uttar Pradesh
and Bengal and now those families have
heard that their loved one who was just
on leave and was returning to duty will
not come back alive martyr omit from
Shamli district of Uttar Pradesh is the
youngest Javan who was killed in
yesterday's attack I'm if I only joined
the CRPF in 2017 and was 22 years old
yesterday when he lost his life my
colleague Ashwin is actually standing by
he visited I'm its family today
Ashwin obviously this would be a
terrible and a sad loss for that family
a 22 year old young man over the promise
of his whole life ahead of him what
conversation did you have for the family
Ashwin well the family members were not
exactly ready to talk but the kind of
sorrow that they are facing right now
was it was unexpected it was very
difficult to talk to them but what they
said in one line was till what time will
the Army and the sea and security forces
of this country will keep paying these
prices at the same time when we were
talking to the friends of amethyst they
said two days before like on 12th he
joined the CRPF 92 he was from 92
battalion he joined the forces in 2017
was the youngest sibling of the five
brother and sister he was the youngest
one so you can you can think of what the
family must be going through this same
time soundly is the place from where two
people two of the Germans have let down
their lies one person constable Pradeep
he was from 12th battalion he joined
these services in 2003 and day before
yesterday like yesterday when he was
leaving he called the family members and
said I'll be reaching the peasant
you and in return the call came that he
is no more so the families are grieves
truck they are demanding one answer from
the government as to when will be the
time that the security forces will be
paying up this crisis and it is very
difficult for people like us to go and
to talk to the families because
ultimately they seek an answer which the
government has to give sooner or later I
should when you did of course visits the
the family you you were there you said
he was the youngest of five siblings you
perhaps also from how I understand
walked around the village met other
people who might have known him when are
they expecting the remains to arrive and
is the entire village in mourning right
now no ash man did you all right we seem
to have lost that connection with Ashman
we'll come back to him when we do get
him visuals visuals on him screen of

awaiting the arrival of the Prime

were dying almost everyday English me

at a NATO at me you have hosted at home
here at the air in fact Farid is back
live with us and Farid the you're
familiar with the story of Nazir who was
lost yesterday and his family who's not
just in a state of shock but also feels
that every day there's news of someone
being alive being lost a life of a
defense officer or a Javan being lost in
Kashmir and that is the most unfortunate
thing the numbers of these losses have
actually climbed over the last couple of
years is this currently the emotion
running across the locals in fish meal
there is just too much death too much
destruction absolutely
the locals are literally sandwiched in
this conflict earner everyday you have
someone in me who dies be the policeman
again he's a Kashmiri is a local be
civilly and a militant again he's a
local so it is a continuous mourning for
the people of Kashmir is just that
places keep changing but the faith is
the same so this is this is something
that is not new to Kashmir unfortunately
people have or to still live continue
with their lives so they have somehow
learned to live around it though this
this is a constant process now imagine
yesterday there was this massive blast
there could have been a case where
anyone could have also got trapped in
this there's there's a lot of vehicular
movements people common man was lucky
that he in fact missed that attack
otherwise there could have been civilian
casualties as well so it is a daily
processor for the common man here in the
Kashmir Valley death and destruction is
been seen from the last 30 years people
are fed up with this but they really
have nowhere to go who will they tell
their stories for in fact every day I
mean you talk to anyone in the Kashmiri
Valley he would have cheated that he
would have seen a situation where he
would have been lucky to survive so that
really is the life in Kashmir but people
cannot really escape it they have to
live here so they'll have to live with
it so that that's rate that really is
the mentality you have to ensure that
the show must go on and that that's
something that a common man here ensures
but other than that as you rightly said
it's a daily story of grief of pain of
struggle for a common Kashmiri and in
fact from the last sometime the death
toll has only increased with civilian or
beat policeman CRPF army men who were
getting killed in the Kashmir Valley
that has only increased there's no doubt
about it
while today everyone will grieve this
because this is a massive incident but
then every other day you have someone
dying in the Kashmir Valley the people
feel that not everyone gets the same
attention from the government and no one
really cares as to put an end to this do
something about it so that this railey
ends this the suffering daily suffering
ends but the way things are going
unfortunately there seems to be she went
to the
there's this vicious cycle of violence
keeps consuming lives and that really
has been the story of Cushman in the
last 30 years but it tell us what the
situation is right now with schools and
colleges and general business see in
Kashmir have schools been closed in
Srinagar will the children continue life
as normal at at some point on money
welfare is up now or since its winter
vacations so schools are shut they'll
open the first week of March but other
than that you have routine daily life
that continues I mean it's it's it's a
stop and start life for goosh meetings
because every other day there is
something that brings life to a grinding
halt did it's a curfew or you have a
firing incident or there is shut down
called by the separatist so it's
literally become a routine a part of
life for the common man to see this
struggle and somehow continue his life
now schools while they're shut but there
are private to coaching centers that
continue in fact just the other day you
had a blast in even a coaching centers
of 15 people or 15 students were injured
there so this is this is as I said a
daily tale of a pain struggle of
bloodshed in the Kashmir Valley people
are fed up with this common man
everywhere has the same needs he once a
safe secure life life with dignity with
education good economic life for his
kids education and everything here also
the story is not different but as I said
he's unfortunately got tangled in this
vicious cycle of violence and the common
man has nowhere to go and today he's
been dealt with another blow that convoy
moments will mean that a common man a
person who wants to drive cannot radius
to stop so again this is something that
he has not earned but he'll have to live
with it because there has been a blast
and there has been a decision that
everyone will have to pay for that blast
so that that's the kind of sense of
common man is feeling out of that
decision but as I said this is this is
the way that the common man lives there
and this is the way that he has been
living and violence it unfortunately has
become an integral part because he has
to live with that he cannot move out of
push beef so he
has to live with and if he has to live
with it he'll have to somehow
incorporate this which is absolutely
seems impossible but that's the way
things have happened in the Kashmir
Valley now schools will open but these
kind of blasts I have had a shattering
impact on the psyche of a parent imagine
he has to send his kids daily to school
school bus even a school bus can come or
get trapped in that kind of an attack so
if common man really will have to live
with it somehow ensure that he continues
his life he continues the life of his
Azure education of his kids so this is
this is really really the story of a
common Kashmiri he's been living with it
from the last 30 years and unfortunately
this vicious cycle of violence is
showing no signs of tying down only
consuming more and more lives Hey
yes Farid odd and that is perhaps the
most unfortunate thing unfortunately we
have stories to tell today like Farid
was bringing us of the people who have
lost their lives the martyr Pradeep
Kumar was also from Shamli in Uttar
Pradesh he survived by his wife and two
children aged 13 and 15 his brother
who's also a soldier says he's proud
that his brother died in the line of
duty doing his duty for his country
but yet I do not you cannot go hey they
can get at the skipper show you the
words could you hear no sorry indeed is
at the end over Jericho Sutra solid I
already knew all over Japan
that's the Prime Minister Narendra Modi
who's arrived now at parlor my part this
was the presence that was awaited this
entire time when we saw the rest of the
ministers and the heads of the forces
after they pee into their respects
reading therefore the Prime Minister the
Prime Minister has now arrived
who had spoken in two different
occasions just today quite emotionally
making it very clear that these deaths
will be avenged and that he has in a
very sharp statement he said he has
already given the Armed Forces his nod
to take whatever retaliate reaction the
appropriate action that will be
necessary
the Prime Minister that being his

we'll prepare now

Defense Minister Minister of Information
followed by Rahul Gandhi and the speech
off the Defense Forces the Army Navy and

as the Prime Minister leaves palem
Airport I'm going to cut across back to
Srinagar where my colleague Farid is
still alive Farid I understand that
security will require you to move from
where you are in the next 10 or 15
minutes can you explain to us what's
going on well it's a routine security
drill that continues in the Kashmir
Valley and as I said since yesterday it
has only increased damage they had a
pure crossing and here they have put out
barricades and the checking of vehicles
and frisking has started so this is a
continuous process that the people go
through but the obvious obviously since
yesterday it has only been enhanced but
say what has really been shocking today
is what has happened in Jammu writers
having a field day being literally
allowed to really go out and create this
frenzy there's this violence and
unfortunately giving a completely
different colour to what has happened
trying to come no lies it and they did
have literally gone through those
localities in Jammu unchecked burning
vehicles and rioting
now this is the second failure of the
authorities in the last 24 hours 1 they
had a big Intel and security failure as
far as this blast is concerned and
number 2 this was something that was
very glaring and open and it didn't
really work it science to figure out
that they could be people in Jammu who
would try to use this situation and to
create this communal frenzy but nothing
was done they went unchecked and till
finally they had to bring out the army
in Jammu and but by then damage was done
not only to property but also to the
psyche or the minority minority comedy
that was there let me tell you Kashmiri
sir
many of them where in fact had to stay
in the civil Secretariat people who have
gone there to in fact as part of their
Burma they had to stay inside for their
safety so this is something that is
absolutely unwanted something that
should have been stopped should never
happen and not at least the name of
nationalism and nationalistic
credentials so that is absolutely
shocking and I
wanted to really take your attention to
this aspect of failure of the government
this is part two and this is the second
failure in the last 24 hours
one big security and intelligence lapse
and Srinagar because of this blast
number two what has happened in Jammu is
absolutely shocking and should never
happened because that really has given a
completely different dimension to what
should have been an incident which was
condemned by one and all across across
caste creed and religion but
unfortunately there are still people who
are the real anti nationals who want to
give it they're completely different
twist and turn possibly for petty
political gains back to you well a quick
question to you before Rob you're
required to move from where you are we
were talking yesterday about the fact
that Kashmir has of course fist is
severe winter over the last couple of
weeks and movement has been you know
difficult yet somehow this attack was
planned and carried out and orchestrated
will the severe winter hinder in any way
the investigation or the ability of the
Armed Forces to nab the those who were
better the attack because we do
understand from your reports yesterday
as well that while there was one suicide
bomber who drove the truck or who drove
the the Jeep into into the bus there
were others who opened fire what
information do security agencies and
investigators have on the others who
fired or who shot at the other buses
well
security agencies later on clarified
that it was just a suicide bomber attack
and there was no support other than the
attacker himself for there was no one
around though initially there we were
told that there was standoff I incident
which could have been a kind of a cover
given to the suicide bomber by his
accomplices who may have been lurking
around and they also fired a few rounds
at the bus but now being told that that
was not the case it was only the suicide
bomber with a vehicle full of explosives
who rammed his vehicle whether the
convoy but as far as your question on
the winter and the extreme winter is
concerned absolutely it will not hamper
the security force operations because
they have been doing operations in
winters for the last thirty years in
fact just if you look at the last couple
of months of extreme winters you will
find non-stop operations against the
militants hundreds of them have been
killed across the the outfits beep
Lashkar his bull even Jasher have been
killed in in fact previously the
security forces did say that the
security forces where the Josh was
planning some big attacks but there
there Carter was neutralized oh yes so
far it obviously while while while you
tell us that the driver of this of this
Jeep might have been alone at the site
obviously there were other people who
helped him people who assembled the
explosives people who configure the IE d
other handlers bases perhaps in in the
valley what information or you know do
the security services know what they're
looking for at this point at this point
do we have any information on that well
our sources in the security apparatus
tell us that they do have very credible
inputs that josh has managed to
infiltrate some hard core and
well-trained and war veterans as as far
as getting them into the Kashmir Valley
and ensuring that they do something big
sensational and also recruit young
impressionable minds into the fold and
basically turned them into killing
machines now that that input has not
proved wrong because here you have a
case where a local boy
17 year old or 18 year old boy has been
really indoctrinated to the extent that
he has become a suicide bomber now this
is not something that is easy to do but
they have managed to do it so that tells
you that these are alarm bells ringing
considering that if they've managed to
do it with one boy they can do it with
others as well so there so this is a big
challenge for the security agencies to
get to those people as I said they call
it the observe guru Scott a special
fighting squad that has been created to
launch big impact attacks like the one
happened yesterday previously they were
more into sending their feed on your
Suicide Squad security for installations
they attacked at the gate then entered
the installations and then held on for
longer so this is a multiple
multi-pronged challenge for the security
agencies but they know who is doing it
it's just a matter of time when they
basically get the right input and maybe
they'll carry out these these search and
combing operations against them and that
is pivotal because as I as we have been
saying that if they've done it once they
can do it too twice or yes clear and
present inconsistent
Fariq many thanks for joining us live
right now on on mirror now and bringing
us those updates we're going to take a
very quick break but we will come back

massive colossal lost the biggest of
course for the families of these
soldiers but for the nation as well 40
brave lives that we have lost in that
deadly attack that took place in Pearl

based out of Pakistan earlier in the day
two attributes were paid in the presence

this massive convoy traveling from Jammu
to Srinagar and then beyond were
attacked that convoy was attacked
yesterday and 40 of them they were in
that bus a vehicle laden with explosives
kgs of explosives came and simply rammed
into them is suicidal Blom bomb blast
that cost us 40 brave lives visuals on
the right of his screen from earlier
today now of course those 40 mortal
remains have been brought back to the
national capital all in the day there
was a wreath laying ceremony all these
coffins wrapped in tricolour a 21-gun

these soldiers who have died who have
sacrificed their life for our nation
these mortal remains will now be taken
to the home towns many of these soldiers
from Uttar Pradesh from Bihar several of
them from Tamilnadu from Karnataka from
rajasthan madhya pradesh even indiana
and kashmir bengal and this just shows
how people from across the country just
come together and become this one unit
one battalion who then lived together
and simply got us and protect us and
then at some point sacrificed their
lives for us Mir Farid is joining us
right now
he's been getting us the updates free
which is bringing the visuals of the
mortal remains as they are brought back
to the national capital what can you
tell us about the follow up on the
investigation we of course know that an
ni a team is in Kashmir today well done
we
is going to be a multi-agency synergized
effort as far as investigation of this
case is concerned this is huge this is
high-profile considering the kind of law
CRPF has suffered so in fact every
agency you talk of any agency he's in
fact that agencies involved in this the
this operation or should I say
investigation you talk off for the local
police obviously they're they're part of
it but then you have teams of ni a you
even had an SG team you even had the
CFSL this central foreign six research
laboratory team from there also was
there in Srinagar they were at the spot
and try to gather whatever they could
from the spot of this blast though there
are several things which are quite
evident as far as this attack is
concerned this is not like the shooting
in the dark they know several things one
obviously that the joshi Mahmud has
carried out this attack number two it
was a car bomber in fact his identity is
also revealed that is a local from
Pulwama so there are several things that
are cleared but then as their
professional agencies know they'll have
to literally go by the book ensure that
the writer method and the way SOPs are
followed as far as the investigations
are concerned but the effects of this
attacks attack have been felt right from
Kashmir to New Delhi everyone in fact
the whole country is talking about this
attack people I agree we saw that the
government also came out a Home Minister
was here he in fact headed or should I
say presided over a high-level security
meeting where they were top officers
from all the belt forces you had
intelligence agency top officials
because there is a feeling that this was
a huge huge security lapse a
intelligence lapse and that's why that
they were trying to really find out as
to what exactly led to this
where was the laxity and just to ensure
that in future these these loopholes
these lacunae are filled so all these
things service amel taneous lee
happening and i think this is going to
be long drawn process as far as this
attack investigation is concerned it
will take some time before all these
these steps are completed as far as
investigation is concerned but the Home
Minister made certain very important
points in his press briefing here he
talked about convoy movement we had been
reporting that something may happen on
that
front he said that convoy moment
whenever there is a big convoy movement
of traffic civilian traffic will be
stopped which is in fact something which
has never happened in the past though at
local level it happened from situation
to situation but if the Home Minister of
the country is talking about a step this
will have massive ramifications on the
ground as the common man here in the
Kashmir Valley has already started
talking about it that how is it possible
that through the day because convoy
movement is not something that is
restricted to certain as it happens 24/7
you the army CRP a BSF convoys moving so
does that mean that he cannot move his
vehicle when all these convoys are
applying so when will he travel how will
he move out so these are the questions
that people are asking there is also a
feeling that their panic buttons have
been pressed a knee-jerk reactions were
just because of one attack this attack
could have happened anywhere it could
have happened every we've seen attacks
on the pattern code base does that mean
that you do steps or take steps that
will really stop or in fact stop the
moment or the people so these are the
questions that people ask him but as I
said right now this attacker has
definitely led to certain reactions from
the government or which are
unprecedented obviously yes the
government is under pressure but then
warmongering all wrap Anik reactions
obviously won't help to really ensure
that they come to grips with the
situation so all these things done we
are happening simultaneously but yes an
attack that is definitely led to a
ripple effect - right from Srinagar up
to New Delhi and in fact the whole
country talking about it yes absolutely
Farida in fact the point that you made
the Home Minister also acknowledging the
fact that yes there will be some
inconvenience to the civilians but when
there are large convoys that have to
move on that Highway they will have to
shut it down for as far as access to the
civilians is concerned referee thanks

holding this high-level meet and taking
stock of the security situation in
Kashmir this of course is to take stock
of the situation the the security
situation in Kashmir more importantly
here because of course this is being
seen as a security lapse for the manner
in which this massive terror attack was
carried out on how the vehicle managed
to pass through laden with explosives
hitting directly at the CRPF convoy we
have with us our correspondent Mir Farid
getting us further inputs here with
these details coming in with this
meeting Farid
you're gonna be reconnecting with our
correspondent me for it here on that in
just a bit but these are images of a
very crucial meeting that is now taking
place and this is with the defense
directly to take stock of the situation
the security situation in this
high-level meat being chaired here the
presence of the Union home minister
Rajnath Singh in Srinagar in Kashmir as
we speak our correspondent mere with
those updates there Muirfield please go
ahead yes as we have been reporting
about the fact that this is the major
security lapse at least all the
indicators or all of the parameters who
started this attack is concerned
suggests that yes there has been some
laxity as far as security agencies are
concerned or whether all of the
intelligence input front already acting
on of the intelligence inputs in a time
bound manner so all these questions have
been raised and probably in this meeting
they'll drill over what kind of security
lapse it was where did the security
agencies go wrong and more importantly
what now they need to be done to bolster
the security mechanism several steps may
be discussed in this meeting and
probably a new mechanism as far as high
rate securities and convoy security is
concerned may also be discussed while
the larger issue issues would be part of
the deliberation but as I said immediate
convoy security and the challenges they
had as far as the car bombing is
concerned may also be discussed it's
also more about sending this message
across to the people to the public that
the government is very concerned about
it and not taking it lightly and they're
doing whatever is in their hands to
ensure that
1vb this attack the people behind it and
the right investigation is undertaken
and number two to ensure that steps are
taken and lessons are learnt from this
attack so that in future these attacks
are not allowed to be repeated and
people are stopped in their tracks so
this meeting is more about a complete
comprehensive security relive all the
senior officers of this various security
agencies intelligence agencies are part
of this meeting governor of fermentation
is that the public is also there
so this is in multiple ways an intent as
far as the government is concerned just
to show to the people that they're they
much concerned about it and they are
taking all steps possible to ensure that
these attacks don't repeat itself and
also as far as this attacks the act is
concerned just to ensure that
responsibility is fixed and it is theme
as to why and how it took place and
where was the last security or
intelligence those things will also be
discussed right and certainly me and
many thanks for getting us those inputs
here a lot of questions that would need
to be answered now here on this with

our look now this has happened in
Narayana it's an industrial area and the
western side of the capital city what we
are hearing as of now is that this is a
big fire FRA and it's also spreading so
efforts are currently on to restrict the
level and extent of damage remember this
comes close on the heels of the fire
that broke out earlier that took 17
lives in a hotel in Karol Bagh so
clearly we are going to also look at
where the fire safety norms were
violated and what exactly caused this
fire all those details are awaited right
so from what we know internally
information is that the fire department
says they received a call at 7:10 a.m.
and in fact in fact after that we also
saw that we also saw that they responded
rather quickly
as of now a total of 23 fire engines are
at the spot and the deputy fire chief
officer rajesh Bhanwar is at the spot as
we understand those pictures coming to
you from the location it looks like a
huge blaze again on the higher floors of
this building let me go across to our
look saying who's tracking this story
for us I look when and where did this
happen what is the latest from the
ground and can you tell us more about
the rescue operation are there any
people there because we have received
very sketchy details as of now can you
take us through the latest please well
according to the fire department
official no casualties reported although
it's a huge fire it appeared to be a
massive but no casualty and nobody is
injured at the labels that we were
working inside this factory that is that
is the Archies manufacturing our chief
guard manufacturing factory this is
located in an inner Ayana area which is
elisa
south western part of the national
capital and there is the industrial area
where the factory is located and several
other industries are also in the same
premises fire departments as soon as the
quantity for ABC
against at that point of the fire and as
of now elect an information also of the
fire it was the cause it's a huge fire
but what was it you were injured in the
incident right okay just one more quick
question as of now do we know what
perhaps could have led to the blaze and
I mean it only seems to have intensified
in the last few minutes that we've been
reporting this story if you can give us
an update on what what are some of the
problems that the fire department on the
ground are facing well it's it's not at
as a lien problem that whatever we have
in the past team that in such kind of
for places like in the industrial area a
lot of illegal construction are are due
to which that fire department always
takes time to repair that but in this
case it was it had it has not yet
happened and the fire department team
that reached there and they start with
the rescue operation soon of meeting
they found no such problem that they
faced and let me tell you that this
Factory is of guard manufacturing
factory so that the lots of paperwork
and papers were lying there that got
boots and all these things so it is the
fire as soon as the fire caught that it
spread all over the building and that uh
that fortunately nobody was injured
right so clearly because it was a card
factory susceptibility he was hi whether
they were fire safety norms and all of
that will track with you I look thanks

well moving on now to the fire that has
scared most of Delhi in a follow-up to
that fire were 17 people died some in
their sleep the FI R has now come out
that confirms that every rule had been
broken by the sudden question we must
ask is this a you and I safe to be in
any of our cities if no one from the
fire department is checking if no one
from the MCD or the local government is
checking and if the hotels themselves
are violating all the rules and who is
taking responsibility take a look Hotel
our petrol is fired in Delhi's Karol
Bagh left 17 dead and over 35 in jail a
day after the incident mirror now
accesses the F IR that lists out serious
violations that went unchecked in the
hotel the police has now transferred the
case to the crime branch the case is
registered and two people have been
arrested that the hotel manager and the
hotel general manager the owner is still
absconded police is investigating the
case as our investigations continued we
expose how lives were lost because
authorities shook responsibility Delhi's
chief fire officer blames the civic body
as he washes his hands of any
responsibility unless some government
agencies forward the case to me I am NOT
going for an inspection in every case in
each case the case was referred to us by
MCD or by the deliveries so it is
basically they are the licensing
authority we are not the lessons we are
just involving in this this building is
fit from fire going to before the
occupancy person
the Delhi government has directed six
fire service teams to inspect hotels
across the city to see if they are
violating any norms 17 lives snuffed out
as authorities passed the buck families
which have paid the ultimate price are
now left inconsolable my brother that
some accident happened in Delhi but we
doesn't know that it was so serious we
thought that maybe some minor incident
would be happening but we can't say we
can't express that but we came to know
in the evening that is cool didn't know
we haven't seen him it his name was
Linda Kumar he was 32 years old he just
came for work - from the company site
just for a meeting we came on Sunday and
it happened actually it happened this
fire incident in the hotel and there is
no proper information how this fire has
been occurred we're now asks who is
responsible for the 17 deaths due to the
file let's do it
I have some quick questions to ask you
there are my questions do you have
family members who travel on work a
regular basis and stay in hotels your
family members who are travelling right
now every time you've stayed in a hotel
do you check whether all of the fire
safety mechanisms are working where the
fire exit is whether or not the exits
are blocked
there's your office check before they
booked you into a hotel if that hotel is
fire Singh there's a lot that goes on in
this country based on a sort of tacit
understanding that someone would have
taken a look at it so it must be safe
let's just get through the day it's not
what we've discovered here in Delhi
it said these people were asleep a fire
broke out at 3:30 in the morning most
people were in their beds everything
went wrong the hotel was
the corridors had wood paneling that
caught on fire and it made it impossible
for people to run out of those corridors
the fire exits were locked because or
blocked by material of some sort storage
material staircase is being used as
storage the staircases that were
available had no lights and so people
started a stampede they fell over each
other and got injured and that steak has
got blocked no one called the fire
services till almost an hour later when
it was too late even when the fire
service did attempt to get there they
couldn't reach because apparently that
road had all been blocked and there was
no divider turn and he couldn't make a
u-turn and they had to drive around the
hotel had actually broken the rules
completely and built an extra floor more
than they had the permission to do so
the MCD had not conducted any sort of
routine checks and had actually given
permission to this hotel to have a
kitchen on the top floor which had no
business having a fire department and
not continuance indeed conducted regular
checks either so you and I go out on a
daily basis to restaurants to malls to
movie theaters to hotels do you realize
that there is nobody taking
responsibility for our lives and this is
our capital city and the show with me
inside the bus is a political analyst
speaking on behalf of the aam aadmi
party that is not here at this point
Bhaskar Ghosh with the BJP SK Theory
former chief fire officer of Delhi van
Rijn coolies a concerned citizen
Santhosh Kumar is a professor of
governance and public policy at the
National Institute of disaster
management in dr. Sanjay's and hawala is
he senior lawyer joining us out of
Mumbai my first question is to one then
a [ __ ] who joins us as a citizen what
energy as a citizen in Delhi the the
details that have emerged out of this
fire and the fact that nobody is willing
to take any responsibility how does this
make you feel as a citizen it feel
terrible faith because these stories are
absolutely tragic they get even more
tragic it seems with every incident we
are not learning what we need to do what
are the systems that we need to put into
place and the biggest problem which I
think comes up is not that we don't have
enough departments but there is
absolutely no confluence between
different departments and different
agencies and different authorities as
your reporter said earlier it seems like
passing the buck we don't we are not
responsible for this they are supposed
to do this or those guys are supposed to
do this we have the systems in place but
the left hand doesn't know what the
right hand is doing and so the result is
this and the biggest problem is and the
greatest concern is that with every
incident where there are so many lives
lost we don't seem to be learning any
lessons in fact I have a citizen who's
written to me on involved who asks
additi birth watch is written in and she
says how can a citizen no fear for
particular building is following safety
norms or no it's true you can't no it's
not your job to know there are people
who have that job on the on the show
with me right now is Bhaskar Ghosh of
the BJP
Baskar Ghosh the EM CD or the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi is run by the BJP
no checks were conducted on this hotel
the hotel's licence had just been
renewed a few months ago while it was in
violation of all the norms including an
extra flow that it had no permission for
what was the MCD doing and how many
people in your experience and you live
in Delhi I understand mr. Ghosh how many
people in the MCD you think took bribes
for this for issuing that license well I
think
I can't really comment on how many
people has taken bribe or not but let me
put out some more facts in front of my
panelists and of course of in front of
you this hotel was given license a 2005
and this hotel was getting renewal of
license and this structure which has
been made over there there was an
rooftop restaurant there was a basement
bar was going on and when our Union
Minister visited they found that exit is
exit passage is absolutely narrow and
was locked so it is a matter of it's a
matter of coincidence of so many odd
factors coincide chest taken place apart
from the short circuit is obvious you
know one second faster gosh let me let
me just go back what which unit minister
visited the hotel when was this and why
was there why was the hotel not shut
down immediately the our Union Minister
mr. KJ alphonse he has visited there
when the sound goat unquote that exit
was too narrow and is locked maybe after
the fire that's not my point
pastor Josh I don't want to know who
went to do a do a photo op after the
fire I want to know now here's what we
have you you are right
the hotel was built many many years ago
but its license was renewed last year
why was the licensing system of a jail
that was violating all the 2017 when we
came to the power if NDMC
the license was renewed in 2018 why was
the license renewed for a hotel that was
violating all the rules no there is a
fund a structural violation which has
nothing to do with the no licensing
given because licensing is renewed on
certain parameters but what he said was
unauthorized structure was built much
before the license here the parameters
is there safety parameters was there
mostly the safety parameters has taken
into considerations and mostly safety
parameters are taken consideration
because you just
you just said hang on you just said that
the fire exits were too narrow I'll tell
you the list there was no panic alarm
there was no emergency exit there was
unauthorized there was a kitchen running
along top there was a bar running on
four rooftop that was unauthorized
unauthorized kitchen in the basement
combustible plastic material partition
on the wall and no proper signage
display apart from several other
violations last renewal was done May
25th 2018 why was this renewal done if
the hotel was not safe why was it not
shut down yeah yeah that's something to
say this is the combustible material
which is used for day-to-day functioning
of kitchen but the question is a because
of the structural division they have
done much before perhaps then quietly
still on and there is a narrow passage
exit so live seventeen lights to could
not be saved because of the well did
this problems or these problems exist
about let the enquiry report comes out
police you know what I've learned I've
learned a very long hard lesson here on
this channel that every time a
politician or a government tells me they
wait for the enquiry report they mean
and they hope that we will forget about
it now first of all let me save both you
and me a lot of time we don't forget I
actually have a chart on my in my office
where we list out all of these problems
and we keep coming back to them once a
month so I'm not going to forget so
you've got to hope that I forget I will
not forget so you might as well answer
now why is it that the MCD renewed a
licence for a hotel that was obviously a
deathtrap and would kill everybody if
there was ever a fire because there was
a fire and it did kill people charred
bodies were found in rooms in their beds
mr. Bhaskar Ghosh someone in the MCD run
by your BJP that promised us a brush
touch our mucked Bharath handed out a
license to a hotel that was unfit to run
a business please tell me why
and if your only answer is a positive in
corruption I will accept
I would appreciate what I want no no no
please did please do not have a linear
relation between the data of court date
is absolutely unfortunate even the Prime
Minister says immediately this is not a
mass murder he's concerned about the
entire thing but the question is until
unless the NDMC inspections or
investigation Delhi police is also
investigating let the investigation
comes and find that okay what are the
lapses and there was already there's
announcement that anyone who has found
to be lapses will be taken into cos so
question is I had one rupee for every
time someone in government said that
wine that there are bribes taken by NDMC
and right so let let that come because I
send a lot of a lot of short circuit
issues are coming that structure is the
master coach I'll ask you a
straightforward question or can choose
to answer yes or no are the members of
the MCD corrupt if I have to say yes or
no I have no answer because until I less
the corruptions cases of proof we cannot
say they're corrupt are the members of
the MCD completely there should be in
every and unable to do their job are
they incompetent yeah I mean the
apparently shows that there is an there
is a lapse of duties from all angles
from different authorities but to
pinpoint and finalize it and to come to
a conclusion of course it needs lot of
documentation lot of proof a lot of
proven facts and if that come
technically obviously this in my opinion
there's only one of two things either
the BJP run MCD which is the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi is incompetent and
unable to do their jobs in which case we
should throw them all out and get new
ones or they're very competent to know
how to do their jobs and they're corrupt
and actually accepted money in return
for life
in which case we should throw them all
out and get new ones so I actually
leading us all to the same destination
but I appreciate the fact that you want
to actually you want an inquiry to find
out which one it is are they corrupt or
are the incompetent because I don't see
a third option s Cade here is a former
chief fire officer of Delhi mr. Daly
thank you so much for giving us your
time is this a case of incompetence on
behalf of the people who issued the
license let me clarify first of all
about this sort of a thing because there
is a living example of of our cinema
where the multiplicity of authority had
issued the licenses and given the
clearances for functioning of that
cinema hall which had a fire in the
morning and again it broke out in the
afternoon at about 3:30 show and killed
about 59 people when the inquiry were
conducted and things who are finalized
no Department was spared in that case I
remember the compensation to the extent
of corrosive rupees were paid by the
fire services electricity department the
MCD the police
everybody was penalized in that case and
even the officers were not spared in
that case you know I remember I had
broken my spine my collarbone my
shoulder bone while doing the
firefighting rescue operation of har and
I'll end up in a hospital and after
three months when I got up I had to face
the CBI inquiry for almost about eight
to ten hours to give the complete
replies to them and based on that
information and what other information
they had gathered they could fix the
officers and the other responsible
people who had violated the safety norms
and allowed this sort of thing to
function and they were penalized in that
case sigh the boss of the aam aadmi
party we understand that the fire
department in Delhi is completely
understaffed
what is the Delhi government doing and
does it not think of it as important
there's nothing it important to staff
the fire department lives are cheap in
Delhi apparently side of us
deaf well oh definitely speak I speak as
an analyst here I was a former MIT party
Emily candidate so I'd like to present
where is the aam aadmi party we did not
think it impossible important one second
one second one second side of us let me
just ask my team did the aam aadmi party
not think it important it should be part
of this conversation they didn't want to
come okay so sorry about saya pologize
to my viewers Santa buses don't with the
rmally parties a former member of the
aam aadmi party the aam aadmi party that
runs the city of delhi topless was not
important enough for their time they
have chosen not to be part of this
conversation they were not part of
conversations on our channel yesterday
either so they're not taking
responsibility for the fire department
that reports to the Delhi government the
Delhi government stops do you please go
ahead go on it I I definitely
yes yes so my stand here is filled with
the my little experience in the
elections let me let me share the Nexus
here and let me speak as the citizens
voice which I started two years back on
your channel I'll tell you what is
happening not just Dell even in
Bangalore even otherwise mostly in Delhi
what we see is the Nexus the corporators
the municipal court raters are hand in
glove with the hotels they invest about
five crore during the elections five to
ten crore just to win and cooperator
seat so therefore they want to get it
back in return they want a return on
investment therefore they have a handle
of nexus with the hotel management where
they're proof a trauma Asakura is a
proof another extension of another flow
approved kitchen in the terrace approved
basement approved without any fire
security norms it is so unfortunate
where you're saying is these elections
are run on money won on money and their
words it is this thing like you said
this has to be stopped
it is very unfortunate for us to see a
situation like this seventeen lives lost
it could have been anybody's family it
could be mine or anyone else and that is
very shocking what you're seeing in fact
let's try and get the are multi-party or
the phone line as well let me just bring
in the other members of the panel
Santosh Kumar is a professor
in the National Institute of disaster
management mr. Kumar there's obviously
been a massive case of let down here by
a breakdown of protocol in members of
local government who needs to be held
responsible because my worry here is
that all members of government will turn
around and say wait for a report wait
for an inquiry wait for a report and
then nothing ever happens in your
opinion who's responsible for the 17
lives that were lost it's very
interesting to note that that who is
responsible somebody's responsible
definitely the fire has happened and
when you do the cause and effect
analysis then you will find that what
were the causes and and who actually
dealing with those causes and that would
be very that would be very clear picture
it will come that who was the
responsible but the second question
comes is that how this could have been
prevented and then probably that would
be a kind of a thing which we can
analyze it properly like said even if
that Hotel has this kind of a license
renewed now the second is that whether
the entire the building was in order
meaning thereby meaning thereby meaning
the staff who was supposed to be
attending if such kind of fire
eventualities happen whether they were
adequately trained and whether they were
actually exposed to such kind of a
practices when the fire happens and the
fire extinguisher has to be operated
number one number two whether that is
this firearm was coming again and again
that it was not working well that is
smoke immersed and it did not give the
fire fire alarm people would have
survived so this is when we are going
and try to analyze each kind of a
building that cause is that why it has
happened and then we will find out
whether the other building of such kind
of of hotels which are working in Delhi
are they are also on those parameters
are they safe enough to go as there and
go and stay there so that is a time
where now we are talking about let me
just tell you let me just tell you what
what was happening here okay and I want
to bring in doctor so Jake anthem Allah
dr. Gondo Allah this is what happened
the fire alarm did not go off VM
lawyers of the hotel had actually locked
the doors for the night which meant that
people had nowhere to run to
they were all trapped there were a total
of 53 guests in that hotel 35 are
injured and 17 are dead which means that
nobody got out you know without a
scratch
everybody got hurt in one way or the
other the employees called the fire
department of after 40 minutes of this
fire the fire started on one flow and
then spread to all floors because the
whole thing was combustible and was like
a tinderbox people died in their rooms
because there was no place to go so
obviously without a shadow of doubt the
owner of the hotel who is currently
absconding he's fully responsible for
multiple counts of murder but my bigger
problem is that government that is meant
to keep people like this from running
establishments where people will die has
done absolutely nothing so gigantic
Allah do you believe that it's just the
owner of the hotel who should be held
accountable or members of the MCD as
well who continued to renew his license
everyone who was connected to this has
to be held accountable including the
corrupt officials of the MCD when
Camilla Mills happened the BMC suspended
several officials action was taken
immediately they are named as accused in
the charge sheet but here we see that
the crime scene has been visited by a
Union Minister and the Union Minister
has personally observed that the exit
was virtually impossible to even cross
so if your exit is virtually impossible
to cross and I'm glad that we have this
statement on in front of the entire
nation then that's the end of the matter
where do you need an inquiry this
clearly proves the culpability of the
owner who is absconded his bail should
be opposed he will try to obtain
anticipatory bail the government should
put all their best counsels on the job
and like we handled suni she tops case
yes in the guard copper crash over here
he is still inside his bail was
I could also wear culpable homicide
charge was there 10 years he's facing
same thing has to be done here and Fay
I'll tell you one more thing I think now
we should go across three zero four and
go two three zero two because this is
blatant murder this is mass murder with
intent all permissions which were taken
for fake fabricated forged and and as as
a result of inducement and corruption
they are no nest in law they don't exist
you have an illegal top you have an
illegal basement
you have exit doors which don't open you
have fire equipment which doesn't work
you have employees who must have come
from some small towns here and there
underage people who lock the whole hotel
and go away because they want to go and
sleep somewhere actually you have the
whole lane where you cannot allow the
fire engine to come inside semi now this
is what this is what the the people we
we as Indian citizens every day we face
fire manual portal
corruption and this is what is happening
Constitution is violated by these people
as far as the Indian citizens are
concerned
absolutely wonder as you go on it is
high time that we rise up and we see to
it yes please absolutely to it that the
statement made we have yes go ahead go
ahead
why don't you go ahead yes I completely
agree with dr. kanta wala uh he has
listed it out absolutely the ignore the
concerns he has listed out we have a
callous attitude towards safety anywhere
you look we have a callous attitude
towards cleanliness and orderliness and
we have a callous attitude to our safety
and actually fail the intersect because
when you have a place which is designed
as a fire exit and you have no sense of
cleanliness and no sense of orderliness
and you stock stuck there which is not
meant to be stockist your putting stuff
on staircases which is not meant to be
done you are creating a safety has
everywhere do you remember the kind of
hazards that have happened when the BRT
was being made how many people a biker
at least I know lost his life because
you have Mulberry here you have broken
stones here you have open manholes
nobody who's supposed to be checking on
the ground checking every single week or
every single second day you think we
have a we have a dearth of people in
this country we have a dearth of labor
in this country no we have a dearth of
accountability in this country nobody
who's supposed to be on the ground who's
supposed to make those checks makes
those checks and that is why we are
there and I want to I am very glad you
have someone from the opah tragedy here
the gentleman said but do you know how
many years ago the apart tragedy
happened do we have to wait every time
for a family to be completely shattered
because somebody is dead for us to bring
this to talk about this again over and
over again I have an architect friend in
Bombay I want to bring say this on on
screen he this person tells me that the
buildings are built and given permission
NoCs are given power given without there
being enough passageway behind the
building in case there is a fire for any
kind of vehicle to come there we don't
have a singer we don't have we have
absolutely no sense of master planning
if there is a hotel where is the exit
where is the second exit you said as I
just watch my point our brigade yes yes
yes one I want to point out that fire
safety laws and rules are very very
clear in our country they're very cure
of how these things need to function
what rules need to be followed the
problem is in implementation because
government that's actually implementing
and handing out licenses is nothing but
corrupt and they are willing to accept
money in return for our lives and this
is something we have to realize very
very clearly in this country as citizens
every time you won't remember not to
work for a government that will actually
result in a fire like this because
that's how cheap your life is agency is
responsible in this particular case so
first of all the North Delhi Municipal
Corporation run by the BJP it issues an
energy for the building structure issues
an NOC for health and food both of these
energies were issued to this hotel that
had a restaurant functioning on the
terrace at the terrace that you can see
that is currently on fire that that was
on fire the one where the fire started
and it had a restaurant in a kitchen
running in the basement it had no
business running either it had no it was
not safe but the NCD Delhi North issued
that license that's run by the BJP for
our viewers benefit the Delhi fire
department comes under the Delhi
government run by the aam aadmi party
now this fire department has supposed to
conduct fire safety measures in checks
every three years an issue and NOC the
first NOC is issued during the building
construction and after that they have to
have random checks this fire department
is comes under the Delhi government of
the aam aadmi party also the Delhi
police comes under the centre ruled by
the BJP needs to conduct regular checks
to make sure that everything is running
properly it has to examine on a regular
basis the NOC is from the fire
department in the Municipal Corporation
it also issues a liquor license
and finally the excise department that
comes under the Delhi government ruled
by the armed aadmi party - counts for
the Amida party - counts for the BJP
nothing for the citizens sort of birth
wash from the armor the party joins us
right now sort of brother wash thank you
for being kind enough to join us on the
phone could you please tell us why the
fire department in Delhi tells us it's
understaffed doesn't come doesn't that
come under the aam aadmi party why
doesn't the Delhi government staffed its
fire department adequately AHA that's a
really interesting question and you will
be surprised and I'm sure many of your
viewers will be surprised to know that
forget putting stars in the fire
department we cannot even ask the
question that what is the vacancy in
fire department she cannot even ask a
question in the Danziger about what are
the vacancies of teachers in schools
because the service the so-called
service department lies under the LG
although during the Sheila Dikshit
German
services which includes hiring vacancies
transfers postings disciplinary action
everything was with the chief minister
but after the central government came to
the power this one in 2014 they brought
a new notification to which they took
away that services the part from the
Delhi government and give it to LG
however tomorrow we are waiting
anxiously for the Supreme Court
judgement and hopefully that comes back
to us I just want to ask you and I do
believe that on the 4th of April last
year the aam aadmi party put out a
report card mr. Barth watch where you
listed out this exact problem and you
said the Honourable LG is not giving us
permission to access services now in
that report you listed out the
department's the sanctioned force the we
can post on the percentage of the posts
that were weakened all fair the Home
Department is not on this list the fire
department comes under home department
did you not feel at the time that you
were generating this list that the Home
Department is part of the our monthly
parties let's state government and why
is it that the Home Department and the
fire department are not listed on your
list because of two reasons you know
that cooking for different reasons one
is probably a listed it they stick those
vacancies under some other head or it
could be they could not generate those
vacancies because I am Telling You I
myself put a question and by the hon
Sabha it was my start question about
vacancies in different Department no no
stick to the point to stick to the point
let me ask you one more question fine
you've made your point about vacancies
oh that's points taken and we'll wait
for the Supreme Court to give us
judgement is well I want to ask you
about the exercise Department the
exercise Department comes under the
state government run by the aam aadmi
party year so no yes yes it does
the excise department also issues
licenses to hotels like the one that was
that was in this fire
this like this hotel had a license from
the excise department can you please
tell me why that license was issued to a
bar on the terrace that had no municipal
or you know that didn't have the
permissions that it was supposed to have
I'll give you a straight answer please
do as you mean that the fire
apartment officers in connivance with
the hotel gave away the fire license and
I excise department in active can
islands with the Hotel EF took money as
brave and gave them you know excise
license assuming it that is true and
even if I have the proofs and even if I
have a knowledge you'll be surprised to
know neither me nor my Minister my chief
tester can even transfer then officer
mr. Bhardwaj
are you a citizen are you a citizen of
India I am yeah I do believe mr.
Bhardwaj the citizens of India have the
ability to file complaints with the
Queen to the local police about
corruption under the Prevention of
Corruption Act is that's not true
touch me how many complaints have you
filed with the local police about this
alleged corruption that you talked about
I personally would have fired more than
eighty three complaints and not just in
my personal capacity I have tried to
file complaints even to the rancifer
committees which whose whole sole aim is
to fix accountability of officers of the
Telugu me he'll be surprised to know in
spite of giving proofs against the
setting is officers in Delhi government
we have given proofs the LG did not do
anything against them to do something
when you file a complaint the police
complaint of that kind is also criminal
nature needs to be looked at by the
police doctor srikanta wala there's
something horribly rotten about a system
where everybody talks about corruption
but nobody does anything dr. kanta wala
yes
yeah I guess this routine check theory
and seeing everything is a very routine
way of life as played and gone into our
bone marrow now very sad to realize that
but let us talk about the tragedy of
Kamala makes Fay you and I as Mumbai
cars we have been through a horrible
tragedy your studio was completely
destroyed you know you know what hell
you have been through in that now in
that what happened was we had filed a pl
mr. Julia Ribeiro even at the age of 90
was concerned we filed the PIL in Mumbai
court Mumbai court appointed the
sovereign committee retired Chief
Justice and scathing observations in
respect of each and every one concerned
including in fact even I should
appreciate mr. Jay Mehta himself
conducted an inquiry and himself
inducted his own officers give
suggestions but what has happened after
that
do you realize what has happened after
that so the problem is that despite
having indictments despite having
scathing observations still it goes on
and that is what the gentleman just
lower here said that there is corruption
everywhere the excise guy the fire guy
everyone is in connivance with hotel
owner and so many such hotels would be
existing there is no status report as
regards what are the checks which are
conducted they have supposed to be
conducted twice a year they can't be
routine perfunctory checks they have to
be proper checks so therefore this
clearly shows that human life in our
country is absolutely worthless and we
are just lucky to be alive every day I
want Bhaskar Ghosh and mr. Balraj of the
Amagi party to listen to this now one of
the victims who died was 38 year old
Arvind who worked for Eastman exports
company who had traveled to Delhi along
with a colleague for a meeting and was
staying at the Arctic Palace Hotel his
cousin sweat nough Rajesh had to travel
from Tamil Nadu to Delhi to collect his
body take a look actually there was a
call from my cousin my brother that some
accident happened in Delhi but we
doesn't know that it was so serious we
thought that maybe some minor incident
would be happening but we can't say we
can't express that but we came to know
in the evening that it is caught
[Music]
he is my cousin brother he is working in
Eastman exports and he came here to
etana by a meeting in Annie and his
colleague are staying there on Monday
night they are you used to return by
Tuesday morning it seems but this tragic
incident happened in the 4:30 in the
morning none come our Krishnaswamy was
also visiting delhi for two days for a
business meeting with his colleague both
of them died in that deadly Pharma fire
Swami has survived by his wife and the
two year old baby his name was Linda
Kumari was 32 years old he just came for
work - from the company side just for a
meeting
he came on Sunday and it happened
yesterday it happened this fire incident
in the hotel and there is no proper
information how this fire has been
occurred and it's not a proper details
no no one is giving any proper
information what is the case of this
occurrence of this fire I got the
information from the company from here
the information has been respect to the
company from the company they are
informing people who travel to Delhi for
one meeting for one day from other parts
of the country are dead people jumped
out of their rooms and fell to their
deaths because there was nowhere to go
Bhaskar wash as a representative of the
party that runs the Moomba the runs the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi that
handed out licenses to this extremely
illegal hotel would you make a statement
right now to the family members of those
who died in this tragedy
so it's very unfortunate start at my
mother is never unfortunately murder is
a crime don't call it unfortunate
unfortunate was when an accident happens
and nobody sees it coming
no the questions are at so what so what
I meant to say that as I as a as I told
you in the beginning of this discussion
that if there is in lapses found if this
is which is run by the do you have
doubts that they will be lapses mr.
Ghosh sorry what do you mean if there
are is there any doubt that they were
lapses no you you can't say like this
because this is decisions no there is a
short circuit and from the short circuit
then that things has happened and which
is the illegal construction legal
constructions and everything has to be
probed and the property mr. baskin gosh
when when the beaches he said brush
touch are mocked barrel what did you
mean touch our most valid means if
anyone found to be corrupted obviously
the actions will be taken against him
and we are talking about our Magna party
even a nama be party even the MLAs are
are accused of the same corruptions and
they are talking about taking it so what
you're saying
rascal Ghosh is that when you say brush
touch I looked about it you don't mean
that you will stop corruption you mean
that when there is corruption and it
costs us seventeen lives and our loved
ones die you will then order an inquiry
and you will tell us to wait and you
will wait for the ashes to be to
actually cool off and you'll wait for us
to forget and then based on the inquiry
you may or may not do something about it
is that what you mean by brush touch I
strongly object see we are already we
are already formulated the policies
which should prevent the corruptions we
are already formally in power for two
years what were you doing for the first
two years in spite of that corruption
happens we will bring them to the policy
will remain corruption front of the
law and we'll send you one name into
task how many people in the MCD have you
found guilty of corruption and removed
in the last two years since you took
over you did say and I remember very
clearly the BJP spurred you know
campaign for the MCD which a very
successful campaign you said it was very
corrupt in the only way to clean it up
was to bring in the BJP and the people
of Delhi heard you quite clearly and
they brought you in so congratulations
on that win it was two years ago how
many people have you removed or
transferred or prosecuted for corruption
in the MCD since you took over two years
ago the honestly I've a I don't have
these figures in front of me so I cannot
say by figure how many people that
obviously have any political management
watch City we try to be as transparent
as possible we have made entire thing a
tender we have you have you prosecuted
any at all you might not have the exact
number but have you prosecuted even one
mr. Ghosh
these very corrupt officials that you
ran a campaign against when you came to
power have any of them been prosecuted
or transferred or brought to book C I
say I cannot missguided you that I know
this statistics even one but obviously I
think the way the MCD is coming up with
a transparency coming up with a more
accountability and the laws which are
being more transparent now this
obviously gosh is it not true last
question mr. Joshi said that the BJP has
controlled the MCD now for 18 years
sorry
has the BJP run the MCD for we just got
in for 2017 who was who was running the
MCD before that mr. Ghosh
who was running the MCD before you took
over in 2017 yeah yeah yeah obviously we
were repeating that it was the BJP and
the year and and the term before that
let's go back 15 years 18 years in fact
how long have you been running the MCD
yeah how long have you been running the
MCD mr. Bhaskar gosh
or do you need what do you need let me
try again
I mean tell by my team that you can hear
me quite well how long has the BJP been
in power in the Municipal Corporation of
Delhi mr. Bhaskar Ghosh I don't exact
exact kind of years but I think a long
time we are there in them city 18 years
now please tell me why we shouldn't hold
you responsible for the 17 people who
are dead in this fire which means that
you are not just responsible because you
could have fixed caroule bag every hotel
in Caral park next to each other is a
death trap a fire trap you could have
fixed this you had 18 years 1 8 18 years
nearly 2 decades and you're telling me
that you had nothing there was nothing
you can do you want me to wait for an
inquiry you have the audacity to ask
these people who have lost their loved
ones to wait for an inquiry
we must have we must have done the
commendable jobs we must have done the
commendable jobs otherwise how we can
continue for 18 years you know I do not
know the answer to that question either
my point here is with these 17 people
and if you think
if you think your answer tonight to
these 17 families is that you must have
done a commendable job which is why they
keep bringing you back with there's
nothing but layered corruption from
every agency in Delhi and if there's
anyone who could have saved these 17
lives it's the municipal cooperation of
Delhi who could have taken away the
licence of this hotel and made sure that
nobody was sleeping in those rooms that
night this is on you this blood on your
hands the officers of the MCD not who
were in charge of Karol Bagh are
murderers no answers will be good enough
other than simple Fi ours listed against
them this business of we will see if
there was a lapse if there was a
obviously there was a problem and this
is what happens to us every time every
time there is a problem in Amritsar but
the Train Randall was 61 people they
told us to wait until they was an
inquiry wait until there was a report
what did the Congress government do
nothing not a single arrest what did the
railways do nothing not a single arrest
61 people died in this case 17 people
died overnight and they're telling us to
wait for a report this stretches across
politics its corruption in which they
sell our lives they do it all the time
the government could have fixed what is
wrong with Carol Berg they didn't they
waited for 17 people to die ask yourself
again do you have a loved one who's
travelling on working is going to stay
in a hotel it takes an hour to snuff out
her life that's how little our
governments care thanks for watching

lot of occupants then that hotel had
also stated that no fire alarm had gone
off the emergency exit was closed during
the incident
there was closed and no one could enter
no one could exit from that emergency
door there were unauthorized kitchen
that was running on its rooftop so very
clearly they didn't have the license for
running that kitchen either all of these
details now there have been named that
have been listed out in the FIA with
multiple violations
our correspondent awoke with further
inputs here allow given the fact that
these are violations on different fronts
it does take into account of the fire
department the MCD and other licensing
authorities which had given all these
so-called certificates to them despite
these violations but indeed after the
after the FIA that has now accessed by
the lira know for the viewers that it
clearly shows how the violation is being
done in this hotel and there are several
violations not only one that there are
seven point seven seven different points
of violation in which it shows that
there was the exit that was found to be
shut and it clearly mentioned in the F
IR that people could not come out
because it was shut it also seems that
encompassed a very much combustible
material that influence material were
used to construct the wall to give the
partition of the hotel rooms and that
that creates a lot of the law that
creates a lot of trouble to the people
that were inside and they could not
because the fire is spread after that
and there are also violation that is
regarding the the the alarm that was not
that was dysfunctional
during the incident so all these that is
coming out in the F IR and and this is
very serious violations that is now
written in the F IR when the the F IR
lost yesterday at around 3:30 when the
vendor and when the fire team of ND
police team and the the the inspection
inspecting team reached a spot and they
collected the evidences and then they
lost the FI are when they found out is

there there would be officials within

which would be taken in for questioning
as well now philately police have
already started their investigation the
investigation has been given to t crime
branch and the crime branch will
investigate the case the crime branch
official just told us that table of
probe and go deep into it they will also

a very very contrite Nageshwar Rao
hoping that the Supreme Court pardons
him tomorrow
all right Meenakshi thanks so much for
joining us one also has to keep in mind
that while Nagas around may point out to
the Supreme Court that this wasn't
intentional
but the fact of the
is a large number of transfers were made
by a man who was simply the interim
chief and that did not stop him from
shunting out several investigating

Liam Neeson plays Nels cocksman a simple
snow plow driver living in the Rocky

Kehoe the film starts off with cocksman
winning the Citizen of the Year award
for his contribution to the town but
that accolade is extremely short-lived
when his son is murdered by a drug
cartel since this is a Liam Neeson film
it soon turns into a revenge story with
him using his very particular set of
skills to hunt down and kill everyone or
at least that's what you think honestly
I had minimal expectations going into
this film and it completely blew me away
with its dark actually make that black
humour additionally the plot is entirely
unprintable just when you think it's
going in one direction it completely
switches gears and jumps off the cliff
in the best way possible
director hans peter mullan interestingly
uses the cost to build subplots and
angles that all add up to the oral story
in the most unexpected ways in fact
neither the typical hero played by Liam
Neeson or the villain waiking played by
Tom Bateman are the most interesting
characters that goes to all the
secondary players and what they bring to
the table numerous conversations take
place throughout the film that seems to
be innocuous but actually lead to some
unusual insights most of them are far
more intriguing and the action itself so
there are no dull moments in between the
expected shootouts furthermore the film
truly sets self apart from so many
others like it in this genre by seeing
the humor in the darkest of moments
seriously I found myself laughing out
loud when I least expected it cold

brings everything together which it does

comes to Liam Neeson's movies and

of Venice was presented as the opening
night film at the Indian Film Festival
of Los Angeles in 2009 yes it was made
more than 10 years ago and never
released until now because the makers
were facing certain financial issues
also this film was supposed to be for
Hans debut film alongside veteran Anu
Kapoor if you watch the film in today's
date he would definitely see that it's
technically outdated but the concept
stays fresh it's about a young man adi

seven days in a meditative state with
his face underground so adi along with
the pharisee for key sitar flies to
venice to complete this assignment all
RD cares about is money and sitar has
his own issues the movie is short like a
documentary and isn't really a massive
film a huge portion of the dialogues are
in English and there's no typical
Bollywood masala or catchy songs it has
a very natural and minimal feel to it
because everything is very ordinary and
real the costumes dialogues styling
everything the cinematography is really
poor because even though it has been
shortened Venice they have totally
wasted the beauty of the city by not
capturing it aesthetically the budget is
low and because it was short more than a
decade ago you can make out that the
cameras used are really of poor quality
in certain scenes the frames are shaking
so vigorously that you'd feel giddy
there's faulty lighting in some scenes
and along with that there's average
editing an average background score what
works for the film is the plot and the
performances bananas great Azadi natural

on the debate tonight the triple the
luck rau is back with the Congress party
stoking a fresh controversy
milah Congress president Sushma thatthey
in the presence of Congress president
Rahul Gandhi says that if they come to
power in 2019
they will abolish the triple taluk law I
agree though that engagement or hon if
they felt relaxed and encouraged to
engage the BJP claims Congress is
playing appeasement politics to go the
Muslim vote bankers look at the audacity
of mr. Rahul Gandhi his party from a
stage to appease merely says that if we
come to power we would not care about
this Supreme Court we will ban the
ordinance the triple the luck law which
criminalizes the practice of chocafella
was passed in the locus of her last year
in the winter session which faced
roadblocks in the Rajya Sabha as the
opposition has demanded that the bill be
sent to Select Committee despite the
government moving an amended version of
the triple-t lug bill although it has
gained muster in the Lok Sabha it's
still stuck in the Raja Sabha mirror now
asks will Congress party waste India's
efforts to ban triple the lock will
Congress party dilute to the triple the
luck law let's debate
well this is this is the question really
now we do know that the opposition had
concerns about the triple thalaaq law
but to say that it will be scrapped
altogether instead of being looked at
will that take us back in our backing
for women's empowerment a battle that is
very hard fought in our country help us
understand this a little better Weber
burger well for the BJP I mean Yannick
member of register before the Congress
doctor Ozma's era chief coordinator for
the women's wing of the a impl be Shere
Khan and Karen Allen the Koran and is an
advocate to the Supreme Court I welcome
all of my guests to this conversation I
mean young Nick my first question is to
you whether you agree with the details
of triple thalaaq as a law the truth is
abolishing triple thalaaq in India and
making sure that people follow the
supreme court direction has been a step
towards women empowerment why is the
Congress willing to sacrifice that at
this point for votes actually what
Sushma Taji meant was that we will bring
the corrected version of the triple
taluk bill I think I heard the BJP
spokesperson say that we will not listen
to the Supreme Court we will ban triple
thalaaq these were not the words whether
it's Supreme Court the Supreme Court
held trip instantly polls the lock is
illegal and so as it is triple select
practice is illegal today so if anyone
pronounces it it is illegal but to bring
a law and make a criminal provision in a
civil law
it's a family law we are talking about a
family and when you send the head of the
family the husband to the jail and you
bring a criminal component it's a small
Act which has been passed by the Lok
Sabha some eight sections and there is
no clarity as far as what kind of
criminal the trial will happen who will
make the subsistence allowance to the
wife what will happen to the children
where the family unit will remain how it
will remain so ultimately law is to give
justice and dignity to whoever here it
is the case of women empowerment we
strongly believe in women empowerment we
would like to bring a law that keeps the
family intact which gives dignity to the
women and there's a women empowerment
per se in its
right meaning so whatever the BJP says I
think they are absolutely not able to
understand the concept of women
empowerment otherwise they are in
majority they claim so tall that we are
in a majority they could have brought
women reservation and there would easily
I make well my question to you is this
do you plan to amend the law that has
been written and passed through Lok
Sabha and reintroduce it or do you at
this point want to scrap it altogether
could you make that clear please not it
has not been passed by the in the Rajya
Sabha of course and so it would not be
scrapping it's absolutely an 8 section
law we need to bring a comprehensive law
where we are giving women the right
empowerment she feels dignified at the
end of the day when she says that ok
this triple thalaaq is illegal I am not
supposed to receive it from my husband
and so there has to be some provisions
of what the stakeholders have to say the
counselors have to be there there has to
be some kind of mediator in me nothing
is the perfect the present bill is
completely silent I think they have just
made a slip shorter method in work of it
and the women will ultimately end up
only going to the courts because as a
criminal component
she'll be ending up in the magistrate's
court where she should not be there's
already a trauma of the triple phthalic
being announced on her pronounced on her
and then she's she has to go to the
criminal court she has to make a hearing
give a hearing by saying that ok she
will allow the bail to be given to a
romantic even an event coming right now
going there for her legal counseling so
I think all these aspects will be taken
care of
isn't this aimed at votes right now all
right
let me take the question now to be above
a garage of the BJP web of Agra the
Congress has said very clearly that it
will not let the law in its current form
pass
what is the BJP response to that you
know I'll tell you what in Congress
everyone wants to be the in Congress and
its allies which is Maha bandha and
everyone wants to be the Prime Minister
and in Congress everyone wants to be a
parliamentarian and a lawmaker the
problem is that in Congress they talk of
law more than the politics and then they
talk of politics more than the law and
they are confused within their own stand
95% of the Congress's strength within
the upper house and the lower house are
only divided on certain points within
the bill
Sushma today has come back come in and
brought in a storm of opposition on
triple thalaaq and I'm telling you as
and when it will come up for a debate
you would see the double standards that
that will expose the Congress to its
core and as I would say that the
Congress's attempt it's a futile attempt
for Congress to even try and stab before
stab the the the entire bill before it
is even born and irrespective of whether
the bill passes or not as the government
in power we have enough resources at
hand or enough outlets within the law
that empowers the government in power to
to actually make sure that the rights
are an end and there is there is a
parity in the rights of males and
females that as claimed by the Congress
and an empowerment of women is not home
ten debris block the triple-t log bill
very unfortunate right consider consider
the bill that to be shipping is tabled
right now would you believe that is the
best possible version of the triple
salak will would you say why hasn't it
gone to a select committee why haven't
you consulted with stakeholders in the
community why has the government
attempted to do sort of strong-armed it
and push it through Parliament okay so
so first of all if if we were to just
push an ordinance and not support the
ordinance in technical terms it is
saying not give the power of law to the
ordinance then even if the ordinance
would have been enforced at that moment
you would have said that we've pushed it
forth but bringing a proper bill
legislatively we're in presenting it in
the parliament getting it ratified by
both the houses or at least putting in
the efforts to get it ratified by both
the houses and of course the lower house
ratified it irrespective of we say that
we have the numbers there etc etc but of
course the lower house ratified it so it
is an absolutely not
not not pushing it our or strong-arming
it first and the second portion is very
simple whether to send it to the Select
Committee or not the Parliament has to
function for a debate unfortunately
Congress has an and are are acting in a
very complete
Gunda format where they don't allow the
functioning of the parliament in a sane
manner look at the budget session look
at any session where is and what are the
attending house you to strap you a field
in terms of functioning of the
Parliament no no we're Burgerville in
fact Parliament has functioned in this
term especially in the budget session
and the session the budget session far
better then in the last budget session
of the previous government so that would
not be an accurate thing to say but let
me open this up to the experts who
joined us Khurana and the first is an
advocate to the Supreme Court do you
agree with ever organized argument and
do you think the Congress is right
Korona in what it's saying
hey I think the Congress came late to
this because at the in the beginning
they were hesitant to perhaps sort of
tell the truth about this because the
BJP owned the narrative frankly I would
really appreciate it if your viewers
that tend to be educated and
english-speaking would just google it
and read the 8th section bill it is
rubbish
it is not worth the paper that it is
written on why do I say this why do I
use such strong words because section 1
the only you know jurisdictional it does
it apply to India does it different law
needed to apply to Kashmir it's a
standard section section 2 definitional
again standard section 3 basically
reiterates repeats what the supreme
court had already done in the shiromar
new case five judges had made instant
triple phthalic will declare it
unconstitutional which means that if a
muslim man is married to a muslim woman
and says man has had Anika and says the
locks are lost a lock this means nothing
so I think a body kabbadi kabbadi it
means absolutely nothing the section
after that section 4 says that if he
does say this then he is committing a
criminal offense now this is the mean
this is the mean crux of the bill right
this is the only thing it adds you know
oh you and I and a lot of your viewers
are and a lot of the people on the panel
here across parties right I interested
in the rights of women now to what
extent is this protect the rights of
Muslim women this is it the way it
purports to protect the rights of Muslim
women it says that if your husband is
either intending to divorce you right
or intending to abandon you and since
tripled and says the laughter like the
lock then he is committing a criminal
offense now frankly you know people have
fights if a man says to a woman met my
son I'd and I see a time at which work
is our oh oh I don't want to be with you
anymore and I'm leaving you and I am
going to divorce you right it's the
equivalent of sending somebody to jail
for that now what do we have for others
for Hindus for example we have the we
have desertion so if a man is deserting
his wife then what happens it is a
ground for divorce right after a
particular period you prove desertion
and then it's a ground for divorce here
what happens is that he says triple the
luck immediately talaq talaq talaq and
suddenly there is a criminal offence
that happens now one that that's
something that I think is just slightly
bizarre because you have a situation
where marital rape is something that is
allowed a Muslim woman can be raped by
her Muslim husband and in the Obama
Hindu husband right and this is allowed
this the government is for this the
government says cannot be criminalized
because it will destroy the institution
of marriage however if this same man
says the lock talaq talaq he can go to
jail then let's come to custody and
maintenance Samina be just a me an aside
what you're saying Karan ll me that we
bring in the other members of the panel
as well mystic violence act she already
has a right to maintenance yes sure yes
dr. dr.oz Mazzara is the chief
coordinator women's wing off the a impl
be dr. Sarah where do you stand on the
matter of the triple salic law as it
stands right now that has been you know
brought through by the government do you
believe that it should be abolished do
you believe it should be modified do you
believe it should be passed in its
current form thank
five de souza for inviting me to your
show first of all let me make a
statement that Calif is neither an issue
of the Muslim community it is not the
issue our country India this issue has
been hyped blown out of proportion the
status of the Muslim community is
educational backwardness they need
employment they need equal opportunities
now all the studies that have been
conducted about the Muslims or the
Muslim women either the such a committee
or other Commission's know where it has
been said that the divorce is an issue
divorce is divorced the matters of
marriage the matters of divorce matters
of inheritance are purely religious
matters and these are the personal laws
which have the fundamental rights
guarantee under the Indian Constitution
so basically this issue has been blown
out of proportion and it's been hyped
there is and coming to the second part
the triple caliph bill it's a totally
ill drafted bill the bill gives nothing
to Muslim women there is more of
criminalization
of the procedure of divorce which is
instantaneous it doesn't give Ghulam
women any kind of empowerment the bill
is only aimed at destroying the homes
the already a Muslim Personal Law Board
organized a signature campaign across
the country and five crore men and women
have stated that they do not want any
interference in the personal law and I
will put before the audience here that
out of the five crore there were almost
two crore eighty lakhs signatures of
Muslim women and when this bill was
brought into Parliament last year that
is in 2017 itself in the year of March
April 2018 we had more than 200 protest
demonstrations across India of Muslim
women coming out two crore women have
particle kdramas I brought how many
different saying they
do not want this bill this bill is being
saluted from the women who are
protesting against the supreme court
order on Sabri mala there are women who
are saying women should not be allowed
to enter Sabri mala right now but the
Supreme Court is made on or has given
its order and the supreme court's order
stands so the sopressata said there at
the instant falak is illegal how do you
enforce that without bringing in a law
let me let me see let me clarify on this
when the Supreme Court judgement came on
22nd August there was no protest and the
Supreme Court it's a minority judgment
that stated that the government can
bring in a law and this bill that has
been drafted in such a haste without
consulting the stakeholders so if the
entire debate is about women empowerment
and giving rights to women there should
be some proper consultation some
parliamentary procedures should be
adopted it should have a legal scrutiny
and the bill is totally ill drafted in a
haste by people who do not understand
that marriage is a civil contract in the
Muslim community and how can you
criminalize a civil matter so that is
our main objection to the court why do
you want to do politics on and after the
Supreme Court judgement we never
appealed in the code yeah and see we
have more objection to the government
using this issue of triple Talaash
politicizing it and overall brandy I
will take this question to Sherry aha
moment for about one moment Sharia Tom's
been listening very patiently which is
one second I want to take this question
to share your car mister car I agree
with what doctors are saying the manner
in which this issue is being politicized
for brownie points is actually very
embarrassing and now today the Congress
making announcement that they will scrap
the bill when they come to power
scrapped the bill when they come to
power isn't this also a politically
motivated announcement aren't they also
hoping to get brownie points from this
issue
by taking away from the women's
empowerment which should be the focus
here reais hey you see when the the
stigmas going on in the judiciary I was
one of those vehement and was he put his
critics of IIT instant able to lock I
was against it I thought it is not only
a crime it is a sin and we are plotted
the judgment of the Honorable Supreme
Court know criminals Asian is not the
answer for that see it like the
Honorable doctor said it is a civil
issue which is being criminalized if
there has to be a liability when
somebody utters instant temples the lock
and if he has to be penalized it has to
be a civil indemnification or a
compensation you can't criminalize it
capitalizing everything every aspect of
a man's life criminality will gain
acceptance and respectability you will
have criminals walking all over in the
beauty of Islam is in Islam criminal
punishment is very less who those laws
are limited to a few crimes what is
happening is it long back to the
medieval times every aspect of a public
life a person let us criminalize and you
know now they had to cut it down slowly
so I don't think a bail is a law is an
answer and one more thing for I would
like to add is only after this bill
becomes a law can it be challenged in
the court tinsel we can only debate as
far as the the the the validity or the
pertinence of the bill is comes in
today's times I don't think there is a
requirement for any bill the Supreme
Court has said instant apalta lock is
invalid it should stay there you know
there is no question you know once a
husband goes behind bars it's extremely
difficult to prove that you know a
manager at that instant able to lock if
you ask him in the court he will say
this is my first installment I was going
to say it again after one month so you
know the conviction rate in the domestic
violence Act in the 498a that is the
dowry Act it is a base imil this is
going to add to the burden of the
judiciary I think this is of course
politics is being played over this
because the elections are around the
corner I don't think you know this law
is required at all criminalization I
don't think is required but yes
instantly well instant people has to go
but I'm gonna
from the sub-query butters of a mechanic
that have been yet known cases of
instant thalaaq ten known cases of
instant Alex
since the Supreme Court judgment
according to The Times of India how
would we stop this without bringing in a
law and my second question to you are my
ethnic is is into the Congress also
politicizing this has in today's
announcement been made purely with the
elections in mind
you asked me the first question and let
me answer the second question first see
I think the triple thalaaq a bill that
was brought we even at that time said
that let there be let it go before a
proper committee these are very
sensitive matters when we are dealing
with the institution of marriage we
forget the children we forget the unit
of the family ultimately family becomes
a society so it's a fabric we are
talking about and when somebody who is
in power thinks that it can be brought
in such a way that we are using the word
women empowerment and for every other
aspect pertaining to women empowerment
gender justice gender equality you do
you take no steps and for so many from
let us say for four and a half years
suddenly you wake up six months back and
you bring the bill and you just put it
back on the Supreme Court because the
Honorable effects court said that it is
illegal and it is you the government may
bring a law so you suddenly take all
these support from the supreme court
epic spent God's judgement and just
bring a slip short thing without
considering the sensitivity the nuances
of the issue and just make a bill and
then you pass it in the Lok Sabha
without taking it to the right people to
the right stakeholders without hearing
anybody without looking at it in a in a
vision way and that is practically
politics and you
practically broken the family on on it
by bringing this bringing the criminal
angle man coming a leak
what was the need for the Congress to
make us move the parties are playing
politics over this piece of legislation
then elections absolutely Sharia conjure
up smells like both parties a fling
politics over then why did the Congress
may commissioner what was the need
the Congress party to make this
announcement today army AG Nick if this
has always been your stand from the
beginning aren't you looking for words
no well we have to tell you possibly
this was kind of Congress trying to me
for votes right so and so now if the
elections are to three months away I
think the bill was only in the last
session it has not even gone to the
Rajya Sabha so many if it is election
time and if it is spoken at this time we
need to make our stand clear that this
is not women empowerment by the ruling
dispensation it is practically you are
hurting women empowerment and so we have
to make a few becomes a third why are
you making it at election time gone into
an election mode property for into - do
you know actually as far as women
empowerment is your and you talk about
the Gandhi first which is one second
career on and the first being raped
Karen and I know I think the point that
amia Nick is making that you know other
look why should they not look for votes
they are an opposition party it is
election time why this is you know when
you have a situation where yesterday or
day before yogya the Tanakh says and I'm
going to show how the two issues are
related yogi Adityanath says that we are
going to not prosecute further 36 riot
accused in the Muzaffarnagar cases
whether some of the worst rape some of
the worst rioting happened right where
you get the tenet also pardons himself
in the same cases where in the Enoch
educationalist a big news report to it
the BJP and the Sangh Parivar has
basically taken over the number of and
has communal eyes it's my view I think
in so many ways then sorry but you know
and this day what is this
disgusting the lobby discarded Poliquin
said quite clearly that bye-bye ladies
one at a time please
dr. small on the panel what Muslim women
need is Financial Inclusion is jobs is
perhaps shelters of all women need more
better shelters right is education only
1% of Indian marriages end in divorce 1%
we are the least divorcing country
Muslim women divorce even less than
everyone else the least the divorce less
than Christians less my god less than
anyone else so this is a water totally a
strong happy not needed the progress is
coming and saying that look we are going
to roll the V not even Congress is not
has also ok done something very terrible
in the lucky okay so let's allow goodbye
love wave Ibaka calls to him asking
goats why is the surpassing the BJP has
made it clear that the Muslim man's vote
is irrelevant and in fact the Boston
bombers so he goes because the Muslim
women don't care about this in a note I
mean so frankly this is a Damona you
know I should people not ask can I like
you know pepper my burger is non
forehead love with my own boys please
wear book respond to that please I mean
I don't I take such a big narrative that
I don't even know how to respond and way
to respond I mean what are we doing avi
I mean Karuna
I respect human intellect that she's
been talking about at the point she's
bringing in but this debate was politics
of crippled thalaaq she's talking about
everything else but triple the log
I'm an excellent I'll be prepared for
everything else I mean I have a press
release from women and child you know
and so on do you want me to get into it
or do you want me to stick to triple the
log and I don't want to fall in love
with my own voice no well let me ask let
me rephrase the question for you there's
not even get to matter mister question
is simply this is the issue one second
one second everybody everybody one
second whoever walk around the issue is
this is triples a lot being politicized
for votes now we put together a panel
and we're four out of five people feel
that the current law in its current form
including a Muslim woman who is on the
panel believes that it is detrimental to
Muslim women in that case has it just
been used as a political tool first by
the BJP now by the Congress has the BJP
used triple the law as a political tool
so everyone
the answer is no the political theorists
may want it like that but the answer is
no we've not used it as a political tool
and I am saying that very bluntly and I
won't III won't stop short of
criticizing my own party if need be but
this is something that we're trying to
bring in a change perspective now there
are two perspectives on the three
panelists that I have with me in front
of me and I will not touch Sharia for
the time being but Sharia has his own
reasons very practical and logical
reasons that he's been watching for us
about ante triple the rock and then he
comes back and says this criminalization
where he talks about 498a and so on
everyone knows it's an open-and-shut
case on 498a that that is another law
that should be amended at some point in
time and I am going on record to say
that so I won't i won't shirk away from
it so that's fine but first of all
Congress has politicized it look at the
timing it's appeasement politics totally
second of all AI empl be whatever that
political party is or the board is a
they are not representing the entire
stakeholders of calling so-called
stakeholders in terms of calling entire
population of Muslim women in the
country so I disagree with it be if they
had an objection to the law where they
are saying oh this law is so bad this is
completely insane and and you know as an
educated person and I am stealing
Coronas words from her opening comments
for the sake of educated audiences let
me tell you this that we have a table it
is open it is open to public comments
before it is tabled for everyone
educated needs
know about it and they can do any of
those comments are you aware of that
is that something let's not become sorry
yes I have be in Kiruna don't get
personal about it and don't agree with
everything in our hair rafting a
legislation perhaps you would realize I
just have a conversation just one second
one second let's stop let's stop let's
stop speaking over each other just one
second viber baccarat if you could
listen to me for a second please
Weber baccarat if we are having a
conversation about triple arc and the
rights of Muslim women and the Muslim
women's bill protection of Rights on
marriage 2018 for you to turn around and
say you don't know what the a impl be is
the All India Muslim Personal Law Board
if you don't know who they are and what
role they play isn't this an indication
that you aren't take whose they are but
I don't know the acronym a or the
abbreviation no I don't know the acronym
of I wanted the instance to both allowed
to be struck down I mean I'll know about
it just to give you a short history but
they do it's called the whole India we
take this back to dr. Sarah dr. Sarah
you know one sec dr. Sarah here's the
thing doctor
my question while yes Weber baccarat
didn't know what the personal abode was
my question to you is about Muslim women
about the empowerment of Muslim women do
you believe the scrapping of this law
and Dai Li would lead to that
empowerment or should it just be
relooked at and modified see first of
all that is the level of ignorance in
the people especially the BJP they don't
know what is Muslim Personal Law Board
they don't know the basics that in this
country every religion has a right to
personal law and Alinea Muslim Personal
Law Board is a collective united
platform of all the sects and of the
jamaat's
that is the first thing secondly our
objection to this bill
section-by-section
when it was tabled in 2007 70 in
December and again when it has come in
2018 both the times we have given our
written representation to all the
political parties oppose from the
opposition who were ready to understand
have a discussion with us even today we
are open we are open to discussion we
are open to any kind of discussion for
empowerment of women what we feel is if
any issue is there the stakeholders
should be taken into discussion that is
the first thing the second thing if you
are talking about empowerment of women
then it is very important that you
educate you give them opportunities for
education for economic uplift meant
these are the basic issues which the
minority community is facing today
instead of that if you attack on their
family system et if you attack on their
fundamental rights of religious freedom
that is where the community is answering
back now the 20 crore Muslim population
of this country which includes 10 crore
women are united opposing this bill and
the practice of triple caliph it needs
social reform and as for the Supreme
Court judgement the man who is uttering
triple caliph it has no meaning so where
is the need for a law we our main
objection is bringing this bill forcing
this bill on the
okay I'm singing on denying according to
the basic constitutional fundamental
rights yeah yeah according to The Times
of India they have been 10 cases less
known of triple thalaaq being issued to
women after the judgment of the
five-judge bench in one case a Rambo
resident was given triple tella for
waking up late in the morning in another
case in Hyderabad a very young woman was
given triple thalaaq because she wanted
to continue her studies a 24 year old
woman from bullinger Reuther pradesh was
allegedly gang-raped by three people
including us but who gave her triple
thalaaq within a week of their marriage
and this you know this solid taylors go
on October 26th an NRI husband divorced
his wife threw an advertisement in a
newspaper the case is registered with
the Hyderabad police November 12th he
has been carried the wife of a legate
busca university professor alleged that
her husband divorced her first on
whatsapp and then a text message a 27
year old beautician in Hyderabad was
given divorce over the phone just wait
now finally after she got this a real
estate agent I gave birth I go to the
for divorcing his wife so my question is
simply this how do we make sure this
doesn't happen without a law because
while the Supreme Court says it doesn't
count within the household how we do
will have it does count then show the
woman have thin abandon her what do we
do then see our country has our library
has very beautiful Lhasa to my stigma
right sir I mean it's to do is remit we
have to do mystic what we need to be
able to have domestic violence order
stay in the house don't let the woman be
allowed to be kicked out but this what
this bill does is that it limits those
remedies because this is the special law
is the specific law right so it says
that it speaks of this sort of very
broad sort of means where's the Domestic
Violence Act is much broader gives a
woman the right to stay in the home let
me read it gives a woman a right to a
finance financial order a right to you
know so it's a real problem it's you
know what the what you're talking about
is very important and I agree with you
that is getting lost in the
in in all of this around this ridiculous
bill but I think of fresh bill perhaps
needs to be brought to look at how to
include and empower Muslim women to make
sure that the domestic violence remedies
are being is able to protect women now
once I get my Baba Quran that are posted
laws every in in this country we have
different personal loss and until we can
bring in one personal law as you have to
bring in separate rows for each entire
con this is a very point depending on
what Karuna is misleading the law in
terms of the divorce desertion and this
bill and that's very unfortunate because
you're relying to be made on your
punishment involved there is a joy that
take into consideration really just
believe it that's why we have before the
supreme court never work around please
one second one thing i I want to be able
to speak with Shelly are on mr. Conyers
my question to you and Carolyn Andy
brought about a very important point
that it's getting lost in all of the
politics that there perhaps needs to be
a clearer look at this stakeholders have
to be taken on board they have to be
consulted and we have to come up with a
bill that truly empowers Muslim women
because how do you make sure that when a
husband's actually issues instant Allah
to his wife that he doesn't abandon her
he doesn't throw her out that she gets
alimony or she gets maintenance to
continue her life in some way
that she's not entirely abandoned and is
not at the mercy of you know of that
husband these are the problems that
ought to have been solved now I want to
bring it back to the fact that Congress
didn't
see they look at it and that they will
come up with a better law they said they
will scrap the one that exists because
it's anti-men he's a realtor sizing
aren't we losing the point completely
and you say you seafarers for as a
little yes yes we are missing that wood
for the trees see them as for the
maintenance is concerned there is a tiny
Latifah case which takes care of the
maintenance it is a in a landmark case
in the Muslim in a personal law and as
far as a Muslim person law board is
concerned the doctor asthma sirens made
a very liquid very cogent point but the
thing is I find the Muslim Personal Law
Board was inert and not proactive while
this was being the entire thing was
going on I wish they were a little you
know proactive and taken things matters
into their own hands and come out with
their own internal reforms taking the
stakeholders into confidence but that
didn't happen I think they should have
preempted the in a judicial process I
think that that latitude was given to
them by the courts which they have
forfeited and as far as the empowerment
is concerned the one way I see him
empowerment can happen is by the way of
Education in and they know going to
schools and colleges and which is I
think slowly happening affair I feel
very happy you know that's happening in
the country and as far as again coming
back to the lady the Advocate there I
agree with her that this should be I
think there has to be a modified law
which is the where the penalty is not
criminal as I'm you know going behind
the bars but a civil liability like you
know composition in terms of real estate
wealth or something else and going
behind bars putting the husband behind
bars is not the answer and nobody can
take away the right to diverts from
anybody from the lady or the man that is
very important thank you so much for
putting that forward ami Agni I want you
to comment on that where is the
Congress's be plan where is your
modified women's Muslim women's
protection of Rights on marriage bill
what are you offering Muslim women in
return of when you say you will abolish
will you completely remove this triple
thalaaq law what are you replacing it
with do you have a better plan have you
worked on a better plan or is it just
this political announcement that you're
making what is your alternative that's
it exactly
no we
have already made arguments even in the
Lok Sabha as a party and if you see
post-independence we have got several
laws all in the Congress time and there
lead to women empowerment when I'm
talking about women empowerment I am
looking at the Constitution of India
that we give equality to women and so
when we bring a law we see to it that we
bring dignity and justice and equality
to women and that enter that completely
gives empowerment to women that also
encompasses certain other factors like
if you see the domestic violence act
when we brought it in 2005 we have
brought the concept of a protection
officer and not now the magistracy and a
counselor where the women can go the
family can have a counseling and the
unit remains perfect the family unit so
on that kind of a modeling you don't
separate a man and a woman and bring a
criminal angle in it and so when the
Congress party says that will bring a
bill where there will be completely
solving of the problem and which will
end into women empowerment we mean it we
don't want to drag everyone - even the
woman who's already had a trauma when
the triple the luck is announced she has
to go to the court why should she go to
the court the man is also already behind
the bars the police has arrested him she
has to go and give a hearing the yes I
don't mind if he's released on bail so
what happens to all this does it make
sense that is in a dignified way of
dealing with the nuisance of or whatever
you call of propulsor lack we are
wanting to give dignity to the woman and
also punish the man I think there is
something really wrong and so all the
stakeholders will have to be listened to
everything will have to go in a holistic
manner when we are talking of women
empowerment just because you're dealing
with triples Alarcon because vulnerable
affects cotton said it is illegal you
want to bring the law in haste with 8
sections have you ever seen an act which
is done so slips shortly so we did make
our arguments in the submissions in the
lobby something Amyas argue why didn't
the Congress and I want to read out the
Congress's comment today and this came
from Sushma today
why didn't this is what it said I
promised that the Congress party will
come into power in 2019 and will scrap
the triple xaloc law the law is another
way
of the Modi government to arrest em had
a SMU's l'm men and put them in prison
to tell me something
wearing this law does it say that they
needs to be an alternative that they
needs to actually aware in this comment
does it say that you're considering an
alternative that you will work towards
the empowerment of Muslim women they
will make sure that they get alimony you
make sure that they get property you
make sure that they can't be abandoned
it just says basically that you will
remove the law because you believe it's
not before remember nothing
who's going to talk for a min can I just
come in no no will bring my camera
another will bring his right to lo
Montes come will bring the right law I
think when you I will when vyas yes
please why should just go ahead of me
until you please when will you bring
what what is the right law that you will
bring yes so when I when of course the
one on which I said that if you have to
see the crux of the matter if it has to
be women empowerment it has to be done
in a very very comprehensive manner and
you have to look at all the nuances and
intricacies that deal with women
empowerment within a family we are not
talking of the violence against women on
public spaces or sexual harassment we
are talking of a family unit and so when
you look at the domestic violence act
and as Karuna said that there are six
reliefs given in that particular act you
can keep the child with you you are not
beaten up there will be no violence in
the family there will be a protection
officer who will visit there'll be a
counselor and you will also have
economic independence there will be
money given to you and so it will be
done within a civil jurisdiction and
that is where a little provision
Protection Act or some kind of a dignity
security to women and so on that lies
yes so that is what I am saying that
should be the modality and that is what
Sushma that she was talking about that
we are not mid-may bringing a law where
men and women are against each other and
that also with a criminal component I
think we should not fight in
debate rather than look at it very
constructively and the objective behind
saying a statement well this discussion
but pointing awkward colored on and the
NIT ni just come in yes go ahead please
can I just come in ticket can I just
come in go ahead go ahead doctor asthma
go ahead this is yeah what I would like
to say today is there is one more part
of the statement that the MPM Susmita
dave has said today that she has stated
that any party any government which is
willing to work for the education and
empowerment of women they they are ready
to talk and discuss so let us take the
positives out of things this whole
triple teller debate is a total
non-issue wasting the time of the media
the judiciary the government the real
issues are the education and the rights
that needs to be given to the women in
the society in the family as a wife as a
mother as a daughter and in India all
the religions and all the communities
face somewhat similar kind of issues
which are dowdy which are female
feticide and these are the burning
issues of the nation I think there is a
need to debate on the real issues let us
take the positives and let us work for
it and that is what is needed it today
and that is what I would like to express
through this platform that everyone in
this nation is ready to work for the
women empowerment the Muslim personal
abode is ready to discuss on issues of
women empowerment and we are ready to
dialogue with any community okay okay oh
that's that's really well said and in
conclusion right now we must point out
that for all women and not just women in
our country not just the Muslim living
in our country we need the same things
empowerment rights in their marriages
rights of inheritance rights of personal
wealth
rights of maintenance and alimony to
make sure that women are treated truly
equal and we were a long road to go
before women in our country have
education and have empowerment and have
jobs politicizing all of these issues is
only going to slow us down it's only
going to roll us back and it's only
going to make this journey even longer I
appeal to our political parties we are
half this country please consider our
rights with more seriousness than you're
doing right now women in India are not
just a political ploy this is a very
very real fight if you are against us if
you're not with us when you're against
us

battle angel is set in a
post-apocalyptic world in it dr. Dyson
Ito played by Christoph Waltz is a cyber
surgeon who finds a discarded female
Sybok shell in a junkyard when he
restores her it becomes quickly evident
that she is no ordinary machine Aleta as
he named sir has an innate childlike
curiosity and she quickly learns to
adapt to the harsh world around her
along the way she also discovers her
history and the real power she has she
also finds a place in a world that makes
a clear distinction between the haves
and the have-nots this story is based on
the Japanese manga gun and if you
haven't heard of that you've definitely
heard of James Cameron the man knows a
thing or two about killer robots in the
future so to say that he has created a
compelling futuristic world should come
as no surprise but Cameron and director
Robert Rodriguez are also known to pay a
lot of attention to a film's plot both
proving their respective abilities to
flesh out intriguing characters and
using emotionally driven storytelling to
power action sequences beyond the
technical superiority expected from a
film that has Cameron attached to it
Elita battle angels emotional weight
comes from a connection to the
characters a lot has been said about the
leads anime-inspired eyes while they
might be an acquired taste
there are many compelling reasons to
look beyond them Robert Rodriguez
ensures that Aleta is the embodiment of
the saying the eyes are the windows to
the soul Aleta is an old soul and she
draws you into a self-discovery Rosa
Salazar brings new rules of charm and

thrilling fight scenes
how are the considerable talents of
Mahalo Ali and Jennifer Connelly are
largely wasted which is really
surprising considering they're both
great actors so I wonder why they
weren't given much more to do or maybe
their work was left on the editing floor
the biggest problem I found with Aleta
Langella started resorts to origin
tropes although it soars leaps and
bounds in the technical department it's
hard to check out the feeling that we're
all too familiar with this story there's
also a completely unnecessary romantic
angle that did not work for me at all
and also felt like the most obvious way
to try to get audiences to be engaged
with the story I think a lot more could
have been done with the audit Wilde
Rodriguez and Cameron pushed the
boundaries of computer wizardry in this
film they choose to follow the
storytelling textbook so whether they
succeed in breaking the curse of the
live-action anime adaption or not is up
for debate I'm going with three and a
half stars for a leader battle angel
it's another testament to the power of
big screen IMAX 3d extravaganzas the
fight scenes especially the motor ball
sequences are gorgeous on the big screen
but there are no great surprises in its

that political parties try to use the

numerous mob lynching incidents in the

whatsapp the average boss of over 2
million used two hundred million users
in India said it has already taken steps
after the government crackdown well
that's right and you know one of the one
of the main defenses of whatsapp has
been that this is an end-to-end
encryption encrypted app and therefore
whatsapp doesn't necessarily go into the
content that is actually being sent over
messages but the concern of the
government was that this platform was
being misused by by a few people to
spread fake news some intentionally and
some in in some cases innocently so the
so whatsapp themselves took a few steps
to try and address that including
limiting the number of times you the
number of people you could actually
forward a particular message video or a
picture to instantaneously so that you
know is served as a sort of deterrent
frustrated those who perhaps have to
send it to a large group of people but
that hasn't necessarily solved the
problem so whatsapp in its defense has
now said that it's not just these
particular individuals who are spreading
these sorts of rumors about you know try
adapting etcetera about these sort it is
groups moving around of kidnappers or
any sorts of you know wildly outrageous
claims but it's also the fact that
political party is this a call to them
have also been used misusing the app now
as as we know really well that you know
these messages get spread really really
quickly and so it's not just those sorts
rumors but all kinds of may
just get sent so whether they're good
morning messages or for that matter
where they're they're politically driven
these get sent rather quickly and
therefore whatsapp also flagging the
fact that you know that is a concern
that they have and how do they actually
tackle this problem is another is
another thing that they have that
they've really had to grapple with
because fake news is such a real problem
that even social media social networking

to deal with in a very serious way not

what the Davidson board intended to is
to basically speak a petition I know

keep seeing number five five five the
person has completed become we have
engineers also be we another BSC this is
not the first such instance in the last
two years we have seen many such
instances whenever the government
announces recruitment this might prove
pointing to a job crisis the center
still claims enough jobs are being
created to employ our youth several
analysis our prospect that we've tried
to do and to our mind good number of
jobs in the region of seven and a half
to eight million jobs are getting
created we asked India are there enough
jobs and is this phenomena of
disproportionate job applications only
for government vacancies most of us when
you get graduated for a post graduation
we prefer going abroad and in your job
over there because we know we might get
an apportioned you were there which is
much much better than what we get over
your there is Java unemployment like
and the amount of jobs being created by
the government is not enough for the
people living in the particular area
Mira now asks where are the jobs if
government claims there are enough jobs
being created
why put over 4,000 people many of whom
overqualified apply 4:14 sweeper jobs
let's debate a very simple question if
the government refuses to acknowledge
that we have a problem at what point are
we going to go about solving that
problem every time it has come up before
the central government the central
government is turned around and said
quite flatly that Ola and uber has
created enough jobs for all of us then
why are become graduates and engineers
applying for sweepers and sanitary
worker positions in the tamil nadu
government on the show with me today I
said who are former Commerce Secretary
Santosh Mero through professor economics
at the Centre for informal sector Labor
Studies at JNU Nara I'm through Booty
spokesperson for the BJP s mood you
learn a AIADMK supporter Rahul Singh
policy analyst will also have Jarama
Venkatesh who works with an NGO in Tamil
Nadu mister do our first question to you
good evening and thank you for joining
us this piece of information that we've
now picked up that the tamil nadu
government opened up applications for 14
sweeper positions and got four thousand
applicants does this mean there's a job
crisis it's difficult to disagree with
the conclusion an obvious conclusion
that if there are 300 times the number
of the vacancies and the applicants
number is as large as 300 times as in
this particular case of recruiting
sweepers in Tamil Nadu government that
the country is certainly facing job
crisis and somewhat of an unprecedented
phenomena in the country however having
said that the extent of job unemployment
probably doesn't quite get reflected
when one looks at the anecdotal data
only about government jobs there is a
tendency particularly in developing
countries like India and many others I
would say where the job security offered
by governments or government agencies
attracts far more people than it should
be attracting there might be some did we
had this doesn't mean I'm saying that
every job in the private sector also
attracts as when he has 300 times the
number because the ever since we we have
it why whatsoever since now for the last
couple of decades for sure ever since we
started off with the liberalisation
process in early 91 we do see a swelling
of ranks of people taken on contract
contract labor the people who are turned
around before 240 days are completed in
a job and part part of the reason for
that being that hire and fire policy
government has not been able to bring
about and there is lack of flexibility
in labor recruitment but that's no
excuse whatsoever
I would like to mention the in the fact
that the enough jobs are not being
created anywhere in the country that the
recent data of 6 percent unemployment or
6.1 percent unemployment which
supposedly NSSL had found out I had
found and then recommended it release or
the government did not release it is
certainly a correct figure if anything
it might be under estimating the real
extent of job unemployment in the
country because we do not have too many
people in the farm sector particularly
who are fully unemployed or but a large
number of there
are underemployed miss professor Santosh
Mero trust want to go over Amitabh
Khan's press conference you know the day
before the budget announcement when we
were talking about jobs in reaction to
the business standard article he said
this Ola and uber cab businesses both
have created 2.2 million jobs you can
say that 15 to 20 percent between Ola
and uber not everyone is registered with
boat and he basically credited Ola and
uber for most of the job creation then
he went on to say obviously you office
Li can't be growing annually at 7.2
percent and saying that there are no
jobs in our economy to my mind the
problem is with the lack of good quality
jobs there's a wages problem and there's
a big informal sector in the economy
professor I wrote sir my problem is not
just that they were four thousand
applicants for 14 vacancies my problem
is that off those four thousand
applicants most of them were graduates
post graduates and engineers and if they
are applying for sweeper jobs that I'm
assuming is not because a government job
offers the most security will the
government do you think it's time the
government acknowledged that we have a
crisis I think if there has been
crisis for several years and and the
data was showing it and the government
was has not been willing to recognize it
and it it's behaving like it like the
ostrich so let me make two or three
point survey let me respond any for each
of the points that mr. Conte has has
supposedly made one that Ola and uber
are creating 2.2 million jobs the my I
completely reject that notion for the
following reason first of all these were
all drivers who were driving earlier
they were simply underemployed and there
now there they're working harder in
other words they were working more hours
in the in the day and therefore their
earnings have gone up so it's not that
they've created new jobs 0.1 0.2 the
both the CMI ii data which is on a
sample size even larger than the
National Sample Survey plus my own
analysis of the Labor Bureau annual
survey which has a sample size larger
than the NSS plus the NSS all three
capture informal work and hula-hooper
are informal work in other words all
three sources that I am citing and that
are now pretty much in the public domain
prove beyond a shadow of doubt that when
Ola and uber type of jobs and mudra type
of jobs or self-employment because this
is all self employment and
self-employment is captured in
unorganized sector jobs by these three
sources all these three sources are
suggesting that the jobs that are being
no one is saying no jobs are being
created of course jobs are being created
if new people are joining the labor
force they are doing something the point
that is being made is that the number of
entrants into the labor force or or
those looking for work is not as large
as the jobs are the jobs that are
available which is the reason why
unemployment rises the open unemployment
rate rises yet we make the third point
that
the fact is that taking all of this into
account we are perfectly aware that the
unemployment rate has risen yes I had
demonstrated this using Labor Bureau
survey and well sir annually then CMI
demonstrated and now NSS is demonstrated
so the unemployment rate is increasing
so I don't know what the gap what what
the government is going on about no one
is saying no jobs are being created that
would be stupid and so the claim that oh
how can we be growing at 7% and no jobs
are created
no one is saying that and the real point
is which the government has to recognize
there is incontrovertible evidence
already that we aren't creating enough
jobs which is the reason why
unemployment rate is rising yes in in
fact number of educated people currently
working as Ola and uber drivers as
Zomato and swiggy delivery boys that is
what should worry us the most because
remember when someone is getting
educated and getting a graduation
becoming an engineer well done we as
taxpayers are funding that education all
of that education comes through either
state or central funding plus the loans
that that person's parents will take so
the burden of not repaying the loans the
burden on the family and the taxpayer is
what we should worry about so we're
educating people but we are not able to
employ them to the level of that
education in fact and this is really
important viewers and we should pay
close attention here money is on the
phone line with us right now from
Chennai he is a qualified engineer who
applied for a job as his sweeper in the
government of tamil nadu and he will and
he's been kind enough to tell us why
money thank you for joining us if you
could just tell us why did you decide to
apply for this job why we just means I
have completed my be in 2016 madam yes
till now I am NOT getting any job madam
job means they are providing a
listen celery like 10,000 in a private
private sector madam but I don't go for
that but am I am I am BC need to get a
government job then I will prepare and
prepare right there right more and more
exam then I can't get a good permanent
job madam the boot money tell me
something when you when you did your
engineering when you studied your B what
type of engineering have you done and
what was your ambition when you decided
to become an engineer I'll come later B
Electrical and Electronics Engineering
madam in 2016 yes in some that our
College not providing any campus entry
madam no I am not getting any job but I
have a 73% AG mark madam seventy-three
percentage mark money the government of
India also argues that they have
provided mudra loans to people that they
have provided support for people who
want to start their own companies
they've provided jobs has any of this
helped you from government provide loan
for the educated people madam but they
are not creating and they are not
creating any awareness to the educated
people madam
they are providing a neutral own means
some people are getting jobs young
people are not getting job then awarded
oh man there was also an argument money
mr. Mohammed Hopkins said that people
don't want public sector jobs they all
want they don't want private-sector jobs
they all want government jobs if you got
a good private sector job would you take
it
that's my ramaa yes I agree but in 2013
I joined in one establish the company
madam they were there giving you only
ten thousand madam then how I come
across the in the rural area madam I am
spending eight thousand five hundred per
month my home rent madam
other than that my home needs my foot
and exit exit Ramadan then we have
overcome that madam that is your problem
money a lot of the people we got in
touch with who had applied for these
sweeper jobs were embarrassed to talk
about this they they were they felt
embarrassment for the fact that they had
applied for this job do your parents
know that you've applied for this job no
madam yes unemployment Ameen that
unemployment the unemployability that's
why I am applying for that job madam
super job they are providing something
doesn't like that so it is a permanent
job then only I am applying for that
madam otherwise I won't applying if I am
getting a good job in private sector
means I am ironing out nearly or 20%
then I will save my life madam so money
for a difference of seven thousand
rupees you are actually telling me right
now that the private sector is offering
you seven thousand rupees less than a
sweeper job in the Government of Tamil
Nadu and you've not you haven't told
your parents that you are applying for a
job as a sweeper if you get the job will
you inform them then that that is the
job you are doing yes madam nowadays in
Greece an employment a then what I have
to do madam nowadays increase the number
of graduates even increase the people I
come they'd become be a MBA PE you have
no choice but to work as a sweeper and
finally money what about your classmates
from your ve college where you completed
your engineering have any of them got
jobs no madam they're also searching for
job madam that's what I am I am Telling
madam okay money thank you so much for
joining us on the phone line that was
money an engineer with a BA degree and
it couldn't be clearer than that
with a B degree who has decided to take
a job as a sweeper or apply for a job
because it pays seven thousand more than
the job
a private sector company was offering
him that couldn't cover his expenses his
rent and his food cost now I'm gonna
open this back up to the panel at this
point mr. Narayan
tirupati off the BJP who joins us in the
Chennai studio mr. Thornberry the BJP
promised us jobs they promised us over a
crore jobs those jobs have not
materialized today we have a situation
where engineers are applying to be
sweepers is the government prepared to
accept we have a problem hey I think we
discussed this before a month in the in
same channel with you and we had a lot
of conversation we had a lot of
arguments but the once again I am very
sorry to say that this is a decade
decades-old problem of bad quality
education that that I again I stress the
other day you you literally you had a
lot of argument against me on this again
I am Telling You when you are talking to
mr. money you would have definitely
sensed that you would have felt that the
bad quality of education is definitely
had enter everything number one are you
deciding monies qualification or
education based on his quality of
English on what basis have you decided
that he's not well enough educated and
it's not is that the quality of English
you prefer for your sweet person
Phi Phi no no fight he was telling that
he was working in a stabilizer company
you should have asked him he was working
as what he would have worked as a sales
representative not the dignity he was is
an engineer basically add to it whose
responsibility is it to improve the
education system whose responsibility is
it to improve their education system yes
that is what yes all engineering
colleges report to view education policy
all the approach and purpose are trying
to
sighs and trying to study yes we have
been doing this for the last two or
three years the entire opposition so
tell me sir you have currently a bruit
majority and Lok Sabha you bring in D
monetization as in when you please
without anybody's advice or anybody's
consultation
the government has hammered through
bills that it had no business hammering
through the Parliament and you were
telling me you couldn't do education
reforms you couldn't bring about health
reforms you are telling me that people
like money today after the investing in
ABI and becoming engineers are applying
to be sweepers because it's their own
fault because the education system has
failed them no it's because the
government has failed them because the
government has not done better what have
you done with the brute majority that
you received in Lok Sabha what is the
BJP done tell me what have you done to
improve the lot of the young people in
this country yeah yeah I will definitely
tell you but I don't want any
interruption see number one is that you
asked me what is this government has
done see there are wonder done per page
of course of people living in India out
of which there are around 38 crore 0
between 0 and 14 1 crore it comes to
another 7 crores of graduates I mean
people studying in colleges 93 crows
come down to another 7 course about 60
years it is 86 come down to another 48
crores of women who doesn't want to work
who are not working housewives that is
out of 14.5 percentage of total
population women are there out of that
70 1.5 percentage of women they don't go
for work and if you calculate the people
who are there who can get jobs who want
jobs are around 43 crores now people say
even the apportion says media says there
are 40 groups and unorganized employees
in India if we are going to obey that
statistics then already there are 53
crores of jobs in India so I think you
are
we're under one second so you're saying
there's no job crisis there's no job
crisis according to you there's no
problem we have no problem let's all
make pakoras mr. thirupathi why don't we
call money back and tell him that we
will get him a book or a class we will
teach him how to make bajji bonda let
him make pakoras it's a good job option
right no no no anyway you are also
giving now pensions to these unorganized
people you have no idea where the data
is Imola no no it is it is very easy to
mark by faith it is very easy to mock it
is very easy to ask questions
I have very clearly told it is it is our
mistake it is the government's not our
government's it is the government's
mistake in Tamilnadu more than 6 lakhs
engineering sweeps are there but now it
is only 3 lakhs they filled up this
thing is only 3 lakhs I am Telling You
educational state subject we have this
Empire State all the steps of file why
do we have HRD ministry in the in the
Government of India then why do we have
a HRD ministry in the Government of
India what does it do
hey that is what we have brought
education policy under upp we'll start
our sorting again smooth irani and now
you don't accept the education new
education policy let us have a debate on
that under you
everybody stop do you know the status of
the SSC examinations and the jobs at the
jobs offered by the government for India
mister we don't do what do you party the
what do you want to rebut vice because
I'm sorry it's getting a little under my
skin mister mister the war please go
ahead
yeah fee I think it's unfair on the part
of the previous panelists to say that
only 48 koror people in India are really
or 43 Carosa actually are looking for
the jobs and that as many jobs exist
alpha chi of 40 odd crores are
reportedly in the unorganized sector
there is no denying the fact that at
least 12 million people enter the
workforce
in India every year that is why what was
being said that if if the jobs are
created by the at the rate at which mr.
Modi had promised or the leadership of
the BJP had promised then only we would
be able to see some dent in the extent
of jobs unemployment in the country
extent of low quality jobs and the
formalization of the jobs which Saturday
in the underpaid underpaid unorganized
sector as well as we would see less of
underemployment in the agriculture
sector the I think you could they they
could be coral whether it is twelve
million job people are entering the
workforce or 11 million or 30 million
but to say that nobody is looking for a
job and everybody is I employed just
because they happen to be in the
unorganized sector is making for a case
of outright but incredible claim of
denial of a problem which exists on the
ground and why should we see the entire
women force of the country listen to
that gentleman gentleman said 48.5%
may be he may be right doesn't want to
work if there is no job for them
probably they are not so aggressively
most of them so aggressively looking for
but fact of the matter is today there is
there are no employment exchanges in the
country where you could go and register
demand is demand for employment because
that practice of having employment
exchanges to register people has been
done away with
there we if I may just bring in one
point please it's yes manufacturing in
the country has decreased
if I may just bring in one point as the
only representative of this panel of my
kind since I am the only woman on this
panel let me make this very very clear
women that the working hours of women
have to account for various things
childcare care of elderly parent
at home care of the household filling
water a lot of times if the job
remuneration falls below the value of
child care and care of elderly parents
in care of the house it becomes a
decision that the woman give up her job
and stay home what does it cost to hire
someone to look after your children
during the day when you are at work now
imagine someone who's making ten
thousand rupees eight thousand rupees
what does it cost to hire someone to
look after your elderly parents who
might be in need of nursing the call
that is taken by the family is that the
woman has to give up her job and then
stay home because it's more cost
effective to do that which is why when
the job crisis Dawn's women are the
first ones to lose their employment
because the salary falls below what is
viable for them to maintain and that is
something that all men in all offices
need to realize that when you go home
you get to kick off your shoes and watch
television when a woman goes home she
has to put food on the table get the
homework done and make sure the kids are
ready for school the next day
not to mention looking after elderly
parents so put those lenses on before
you make any decisions my next question
is to Rahul Singh Rahul Singh I found
something very interesting when I was
looking at these documents which my
colleague promotes sent me from Chennai
interestingly the 10th pass and the 12th
pass applicants into these jobs are all
in their 30s but the become the B the B
SC the BA applicants are much younger
they were born in the 90s they're recent
graduates which means the recent
graduates are far more desperate at this
point to find jobs Rahul Singh very
welfare I think the point is well
established we have been we have we have
debated these issues in past as well one
point is clear we have to recognize that
there is a problem I think you started
with this statement we have to accept
that there is a problem if we accept it
I think there are certain things as for
a solution 1 2 3 are concerned there is
a possibility to look at it number one
if you connect
of the points which I made in one of the
previous debates please do not look at
the job only from point of view of
creation and then we wait for people to
come in join it we have to have a right
kind of connection with the population
policy education policy and job creation
which is also to do with the
employability quality know that some of
the panelists also already mentioned
about it I think it is between 95 to
2000 when we started growing our
population actually and we were in it is
it is between 2000 2010 we were
increasing the enrollment ratio in the
universities that time we should have
been we should have realized that we are
going to face a critical situation and 5
to 10 years from now I think panelists
have already indicated that in last 10
years or so unemployment has been going
up we should have geared up to tackle
the problem it's not the problem of only
India it is problem of the world but
please remember India is going to be the
most populous location in the on the
planet and so it is going to be more
severe in India of course so we have to
address the education policy population
policy but most critical is how are we
going to handle today's critical
situation and that is unemployment
absolutely very well said when we are
talking about unemployment the formal
informal those who are educated all
aspects have to be taken I think you
brilliantly put up the issues of women I
cannot handle it that well I can
understand the way you are presenting it
but if we go to the data I think it's
going to be more severe than what you
just said so data is I think we would
not like to be in a male-dominated
society as Indian society would not like
to look at how women are contributing
and how are they sacrificing I remember
some of the reports came in last few
days even women who are having higher
salaries than their spouse are leaving
their job because of the social egos
right so I'm not getting into that but
the essence the problem here is right
now is job creation some of the I have
to bring a couple of
voices into the into the conversation
yes yes forgive me
s mood leader and for the ADM cable
stupid leader and yes my question to you
you're sitting next to your friend
Wilson Aaron through bethey who said
that the education problem is a state
subject and hence the failure of the
state as the state government failed mr.
Bergeron to provide decent education to
these engineers are you turning out
engineers who are fundamentally
unhireable for anything other than
sweeping the quality of engineers who
pass out from the same College one goes
to a normal corporate gets something
like 25,000 salary and another gets up
picked up by Google and gets a 1 crore
salary so the caliber of the people are
different
you can't just determine based on their
just degree and say this guy is like you
know how do we get admission into
engineering colleges
isn't there an entrance entrance to get
into engineering so you're hiring a 1
crore resource and a 25,000 resource in
the same classroom you're giving them
both admission how is this happen no no
same to me what you're said is no I
don't why don't you I also went to
college so I'm not buying this no you
are wrong now let me also explain you
get to college you're different State
this is a different state there are
states are different the education
system is different which is what you
understand somebody spoke about Ola and
Yuba it did not create job all these
people are drivers they were jobless too
they got jobs
that's absolutely rubbish because I have
spoken to every driver of them every
drivers you spoken to them all some of
them work you want 20 hours mister
muladhara why okay let me rephrase the
question one second once they don't give
me anecdotal evidence let me rephrase
the question
mr. Bullen let me rephrase the question
four thousand people are applying for 14
sweeper jobs why four thousand people
applying for four sweeper jobs why there
is an underlying greed for a government
job as there is an underlying greed for
government jobs which gives them
security etc this Zomato Sugi Ola
these are we to take it as a part-time
job lot of these engineers who work in
Anna University they deliver food in the
evening for tomorrow Zomato and swiggy
is that escape for lack you displacing
the sweepers job profile yeah
why should money work he's it's a
profile what's wrong he's going to earn
some living for this family was in to
your demands voice doesn't matter you
have to be shameless you have to come up
in life you can't be you can be sitting
at home saying that I will not take any
up job unless I get a job from Google
that's wrong that's a wrong attitude
there is no heart happening is wrong
with you how can you say things like
this how can you say things like my
heart is everywhere and if this is the
arrogance of the state government of I
must be more news will go on happening
it's very sad - no no it's very it is
very sad to hear you know comments like
this or national channel what are they
talking your people are beating each
other for without jobs in India why are
you portrayed the Indian is such a bad
light to the Western world for the
entire world
we are not tearing creation is the
managing trustee of our power and carry
mr. Wang Qishan do you want to rebut
this for me please
it is for firstly it is it is extremely
Damini mr. bull either and listen skew
head mister firstly it is extremely
Damini yeah extremely demeaning on the
youth of this country
to make statements like this question
later on see what we are seeing today
let's look at the numbers both in
Tamilnadu as well as throughout India in
Tamil Nadu in 2015 after the floods we
had a huge number of small-scale and
medium scale industries which were in a
huge amount of problem in 2016-17
between 2016-17 and 2017 eighteen fifty
thousand micro small and medium
enterprises have shut down shops in
tomorrow this is a garment report places
the Tamil Nadu assembly now so this has
directly resulted in a loss of file a
great drop is your paralysis
this is the report of Tamil Nadu
so in 2015 and we had floods there is
there was no redressal from the garment
for these people in 2016 number we had B
monetization and then again in 2017 July
we had this GST where a lot of these
industries have to start paying from 5%
back to 12% you know tax so what
happened was that there was a huge huge
amount of pressure on all these small
and medium scale industries that
resulted in a huge loss now the data are
very clearly price of that we have a 6.1
percent unemployment rate which is a 45
year high if India and talking about you
know jobs for women there were several
comments that is made but data is very
very clear between 2011-12 - now in
2011-12
there was a 13.1% please understand I'm
gonna trade for women and that has
increased to twenty seven point su in
1780 now today what the Government of
India is doing this right is their cover
up this run employment problem there you
know to address this unemployment
problem they have one solution the
solution is that that you should cover
up the data you should not release the
data if you are you know yes this is a
leaked report but why this why is the
gun but not coming up with this
unemployment coming up this data and
that is what I see here that's all are
we just listen to the story of mr.
Jayram please thank you what we don't
want to mean see and the other part the
other important part is that in Tamil
Nadu what we are seeing is that in
almost every industrial job that is
being created for example many
industries came in with the promise that
they will create 40,000 50,000 jobs in
Tamil Nadu but what is in reality
happened is that there is no
accountability that is being made
recently what we found out is that many
of these industries that has come has
created only one-third of the jobs in
terms of permanent employment
none of the jobs are in terms of
contract jobs and other things where
people are thrown out after one or two
years and so there is no real job for
the youth of this country they are
thrown out and other people are taken in
so people have left jobless after a few
years so this is what this is the state
of thumb now to that we live in and the
data today that four thousand people
applying for these jobs three hundred
and fifty of them graduates are playing
for sweeper jobs tells it all and the
numbers are right on the face of the ADM
K and the BJP and if they refuse to
acknowledge this problem there can be no
solution well I want to take these these
questions back to Professor Merrythought
professor emerita I just want to put
encapsulated things that we heard from
the representatives of the BJP in the a
IDM came there is no shame in taking a
sweepers job
the problem is NGOs we have enough jobs
we graduates applying its applying a
sweepers because they are greedy for
government jobs there is a problem with
the education there is a lack of talent
and capability and women don't want to
work by far out of the one and a half
years of jobs conversations we've done
on this channel these but these are the
worst excuses I have heard professor my
rap right so let me see if I remember
all the multiple issues that you've just
brought up honestly on the on the fact
that BJP doesn't recognize the problem
this is an old story with the BJP and
the government now we have added a ID MK
which is also not willing to recognize
the problem you know I think the people
of the country will take tell these
these governments what they think never
mind that honestly we really need to
move on to solutions but let me just say
the following that there is clearly
obviously NGOs is not the problem I
think one solution to the problem which
we have which we have which all of us
have already recognized
regardless of the two parties is that is
that we shouldn't we should be diverting
young people into vocational skills and
vocational education and training at the
age of fifteen sixteen and maximum 17 or
18 rather than allowing them to get into
higher education tertiary education ba
ba no ba BSC MBA engineering and the
opening of the college's happened as a
result of the fact that Tamil Nadu is
one of those states which had you know
universalized or pretty much
universalized seen a secondary education
early on and therefore people seeing
that they had nothing else to do
non-agricultural jobs are not in getting
created they went on to do tertiary
education obviously they are going to
end up being unemployed so clearly one
solution is if you if you early enough
divert as happens in China between the
between the ages of fifteen to eighteen
towards vocational stream then people
does not necessarily continue to higher
education problem no solution number one
solution number two we have to recognize
that more and more girls and I am
turning to the to the gender issue FA
but you rightly and so correctly brought
up you know more and more girls have
gotten educated so this argument that
the BJP person was making all women
don't want to work this might have been
applicable to this might be applicable
to sort of middle class women in urban
areas this is much less much less the
case with younger women who've all
gotten educated both in rural areas as
well as in urban areas and honestly they
are they would like to take jobs in the
non agricultural sector they don't want
to be in agriculture yes their mother
Mother's are coming out of agriculture
their fathers don't want to be in
agriculture so they don't want them in a
so clearly what we need to do now having
provided them with education specially
in Tamil Nadu what we need to do now is
much better skilling yes and if we were
to provide them skilling then they would
be better prepared for
to be to assess the labor force one well
final point about yes please very
quickly though fortunately we have run
out of time but I just want to reiterate
what Professor Merrythought was saying
the government's assumption that women
don't want to work in which is why
they're outside of that labor force it's
completely false it is a fallacy to
assume that women don't want to work do
you realize that every farming family in
sixty percent of the population of this
country women go out into the fields and
function like unpaid farm labor apart
from running their homes
apart from fetching water apart from
caring for the very younger the very old
of their families when there is a job
crisis and when there is a crunching of
the number of jobs available in the
market the women are the first ones to
be left out
remember companies that don't hire women
out of fear that they might go on
maternity leave
remember companies that don't hire women
out of fear that they might face sexual
harassment problems going companies that
continue to hire men because of a lot of
the jobs will require travel or physical
labor and they prefer to hire men women
have been workers in this country from
the very very beginning do not blame
your problems on us
if 4607 applicants work graduates and
post graduates have applied to be
sweepers in Tamilnadu for heaven's sake
we need to realize we have a serious
serious problem in this country for as
long as the government Center and state
pretend to be in denial stick their
heads in the sand we will not have a
solution and that to us should be the
scariest part of this story thanks for

be one of the most beautiful cities of
our country and also of Jammu and
Kashmir is now in a state of Filth as
heaps of garbage remains uncollected for
the last two days the sanitation workers
are on an indefinite strike against the
civic body reminding release of their
pending salaries let's go across to
Farid to get you more details for it
we saw a similar strike a few weeks ago
is it about the same demand so why is it
that their salaries remain pending well
it and we the it is basically after the
elections the civic body elections we
saw that the body was elected you they
were co-operators mayor deputy mayor and
from day one we saw that they were not
in good terms with one another and then
they started cleaning order washing
dirty linen in public now it seems that
since then the didi municipality is not
coming back to what it was and or at
least the way it was functioning as far
as the normal day-to-day civic issues
are concerned now since yesterday once
again the municipal employees especially
the serve I am cherries are on strike
now they're demanding a plea basic
demands of their they saying that from
the last six months they have not been
paid to add to that they do not get the
necessary tools required for day-to-day
functioning including rubber boots or
uniforms they're not getting that and
they say that time and again they have a
priced the mayor and the commissioner
and all the authorities about the issues
they or they've just in return got
assurances and when it comes to him
implementing them they're not
implemented implementing those
assurances nothing is getting translated
on the ground and finally they've lost
all patience and now they're on strike
so as it rightly said that this
beautiful city is getting dirty right
now also situation very bad snow Oh as
you could be seeing behind me it's still
snowing and that is in a way acting like
a sanitizer for the issue otherwise
imagine if it would have been warm or it
would if it would have been summers or
she would have snowball so snow as of
now is acting as a kind of a shield for
the municipality or for all the mess and
dirt it has inside and but now for how
long will the people take it because the
garbage is getting littered across the
Srinagar City it is not being collected
and this issue in a day or two will
start to bother the common man and then
we'll have to see how other people react
but as of now they're sleeping they're
doing nothing about it and for the
second day in running the garbage has
not been collected and the authorities
have absolutely nothing to say on this
complete breakdown of communication
between them and the employees and in
turn obviously it is a common man who's
suffering on this front is well not to
talk about all of the other issues that
are plaguing the Kashmir Valley right
now yes absolutely thanks our for it for
bringing us this story when we'll just
hope that the issues a result soon and
everybody gets back to work soon enough
thanks for either",True,en,632,0,10

case the Delhi police informed the court
that they are yet to get prosecutions
sanction in this case the hearing in
this case has been adjourned to 28th of
February after remember the court had
given 10 days to Delhi police to get the
prosecution but they have alleged that
they still do not have the permission
from the Home Department
all right that of course being the
latest they're coming in at this point
the Delhi government yet to give the
go-ahead to the Delhi police to
prosecute coneja Kumar

sedition a day before a City Court was
set to hear the charge sheet against 10
people including the three former
jollier university student leaders for
allegedly shouting anti-national slogans
in 2016 now it seems that there is an
impasse that has been reached with the
police saying that they are still
awaiting the government not to prosecute
this of course being the latest they're
coming in at this point the Delhi
government official said that the police
had sent a copy of the charge sheet to
the Home Department just two hours
before they submitted in the court so we
are looking at a fresh case of a faceoff
of sorts between the Delhi Police and
the government over this entire JNU
Sedition case on one hand where the
police is saying that they had ten days
to get prosecution sanctions from the
whole department and so far they are
still waiting for a go-ahead from the
Home Department they're also listening
to how the Delhi government officials
have said that the police had said the
copy of the charge sheet to the Home
Department barely two hours before they
submitted in court and that is the
reason now the case is now to be heard
next on 28th of February this is of
course the latest are coming in in the
JNU sedition case at this point we'll
have to wait for more details they're
coming out remember the Home Minister
was yet to approve or declined the
prosecution sanction the police need to
proceed with the court in this case the
court will take cognizance of the charge
sheet and begin the process to frame
charges only after the Delhi

exclusive chief minister HT Kumaraswamy
in his party's big pre-poll promised
last year was a mega farm loan waiver
that he said will be given within 24
hours of him coming to power however
eight months have passed since
Kumaraswamy became chief minister and
this promise is nowhere near completion
let's go cross - Rita who's got more
data and details on this Rieger you've
sought some details wire an RTI query
what does the government response show -
you will absolutely turn me this is a
shocking revelation coming in from the
revenue department of cannot occur now
this is the RTA copy that we have
received from the revenue department
you're right here in Bengaluru itself
now there are several questions that we
have asked Mira now has asked because
remember it's been over a couple of
months since HT Kumaraswamy his
government have been claiming that they
have insured a complete loan waiver now
according to HT Kumaraswamy he had
promised by saying that he will ensure
nearly 46,000 crore rupees of loan will
be waived off in the next couple of
months and we also heard just a couple
of days ago that is the budget the
upcoming budget for this fiscal year we
understand they are planning to set
aside 20,000 crore rupees now which will
complete the 46,000 crore as promised by
HT kumara Swamy but is that what is
really mentioned in this RTI a response
to be renowned well not really what we
understand is that out of 46,000 crore
rupees it clearly says now this is the
response what we are getting here as far
as the co-operative sector banks is
concerned now the amount that has been
dispersed by the Revenue Department the
Karnataka government says seven hundred
and sixty-seven crore rupees and to the
bank that we are looking here commercial
banks it talks about three hundred and
eighty two crore rupees now if you
adding both of it the co-operative
sector banks and also commercial banks
it will not go more than thousand one
and 50 crore rupees so we're really is
the promised amount as far as history
Kumaraswamy is concerned we are talking
about a pole promise of forty six
thousand crore rupees
but this RTA responds to Veera now tells
that they have so far dispersed this is
as On January 24th only thousand one
hundred and fifty crore rupees so this
is interesting because then it looks
like Sri join the last couple of months
you know they've managed to disburse
loan only about three hundred crore more
from the last data that had it much and
this is despite the fact that the
government says no we are going to speed
it out we are going to ensure everybody
gets the money
what is the sense what are people saying
why is the process taking so long
well another interesting thing over here
autonomy what we must note here is
because we did ask two questions now the
first question did of course promise on
as far as in fact how much has been
disbursed they have responded to that
that is which is thousand 150 crore
rupees but however we see that the
revenue department did not they fail to
give an answer to especially how many
farmers are benefited because does that
mean that the Karnataka government does
not have answer to how many farmers have
benefited from the farm loan waiver
because even today we hear from several
farmers from across the state that they
haven't received the amount it is still
stuck in the banks so we're really is
the answers forest coomaraswamy promise
is concerned it's going to be
interesting to note that we are hearing
that HT kumara Swamy is going to come
out with a pro-forma budget now is he
going to come up with another light now

JdeQDu46Q84,"GST impacts home buying, 26% increase in demand of ready to move flats","Maharashtra: Under construction flats lose popularity as the demand for ready to move in flats increases in metro cities, especially ...",2019-02-05T05:15:04Z,MIRROR NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JdeQDu46Q84/hqdefault.jpg,"welcome back you're watching India this
morning define the decades-old trend of
under construction projects being the
popular choice among homebuyers a new
trend has now emerged in recent times
now the demand for ready to move in
flats has increased in metro cities
especially in a city like Mumbai experts
and builders claim that the change is
because of GST and the uncertainty of
project delays also experts Silvera
provides a safety net to home buyers
thus addressing concerns of unfinished
projects see over the past couple of
years there are three changes that has
generally happened in the entire
industry first there was the implication
of the GST then there was the regulator
that came in with radar and that is a
general slowdown in the entire market
going forward we see a lot of
transparency that that is coming into
the industry with Herrera coming in and
we've seen how since the introduction of
GST there has been a lot of strain on
the real estate
you know the whole sector and the real
estate set has also been asking for a
cut in or the GST how do you think this
12% GST on under construction flat
actually makes it expensive for somebody
to buy our housing or at the end of it
the final product at the final amount is
the same how do you look at it final
amount has changed but not to the extent
of 12 percent you have to see it in a
view that before the GST the rates were
6% with service tax and back now it has
increased to 12% but did we get the
input tax rate which we pass on to the
consumers so there has been an increase
but the right time to buy the project
says now for a genuine home buyer
because the developers are rolling out
incentives for buying under construction
flats because there's a slowdown and
developers are giving good offers so the
effects somehow gets nullified in the
process this change has happened in the
last three to four years where there
have been certain effects of de
monetization rera
and lastly GST that has changed the
mindset of the buyers so with GST coming
in now buyers have to pick 12% under
construction and when the possession is
there there is no GST so due to that
cost 12% cost in the increases of
price buyers have preferred to now go
for ready position rather than under
construction but definitely the
sentiments have been hurt very badly
because of the government frequent
changes in the policies which is really
really affecting the real estate
industry at the moment aka ready to move

and they don't want to wait so that's a
primary reason to even the reader has
come into effect a lot of buyers still
feel whether the Builder is going to
deliver on time plus the weight itself
is you know the gestation period is very
wrong so people really don't want to
wait they'd rather pace a little more
amount and then going for a ready to
move in property a significant trend is
being witnessed in the Indian real
estate market where the demand for a
ready removal flats has increased by 25%
in the year 2018
now while on one hand the ready
possession flats are in hot demand on
the other hand the popularity amongst
under construction projects seems to be
reducing amidst the home buyers now the
real estate experts say the guys are
largely two reasons for this shift in
the trend one being the 12% GST which is
levied on those people who wish to book
their flats under the under construction
projects which is otherwise not
applicable in the ready to move in flats
and the other reason being the delay in
construction projects which has become
the defining or feature of the Indian
real estate markets now since the
introduction of GST the markets have
been facing a tough time with them also
appealing to the government to reduce
the GST from 12% or to 5%

they would take the matter into
consideration we are yet to you're of

reading good to have you with us here on
the last word
the big debate tonight is mama tawa says
Center has politics obstructed and
derailed the investigation in the mega
chit fund scam but before we go to a big
debate we've got some big breaking news
coming in
well the UK Home Secretary has approved
the extradition he's given his nod to
the order by the UK Court which amalia
now has 14 days to appeal this decision
he can obviously go to a higher court
and if there he gets an adverse decision
then he can also approach the Supreme
Court but of course we are a step closer
to bringing Vijay Mallya back remember
the UK cordovan westminster magistrate
had given its verdict in december to any
80 meenakshi is joining us with more on
the story so Meenakshi definitely a step
closer but it's not as if Vijay Mallya
is coming back home anytime soon well
and we are not that Mallya can be got
back forthwith because there are other
procedures which need to be complied
with namely the appeal stage is still
pending there but surely a government of
India is viewing this as a big shot in
their arm as we speak Arun Jaitley has
also put out his reaction by way of four
tweets and we in the public domain where
he is saying and so how the government
is closer to bringing Mallya back while
the opposition is rallying around us
Sharda scamsters so that apart very
quickly Tandy for the sake of our
viewers there you UK Home Secretary are
pretty much had to deal with just three
points which is this whether under the
UK statute law the extradition of Vijay
Mallya was something which felt which
fell under the prohibited category or
not for that between simply considered
whether or not a death penalty would be
awaiting Mallya in India which was not
the case whether or not the jail cell
that he would be launched in or
something which was up to standard which
will recall video footage had been
submitted in the West Minister Court
earlier to corroborate as to how the
jail cells here in Bombay were
adequately equipped and thirdly or
whether or not Mallya was extradited to
the UK from another third country which
he was not so within the purview of the
UK statute law since Mallya still did
not fall
within the tree a prohibitory categories
UK Home Secretary and he was pretty much
constrained to order his extradition
which a lot of experts here within the
Judy within the legal fraternity feel is
a procedural because again by layer like
you pointed out has 14 days time to file
appeal in the Superior Court a
challenging the lower court of
Westminster decision and also a you UK
Home Secretary's decision Somalia may
not be coming back right yeah both with
all right Meenakshi thanks so much for
joining us with that update quickly
let's also bring in Gore on can't lawyer
with the Supreme Court on this Quraan
just to put this in perspective for our
viewers as well to understand what the
pace of trial and cases can be in UK how
soon can we jamala be back because like
in India even in UK you have multiple
options of an appeal in a higher court
so I it's the same common law which you
know India follows is the same common
law system which exists in in United
Kingdom too so you know this is
definitely a very positive step in the
direction of getting a favorable order
big day for the Indian government as
well as the investigating agency but at
the same time you know to bring him
actually back physically back to India
it will take some time because the
process of Appeal is available to him
which I'm sure he is going to exhaust so
it means that he goes to the High Court
and then subsequently if he loses then
you know to the Supreme Court so we
don't really see him coming back very
soon probably the whole process would
take almost eight to nine months or
maybe more depending on how fast the
case actually progresses so but then
again I mean you know all said and done
I think it's it's a big day for the
investigating agencies as well as the
Indian government finally they have been
able to get one positive judgment in
their favor so it's a big step I think
for for us I'm sure we will get to see
Vijay Mallya soon and back in this
country all right thanks so much for
putting that in perspective go wrong we
now move on to the big debate for
tonight well of course the big talking
point tonight is
Center was as Mamata Banerjee and this
is of course the face of that got
triggered with CBI moving to quiz the
Kolkata Police Commissioner over the
Sharda chit fund scam a politics aside
viewers because politics will continue
BJP will continue with its own rhetoric
TMC now with the support of several
other opposition leaders will continue
with their rhetoric oh we don't really
know but the other person is the one
who's trying to destroy the democracy
both sides will say that I have a very
clear question tonight who is dear
ailing the investigation it has been
almost six years since these two mega
chit fund scams actually came to light
thousands of crores of investors of the
common man's money has been looted
thousands of investors have been duped
when are we going to see justice being
done and if they were top cops and if
they were top politicians who are
involved in this case when will they be
brought to book now why do I say that
why is the question there's politics
dear ailing this probe just take a look
at some of the high-profile names who
are linked to the Sharda chit fund scam
I'm going to start with those who've
been quizzed in the Sardar chit fund
scam that includes subrata Bakshi who is
a TMC Member of Parliament it includes
Himanta Biswa Sarma who's the BJP leader
now is a Congress leader earlier he's
the chief minister of Assam it includes
Muckelroy
who was then the TMC leader he is now
the BJP a BJP leader or pita goes also a
TMC MP let's talk about those who've
been arrested in the chars are the chit
fund scam fringe.i both say TMC leader :
course also a former TMC MP a Member of
Parliament was later on after much hue
and cry suspended by the TMC
Madan Mitra at the time that he was
arrested he was actually a state
minister Oh TMC leader the star
transport minister for the state
Rajat Majumdar TMC vice-president these
are the people who've been arrested in
the Sharda chit fund scam
you can see from those quest and those
arrested BJP and TMC are two parties
that come up not just that
bigger than shots are the chit fund scam
and linked to this entire investigation
is the Rose Valley chit fund scam it
goes beyond West Bengal toppers fall an
actor turned TMC MP has been named and
picked in this case so they burned up
out there a senior leader TMC MP was
arrested in regards to this case from a
transient miss wallaby Jerry leader was
also arrested in this case and then
there were three different CPI M leaders
m ml a puzzled Chaudhary Emily Bridget
Arnaud and Gautham dust who were then
quizzed in the Rose Valley case now why
am i taking all these names these are
all politicians high-profile people
well-connected powerful MPs and leaders
who some of whom are still there in
these political parties today so can we
really expect a fair investigation I
have three very basic sets of questions
these are the questions for TMC tonight
why block any agency from carrying out
an investigation what was the need for
mum table energy to go and show support
of the Calcutta police commissioner who
the CBI had to grill in this case he was
heading the SI t why should the CDI not
ask him questions about this case why
not let the law take its own course in
this investigation and my third question
is injustice to lakhs of investors many
of whom are from West Bengal others from
Orissa more important to our politicians
- Mamata Banerjee here are much
different set of questions of the BJP by
allow painted leaders like muckleroy and
miss Lazar Myrtle joined the BJP and why
give them important force is BJP
selectively then cracking down on the
corruption and talking about action
against corrupt when they have actually
included these ministers and these
leaders in their own party those are the
questions let's get straight to the
debate and say good evening to dr.
Sanjay Jha so al MP with the BJP goron
can't lawyer with the Supreme Court
stays with us
Chaudhary former Advocate General of
mother Pradesh Tata got us at spotty mp4
BJD and common with la Chennai continues
to stay with us he's a policy analyst
and a professor at JNU and I'm going to
go across to dr. Sanjay Jesuit dr.
dussell what's happening you are we
losing sight of what is important
justice to those investors most of them
were relatively poorer people who had
their small savings that they had put
into these chit funds and they ended up
losing that money it seems like it's
just a political fight now see this
fight is not between Center and state
this fight is between poor people and
those who have looted their money and it
we are seeing it since so long nothing
has happened
nobody has been punished it would have
been much better if month of energy
would have caught all those culprits who
have done this scam and there should
have been booked but unfortunately she
was more interested in killing them and
definitely she is having some vested
interest for that that's why the Supreme
Court has to intervene and whatever the
CV I was doing was by the order of
Supreme Court when mr. Souza
Bandopadhyay to Muckelroy can be great
why not the chairman of the SAT can be
grilled by the CBI and how come if I
senior IPS officer is sitting on a Donna
with Chief Minister it means that there
is a hobnobbing between month of energy
and the police commissioner and they
both are shielding the real culprit
now everybody doubts whether the real
culprit is month of energy so that she
is trying to avoid all the
investigations the law clearly says that
the CBI can go to the state only by two
means whether if what if a state allows
or the Supreme Court gives an order to
them so everything was happening under
the jurisdiction of Supreme Court
and this police commissioner has been
called more than three times what CBI
inquiry he never cooperated with them
when Chief Minister of Gujarat can be
grilled for nine hours by CBI and
neither it was opposed by the Chief
Minister of Gujarat nor it was opposed
by any BJP remember that why you are
grilling mister and that is Modi because
if somebody is on truth he does not need
to wish shy away from anything but those
who have got their Western interests
those who are involved in the scam
naturally they have got some vested
interest that's why they don't want to
come in front of CBI if mr. a police
commissioner is clean why he should
avoid coming in front of CBI you are a
he's a senior IPS officer he knows law
very well why he was if they are just
having a dream that in 2019 myth the mr.
Modi might not be in power and then all
our cases will be cleared and that's why
all those people who are on bail at
present they are supporting mrs. miss
Banerjee so that they can be saved from
CBI and from other investigating
agencies okay now let me bring in mr.
common with a Chennai mr. Chennai the
fact of the matter is that today those
who actually were even attacking Mamata
Banerjee in 2014 2015 2016 over the
shara chit fund scam and the names of
TMC leaders that had popped up including
the Congress including the RJD they all
targeted the TMC then they've all come
out and support with her now but is it
right should we buy this argument of BJP
is trying to destroy the democracy but
in fact all that they seem to be doing
is protecting a Kolkata Police
Commissioner there was a stay given by
the Calcutta High Court so there the CBI
relief was preempted but the most
serious thing is what is happening to
the poor people of West Bengal and I
think that should be the item which is
given the most importance and the very
fact that all the
parties have not got together to make
sure the Sharda
scandal and other scandals are put
together it's very sad because what is
happening is you're weakening the fiber
of the people who don't know where to go
from pillar to post so I think it is
extremely important because they don't
have the advantage of going to the
Calcutta High Court to get a stake they
don't have the advantage of going to the
CBI they don't have even the advantage
of going to the police commissioner but
those who are suffering as the poor end
four years
West Bengal was seen as the place which
there was a move towards the Galatea
desert but from what I hear from this
gentleman now an avert for the last few
years it's shocking that people have
been looted this way and this could not
have been done unless powerful interests
shielded the people who looted these
people it's a very sad thing and yes I
don't think that is the most important
thing month of Banerjee should do on her
Dyess but it is something she should do
and say that I will help the people of
West Bengal and get their money back but
how is she doing that because if you see
two of our Minister former ministers
were arrested in this case several of
her leaders have been quizzed and named
in this case some of them have actually
now abandoned her and gone to the BJP
also and and so when the CBI is trying
to question the man who led the si T
probe why should she stand up and defend
him to use the High Court judgement but
the fact is as the seer in Hampshire my
colleague also would say that justice
delayed is justice denied so what has
happened to these people is basically
justice denied and mamta Banerjee as the
Chief Minister of West Bengal owes it to
these people for them to get their
looted money back I mean she may be
important in this particular case but
basically she is answerable to the
people and specially the four people and
it is it is very unfortunate yes this
issue which is up there is important but
it's also a political sideshow right
where the poor people get nothing to
say because they did this they're
completely disenfranchised absolutely
let me bring in our legal experts as
well and just for our viewers
understanding these two the char the
chit fund scam which is relatively
smaller in nature but when I say small I
still mean at least 4,000 to 6,000 crore
rupees if not more the Rose Valley chit
fund scam actually is allegedly bigger
than even 20,000 crore rupees some
reports such as 60,000 crore rupees the
problem with chit fund scams or Ponzi
schemes is that you really don't know
how much of money these guys have
managed to raise how much of money
people have invested now in in the
Sahara case so brother Roy was in jail
for many many years
and it was it was a big struggle to get
that money back but in this case while
the corporate side of people have been
arrested and sent to jail we don't know
any update on the money front and we
definitely know that those politicians
and those cops who were involved haven't
really been convicted yet so let me take
it across to go wrong count and ask him
this question mr. Khan who is derail in
this case when you have so many
politically connected people involved
can we really expect justice
well absolutely yes and I think the
reason why the Supreme Court had in
Devane and had taken and and had given
the case to CBI to investigate is only
because of the fact the case was not
really moving when when it was being
investigated by the local police in West
Bengal so that was the need why the
supreme court had transferred this
matter to the CBI and now to come in
between the Supreme Court and the CBI
and for the state government to take an
action like this where the CM is
actually supporting the Commissioner
going out and sitting on a donna is
something which is absolutely unheard of
and who she is trying to protect if the
CBI is an independent agency is there to
investigate this matter I don't know why
she's not letting the CBI function to
say that she had not given consent under
Section six of the DSP Act it is
something which is much subsequent and
to make it worse for her this is the
investigation which has been directed by
the Supreme Court
so those sections those acts don't
really help her in any way
so the CBI is entitled to carry on with
the investigation and if the CBI goes
there and tries to investigate a police
officer then I don't see any reason for
the the entire dispensation and West
Bengal to really you know fall in line
with him and even the police officer
sitting on a diner with the CN what does
it show it shows there's something much
more to hide there is something which
you know probably the Chief Minister has
to hide that is the reason why the
Police Commission is getting this kind
of support from the dispensation
otherwise if things are cleared like
rightly been pointed out that if you
know Narendra Modi can sit there and you
know you know get investigated by the
CBI then what really holds the police
commissioner to come forward and and
divulge and be a you know part of the
investigation if there's something which
the CBI needs to ask him why doesn't he
go and cooperate there are three notices
which are already been sent out to him
but he never even showed any sign of you
know joining the investigation which
really raises lot of doubts about the
entire way the the the state government
is actually supporting it and trying to
shield him yes Chaudhary thank you for
joining us that do you agree that this
is not the right time and the place for
politicians to to enter to step in and
to make such comments and not just mum
commands you sitting on that no but they
just be other force visiting or on the
daniken amore who is visiting her on
that Donna and they're all now giving
these speeches and making it sound as if
everybody is getting together to fight
against this one dictatorial party and
protect the democracy but the fact of
the matter is at the end of the day the
police commissioner of Kolkata was at
one point of time the man heading this
investigation
the CBI has sent empty three notices
took her that they wanted to quiz him
and now we are not allowing that to
happen you know unfortunately everybody
here wants to see it from a particular
angle we have to view this
dispassionately from a purely legal
angle and the action of the CBI
whether it was justified or unjustified
and what was the caring hurry to visit
the police commissioner's residence on
Sunday at 6 p.m. with 40 CBI personnel
he's not an accused only a summons under
Section 160 CRP C has been sent to him
they say he is not responded and what I
heard from the media was that he has
given three pointed replies to every
question that they had asked me as it
may I'm not going to the merits of the
whole thing now what are you there for
this area for questioning you don't need
40 personnel to question you could have
easily waited on like I I heard today
mr. AAP singer former director of the
CBI who said in such circumstances if
they should have first recruited the
chief secretary or to the Chief Minister
saying that he is not cooperating and
raised the question of cooperation very
strangely enough the very Supreme Court
which must being touted about there was
only but the affair was registered as I
believe in 2013 but in 2014 itself the
Supreme Court while appreciating gsit
headed by the present police
commissioner efforts to investigate
directed since it was a larger area to
be covered by different states were
involved directly the CBI to investigate
now it's been five years since that what
have we in front of us in five years
except that what this is what creates
the wrong impression and wrong
perceptions are created from nothing
today I heard mr. Javed Kerr saying that
there is a red diary and there is a
pendrive now these are investigation
matters in the CBS sharing these details
with the BJP leaders did not being
should not be done at all but this a new
haste that was shown he is not required
here very senior police officer and 160
what is the 167 sorry nobody knows over
here on this tree 167 under one section
166 0 of the CRP see you're merely are
asked as a witness because they're
saying we went to question and not
please understand one of the friends do
I use the word grilling there's no
question of grilling involved in it he
said we are only going to question him
but why can't you question him go to his
office take your time if he does not
give the time it's the Supreme Court
monitor investigation you could have
filed an application before the Supreme
Court Luce you asked us to investigate
he's not he stood that day heavens would
have fallen in 24 hours after all today
the Supreme Court has gone to the a day
I mean sorry the CBI has approached the
Supreme Court with fix the case the
bench has been constituted and tomorrow
a three-judge bench is going to hear it
in the Supreme Court similarly they
could have approached the Supreme Court
and said so all this ugly situation
could have been avoided
retros a very well avoidable thing that
could have been done I don't know why
this 500 approach of 40 people trying to
show us clarity are you really going to
question terrorists or something
mr. Corrigan yes very easily avoidable
situational absolutely I think first of
all I was just reading right here you
know there were only 11 police personnel
who had actually go on there so though
to make that kind of allegation that
there were 40 people is absolutely
incorrect he should not rely on media
reports you know you should you should
not you should not make that kind of
statement you are a responsible person
you should not make that kind of a
statement lera phi this there are media
reports that suggested initially yes
your media reports did suggest initially
that about 42 officials at various
locations were put in place to go and
find the Kolkata Police Commissioner who
at one point was also reportedly missing
but yes from what we have learned from
our CBI sources and I'm going to clarify
and emphasize on that respect that the
report has been sent from the local
cause Kolkata CBI team to the central
team now about what happened last night
claims they're about 11 CBI officials
to the residents last evening and that's
how the entire drama unfolded and
instead those 11 officials were then
told to get into this Jeep by the
Kolkata police team and when they when
they tried to resist that they were
pushed into this sheep and CBI sources
clear that the Kolkata Police actually
wanted to find out from them what was
the plan they wanted to know what is it
that the CBI was investigating and what
CBI's plan was I just wanted to put that
in perspective go ahead now mr. Conte
and finish your point
well absolutely done me I mean this is
very unfortunate that you know those CBI
officials who had actually been you know
discharging the duty actually taken by
the police the Calcutta police which is
very unfortunate these kind of
situations should never actually happen
and then to that extent that those
people that he had gone there to take
you know 160 when he's saying 160 he's a
witness definitely you can go and record
a statement of the witness it is not
that and even if it is a Sunday I don't
think so investigating agency really
needs to look into that whether it's a
Saturday or Sunday we should actually
appreciate the fact that the talks of
going there and are doing and
discharging their duty we should not
what well absolutely they can but this
there's nothing which stops him from
going there and recording a statement so
I think you know it is a Sunday so honey
is that do you know that matter has
already been matter has already been
lingering on for such a long time and
tomorrow when we are talking about the
Supreme Court we all know that there's a
contempt which has been filed because
the entire investigation is actually
being you know done by the supreme court
so there's a contempt application which
has been filed tomorrow the court will
actually look into it whether part of
the official I will have able to bring
in any evidence then I think the CGI has
already indicated on it so we will see
what exactly will happen tomorrow so
don't see that you know so I'm going to
take a strict stand yes I'm going to get
me of djd in just a bit but really call
the CBI today mr. Ochoa is my question
disclose anything against the police
commissioner
I have this question for our legal
experts before I go political experts my
question is there's a CBI have the right
to question or to search a property or
to arrest somebody without a warrant
because we are given to understand CBI
did have a warrant yesterday not without
a warrant no they do not
I had not gone dead why somebody or they
have not gone there to search but I'm
not too sure if the police knew what was
happening if it was but if they were
being raided search and accuse yes the
Commissioner of Police is not an accused
he can only be closed because he was the
one leading the SAT so Holly she's not
an accused in this case he has not been
made an accused fair enough mr. Shah the
idea that fine he's let me go across
Judith Agatha's apathy MP with the bjd
some of the BJT leaders and those linked
to the party have also been linked to
the Charlotte chit fund scam and to the
Rose Valley scam one of them was also
arrested few years ago mr. Sethna 'they
tonight what we are talking about is
justice to those thousands of investors
who put their hard-earned money in these
two scams and the fact that the
investigation seems to be blocked
obstructed and derailed at every step
because of politicians your comments not
me I I have two opinions the first
opinion is that investigation hello yes
Lord mr. Satpathy can you hear me yes we
can
the first point that I the first point
that I want to make is that
investigation should never be disturbed
should never be you know interfered with
that is an accepted fact I think every
law-abiding citizen would
that and I also wanted but the way the
CBI has been functioning the way the
central government wings have been
functioning lately speaks volumes that
this could possibly be used as political
score settling and that may not be a
good thing for the country in the long
run and I believe that investors who
wanted to become millionaires overnight
without working do deserve justice it is
important that the poor who invested
their money who money hard-earned money
as you put it hoping that they will rake
in a huge profit in a short while do
definitely deserve justice there is no
second opinion about it but the other
side is the investigating agencies have
lost credibility CBI is no more holy
institution that people trust anymore
whenever CBI is given a case we never
hear the end of it all I am wanting to
find out is if these chick fern scams
have happened some seven eight years ago
and this government this particular CBI
has been investigating it for more than
five years why weren't these things done
earlier what was the reason for this
lull in the storm and suddenly just
before elections it's happening
everywhere was you where the people who
had invested their hard-earned money as
you put it in this in these chit funds
hoping for rigging and a lot of money
overnight without working didn't they
deserve justice earlier why is it that
we delayed giving them justice okay that
age-old cliched phrase that justice
delayed is justice denied also comes
into play now okay let me take that
point across to dr. J soil of the BJP
dr. Jessel you want to respond to that
why I suddenly remember that there was
this one specific cases where and
speed-up on the investigation now see
it's not about a speeding above the
investigation just it was simply the CBI
has gone there for questioning about
different things with the police
commissioner it was not nothing with the
speeding we call if it should have been
done by the government of West Bank all
providing justice to the poor people if
they would have provided it there was
would not have been any need of Supreme
Court intervention and I doesn't agree
with Mr Sarkozy I really don't agree
with him frankly speaking but he's
saying that if this is absolutely
monitored what it was whatever Singh no
yeah that's another thing but this is
monitored by Supreme Court this is not
monitored by anyone else and if you
don't believe in Supreme Court then
things are quite different and it was a
simple inquiry but every war all those
people involved in a scam to save so
called a government it's a it's a
clear-cut that all the scamsters from
theory although to Maya
also they all are lobbying with month
month of energy so that they are trying
to posit annual share are being
forwarded to
they have got a daydream that after
Manor okay so I just nothing wrong the
heat this CBS and Ford
ma Muckelroy also yes no one should be
shy
a way forward and query of CBI
let everything come because you yourself
are raising this question dr. Jo why
or Road when when this case came to
light and when this case came to light
and when Mukul Roy was questioned the
investigation was still on the
investigation is still on why did the
BJP think it was okay to bring him on
board does that not also make you look
like a hypocrite because he is still
being cuckoo quiz in RIS reference to a
case same goes for Himanta Biswa Sarma
when his name has popped up the
investigation is still on CB s still
looking in the case why bring him on
board and maybe the Chief Minister see
let the Supreme Court decide I energy is
the boss of everything of all the scams
I am NOT saying that but let everyone is
allowed the Supra CBI can't drill anyone
let them ask the questions what they
want to ask they were they have to
report to the Supreme Court Supreme
Court will decide that who are the
culprits and you are not who I you are
somebody else will wise we will decide
that this person is jovial in the
Supreme Court run the government here
the West Bengal government failed to
provide justice to the poor people
are you asking something from why not
let the Supreme Court run the government
you at the government hole sometimes
don't always put everything we know they
say tomorrow they will go into an
academic discussion about whether this
kind of a thing can be done or not and
they will leave it to the executes if
they will again leave it back at square
one we move it's all known now nothing
is a secret so why are you to run this
country with me or not I don't care
no I don't think this is a fair argument
or excuse for any party to give us that
the Supreme Court will decide so why
should we get into it you can't give
platforms to those who are being quizzed
who are being named who are being
accused because otherwise you're giving
them more power at a time and they can
use that power to influence any
investigation which is why I keep coming
back to this point with which I started
with look at the list of people from TMC
from BJP even BJD who have been named
we've been questioned who will links to
the specific to chit fund scams how can
we expect a fair investigation at any
point and then look at the share of CBI
itself I mean an agency that is going
through a crisis by itself can we really
trust their investigation yes so as a
chairman of SI t he should have punished
all those people who are involved from
BJP
he is already a party he's not a police
commissioner he is sitting with month of
energy so why not wisdom is month of
energy and Rajeev Kumar okay point taken
I think it is frankly very very
inappropriate so for the Kolkata Police
Commissioner a man in uniform and for
the for a politician to stay a share
stage and for even mamta Banerjee to
come out in his defense like this when
an investigation is still going on that
being said as my own opinion let me go
across your roof George or three Hugh
has been wanting to make a point and
then we will bring in our other
panelists yes mr. Joffe yes I tell you
that the gentlemen of the BJP is talking
about respect of the Supreme Court and
every month but follow and all that what
is happening subdermal I should be
entire BJP has been flouting the order
of the Supreme Court the Prime Minister
hopefully is literally spoke against the
Supreme Court honor in the sense to say
that why should this interfere in the
religious matters I'll give you another
example in super Chhattisgarh there was
a killing of innocent villagers by the
lately the Supreme Court directed
investigation in 2016 and the CBI
officers who had gone there were
assaulted by the local police they went
in hit themselves for their lives and
they were saved by the CRPF just in the
nick of time so this is all right to
have one way to I was now going to say
this but every time things it says
Supreme Court Supreme Court then respect
the Supreme Court all around right and
therefore all this is I think being very
hypocritical and is degenerating into
saying month I did this one card in that
week talking what was the need for the
CBI emergency where an investigation
pending for the last five years in one
day what would have happened you could
have gone you could have gone to the
district II could have gone to the court
the elections are over now do you want
to say that CBI should not question
anyone till the elections are over do
you want to say that right göran can't
you wanted to say something and then I
have a question for annoys him I'm just
saying that you know let let the CBI do
its investigation it is very unfortunate
that we are making everything very
political I think the fact that mamta
Banerjee initially had made the
statement that since she has you know
gone against or made a representation
that both you know she will not go by
the CBI dictate it's very unfortunate I
mean we have to we are doing both we are
not lucky letting an independent agency
do its investigation at the same time
they are also floating the supreme court
order so we are doing boy
we are not letting the law of the land
actually function the action of the
state government actually reflects that
they have no respect for the
Constitution the action on the part of
the police commissioner reflects that
he's absolutely hand in glove with the
you know the the political dispensation
sitting on a tide now it is a very
unfortunate situation and to say that
why the CBI has gone there on a Sunday
evening is worse because the fact that
CBI is actually doing its work rather
than giving a pat on their back stating
that they are even working on Sundays it
is easier to accuse them that why they
have gone on a Sunday and if they are
actually investigating a witness he
can't deny yes then the suit the CBI is
at liberty to knock on the doors of the
court and do whatever procedure is is
available for them in law okay very
quickly let me just bring it mister can
I as well they will follow the law yes
very quickly let me bring in mr. Jenner
as well and here is a question that has
been put forward by one of our viewers
so I'm just going to put that across to
you mr. shenoy book isn't it isn't it
also slightly odd that month apparently
didn't go on or not didn't cry foul when
her ministers and her leaders were being
arrested and were being taken back and
forth to the court and but it when it
comes to one Police Commissioner she is
doing it I mean how else do you see it
except for the fact that it's election
season just a few months to general
election well you know I find it passing
strange that you have a huge bundle you
have a huge floor you have police
commissioner's etcetera etcetera all
there is this a form of governance yes
is the money that is being spent on this
going to help the people in the shard
the scam etc and and one important point
that a BJP friend made I mean it ran and
the others made that if you go to the
poorer areas Chhattisgarh Jharkhand etc
where people like me worked on the raiga
the natural Rural Employment Guarantee
Act we found that the situation there is
floundering because the these structures
that should have given these poor people
power and empowered them are not there
so from the bottom to the
up to the Sharla scam you have a system
which is rotting
so I plead with the Honourable people
there the politicians the people who are
interested in what is happening to the
country that we should really get beyond
some things and where there are
sideshows we should ignore them we
should not create them as something very
good in mamta Banerjee gets power from
sitting next to a police commissioner
good luck to her but we are more
interested in power to the people and
that we have not seen in this episode
all right I'm completely out of time
here so I'm afraid we'll have to wrap up
this conversation and thank you to all
of our panelists who have joined us but
I think it is for people to decide
because on both sides politicians are
going to come to you and try and
convince you see the other side is more
corrupt see the other side is the one
that is actually protecting the corrupt
but does it do any of them have any
moral standing in this specific case
thousands of investors put in small
little sums of money hoping to get some
big returns they got lured in but as
many of them did no better but what
about justice to them in this almost six
years no party has made an attempt to
bring justice to those people leaders
from big parties are involved are linked
to this trick front scam lot month of
energy not the BJP not the BJT nor even
the left not even the Congress none of
them really have a moral standing today
to stand up and say or the other side is
killing democracy or the other side is
corrupt because they are all doing the
same thing looking out for their own and
playing politics at the cost of common
citizens and their interest thank you so
much for joining us tonight

KaQtXnegMig,UK Home Secretary approves extradition of Vijay Mallya to India,United Kingdom's Home Secretary has approved the extradition of Vijay Mallya to India. Mallya can appeal in higher UK court if he ...,2019-02-04T17:24:36Z,MIRROR NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KaQtXnegMig/hqdefault.jpg,"well the UK Home Secretary has approved
the extradition he's given his nod to
the order by the UK Court which amalia
now has 14 days to appeal this decision
he can obviously go to a higher court
and if there he gets an adverse decision
then he can also approach the Supreme
Court but of course we are a step closer
to bringing Vijay Mallya back remember
the UK cordovan westminster magistrate
had given its verdict in december to any
80 meenakshi is joining us with more on
the story so Meenakshi definitely a step
closer but it's not as if Vijay Mallya
is coming back home anytime soon and we
are not that Mallya can be got back
forthwith because there are other
procedures which need to be complied
with namely the appeal stage is still
pending there but surely a government of
India is viewing this as a big shot in
their arm as we speak Arun Jaitley has
also put out his reaction by way of a
tweet and we in the public domain where
he is saying as to how the government is
closer to bringing Mallya back while the
opposition is rallying around us Sharda
scamsters so that apart very quickly
Tandy for the sake of our viewers there
you UK Home Secretary are pretty much
had to deal with just three points which
is this whether under the UK statute law
the extradition of Vijay Mallya was
something which felt which fell under
the prohibited category or not for that
between simply considered whether or not
a death penalty would be awaiting Mallya
in India which was not the case whether
or not the jail cell that he would be
launched in or something which was up to
standard which obvious will recall video
footage had been submitted in the West
Minister Court earlier to corroborate as
to how the jail cells here in Bombay
were adequately equipped and thirdly or
whether or not Mallya was extradited to
the UK from another third country which
he was not so within the purview of the
UK statute law since Molly
did not fall within the tree a
prohibitory categories the UK Home
Secretary and we was pretty much
constrained to order his extradition
which a lot of experts fear within the
Judea within the legal fraternity theory
is procedural because it can by layer
like you pointed out has fourteen days
time to file appeal in a Superior Court
a challenging the lower court of
Westminster's decision and also a you UK
Home Secretary's decision Somalia may
not be coming back right yeah both with
all right Meenakshi thanks so much for
joining us with that update quickly
let's also bring in Gore onk-onk lawyer
with the Supreme Court on this Quraan
just to put this in perspective for our
viewers as well to understand what the
pace of trial and cases can be in UK how
soon can we jamala be back because like
in India even in UK you have multiple
options of an appeal in a higher court
so I it's the same common law which you
know India follows is the same common
law system which exists in in United
Kingdom too so you know this is
definitely a way positive step in the
direction of getting a favorable order
big day for the Indian government as
well as the investigating agency but at
the same time you know to bring him
actually back physically back to India
it will take some time because the
process of Appeal is available to him
which I'm sure he is going to exhaust so
it means that he goes to the High Court
and then subsequently if he loses then
you know to the Supreme Court so we
don't really see him coming back very
soon probably the whole process would
take almost eight to nine months or
maybe more depending on how fast the
case actually progresses so but then
again I mean you know all said and done
I think it's a it's a big day for the
investigating agencies as well as the
Indian government finally they have been
able to get one positive judgment in
their favor so it's a big step I think
for for us I'm sure we will get to see
Vijay Mallya soon and back in this
country all right thanks so much for
putting that in perspective Quran",True,en,227,1,1

go across to Santa who's there in
religiosity tracking the latest for us
here Santiago San understanding of the
level and extent of the protests the
hunger strike that Ana's RA is sitting
in what exactly are his demands at this
point a figure today is the sixth day of
another attention his hunger strike and
if you talk about why exactly is he
doing it by what are his demands if
of the month is the appointment of local
and local star now if you talk about
this entire movement I'm not in 2011 he
started she started mention her hunger
strike demanding and after that also in
2013 he once again did another unsure as
a result in the month of December 2013
the Billboard meal in fact it came it
was signed by the children also in the
very next year which is January 2014 but
by the time anything could have happened
the government changed and still data
also after five years or also of the
signing of the bill till date the
appointment of Lokpal is yet to be made
so now as we talked about the government
after the bill the big thing is that
there should be a committee for the
appointment of the local and that
committee along with prime minister
should a prime minister and other
members should also have Leader of
Opposition now there is opposition and
the partial because no none of the no
party actually cleared the mark of 10%
of the total seats or of the Parliament
who came the position of leader of
opposition but to that our Supreme Court
gave our gave permission to the
government to go ahead and form the
committee without the opposition but
despite that yes
despite that no development that is the
reason why Anna is angry over the delay

these big-ticket announcements will
touch every citizen mayor now asks
should the center have presented a
packed interim budget before the big
2019 general election how implementable
is the Modi government's election budget
let's debate you're watching the you're
watching the urban debate on me around
fader source I thank you for joining us
we're asking a very simple question
there were three major announcements or
as we've been calling them promises in
this budget how implementable are these
promises first of all none of this can
actually move until a new government is
sworn in and that new government decides
to agree and fast which means that
you're making plans for a mandate that
is not yours but more importantly if we
examine these three announcements the
benefits to farmers who have less than
two hectares of land do we have the land
records to do this do we have the data
on the farmers can we actually reach
them what happens to landless farmers
the benefit of pensions that you are
actually going to give unorganized
workers do we have the data on
unorganized workers how does how does
anyone prove that they're making less
than 15,000 rupees if they're being paid
in cash and their unorganized and what
happens if I'm above the age of 30 and I
can't make the contribution for the 30
required years the benefit of five lakh
rupees or a better tax management for
those who make less than five lakh
rupees the question that needs to arise
at this point is why have you made this
decision why have you brought it in as a
rebate and not a change in the slab and
is this an acknowledgment from the
government the D monetization in GST has
in fact hurt the bottom of the working
pyramid joining me on the show Bhaskar

Himanshu
my question to you is this if we talk
about the pensions that will be given to
the unorganized sector workers do you
see that as an easily implementable plan
or are they enough details here that
make it seem like it can be implemented
well first of all this Prague this
pension scheme is a rebranding of the
uttal pension use now that was already
there so it's not much new as far as the
pension scheme is concerned but really
the problem is about how to get the
unorganized sector workers to become a
part of this pension scheme and it is a
voluntary scheme in a sense the worker
has to contribute 100 rupees or 55
rupees whatever is the contribution
depending on age for month so for
example if you had a 25 year old 20 year
old worker you have to contribute for
the next 35 to 40 years and only at the
age of 60 you are going to get a sum of
3 thousand rupees I'm obviously that is
a value that will not make much sense
after 35 or 40 years of the afternoon
from from now but I think this is also a
scheme which is which requires
unorganized workers to be brought in the
scheme and in the last 2 years if you
look at the experience of the utter
pension use now only one point two
co-workers have come in and joined our
two pension use that despite
government's over
drive and everything that has gone into
it so the idea that ten crore workers
will become an organized be part of this
Pension Scheme is really something that
is not going to work out despite all the
government's efforts but the other
problem which is there and this is
something is regarding implementation
since you asked about implementation yes
I mean suppose I'm an organizer sector
worker for five years have been in
Haryana unorganized sector worker and
suddenly which is what the government's
objective is that I join a formal sector
what happens to the contribution that I
made for the five years will I be able
to get this unorganized sector pension
or will I become eligible for the EPF of
money that I am going to get or I become
a NPS pension I think there are issues
which are related to that and there have
been many many complaints of people now
unable to claim their pensions even if
even they have contributed for about 10
years or 15 years that has happened with
EPF o that has happened that is going to
happen with other pension schemes also
what is required is a better kind of a
scheme where you allow them to take part
in the social security provisions and I
last point I wanted to just took an end
s and this remember one of the oldest
pension scheme that we have is the
oldest pension scheme which is almost
like a pension scheme for workers were
people in the rural areas were above 60
years of phase and 65 years of age now
their pension was fixed at 200 rupees in
2006 this government in the last five
years despite sixty economists writing
to them almost every year that please
raise it since 2006 it has not been
raised it has not raised it from 200
rupees to even 500 rupees which was the
demand that we had now if you can't
provide pensions and cannot be give them
a decent kind of a pension to the oldest
pension holders or to the widows or to
the disabled pension holders then I have
serious doubts on your commitment to
provide pension to the unorganized
sector workers and that is something
which is a big question that needs to be
asked and this is also related to the
farmers income transfer a government
which is so insensitive to the the
poorest section most vulnerable section
of the population and is refusing to
raise their incomes that is their
pensions from 200 rupees it suddenly
going to clear promise of pensions to
all organized sector workers and farmers
it's some somewhat there is a
contradiction here and there is a trust
deficit that is difficult to
based on these and these announcements
right I also have Abhishek Rastogi who
is a tax expert I wish a the five the
tax rebate offered to those people who
make less than five lakh rupees of their
taxable income less than five lakh
rupees the justification that has been
put out by the Finance Minister most
spokespeople of the BJP is this people
need to plan their taxes which is why we
announced it now and didn't wait for the
new government to come in what planning
of next year's taxes happen now in
February I think as far as the tax
announcements are concerned this is more
on the expected lines we saw in the past
that the reference when it came to the
reservations came to the family income
and the hint was given that that benefit
would flow in or wherein the family
income would be between the range of 5
lakh rupees to 8 lakh rupees for the
economically weaker section so I think
from that perspective it looked very
evident that the benefit with respect to
the income tax exemptions would come to
that bracket of people with income in
that range so I think that benefit of
tax exemption has been extended to to
the income group and the total exemption
would now be extended when the
investment is to the tune of 150
thousand which means that an individual
who earns 6 lakh 50 thousand in a year
can plan the tax in such a way that
there is no tax on the total income so I
think that was more or on the expected
lines but I think when it comes to rate
rationalization now because if we see
the direct tax collections the direct
tax collections have also gone up 19
percent as compared to the ten month
period of the last year if we see the
GST connections it touched 100,000 crows
this month so which means that when
these tax collections are improving and
when we are saying that the tax
compliance is getting better I think the
need of the hour wash to remove lot of
these cesses for instance this
education says Chris chicken Diane says
the surcharge on even the higher bracket
income groups should have been looked
into and I think that has been ignored
and when again we come to the tax
benefits if we see that entire tax
structure today before the announcements
that we see the income group between two
like fifty thousand to five lakh was
subjected to five percent tax rate and
the moment you cross five lakh rupees
the tax rate is twenty percent so it
jumps from 5 percent to 20 percent and
that's why a lot of these people in the
income group range of 5 lakh to 8 lakh
would face was facing a higher brand so
I think from that perspective this
benefit which comes to a person who
basically gets this rebate of even one
lakh fifty thousand rupees as compared
to the pre announcements would end up
saving some thirty thousand so from that
perspective it's a it's a good budget
for the middle-class income group but I
think the rate rationalization was
expected and should have been announced
okay to my studio guess there's a lot of
the of this seem like patchwork to cover
up maybe mistakes that were made in the
past and if we actually on one table put
down every announcement or every
statement that was made by this
government over the last five years it
would be wildly self contradictory
because they've been so many u-turns
yeah and I think the reason for this is
very simple that I mean we've said that
earlier as well the reasoning and the
logic behind this exercise is to provide
talking points that are put to other
political activist in the ground it's
nothing to do with the economic logic
it's nothing to do with financial
prudence it's nothing to do with
implementation challenges it's
everything to do with building a
narrative because they know that there
is a need to build a narrative across
various sections salary class section
has a new narrative to be built workers
low-income farmers all of these sectors
require a narrative for the parties to
go out and campaign but you know here's
my question this was also the question
that came up when the rbis independence
was under a cloud which is should we be
making short-term political decisions at
the expense of the country's finances or
the Kanade or the long-term finances of
the country which is effectively what's
happening here the budget
it is not a place to make a lecture I
mean you know I mean that's a probable
question and I think these things should
have been done outside the budget and
you know I knew mr. Modi
makes you know one political speech per
week so he could have easily promised
these things outside the budget so I
also wanted to make a couple of quick
points just so you know the interesting
thing is that people now with an income
of up to 5 lakh pay no tax but the
moment your income becomes five like one
rupee yes you pay a lot of so which is
not you know you pay 20% also and you
pay tax on the income up to file a
Caswell yes it's it's not equitable at
all you know I mean you're basically
penalizing a lot of people the second
interesting thing that I sort of
observed in the budget was how huge well
presented all the good data points you
know so it's like inflation is low but
what he did not tell us was that
inflation is low because food prices are
in negative territory yes not food price
inflation is in negative territory so if
you take food and fuel out of the
inflation basket the inflation currently
is around five and a half percent which
is not as high as ten percent as it used
to be during the UPA era but it is still
very high
the third point was that you know Bujji
I talked about the fact that air traffic
in India has doubled and you know I mean
air traffic in India has doubled yes but
you know what role does I mean comment
has some role but his point was we've
built airports you know is this doubling
happening because of people flying to
all these airports what is this doubling
happening because Mumbai Delhi traffic
has peaked Mumbai has rubber traffic is
peaked you know but you know what he did
not talk about was the poor sad state of
Indian Railways which most people still
used to travel in I mean just you know
hardly any mention was made about the
railways in the budget and he is the
railways minister as well which is
really something I didn't mention that
was made about the railways was the
factor findings have been have been
removed only on a broad gauge by the way
yes but you know and I would come back
to this whole question of statistics and
question of what the government is
referring to
and how they will consider you know one
piece of statistic when it suits him and
that same piece will be will be sort of
discarded when it doesn't but picking up
from what we said that they had actually
framed a lot of the sentence is very
interestingly like the defense budget
when we were listening together you
pointed out that while it was said this
was the highest ever it was not
incrementally much higher than last year
yeah so what struck me was that the term
not the term using the budget speech was
the for the first time ever the defense
budget has touched three lakh crore and
obviously there was a lot of thumping
and very orchestrated clapping that last
year's budget which is 42.96 crores 96
lat corrode so it's it's really only
four or five four and a half thousand
crore so technically that doesn't barely
covers inflation so but the headline is
the first time ever three lakh crores so
I mean that's obviously a bit of spin
doc GDP the number might have actually
fallen now bring in a vast cargo ship
the BJP who's been listening very
carefully and very patiently to all of
this Vasco got specific questions and
I'll go one by one the first question is
from was from Aviv on you and we'll
switch this to Hindi some people you
will be able to rebut you as well

that okay
it was to be in the last bench of cec 3
and but it has up to cross plus 50 power
50% we have the achievements and in
order to protect the small farmers
having 2 hectare of land like in West
Bengal I am from his bengal from west
bengal which is Manaus 5,000 rupees per
hectare as because there is a small land
there's no big land so small land as the
states which have a small farmers as if
they have a to hectare is totally
unprotected so they have been given an
amount of six thousand rupees which will
be affected from I believe 2018 so the
thing is that the attitude of the
governments for this six thousand rupees
per year it was beneficial 12 crore
farmers will be directly benefited okay
are equally affected from blows mr.
Ghosh how do we know 12 core powers will
be directly benefited have you checked
all their land records sir do we have
the land records in our country to know
that these 12 crore farmers will be
movin gone then when honourable when
honorable finance minister when
honorable finance minister in the budget
paper has been declaring that means he
has checked it from his own Department
i-ight at the studio cannot tell you but
it has been checked respect your
position but when the honorable finance
minister makes as deep into my speech in
the studio I have to question because we
haven't sealed that data
next question Bhaskar Ghosh what happens
to those farmers who have no land at all
do they not qualify but one thing please
please allow me allow me once again
allow me once again allow me once again
and what happened outlay is there per
year and 20,000 estimate in the current
year we know that I want to understand
from you how will this be implemented
how will you identify these farmers what
paperwork will they submit and what
happens to farmers who have no land in
fact a
free state Bolero has got the land
records which is now most of the states
are digitized it from the BLM energy you

not put the cutting edge ERP sorry when
you are due to occur youi here Baskar
goes let me move on to the next question
the next question is this the pensions
that are being offered to unorganized
workers what data is the government
referring to because until yesterday you
were telling us that you don't have data
on unorganized workers and that's why
your job crisis cannot be confirmed or
refuted please tell me how will this
pension work how will you identify these
unorganized workers how will you find
out whether or not they're making 3
15,000 rupees a month and how will you
give them the benefit see this is May
pension yojna which is predominantly
major pension Georgina I will give you
some some of the indexes which has been
already clarified in today's budget
allocation mr. Bosch which we have not
received today like here's a question
let's say it it says if you're 29 years
old you pay a hundred rupees a month
let's assume through some magical
intervention I am able to produce a
letter that shows that I only make
fifteen thousand rupees in that's why I
qualify I pay a hundred rupees for the
next 30 years but thankfully because of
a growing economy I am no longer at
fifteen thousand rupees a month will I
still qualify will I still get the
pension how will this work what happens
if there is a 32 year old or a 42 lineup
will they be able to sign up what
happens for example two people who only
get work six months in the year or three
months in the year and don't get work
for the rest of the months in the year
what happens to someone who sells apples
only in certain times of the year and
doesn't have apples because they are not
in season in the rest of the year
how will they qualify in 15,000 rupees
salary or 15,000 rupee income every
month there are no answers mr. Ghosh
unless you can offer them to us right
now please go ahead I'm tell you one of
the options could be see it has been
mentioned in the budget speech you know
that EPF of memberships has increased by
around 2 crores
so this EP fo members when they are
registered with the government and they
give their contribution where government
this time is 4% incremental the
government contribution is also there so
this could be another possible data's
mr. Ghosh sorry forgive me for
interrupting you but EPF for data will
only have organized sector employees by
merit of being qualifying for EPF er
they're organized and not unorganized
this was meant for unorganized sector in
fact the Finance Minister mentioned
ragpickers apart from other you know
professions that he called out in his
speech how will you get this together
there are no answers mr. Ghosh how will
you implement this
now this unorganized sector what you're
talking about
even the records of this anonymous
sector will be taken by the respective
Labor Department's they have to come and
they have to disclose and okay based on
that okay okay I will interrupt you
again forgive me but the Government of
India has said in Parliament that the
labor department in the Labor Ministry
doesn't have data on the unorganized
sector which is why we don't have a
complete number of employment or
unemployment because the largest portion
of our country is unorganized and the
labor ministry is unable to measure it
so if you're going to tell me that in
the next two months the Labour Ministry
is going to magically learn how to solve
for that problem I will ask you why
didn't they magically learn to solve for
that problem four years ago no this was
first of all this was the scheme which
has been launched which has been
announced in this interim budgets so
this interim projects hands on words the
the records will be if it's not there
that of course could be created I
believe it is a part of the record
should be available with the government
and the government is going to affect it
okay I'm glad you think that and I
really wish we had done this earlier
perhaps around D monetization when we
didn't have that data would have been
useful then Sanjay Jha off the Congress
is joining us Sanjay Jha go ahead please
Oh fair I think the the first point I
wish to make is that a government is
elected and a government is expected to
deliver five full budgets but I think it
was politically immoral unethical and
unprincipled on the part of the BJP or
the NDA to announce not this was not an
interim budget this was like a full
budget I mean he talked about tax
amendments he talked about soaps to the
farmers so clearly I would say breaking
with what ought to have been a proper
parliamentary protocol was to let the
new government take the calls that this
government in is
critical desperation has tried to place
on electoral tactic but the fact of the
matter is let's take the example of
farmers the farmers today have been
ravaged over the last five years if you
take the data of the amount that they
are going to give to every household of
eighteen thousand rupees it's a
laughable number you are talking about
actually assuming one household as four
people four rupees per day per person so
I think this is making a mockery of the
entire farming community to criticize so
when Rahul Gandhi promised that he would
do a basic income to every poor
household you give us no details
whatsoever of what that income will be
what households will get covered how
often will they get paid so it's very
easy here for you to criticize but when
we want you to look at your plan the
Congress give us no details at all and
so you left us then we are assuming that
you would you want us to believe you
sell a plan that has no outline at all
how is this different well let me answer
your faith
the truth is that the truth is than the
minimum income guarantee that will be
extended to all the poor in India is oh
is is going to be announced when we
formally put it up in the public domain
when mr. Gandhi puts the manifesto for a
very frank and a public debate and is
going to happen very very shortly oh you
don't have to wait too long but the
point that I wish to make our budgets
for that are significantly higher we
believe this is nothing but synthetic
tokenism because at the end of the day
this is going to make no difference to
the life of a farmer I mean you have led
them down an MSP as somebody rightly
pointed out they have mr. Modi and mr.
Goyal are going to town saying that we
are going to relieve rural distress you
have used the wrong formulas is si -
it's not a 2 + FL I don't want to get
into the technicalities but they are
brazenly misleading the farming
community where is a doubling of farm
income that our own Jaitley talked about
it's not gonna happen because
agriculture is growing at around 2.5
percent so the bottom line is you have
led them down as far as the middle class
is concerned please find out as to when
will this taxable income relief come
into play
have looked at some of the fine print is
gonna come into play in 2020 so what
what exactly was preschool doing you
need to ask him that question and I
think you have taken the middle class
for a jolly ride the middle class by the
way has paid almost 16 lakh crores in
excise duties on oil products when the
oil prices had crashed what happened to
all that money so end of day to give a
relief at the end of five years on the
first slab and that 2-under taxable
income only up to five lakhs is frankly
something nothing but it was let me take
this has actually failed to deliver all
the fundamentals yes
so Vivek we heard we've been listening
to answers from the BJP spokespeople and
we must be if we're going to be
completely fair they're in a difficult
position to that yeah I mean they really
do not have the answer so and and what
we need to very communicate as
journalists to and all three of us are
journalists to our audience today is yes
announcements were made but there's no
clarity a this government perhaps
shouldn't have been making announcements
for a mandate that wasn't theirs even so
there's no clarity on how any of this
would be implemented and the audience
should know that yes and I think the
government has done that because they're
perhaps secure in the fact that most
voters out there there are people who
really make a difference to literal
outcomes either don't care about data or
don't understand that so obfuscation is
easy to do you can use label headlines
you can use label terms you will say oh
we will remove poverty or we will do
this we will do but there is no
authentication or backing of that I
think both sides and it's not just about
the BJP alone in it I think politics is
now about selling pipe dreams whether
those my dreams are practical or not the
Congress is equally guilty of doing that
the minimum income guarantee scheme when
he said we will identify the poor we
don't have data on the poor it's as
simple as that
and just like the djpick unproduced it
neither can the Congress there is there
is a fundamental problem that we have
that there is now a competitive for the
game going on between selling pipe dream
because every government or every
political party wants to sell a pipe
dream unfortunately we have a
demographic respond to that where yes
where it is difficult for an ordinary
person to actually understand
that there is very little data or
information to substantiate whatever
promises have been made either in the
budget or out of it you know yesterday
on the show we called out a list of data
reports from the government that
actually have not been submitted some
for two years some for four years and
there are two things one is if you're
going to withhold data that's
uncomfortable because it you don't you
don't believe that it looks good you
know for publicity that's one thing but
the reason why government actually
accumulates statistics and data is
because that's how you base your
decisions so now you're making decisions
for example on doubling income and on
farmers whereas the agriculture wages
report has not been submitted for four
years yes so it basically goes back to
the point I made about you know the
government essentially killing its NSSO
data yesterday so an SSO is one of the
most important inputs into the GDP so if
you don't trust NSSO data you know what
do you really trust and the same with
unemployment I mean the Labor Bureau
used to put out these and well
employment unemployment numbers and the
2016-17 report was held back because it
was inconvenient for the government and
now we are holding back the the
unemployment report that came out
yesterday so I guess I just wanted to
make you know a simple point you know I
think the BGP would have been much
better off by simply depositing money
into John Donne accounts and you know
finishing the whole thing rather than
putting on this giant tag don't you do
this is this a formalization of money
being handed out before elections we
don't you just happen in that will not
go before elections money would be
distributed you've now bypassed the
Election Commission and found a way to
do it officially so the one unusual
thing that has happened and that's a
giveaway is that in this scheme for
farmers 20,000 crore has been allocated
for this quarter itself and they have
said so publicly that this will start
happening as of tomorrow I don't know
how that's going to happen but they're
almost claiming because they are the and
that's why it's in three installments
because they are desperate to ensure
that the first installment of 2000
actually reaches the account because
that's when people start feeling
something has happened whether it is
practical or not it still left to be
seen but they're desperate but the price
of a vote is 2,000 rupees or not is left
to be signed how much people actually
get that I mean that's another Himanshu
here's the other point we must note you
know when earlier when when politicians
would hand out money before elections
this would come from party funding it's
coming now in this case from our tax
money this is a dangerous precedent I
think it is it is and I think there are
consequences of this which we are not as
of now imagining but these are very very
serious consequences let me let me tell
you that this government is also a
government for the last four years which
has seen real investment in agriculture
decline and that's a fact that is coming
out from the National Accounts data this
is a government which has neglected
agriculture sector over the years and at
the end of it when your term is ending
you are distributing this money and it
is coming at a cost
remember already or 1.9 lakh crores have
been logged in for loan waivers and that
has impacted the investment at the state
levels so there's investment at the
state level in agriculture in other
sectors has also gone down now look at
this year's budget the numbers that have
been presented there's a massive
increase in revenue expenditure but
capital expenditure has remained
stagnant you at a time in the economies
in crisis the rural economy is suffering
from a demand depression and you are
basically coming to a situation where
you want to give money to the poor
people and you want to give money to the
rural areas but it is at the cost where
you are ignoring the structural problems
so you can't actually be having this
every year and you can't basically be
trying to resolve the problem of
agrarian crisis or the rural crisis
where the wage growths have slumped by
simply handing out money this is
something which is not going to end in
one year or two years so and this is
happening at the cost of ignoring the
structural problems so there is no
investment happening there is no way the
basic infrastructure is being created
last year the budget that was allocated
for rural housing rural roads both have
been not spent so you are not spending
on basic rural infrastructure and then
you are claiming that I am going to
create improve the rural economy by
giving money to the
people you can't do that you have to
create those things and if that is the
income transfer is coming at the cost of
those ones expenditure and health
expenditure and education expenditure on
NRI GA if it is coming at that cause
then this is I think the this is not
something which is going to be
sustainable for long run and in a very
bad competitive politics where parties
are competing as to who can give more so
I I really have a problem with this
whole approach of income transfer at the
cost of not doing substantial
investments or spending money on the
basic necessities or basic services
which are required I am fine with the
giving cash transfers for the elderly
for disabled those who are marginalized
but and for those people who are able to
earn were willing to work income like
the farmers or people are more casual
workers the government should create
infrastructure and enable them to earn
more income rather than simply giving
them money
so the whole philosophy itself is
something which is flawed yes yes I have

Haga Santa please respond to what
Vanetta body said when he was speaking
when he said even the Congress doesn't
cannot produce data on on poor on the
definition of for and how you will reach
all of these people so how are you
making these announcements or these
promises right now Oh Phillip
we have already done a lot of homework
on this already targeting the households
yes I agree with him it's a challenge
which is why a lot of people use
universal basic income because you just
give it to everybody but that's not we
don't have that kind of unlimited
resources
but what we have definitely discovered
during our study is that you have to
rationalize some subsidies it doesn't
mean that the subsidies will be removed
there is enough scope to actually
improve even your revenue and therefore
it's a fine play between income and
expenditure and the way you actually
target the scheme the way we're looking
at at edit PHA is very simple you define
a certain standard minimum income and
you make sure that anybody who goes
below that is made up for that deficit
and I can tell you this for a fact India
has the resources actually giving cash
transfers in a great number of ways will
make our system a lot more efficient and
you have you know we started direct
benefits transfer you do have add hard
and these can be used in a very I would
say maybe completely thrown out well let
me tell you let me tell you on your
program I have said that a hundred times
you can pull out the video the Congress
Party's belief has always been the same
God was only meant for one purpose is
for welfare distribution services and
that's what we are consistent with let
me let me actually bite the bullet on
you on on your question the Congress
party will make sure that unlike the
party janta party it will not be made
mandatory for the common man for
telephones and banking services and
passports and various other things that
can make it recordin or part of the
surveillance state well let me be very
clear on that well I'm glad you're very
clear on that
Sanjay Jha because actually we've got
order and I don't believe either the BJP
or the Congress has much choice in that
but I'm just coming back to the fact
that why let me tell you no no no no no
no no excuse me excuse me excuse me the
supreme court order was violated by the
BJP the BJP actually violated that as
they continue to do so if you have been
reading recent reports the BJP is back
in reality yes
but we are being violated which Marvel
is responding to in fact you know sanjay
basically talked about rationalizing
subsidies is a very very interesting
area now what do you rationalize do you
cut fertilizer subsidy and be labeled
aunty farmer or do you cut food
subsidies if you cut food subsidies then
there is this whole infrastructure of
food Corporation of India FCI
if CI buying wheat at MSP rice at MSP
from the farmers then selling it to the
PDS yes so do you stop that I mean these
are very tricky questions and you know
you need a very strong-willed leader and
an administration to push this through
and Congress and their socialist past I
mean I'm not sure as to completely
honest the Congress while they have made
this one big announcement that we will
do basic income and no details
whatsoever what is your solution for
farmers you have no solution you've come
back to Rajasthan in Chhattisgarh Madhya
Pradesh farm loan makers all over again
you have not I mean it's almost like
nobody's bothered to read this
swaminathan Commission report it's all
there but you don't have new solutions
you don't have new answers you have a
party leader who makes statements about
how everybody's talking about a new
India what is this new India is this an
India where we have no research where we
don't bother to do our homework ever we
don't read reports so one quick thing
just before sends a response actually
you're right nobody has actually read
this have nothing committee report and
I'll tell you why they keep referring to
that report as if that was the only
thing in the report was MSP it wasn't
there are many many more things in that
report which has been gathering dust for
the last 12 years now yes so in that
sense both sides have equally guilty of
not following was they themselves breach
that report is a comprehensive report on
the problem of the Indian agriculture
system it's not just about a miss P
before you before we go back to Sanjay
one is just point out one thing they
make when the Oxfam report came out
about the difference that was the
widening gap between rich and poor
and again government machinery plus
trolls on Twitter spent or worked
overtime
rubbishing that reported saying that it
was not reliable but before I go there
that the report actually at the end of
that reports made three or four
suggestions to the Government of India
improve your health care
which is your public health care that
should be for free people will save
money if they don't have to spend money
on health care improve your supply of
water so that women don't have to spend
time and money accessing water so it
actually said health care education very
specific things my only point he and I'm
not saying we need to listen to Oxfam my
point is there are there is a lot of
work to be done on the ground in our
country and throwing lollipops at people
every time we do it we lose
opportunities to actually solve problems
which is true and you're talking about
inequality also I mean we may buy the
Oxfam report or not but there is data
which shows that per capita income of
Bihar is around thirty eight thousand
five hundred rupees the per capita
income of Delhi is three lakh twenty
nine thousand the per capita income of
Goa is close to four lakhs there is
inequality for you I mean you don't have
to go to Oxfam to check inequality so
and you know and one more point I wanted
to make you know talking about all the
reports that the government Commission's
and the experts right you know believe
me if we started reading those reports
and if we implemented even one-fourth of
what they suggest India would be a much
better country so politicians just
Commission reports and you know which is
where it all ends so we have run out of
time and we're simply going to leave it
here you will see banner headlines on
your newspapers tomorrow morning what
you must remember is that these are big
promises these are promises that are
being made a few months before elections
and we don't have any answers and we've
tried already we don't have answers of
how these promises will be fulfilled if
they will be fulfilled at all and what
it's going to cost where the money is
going to come from we don't have those
answers so they're great promises but
can you implement them can't even tell
us that right now so while you read your
paper in the morning have that in mind
when you decide to vote remember to only
believe those promises that can actually
back me back to my data and can give you
a road map on how they're going to be
implemented we're going to leave it
there here on the urban debates and
before we wrap up our colleague got in
touch with their main the Pradhan who
had similarly sort of jingoistic things
to say about the
what is that mean the pradhan commenting
on the budget announcement in terms of

starring Taylor Russell Logan Miller J
Ellis Tyler Labine Deborah Ann Woll and
Nick Madonna is directed by Adam Robert
Earl who also directed insidious the
Laskey and the taking of Debra Logan the
story is pretty much described in the
title six strangers received mysterious
invitations to an escape room only this
isn't a fun game here winning or losing
is a matter of life and death they all
need to work together to get out alive
now the escape room concept is pretty
well known you are trapped in a room and
the only way out is to solve riddles and
clues
similarly this sub-genre is also quite
well known we've seen it before in the
saw series and the concept goes back
even further to 1997 with a Canadian
film cube escape room starts off well
enough we're introduced to a couple of
the characters and we see how they land
up here we also discover the other
players in the game and see how they fit
into this dire situation the
performances are quite decent although
some characters get on your nerves for
different reasons that's just the way
they've been written so it's no fault of
the actors per se
Taylor Russell plays Zoe Davis a
brilliant college student who is an
introvert JLS plays Jason Walker are
successful and cocky chap who thinks
he's better than everyone else
Deborah Ann Woll plays Amanda hopper who
turned out to be my favorite character
she has a huge role to play in one of
the rooms which was also the most
nail-biting of them all now the momentum
ramps up until this particular room
approximately midway through the film
but it takes a sharp downturn from this
point on there might be a couple of
surprises but whatever investment is
made into the proceedings
stunningly fails towards the last lap
and particularly in the climax that's
when it becomes apparent that the
interesting reason behind why all these
changes are forced to work together
hadn't been thought through well enough
in the writers room it's as if the
script itself is stuck in an escape room
with no way out
director Adam Robert Earl tries to
hustle this concept with a brand new
packaging but soon Weston and dies along
with any interest you had in the first
half I'm going with three stars for
escape room I'm sure there will be ample
movie goers will enjoy the thrills for
the most part but it'll be hard for
anyone to escape all the sub genre
tropes that eventually drag the film
down as it squanders its initial setup
have you watched cube do yourself a
favor hunted down and watch it whenever
you can you see the original concept for
escape room in action and done in an
exciting even thought-provoking way also

biography drama starring Saoirse Ronan
Margot Robbie Guy Pearce David Tennant
Jack Loudoun and Ismael Cruz Cordova it
is directed by a Josie Rourke feminist
said in the 16th century when Mary
Stewart played by Saoirse Ronan returns
to a native Scotland to reclaim her
right to the throne as she attempts to
overthrow her cousin Elizabeth the first
the Queen of England played by Margot
Robbie
if you thought Game of Thrones was
complex well as the saying goes the
truth is indeed stranger than fiction
Mary Stewart and Queen Elizabeth the
first were cousins but that's pretty
much where their connections end Queen
Elizabeth was a protestin unmarried and
childless while Queen Mary was a
Catholic now keep in mind that the 16th
century was when the animosity between
Protestants and Catholics ran beep to
say the least so naturally as seen in
the film Mary is immediately perceived
as a threat to Elizabeth's placed on the
throne this leads to a series of
dangerous scheming in both courts as the
two strong-willed women battled their
way through manipulative advisors as
they take each other on social Ronan is
an immediate standout the young actress
gives a passionate performance as the
Queen of Scotland with a fierce
on-screen presence that demands your
attention Margot Robbie is no less
impactful as a somewhat erratic and
unparallel is with she disappears under
layers of makeup which is symbolic and
how it's hard to tell Elizabeth's true
intentions she often is between
vulnerable and steadfast although one
wonders if that is by design or due to
the lack of clarity in how a character
is defined the supporting cast is pretty
solid too with Guy Pearce and David
Tennant
on Elizabeth's side of the border
respectively playing William Cecile and
John Knox with convincingly sinister
undertones in Mary's coat Lord Daniel
played by Jack Loudon and smell cruise
Cordova's David Rizzio are the most
memorable characters their interplay
drives a majority of the plot which
leads to the film's pivotal point up a
little at that point though the Trinity
runs between being mildly interesting to
downright drab as director Josie rogue
focuses on putting all the pieces in
motion for the eventual showdown between
Mary Ann Elizabeth while historically
debatable because the two allegedly
never met seeing Margot Robbie and Sasha
run and confront each other is magnetic
equally mesmerizing is the attention
given to the
costume and set design to the point of
being distracting in the best way
possible
likewise John Matheson cinematography
elegantly captures Scotland's stunning
vistas in the end the film's intended
impact is severely hampered by clunky
pacing and a convoluted plot that fails
to engage I'm going to three stars from
Mary Queen of Scots the famous are a
timely premise with a lot to say about
toxic masculinity and women empowerment
but never gets around to it
despite its brief sparks of brilliance
that quickly die out before catching

well I haven't been this excited to
speak to someone in the studio for a
very very long time
this is someone I've admired for many
many years he's been called several
names a millionaire politician socialite
a best-selling author for some time a
prison inmate as well but just for the
next half hour my guest in the studio
mr. Jeffrey Archer thank you so much for
making time - thank you I only made time
because I set out from my hotel four and
a half days ago to try and get here at
on time allow me to apologize on behalf
of the city and the traffic well
anything else you might have encountered
on your way well I I'm just a little bit
surprised how you teach your young
people in driving I mean do you actually
instruct them to have the white line
going down the middle of the car like
airline pilots oh if you go fast enough
you might take off oh but what about why
do you always have the tractors on the
outside lane and yesterday when I was in
Delhi I was overtaken by a camel so this
is how it works the guy who sells the
fruit is on the outside and then there's
the parking is the illegal parking and
then there's the tractor and the cow you
find your way through that it's an
obstacle it makes it exciting yes you
did and I must tell you that where we
are right now in our studio is a
particularly difficult part of this
access that's a relief to know well you
were in Delhi and you were in Jaipur
you've been travelling yes
Jaipur was wonderful I didn't type or
festival 7500 people came to hear me
speak that was an unbelievable
experience are you surprised were you
surprised yes I was you once you
shattered shattered you you see this
mass of human beings and you think wow
can they all have read the book then
it's unbelievable they would have not
all of them would have bought the non
pirated copies well I read it
even if they your I had I my man in the
hotel taking care of me super guy said
would I sign the book and I say yes of
course and who and he gave me a girl
than him I said he said that's my sister
I said fine nice present for you no no

sister gets it second I get it third and
then I decide who to give it to I said
well that doesn't help me and he said on
average ten people are average ten
people in Britain 2.3 in America 2.4 in
India ten people have read a book that's
fantastic and you know there's there's
so much conversation now about the fact
that nobody reads anymore but do you
believe that no my figures are up
overall no that's not true in India in
particular they still love books yes see
the kindle hasn't taken off yeah
whereas in England it's 40% and in
America it's 42% here it's still only 2%
and because you love books
in fact I became very aware of this when
I was coming from the airport and a
charming little boy tapped on my window
with the pile of books and said would
you like the latest Geoffrey aren't you
and I said I am the latest Jeffrey
Archer you should put the picture on the
back of the right right right right well
it's interesting you pick that one up
yes it's cause that's the latest Jeffrey
Archer
no yes the first of the Clifton
Chronicles oh yes no that is the latest
what's there yes
I'm signing autographs in a school and
there's a boy standing there who I can
hardly see so I said are you there yes
I'm here
how old are you eight I said eight and
he'd already read only time will tell
at the age of eight and now this is the
new generation of Indians so when you
say are they reading they're gonna take
over the world
don't get yourself at eight year old
he's gonna take over the world but it's
fantastic the influence that you've had
on young young people and I was having a
conversation we have a very young team
and they're all lined up right now to
you know to speak to you when we're done
with this
conversation and we've all read your
books because our parents were reading
the books when they were done it's the
same thing so do you know walk in spend
our summers reading those books so we've
we started fairly early because there
was easy access to the live and it's
very flattering because it's now I'm so
old that it's grandparents parents and
children yes you don't expect to survive
that long I mean Cain and Abel has B
it's on it's hundred and twenty fourth
reprint in a hundred million people have
read it and it could have died I don't
know six weeks after publication but it
just goes on yes and we are very
grateful to the Indian people well may I
just say was fantastic it was a
brilliant brilliant book when you wrote
it did you did you know that this is
fantastic I've done such a good job it
was very good question
I sold it to the United States yes for
3.2 million 40 years ago which should
have woken me up because I was penniless
at the time but I was still nervous I
was absolutely nervous and then a lady
said you know this book is going to last
the hundred years I still didn't believe
it and it didn't get on the best sellers
list in the first week because no one
had ever heard of me in America and it
didn't on the second week and then in
the third week I got two minutes on the
Larry King show Wow and he was meant to
be interviewing straight after me dr.
Henry Kissinger and he was linked up in
Paris to do dr. Henry Kissinger and I've
been told firmly I would have two
minutes which we all know on television
is a long time yes and dr. Henry
Kissinger would have 28 minutes and
Larry King said well describe describe
Cain and Abel please Jeffry clearly
hadn't read a word and I said what Cain
and Abel story of two men both born on
the same day one with everything one
with nothing they only meet once and it
changes their whole lives I thought
you're now about to be kicked off we
have got it over and I said Cain and
Abel so I was very pleased with myself
he said tell me a bit more Jeffrey so I
described the two men and how I drew
this one and I realized they couldn't
get through
[Laughter]
minutes on the Larry it went to number
one the next week and sometimes you need
a bit of luck yes and the power of
television ladies and gentlemen when I
was on the breakfast show in New York
and knew nothing and was naive and I
could sue again that the book was in
pristine condition and no one had ever
even touched it the man who was
interviewing me and he was looking there
and he said toss saute your nose they'd
sent me over on the Concorde because
they wanted to improve how important I
was and he looked at his notes and he
looked at me and I thought he hasn't
read the book and he said is it you I
hear you came over I area came over on
the Concorde and I said yes that's quite
right this is and I was on my slot the
red light was on this is my chance so I
said yes Concorde is a plane that the
British built it flies twice the height
of any plane in the history of man it
flies twice the speed of any plane in
the history of man you can have
breakfast in London you and have
breakfast in New York because you've
flown on the greatest plane on earth and
I'm proud to be British and tell you
this and he said been lovely having you
on this do you my publishers were not
pleased do you miss the Concorde well
it's funny you should say that in a
moment of seriousness it's the first
time almost in history that we've gone
back isn't it it's the last time it got
stopped and we're now going slower
planes yes it was beautiful oh I love so
beautiful I loved it yes you're right it
was physically beautiful but it just
getting to New York in under four hours
was under three hours a few minutes he
was completely ridiculously expensive
but well we we told our publishers
that's what we wanted but we could use
it with the traffic here are you come on
it's a tractor camel car Concorde
helicopter helicopter we do we do but if
you get your Metro in London the metro
what we call the underground works very
well yes and I hope when you get that
it'll be we do I mean a lot of the
you saw outside the offices because
there's a metro coming up so it's
temporary pain they should try to finish
by the time I got here we will call them
yes we will have a strongly worded
letter
well let's also talk about some of the
other things since we were talking about
Concord was British there was so many
your sort of cars and ideas that were
British that perhaps are not doing as
well anymore
do you as an Englishman feel a little
you know that maybe that some of that is
waning
brexit and everything that's going on
right course but we had a great history
and we've had the British had great
achievements yes and I am one of those
who looks upon certain things I see in
India with great pride yes I had the
honour at a very as a child to work with
Margaret Thatcher and with Mountbatten
with Lord Mountbatten so I have a
feeling and love of India early on and I
came here for the first time 40 years
ago and it's changed changed beyond
recognition and the biggest change has
been women when I first came 40 years
ago they all wore forgive me there's a
photograph of you with manga touch it's
a great lady I'm very proud to work with
her lemon yes 11 years with her very
close association with my wife as well
because Mary is a suppose a scientist is
a scientist Mary taught chemistry at
Oxford yes and Margaret Thatcher had
been an undergraduate yes and read
chemistry at Oxford so they became good
friends in their own right and my wife
which will please the women watching
this program went on to be chairman of
Cambridge University's hospital is now
chairman of the Science Museum there she
is god bless ER now chairman of the
Science Museum and the Queen has made
her a dame
she's now Damon Mary so because so women
watching yes your turn
take you back to us Oh forgive me I
interrupted you he was saying nothing
that has changed the most I did
apologize
you said the thing that's changed most
in India is the women and India in India
yes I went to school yesterday mm-hmm
1,400 children came to hear me speak I
was introduced by a 16 year old girl the
voter thanks was done by a girl the
presentation was done by a girl
the signing line was done by a girl
while 700 pathetic boys looked on and
watched they're going to take over I was
looking it was happening in front of my
eyes and I said rather casually to the
head girl as I left I hope you'll be
going to university and she said I'm
going to some Ann's College Oxford and
so I was properly put in my place but
actually actually I'm totally another
subject yes where I was truly put in my
place yesterday I hadn't thought of
admitting this on television I was in my
hotel and I got in lift charming man
about my own age stopped me and said how
nice to meet you Lord our journey shook
hands and they said I love your country
I'd say do you come here he said well I
was educated at Cambridge and this is
old man a man of 70 he said I was
educated at Cambridge and I said where
were you educated he said I read
mathematics at trinity cambridge I said
what and what an honor and yes fifty
years ago that must have been a fairly
remarkable said no no he said Trinity
read your exam papers they don't look at
the color of your skin
oh yes and we shook hands I thought that
was a great line that is that is
beautiful and you're so right about the
fact that the fortunes of Indian women
have changed drastically I hope so
50 years and it's it's happening around
the world as well as in Africa here I
have 12 year old on stage with me a
couple of weeks ago she gets up on stage
and she's written a book already at 12 I
I picked right at the or who's written
the book up goes Isaac come on said I'm
12 and she bought up a little book yes
and she stood by me and I said well
you're on your second book yes she said
I'm on my second book and I said how's
that going very well she said I shall be
selling more copies so I'm keeping in
touch with her yes this is not uncommon
yes there is a generation of young women
now who are going to come through and
run this country and this country will
be better for it
Chella well you know you said something
very interesting before we sat down you
said you hand write everything everyone
no cell phone tablet no my wife uses
these wonderful things over here the
press but if she can she's got them all
she's got everything I've got I have I
rise at 6:00 in the morning
yes I work from 6:00 until 8:00 take it
to our break 10:00 until 12:00 take a
two-hour break 4 until at 2:00 until
4:00 take a two-hour break
six until eight in bed by 9:30 hand
write every word first draft usually
takes all five weeks and this draft of
the latest book this took this is the
what you have on your desk here is the
14th draft every one and written I wish
there was a hard work and it's
discipline tremendous discipline yes but
I say to girls a lot of girls come to
see me young girls in India come to see
me and say I want to be a writer
Geoffrey what should I do next I say go
to the ballet they said what I say go to
the ballet you want me to go to the bat
why because I want you to sit in the
audience I want you to see the prima
ballerina yes and think how many hours
she has spent becoming the prima
ballerina and I want you to look behind
and look at the chorus and think how
many hours they've spent just being the
chorus then I want you to think about
the thousands of girls who dream about
being in the chorus talent is useful but
you've got to be willing to work very
hard indeed and it's no different for an
author it doesn't matter if you play the
violin you're a countertenor role or a
ballet dancer or an author
it's damned hard work yes if you have a
god-given talent yes if you're a
storyteller you're lucky but if you're
not willing to put the work in nothing
will happen so I see you throw in the
notes away yes I have had all these
notes the notes yeah I had a literature
professor in college who told me that
the secret to good writing is rewriting
you can never be satisfied you actually
are never said so it's never done and
you know every writer could if I had to
do this you probably want to make some
changes again but you have to just keep
working at it well Mary says if I went
into a shop and saw one of my books and
was allowed to read it I would be
turning the pages and correct it
correctly you say you're quite right
it's but fourteen real how do you know
when your heads you win how do you know
when it's when it's good enough it's a
jolly good question I think when you're
down to a comma here a word there a
sentence every 20 pages it's time to
hand it over and let someone else read
it I think you're there but while you're
still writing on every page no no you go
on
it's the pause do you write out a
structure first no you don't no I do not
that you're quite right there are people
who put up yes no no now you take this
one for example I had read hedgy one I
had read : Powell's life yes
biography yes called called what about
him about the great man and I read that
his mother who lived in Jamaica wanted a
better life and she decided I have to go
to Britain or I have to go to America
which shall I do and she chose the
United States and kerlun Powell was born
in Harlem and not in Hackney and so he
became the Secretary of State yes
for the United States of America I
wondered if he had gone to Britain who
would he what would have happened you
see I didn't think in those days he
could have become a British Army officer
I don't think he could have become in
fact I know he couldn't head of the
Armed Forces I don't think he could have
become foreign secretary because he was
black from Jamaica but thirty years
later the world has moved on we now have
in England a Home Secretary Sajid Javid
a dear friend who is the Pakistani and
his opposite number the shadow home
secretary is the first black woman MP so
it's changed so I thought I'll take this
one stage further I'll take a Russian
boy aged 16 very bright mm-hmm he has to
escape from Russia because his father's
been killed by the KGB and his mother
has to decide shall I go to Britain yes
or shall I go to America and I decided
I'll be very courageous I'll do both the
same boy will land in Britain and you'll
follow one story the same boy and he'll
be Alex he's Alexander but he'll be Alex
when he's in brescia when he's a Brit
and Alex when he's in America so you'll
follow two stories are exactly the same
child arriving in different cities yes
experiencing different things going in
different directions but it's the same
child and it what's happened when it
comes
yes okay so uh you are you've always
been a big fan of the crate mad about
cricket yes my life begun really with
the noir puppet OD we were all fit
together and he was a dear friend his
death was very sad for me he very kind
to me whenever I came to India he threw
parties for me and was very kind and I
loved him because when he lost his eye
it was so brave to battle on and then
your next Indian captain that I got to
know what no well was Farouk engineer
mm-hmm became a dear friend and since
then I've met crumbly
and become a friend of session 10
daugher and I quite recently met curly
and they're all rubbish they're all
completely I mean
England has got the best team in the
world I say that so but we're not cool
II like it he may be the best person
I've ever seen
the ICC Awards he swept all of them is
never well who is surprised there
doesn't seem to be one level at which he
can't give you 60 any day of the week
and a hundred every three matches and
he's a fierce competitor to I doesn't
like losing that one does he and the
comments he made about Australia when he
came back from his victory in Australia
managed to hit the front pages in
England yes yeah a gentlemen's game as
it used to be back in back in the face
well so the six let's go back and take
that at two levels yes one when the
Australians were when the Indians were
in Australia at a time before and
cumberly was captain what a gentleman in
was and how well he behaved no marks for
mister ponting and the way he behaved
yes
India came out of that with greater
dignity and I'd like to say well I'm on
this show and got the opportunity to
berate you I hate 2020 you know I can
tolerate just about one day cricket
cricket is a Test match between two
great nations and the complete proof of
this was when India played Australia and
Australia made the Indians follow-on yes
and VVS Laxman and Rowell Dravid yes
that is through the day and the
Australians went back in and lost the
match that is cricket
that's SS cricket and so when you said
when we were off the air I hear you love
growled rabid what a beautiful stroke
player but he was a Test cricket oh yes
who doesn't love Rahul Dravid charming
and delightful man and of course I'm
influenced by how many of their wives
read the book but
nevertheless no I think you probably are
the best team in the world at the moment
yes if the final in England in the
one-day game is between England and
India as it's in England that could be
very interesting indeed and can switch
because you have two or three of the
greatest batsmen on earth if they have
an off day anyone has an off day so I
hope that will be the final I've got
tickets but I hope it'll be the final
have you heard of a young cricketer
called Joe fryer whose name's yes I have
bola and may well get in the England
team yes absolutely
so he's why I wanted to captain the
inside failures of my life is that I did
not captain the England cricket side but
I loved the game I'm passionately
devoted to it I want to ask you right
now for advice for people who hope to be
writers you did say of course
hard-working discipline where do we look
use the word play you said writers yes
if you're well-read and well educated
you can be a writer yes I am a writer
but first and foremost I'm a storyteller
yes I tell stories that begin once a
time and I want you to turn the page
that is a god-given gift writing is part
of education so to those people I would
say read the classics keep reading all
the time don't be in a hurry
I wrote Cain and Abel when I was 38
years old my first book I wrote at the
age of not a penny more not a penny less
yes at 36 and I get these youngsters of
12 coming up saying I want to write the
great Indian novel take your home down
write short stories right does it have
to come from life experience you have to
live enough before you're able to write
it helps it certainly helps I met
interesting people I've had an
interesting life that certainly helps
but I say to young people don't worry
about that I mean the great RK Narayan
could write about a tax collector in a
small village yes who was having trouble
with his wife and you thought this is
boring until he started reading yes and
you couldn't stop turning the page
because he made the whole thing I'm
alive
and that's our key narayan at this
remarkable gift to do that so I say to
young people Arcana Ryan rather than the
Nobel Prize winners what do you think of
all of the the new fantasy fiction Game
of Thrones dragons elves that sort of
thing does it I don't understand it okay
I apologize all these amazing things
that sell millions of books I'm not
complaining because it's a good thing
that people are reading yes but count me
out I write a simple story that begins
once upon a time and hope you will turn
your view on Harry Potter Oh brilliant
she read it if she's oh yeah she's
genius and one of the great writers of
all time we only have one thing in
common
quite I my first book was turned down by
16 publishers her first book was turned
down by 18 publishers so we I say that
because you were talking about the young
don't get depressed
don't yes don't give in because someone
writes and says oh I don't think this is
quite what we're looking for in our
distinguished house Buncombe get on with
what you do and don't give in because in
the end it isn't publishers who decide
yes it isn't critics who decide it's the
public in this side who will be read and
Harry Potter that was public decide the
definition as the children yes not even
the public yes children decided so when
you know you have a story when you have
done 16 drafts and you've now arrived at
what you think is perhaps the closest to
perfection that you can get and there
are publishers saying no there's this
temptation of maybe this is not the
story the thing people are reading right
now don't do with vampires okay any of
those things do what you do best if your
mother is a hairdresser and you go to
work every morning in a television
studio riding a bicycle right about that
it never worried arcane Orion write
about what you feel you know about
the reader will then know oh yeah of
course he knows what she she knows what
they're talking about don't do vampires
because vampires are in there are no
vampires in heads you win do you want to
do like a close-up for the camera us we
should close up to the camera estimated
page they miss it there just in case you
miss it and we're out of time Oh Lucas
how far ever that's very kind and thank
you very much very professionally on the
show what a pleasure
I saw your picture when I came in I saw
I thought she looks frightening she'll
tear me apart no Ben lovely being on the
show it has been we have more
conversations and more opportunities
that's very kind thank you thank you

to you thank you for your time you again
the other we're talking about missing
statistics and the government's
announces now announcements I can see on
other channels that there's apparently
what they're quoting is internal buzz
about income guarantee that's going to
come one should if the statistics is not
available with the government and
remember statistics is there it's
created data is created so the
government can make decisions not to
make the government look good are you
worried about the decision making
process right now with the motives
behind the decision making process right
now
look we the Democratic norm is that you
are given power for five years you can
present five budgets this government has
presented five full budgets now to wish
to present a sixth budget a full-fledged
six budget is simply not on to my mind
that's not part of Democratic convention
this should be just a vote on account
what the government ought to do is to
present a full-fledged outcome budget an
outcome budget which has been going on
for some time that's an exercise for
last seven eight years never taken quite
seriously at the end of the five years
this government should tell me what
exactly have they achieved in five years
we were talking about statistics the one
statistics I want and say if you can
help me get it from anyone who
represents BJP the minister or anyone
from the ETI Oh anyone from the ministry
the simple statistics is this this
government promised that farmers income
will be doubled in six years yes three
years have passed since then
can anyone please tell me how much has
the income of farmers gone up in the
last three years has it gone up by 40
percent 50 percent 30 percent what is
the statistics no one has an answer to
that so can we get at least this much
before we get income guarantee can they
at least tell me what is the status
right now to my mind this should not be
a budget for major declaration this
should be about preserving the
status quo and not causing any further
damage",True,en,719,3,22

the unemployment debate has flared up
again a report in the business standard
claims that unemployment is at its
highest in the last 45 years the report
is based on yet to be released data from
the periodic labor force survey
now according to the business standard
report the survey reveals that
unemployment rates are at a forty-five
year high in 2017 18 at 6.1 percent now
the report also says that labor force
participation as well
the rate that rate is lower than
previous years the report stoking
further controversy as it comes after
two National Statistics Commission
officials resigned the officials alleged
the government had stopped the release
of this data
despite the NSC approving of it the
opposition led by Congress president
Rahul Gandhi wasted no time in taking on
the government but the BJP retaliated
saying that Rahul Gandhi has a myopic
view of issues and the real data
actually shows a sharp increase in jobs
created in the last 15 months later
rubbishing allegations of data was
suppressed the Nidhi ioq vice-chairman
said the center did not release the
report as the data was still being
processed the DTI have also shot the
people but there was no job crisis in
the country this report that is being
cited is not yet finalized is a draft
report and the data that is being cited
is not yet to be is not yet been
finalized or approved by the government
but even as the debate rages on Miller
now asks is the government trying to
suppress unfavorable data let's debate
well a big question to ask right now is
if we piece together these things to
individuals of the statistics
organization that actually collaborates
statistics for the government of India
resigned from their jobs because they
said they submitted a report to the
government that was never released they
believe the government is suppressing
unfavorable reports post which the
report was leaked in the press and if
you consider it now if this is the real
report then there was every reason for
the government to want to suppress it
because it was damning evidence they
need the ioq in a hurried press
conference then came out to say that he
didn't agree with the comparison that
this was a five-year 2 5 your comparison
and we should ideally be doing a
quarter-to-quarter comparison so the
route journalists in the room quite
rightly asked so where is your
quarter-to-quarter comparison and the
neethiyin said it's not ready it's going
to take another month until we have all
five quarters or six quarters of data
together we can't give you a comparison
so you won't see this data until
mid-march at least which means wait for
another month don't take the current
data seriously if we've seen a pattern
so far and we have seen a pattern we
will tell you for the last two years
we've had no data whatsoever about
farmer suicides we've had no data
whatsoever about unemployment and I want
to remind you unemployment is different
from job creation and the government in
various senior members of ministries
have come out to say that all has
created jobs
uber has created jobs mudra has created
jobs creating jobs is different from
losing jobs when businesses shrink
people get fired
there's been no data on that either the
GDP data has been changed over and over
again to now the latest GDP data tells
us during the year of the monetization
in 2016-17 the revised GDP data stands
at eight point two percent the
government tells us today we grew at
eight point two percent during the
monetization there is a crisis of data
and is the government really suppressing
data that is unfavorable before this
election is that where the crisis comes
from remember we're not talking about
whether or not there are jobs we're
talking about why isn't there any data
it is your job as the government to
release timely data Rehman Malik for the
BJP a j2 our former Commerce Secretary
so much jars a special correspondent of
the business standard who wrote the
article will join us through the course
of this conversation Rahul Singh is a
policy analyst ke raghunathan with the
All India Manufacturers Association
professor come on Mithras now is a
political analyst and Rajiv Mishra as an
RTI activist I welcome all of you to
this conversation my first question is
to mr. Ajay - ah mr. - ah thank you for
joining us if you consider the
information coming out or come around
the National Statistics organisation is
there reason to believe the government
was perhaps attempting to suppress data
that was not favorable
but I need to go by circumstantial so
far as it's circumstantial evidence that
he's are to the erstwhile Planning
Commission which was there for 60 odd
years also do exactly the same thing
rather than overseas overseeing data
prepared by another ministry which is
the Ministry of Labour or that
department or the Ministry of statistics
yes see if nithya yoga also gets into
involved in processing of data or
finding loopholes in data which has
hitherto been independently prepared
questions like the one which has been
raised in the newspaper and which you
mentioned just now fit are bound to
arise and particularly with respect to
the labor data I think there is cause
for concern because earlier even before
the NSSO data or alongside the NSSO data
earlier we used to get data from the
Labor Bureau which is Houston Simla but
under the Ministry of Labour which used
to divide data about the organized
sector based on its fairly large samples
of Rutgers a sample which had been
refined over time the data released by
the Labor Bureau was stopped and
thereafter the NSSO data was first
required to be clinched I would say if
by the government before it could be put
out and it dead looks to me a bit of a
pattern in it I'm afraid because even
the GDP back series data it wasn't quite
released by the CSO or the Ministry
which is responsible for it the but it
had to be sent to the nithya yoga
the yoke then in a press conference
along and that was unprecedented
released the data it coming from with
the IO and finally I would say the very
fact that a policy maker a think-tank
also becoming a member of the National
Statistical Commission what this
government has done he has to put the
CEO of the next idea he has an ex
officio member of the National
Statistical Commission that again shows
that the government is concerned about
what kind of data comes out please put
out in the public domain in domain by
others I hope what I am saying is not
entirely correct because otherwise
questions about risk questions about
basing your policy on data which is
otherwise not independently prepared can
lead to skewness or distortion in the
policy-making yes and also can put
doubts in the minds of investors
particularly investors overseas and
those who multilateral and bilateral
institutions which finance Indian
development programs in a big way
because I should stop at that but I
would say there has also been delay in
putting out the FDI data for the last
several months by the D IPP iris trial
Department in which our eyes of mine
which otherwise would put out monthly
data if not monthly bimonthly but never
really have there been eight months when
the FDI data as compiled by the IPP
which later on the RBI may cover refine
and which finally aunt are used to
release on a comparable data put out
four other which are compiled for other
countries we haven't seen even the FDA
FDI data comes out of government for
several months now so this this concern
about the fact that data is either being
with her
or only released if favorable is perhaps
what most independent voices are
concerned about professor Cameron
attrition oi it's a professor of
political economy at JNU professors
right here's the thing GDP numbers have
also been revised and I remember it took
us a few minutes and a few my colleagues
a few minutes to realize what is going
on with the GDP numbers as they revise
right now
it makes the UPA government look even
worse it makes the NDA government look
even better but the thing that's perhaps
the most curious is that the revised GDP
number for the year of D monetization is
at 8.2 percent that's a shocking number
8.2 percent is very high is there a
problem with data in this government
professor joy look India monetization 16
was a 16% of the currency was left
actually within 14% 86 percent of the
high value notes over spiked were not
used so if in that kind of situation
when there's such a shortage of currency
huge shortage talk of some hike in the
economic statistics is just not
palatable or possible and and the same
it takes us even to what is happening
inside the economic mechanisms that show
the trends in the economy now if you
have I'll just stick to give astute
statistics yes if you have the
joblessness rate amongst rural male
youth as 93.9% in 2009 10 which goes to
seventeen point four percent in 2017 and
18 and similarly women whose joblessness
was 2004 zero five nine point five
percent of drive sharply into
thousand seventeen eighteen to twenty
seven point two percent so obviously
something is being shown here
it may not be absolutely correct but it
certainly is an indication of what's
happening and the serious thing is that
when you stop to members of the National
Statistical Commission including the
acting chairperson and they resign it is
actually a for a kind of censorship
where if you do not do what the people
in power do they may be punished for it
so I really think that there has to be
some kind of attempt to bring out data
regularly yes the point about FGM I was
raised ad so that we will actually know
what are we dealing with if we are not
sure of the data then we can't even be
sure of joblessness yes this would be
very bad for attempts to revive the
economy so so I think the basic problem
is that yes it is admitted that
unemployment rate as it as at a four
decade high but the question is what are
these measures being taken for example
the back series data for UPA after that
that data was shown to be quite high but
that doesn't seem to be in keeping with
what was argued elsewhere so I think
there's a serious problem in our
economic apparatus know about the use
and counter use of data which is
actually making it more difficult for us
to understand and move it in the
direction that we would like to move in
in fact let me just read this out this
is a list of missing statistics in our
country the NSSO annual employment or
unemployment report which comes out of
the ministry of statistics and programme
implementation the last submitted
2011-12 socio-economic caste census data
for OBC supposed to be released 2015 16
was last submitted twenty eleven and
twelve rapid survey for children from
the Ministry of Women and Child
Development last submitted 2013-14 for
interacting mess
in statistics as mr. Theodore pointed
out has not been submitted since June
last year crime in India will from the
NCR be 2016 was the last data prison
statistics National Crime Records Bureau
2015 was the last accidents in suicides
2015 was the last agricultural wages
data that is to come from the Ministry
of Agriculture 2015-16 was the last
piece of data and I want to bring in one
more voice before I go to Robin Malik
Rahul Singh is a policy analyst grousing
unfortunately every time when you've
been part of enough of these
conversations every time we have
conversations about jobs it's anecdotal
evidence about one office that you know
or one office that I know it's because
we don't have proper data how
desperately does India need its data
right now Rahul Singh
I think the creation of the Ministry of
his statistics is about data itself we
as a country need data points because we
need evidence that things are moving
which has been working primarily pretty
well in the financial market certain
indicators of economy but on the social
side I think we have done disaster and I
don't want to say only this government
or previous Congress or previous BJP I
think last 25 years we had a fantastic
chance to create a fantastic data
structure which we have failed so data
is a point you know you cannot go for
evidence-based policy unless there is a
data available and UN policies as long
as you are connecting with you and based
policies and governmental responding to
that you have to have data evidence
locations which we have been missing as
a policy structure of government itself
so as I said just not one government I
would blame for it I would blame all the
governments maybe in last four and five
attempts last 20 25 years because anyway
if you improve the data structure
statisticians would know that it will
take minimum of 10 years time to convert
that data into policymaking or
vice-versa so data is very important we
have started realizing that the kind of
data we are receiving from whichever
terminal you know
introducing their data in certain manner
some of this data I did a research 10
years back at our about finding data
error and believe me 10 years back I
compared three terminals of data on FDI
and I found different data sets this
paper is published so scientific city of
the published paper cannot be questioned
this is one of the most reputed journal
of the country so it's not the issue of
just publication it is also how coherent
is this data in different institution
which are government institution you
know Ministry of Finance said RBI and
something that you you shared with
unpaired this is the location and
decisions I'm talking about so create
the data structure right kind of
institutions and data structure if we
are having those in right place I think
authenticity is not going to be coercion
as far as methodology and sample issues
are concerned there can always be a
question and debate that an SSO is not
doing good or CMS data is better because
they have different ideology and they
keep believing and you can always
cushion the sample and methodology I
mean even even have a normal order it
can be questioned for that so issue is
not that issue is your data points are
authentic or not and bring in the latest
technological tools too if you want to
create authenticity of the data so that
it is not revised at the bureaucracy or
the political level yes in fact let me
bring in Robin Malik right now mr. Malik
you've heard everybody speak I have a
very straightforward question to you is
the government of India right now led by
the BJP suppressing data that is
unfavourable for you before an election
no way I would not say that it is
suppressing the data but yes I would
definitely say the data is that and the
parameters that we had been collecting
data that were probably not of the right
sample size of was not of the right way
to do it there were a lot of it the
issues which were there but let's kind
of get back to the basic word that we
you had taken out and that was jobs now
son you would you should remember the
speech that probably mr. Coble said
gave in the Rajya Sabha and he you know
went on to the same you know things
which were safe 2530 years back that
computers have taken away automation
have taken a let me please fail
let me let me please finish wanna have
this nursing job creation because that's
a very easy way to derail this
conversation we're not discussing the
merits of job no you said I'm not
jumping issues is the government
suppressing data you are you are you are
it's the government suppressing data
Somalia yeah there couple there a couple
of things which you should understand
which you are not ready to to talk about
and that is one what is the
employability today in the nation what
are the employment avenues generated
with a V what are the jobs available
been submitted where are the accidents
in suicide separation of job data yes no
friends from suppression of jobs data
you jump on to every data so that is not
the job to other members of the panel is
not about winning it's it's it cannot be
it cannot be a spy it could not you know
you cannot say this that you are going
to talk about job data and jobs this
aggression and then you bring on all
okay I will I'm now starting a clock mr
mallya I'm going to give you exactly one
minute my question to you remains is the
government suppressing data that is
unfavorable before an election because
you don't want it to make you look bad
why are you hiding the data from the
citizens of India who knew your time
startsnow
go ahead why
hiding data from us I don't need one
minute for it it is it is not that we
hiding data it is just that the data
needs to be reorganized one it has to
have new parameters it has to have a new
sample set and once you are doing that
it would definitely take time if it has
to be quarter-on-quarter month on month
and those sample sizes and those sets
need to be reorganized because unless
and until you don't have the data which
can give you a clear picture on 1.35
billion people you cannot you cannot
just go ahead oh very well
or 10 seconds just to increase the
sample size you need to please tell me
we've had the Ministry of statistics
that has existed for a very very long
time and you've been in power now for
nearly five years short of maybe four
months
why did you wait so long to improve what
you call the sample of the methodology
or like you said there were issues in
the manner in which data was being
collected why wasn't this fixed earlier
a lot of things have been done through
16 in 1516 and if you see from 1516
onwards now those issues are being
arranged and they will definitely if if
you have to put a year on here
you will require two years and then you
will start going from there onwards so
if you start saying that you have
suppressed it for four years that's a
wrong statement together tragic mr.

sorry Samir accepted a couple of
regressive would okay so let me just
come back to this Musashi through you
mentioned in the beginning of course the
National Statistics Commission we
started in 2005 and it was started for a
very specific purpose now the members of
the the non-government officers who have
quit actually said that it was no longer
serving its purpose because the data
that was being collected was not being
released if the Commission was not being
consulted the nithya yoga was actually
even when the GDP data was was revised
the Commission was not consulted is it
fair to assume or to say at this point
that another institution that was meant
to be independent and nonpartisan is
facing a crisis of credibility at this
point with these two resignations now
fear if I recall right earlier the
chairman of the National Statistical
Commission are was also used to be the
Secretary of the Department of Law speed
that is the Ministry of statistics and
programme implementation and that
arraignment
had continued
for quite some time till this it was
decided to reconstitute this Commission
and induct in it certain members from
outside yes and also to have an ex
officio post which somebody from the
government would hold it and that turned
out to be the needy I hope see you
whosoever it will be that nietzsche i
Axio will also remain there so that was
how I think the reconstitution of the
Commission meant that they were greater
number of people from outside the
department of must be other Northam
Ostby who were involved in this decision
making exercise and now we find that
their government hasn't been able to
appoint a chairman for a long time there
is between an acting chairman and in the
process the other officers other
departmental officers have virtually
taken over running the National
Statistical Commission also so it
doesn't remain any longer independent an
independent body or even an independent
Ministry of the government which had a
hierarchy of reporting and to who in the
government it would report etc so there
is now intermixing with another
Department called the DPI org and et IO
in turn headed by the Prime Minister
Prime Minister's office etc so I think
the lines of accountability for the data
collected processed and put out has got
very blood on who is responsible and who
is who is finally deciding what data to
be put out we also have now joining us
key raghunathan is the All India
Manufacturers Association mr. Grantham
we've had conversations about jobs about
GST and the impact on you know on what
you what you do and the organisation
that you lead you'd done a study as well
but you talked about job loss in your
space which was rubbished
again by
members of the government is there a
attempt to deny or suppress data do you
believe that the government at this
point is failing or is is refusing to
accept the job crisis and this is part
of that refusal Thank You Faye yeah more
published very many reports about the
indications of job loss people didn't
take it seriously no it is becoming
evident and it's easily visible for even
anybody to see it for example let's take
how do you measure the job loss
organized a sector unorganized a sector
the statistics can never be 100% it can
only be random studies sample study and
they're based on a survey study ei move
has given a particular kind of a study
which is based on the members across the
country from different sectors in an
organized sector we also classified that
unemployment is not merely people who
are not employed but it also means
people who are wrongly employed or
forcibly employed are underpaid
employment we also classified that now
fact remains in spite of the result what
we had come out with from one section of
the people we are yet to be called for a
dialogue with the government we are yet
to be asked for the report of the
government and we are not yet consulted
on the remedies which we had suggested
let me tell you NPS lead to where job
loss investments coming for expansions
lead to where job increase but the
investments are reducing now how much of
investments have come we have not seen
many public issues coming in now
nowadays we are not seeing opportunities
for new employment opportunities are
being generated now the skilled labor
which is available in this country still
remains unemployed or underemployed are
not employed in the right category we
still see people on the
carrying sweeties and tomatoes are
people on the wheels running goober and
the Wallace and we still see newspaper
wear for a pins job PhDs are applying
engineers are applying are they not
seeing we are seeing our own family we
are witnessing people younger generation
without finding a right job we are
finding it visible
we are also visibly seeing a more
predicted the middle-aged people's job
loss is becoming increasingly higher
middle ages between 40 to 50 yes yes
this age group job loss is also yet
stream Lee if I know
and this is again will be a biggest
problem you will find that will lead to
people who have taken loans will become
defaulters now industries who are taken
loan of becoming NPA individuals who
have taken loan will become defaulted
because the age group of 40 to 50 years
of most needy people to get employment
opportunities today we are missing that
if we don't correct things in time a
stitch in time would save 9 we are not
doing ok you are running a
trial-and-error policies and the error
is becoming more and as we are concerned
about it we have prescribed the remedies
which can arrest this but we are not
wanting in the remedial measures yes no
things are becoming visible no now we
are denying reports ok a professor
Chennai here's my question
and every time we bring this up there
are a couple of pieces of information
that are offered to us from various
agencies of the government things like
the mudra loans there was the EPF the
APA for data that was talked about that
has not talked about that was not
brought up today at least and then Ola
ubers omote on all of these other things
now that's the difference of course
between joblessness and job creation do
you think that the data that was offered
by the nithi I hope this evening solves
the problems that have been raised are
you satisfied with the argument that
Amitabh grant offered at offered the
citizens at this at his press conference
today
I don't agree with Amitabh though he's
also from my university it cycles if you
just look at the employment and
unemployment rate over 45 years you get
a high of only 6.1 percent in 2017 18
there is a clear sign that the economy
has not been able to breed it will deal
with the problem of joblessness and of
course as the gentleman from the
manufacturing sector pointed out there
are all sorts of reasons for it but the
problem is I don't think there is a
coherent map made first before the
statistical and other data is weighed
and a decision is taken unfortunately
there is sometimes an element of
politicization like for example the GDP
figures of the UPA while there was a
back series seem to prove that it wasn't
as good as the NDA now we have to get
out of this kind of tinkering and
political maneuvering the situation is
that joblessness rates are extremely
high and they are getting higher and we
have nothing in store to really control
this and second is a point some of you
have made there has to be some
concentration of some particular bodies
for example the National Statistics
Commission the end ssso and other should
be allowed to let this take place
because of their too many irons in the
fire
it won't work at the moment we do not
have a coherent policy where everyone is
pitching in and how we are firefighting
if it hadn't been for this Business
Standard article this morning we would
not have done anything about this
earlier so there is a serious problem of
how the system is working because
joblessness of this amount will have can
have terrible consequences for the
economy and therefore it is very
important that the government take this
most seriously and try not to get people
to leave the particular institution
unless it is unavoidable but it is very
necessary that this should be treated on
the highest level
well the same question
mr. mr. dua were you convinced with the
argument put forward by Amitabh Khan
that his press conference today I must
confess I haven't watched that press
conference but I have read the statement
which appeared in the newspapers which
was put out by the meteor yesterday I
would say that it offered a very
inadequate explanation the fact of the
matter is if the government data is not
independently compiled process there
would always be doubt some suspicions
and doubts about it and people will go
then by anecdotal evidence and more of
you know what they get to know about a
particular industry particular sector
and then come to the conclusion for
instance and lot has been said and I
wouldn't blame people who are saying
that the railways has of late been
saying at the railway minister and the
hose currently also the finance minister
that we are creating a lot of jobs in
the railways and he had said last year
that a hundred thousand jobs would be
created in the railways very soon you
know what was and then thereafter the
railways has put out that 480 thousand
jobs out of those 100 thousand they were
in what's called the government the
class four categories that means peons
and attendants at the lowest scrappers
and what's the number of people who
applied for those 80,000 jobs over three
million people that means that if there
is there is obviously people looking for
John it was 30 but it also said that
included yeah well you could maybe write
three million or thirteen but I both are
grossly I think so this shows that in
the three five behind similarly in the
police yes but yes mister do I you're
right no I understand stable job after
the matter is if for outro in yeah
police constable jobs exactly the same
way
number of people hoopla who applied for
jobs whether it's the Delhi police
Rihanna police or utter Pradesh it is
virtually 50 times the number which is
advertised or finally taken in and not
and they are not being rejected on
medical grounds because for the police
even the medical critical requirements
are pretty high it is that on some
arbitrary criteria and I don't blame the
people who are recruiting what can we
decided what how do you really decide
the job in the police when you put them
through a test yes which have been
farmed out probably rightly objectively
and others which only shows that what is
the extent of people in the number of
people in the country who are looking
for jobs we are and in the private
sector certainly the organized sector of
manufacturing cannot become the hub for
creating employment it has to remain if
you either you will have to pay more for
over employment there and you pay for it
by your exports becoming non-competitive
you will suffer there or the substitutes
which are aware which are available now
in large numbers and yes yes economy is
like China who are able to produce this
scale okay and sell them cheaper yes so
you pay for those yes in fact we have so
much we have so much jia joins us right
now so Asia is the special correspondent
at the business standard who wrote the
article that has caused all of this
upheaval across the country so we should
good evening and thank you for joining
us they has been of course a great deal
of reaction to your story and I know
that's always a very proud thing for a
journalist but the nithya yoga Quito
'king about how this data was not
approved by the government it was not
meant to go out because the methodology
was not correct I want you to take us
through the story that you that you
filed for this I would like paper yes go
ahead go ahead so much your reaction as
well yes so I would like to I would like
to counter
on two grounds one is that the report by
the NSSO doesn't require the approval of
the government it only requires the
approval of the Standing Committee and
another National Statistical Commission
and both of the bodies have given their
approval in the first week of December
and after that the report was supposed
to be put up in the public domain domain
but it's been almost two months and the
government is just sitting on it and
second of all the fact that the Lethe io
y Semin is saying that you know we are
doing a verification of the numbers is
baffling to me because after the
approval of the National Statistical
Commission there is no need to verify
the data I mean does it mean the
regulators are too uncomfortable with
the numbers that they are going in for a
verification at the ground level I mean
that's anybody's guess I think and of
course one of the things that was said
repeatedly by the nithya yoga was that
the methodology of this report was not
correct
both the vice chairman and the CEO said
it they said that basically it's a
comparison of five years to five years
so 2011-12 or two 17 18 and that's
incorrect what they would rather be
looking at is a quarter-on-quarter
comparison what's your what's your
response to that yeah I'll come to that
so on that I mean I have seen a copy of
the report and it clearly gives out the
comparison of the 2017-18 figures with
the past surveys of an SSO which were
done on a five-year long period but so
so the Nationals own report has done
this comparison it's not as if we did
the comparison on our own rest to the
previous reports it's the NSS own report
which is in the comparison so so I think
the nithya yoga vice-chairman is
squarely misleading on that fact mr.
Robin Molly please tell us why should we
believe any data that comes out of the
government of India at this rate
again I would be be upfront in saying so
that the parameters by which this is
done and the verification is required
and these standards need to be reset
because of the simple fact that these
five years to five years and things like
that are not what would give a clear
picture on to what is happening because
the micromanagement of this large-scale
human population and everything is it
required we we must
please please let me complete fair every
time this is not going to happen
whenever I'm saying something you're
going to stop in between that is not
right the National Statistical
Commission and the NSS so who when the
government is more qualified to check
their work see the fact remains that
today you have to also understand
because of the new demographics you need
to to look into the employ of employed
people one and the self-employed also to
understand where your economy is going
where your jobs are going and coming
from so until and unless those things
have not been set right if you start
assessing things based on the parameters
that were where relevant let's say few
decades back and today's dynamic
situation has changed you cannot compare
the two okay alright so much come on you
have to reassess and you have to
represent yeah so so I would I would
sorry sir sorry to interrupt you but I
would like to say that the verification
of the data is done before the data is
put up for approval to the National
Statistical Commission and this national
statistical commission which approved
the report in December I would like to
state the fact that the NSC is an
autonomous body which was set up in 2006
six just to ensure that there is no
interference of the government on the
data which is you know collated by
realist or so in that sense I mean is
the government trying to interfere in
the initial
service by saying that we are going to
verify the data after this is approval I
don't know I mean who's going to verify
data that's come out from the NSS so and
already looked at by the Air National
statistic Commission who else which are
the Department of the government is in a
position to verify or to recheck mr. do
I am taking this you know so Misha's
point back to you very quickly before we
run out of time
doesn't this now sound very worrying the
credibility of data certainly has taken
a hit particularly after the two members
of the statistical Commission who a
couple of days even cited the reasons
for their putting in their papers one
being that they had finalized the data
unemployment in the state including the
acting chairman but the government has
put it on hold and secondly they also
referred to the back series of GDP in
their letter which is in public domain
so which the people who themselves had
been charged with the responsibility of
verifying that means the second check on
the data which had been collated by NS
or NSSO if they are unhappy and they are
in public domain reciting their causes
for putting in the papers it could
certainly causes it's a matter for
concern right sorry we've run out of

callate you know one second all right
we've run out of time here and I just
I'm just going to call out this list one
more time as we wrap up and I want to
particularly thanks so much Jeff for
joining us on the show and actually
answering some of those questions
the an assessable annual employment
unemployment report was last submitted
in 2011-12 we haven't seen a report
since then socio-economic caste census
was last submitted in 2011-12 we haven't
seen a report since then rapid survey of
children from the Ministry of Women and
Child Development last submitted 2013-14
foreign direct investment statistics
from the D IPP last submitted in June
last year prime in India in CRB 2016 was
the last report present statistics 2015
was the last report accidents in suicide
data 2015 agricultural wages data from
the Ministry of Agriculture remember a
government that promised to double the
income of farmers we haven't had a
report since 2015-16 and of course the
numbers of suicides among our farmers we
haven't seen a report for over two years
now if you don't get statistics that are
reliable if we aren't able to trust the
national statistical Commission then
none of the decisions you make and none
of the announcements that may be made
between now and the election are being
made on hard data what we are doing
effectively is painting the windows of
the government so we can't see in we
don't know what is really going on every
single decision made by any government
ought to be based on sound statistics
because you cannot make decisions for an
entire country unless you have the
statistics
just to keep an eye on the elections if
you're going to withhold statistics it
means that the decisions you're making
right now are not in the best interest
of the citizens of this country another
institution under a cloud another
institution losing its credibility
another institution where people are
walking out because they are unhappy
with the loss of credibility this is
very very worrying

In the report, the probe panel ...",2019-01-31T05:30:16Z,MIRROR NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VaofCrN9nDA/hqdefault.jpg,"the justice VNL Shri Krishna probe
report has indicted ex CEO and MD of
ICICI Bank Chanda Kochhar in its report
the probe panel states that Chanda
Kochhar had violated the company's code
of conduct and there was lack of due
diligence in her annual disclosures as a
result of ICICI Bank releasing a
statement on Wednesday evening saying
that her separation will now be
considered formal termination in other
words Chanda Kochhar has now been sacked
wit retrospective effect in fact what
we've also heard is that while ICICI
statement seems to suggest that kota
failed in disclosing the conflict of
interest and so the onus is only on her
the accused has also issued a statement
denying any wrongdoing claiming that the
bank systems could not have allowed such
a conflict of interest so clearly the
response coming in from Chanda Kochhar
is well aware she states that the
systems within the bank was such that a
conflict of interest was not possible so
in a way perhaps suggesting that she's
being wrongly implicated none of the
credit decisions in the bank were
unilateral so this is something that
Chanda Kochhar stands by that these
decisions were taken in consultation
with the board members the bank's design
structure of v8 possibility of conflict
of interest so that is the moot point
here where she is saying that I cannot
be accused of conflict of interest since
such a thing is simply not possible
within the system's existing in the bank
the bank's decision has caused me
immense hurt and pain et nouse Poonam
sena joining us live from the mumbai
newsroom Poonam credit decisions warrant
unilateral so that seems to be the
statement that coming out of Chanda
Kochhar how do we read this what has
gender culture said in her defense take
us through the latest please well that's
right in fact mr. Endicott res
definitely defended her stance stating
that all the credit decisions are not
taken unilaterally decisions are taken
at the board level that is her defense
and she of course says that in her her
conduct has been dealt
absolute professional manner having said
that if you look at the report coming in
from just as Shri Krishna it's an
independent report where it there there
is acquisition that she failed in terms
of she's violated rather the code of
conduct of the bank and as a result
action should be taken and as a result
we should be seeing some amount of
severe meant of the bonuses since 2009
and various other penalties so yes as of
now it seems that Chandra culture has
been accused notwithstanding that this
is an independent inquiry itself and we
also know that media does report that
CBI inquiry is in process or would be on
its way on not just churn nicosia but
there are there is also possibility that
we may see inquiry to be extended at the
overall world level or other senior
management level as well that is he yet
to be seen having said that if we look
at what the voices of most of the top
lawyers are stating that they don't stay
that mode also has a certain
responsibility and there is there is
some amount of lack of due diligence at
the board level itself - I guess this
process probably means slightly
continued over the next few months as
well but from a stock perspective I
guess the results were good and stock
possibly may not be that hampered on
account of this issue but apart from
that this entire case probably would
continue for a few more quarters you
know Poonam this is a huge departure
from the position that the board took
earlier let's not forget the board said
in fact that we're opposed full faith
and confidence in Chanda Kochhar
there was no question of nepotism
favoritism or quid pro quo now from that
to this clearly a question would be
raised like you said of the board itself
that's right in fact Loretha lawyers to
mention that the board also should be
questioned and why is there still change
in stance right on the beginning when
there was absolute support from the
board much on their culture and now it
seems that the board does find Chanda
Kochhar and only Chanda Kochhar guilty
that's the key thing so hence there is a
possibility and there are
big questions raised as to asking
question ability in terms of the word
due diligence and possibly I guess we
also will have to wait and watch out for
what the CBI's next stands would be in
terms of inquiries right at the top
management level right so there seems to
be desperate damage control on the part
of the ICICI bought trying to salvage
its image pull and thanks very much

Rescued girls have ...",2019-01-31T05:16:31Z,MIRROR NOW,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JBJodivv6As/hqdefault.jpg,"now the child can whom was sealed in
nineteen girls were rescued and Thummim
are now the raids took place after the
district collector interacted with the
girls of the childcare home and two of
them even wrote to the DC about the
atrocities against them multiple miners
came forward complained that they were
sexually assaulted by the warden himself
foresters rescue the officials are even
questioned the stuff and have arrested
the accused warden under the PAC's who
act the rescued girls however have been
relocated to the government childcare
homes at the point
I call it promote now joins me live with
further updates on this promote yet
another case they're coming to light of
how a shelter homes have turned into a
place of torture give us a sense of the
scale of the number of people that have
been rescued and what really was
happening inside this place well it
surely is very unfortunate and the most
shocking part is that this is the third
such incident reported from the same
districts at its live animal a very
famous for a Shiva temple and this
particular home also is on a path called
SG develop which is around the temple
where appear like every month people go
on a footing kilometer or a walk it's
got some kind of a pilgrimage but even
after that like nobody knew that such
kind of instance of atrocities are
occurring the issue is that like after
reports of like sexual assault on minors
were like became rampant in that
district the collector took an
initiative to hold grievance meetings
this is where the last report like a
last instance was also reported by the
students and the same thing has occurred
again this time it was shocking because
minor girls came forward instead of
trying to say like what is what are
their requirements inside the shelter
home they had gone ahead and said that
like what ways they were sexually
exploited and that's when the shock
collector immediately formed afar a
committee where we Thor T's and qua
police and as they raided the home they
confiscated the warden's cell phone and
once after confirming whatever that the
children have said it's true they
immediately had arrested the warden
right now under boxer Act and the Tara
this shelter home has also been sealed
19 children have been rescued so far and
they have been taken to other homes the
problem here is that like at least now
they're activists especially child
rights activists claim that the
government should come forward create
committees and voluntarily go
and investigate such matters in various
shelter homes across the state but we
are not like expecting anything from the
government so far absolutely under
promote what is even more important is
to note that a couple of days back the
in fact was a report that even suggested
how almost one thirds of the children in
these shelter homes are mistreated with
this report in hand we now expect the
state government to really expedite this
process of surprise checks and ordered
so as to avoid these kind of situations
but that's the unfortunate part because
this is not the first or second incident
but the third one imagine from the same
district within the past six months and
that took during reveal such a grievance
meetings alone
thankfully the collector had the idea to
hold such kind of grievance meetings to
find out and that is where the children
have come forward the issue here is that
like most of these minors don't even
know what they are going through that's
the problem because various children who
have been brought to such a shelter
homes most of them are abandoned by the
parents or like they could not like give
them the adequate care and that's the
reason these shelter homes aren't like
working and that's the reason these
children have been placed under in such
a shelter homes and imagine like if
these students or children does not know
what is happening to them since a few
children knew what was going on imagine
they had to go on ahead go ahead and
write down that they were forced to
watch porn and then they are sexually
assaulted imagine the kind of like
atrocities they're going through time
and again a place has you placed in
front of the state government to take
the matter seriously but still now we
haven't found out any kind of like reply
from the government all right so as the
moment 19 minor girls who have been
rescued from this child care home in
Thummim odd we leave it there promote we
will have to wait and watch if the state
government really takes into account
these kind of horrific details that are
really coming out of a load of shelter
homes in the state of thumb and not for
the moment many thanks for joining us",True,en,107,0,2

confirmed and our culture is definitely
in the dark she has finally officially
been sacked by the ICICI Bank after this
justice shri krishna panel submitted the
report and found that they were grave
violations of the code of conduct to get
you more details they have water running
in the newsroom right now now take us
through the details this is a board
decision that has just been announced
this is not exactly a both decision that
has been announced or in fact Chandra
culture had resigned last year
what me today need to understand is that
the top banker of the country of veteran
banker Chanda Kochhar who was allegedly
involved in the case of Nakata's illness
far as extending loans to Whitaker and
his concern has now officially been
found guilty of violating the code of
ICICI Bank with respect to lack of due
diligence also with respect to
disclosures as required in fact she
remembered it not recuse herself from
important meetings these are some great
areas that have been highlighted there
in the report now these allegations are
not new this really has been an elephant
in the room or the charges first
surfaced in 2016 but of course the ICICI
Bank board blatantly defended Chanda
Kochhar
even in light of these allegations so
the time and again declined an
investigation done by an external agency
it's only after pressure mounted last
year that they found an investigative
agency panel under the leadership of
Justice so Shri Krishna and now we have
the report which clearly shows her that
the clean should give him to her last
year was perhaps mug the bravest and
best moved on by ICICI Bank erm what
next investors will be concerned or the
stock price tomorrow of course they will
take a beating more importantly remember
that there could be class-action suits
were filed against ICICI Bank in light
of mismanagement of company funds and
there also miss conduct by a top CEO for
about two years or so and also ICICI
Bank as well who took place a clawback
as far as all bonus
so and other remittances OT Chanda
Kochhar is concerned all right now
thanks so much for joining us I'm just
gonna highlight some of the points from
this ICICI Bank sit when the tests come
out and it says inquiry report concluded
that her lack of diligence with respect
to annual disclosures as required by the
bank in terms of its internal policies
the ICICI Bank code of conduct and
applicable Indian rules and regulations
on her interest direct or indirect
towards avoidance of conflict of
interest remember this has been one of
the biggest charge against her when
considered that the banks processes were
dependent solely on the directors
discharging their fiduciary duty to
recuse themselves and avoid conflict
implies that the banks processes were
rendered ineffective by her approach to
such disclosures and avoidance of
conflict effectively what this also
means is that the entire blame has been
put onto on the culture that it was her
responsibility to come ahead and
disclose if there was any conflict of
interest which she did not do so the
rules have been put in place by the
ICICI Bank but Chanda Kochhar did not
make those necessary disclosures this is
also very essential because in the fil
that has been filed by the CBI
CBI goes on to say that they will look
into the panels that sat and cleared the
loans to Videocon and see and and ask
them if they actually knew about this
said conflict of interest as per this
finding she never made these disclosures
so then how is it that anybody within
the ICICI Bank or on those panels would
have known the other part of course is
this and this is the other important
announcement by the bank the conclusions
there add that after due deliberation
Board of Directors have decided to treat
the separation of Chanda Kochhar from
the bank as a termination for cause
under the bank's internal policy so like
me I was pointing out while she was made
to resign as as the bank chief and from
the board earlier it is only now
officially that her services have been
terminated",True,en,497,4,8

the news here on mironov impoverish
readers straight up to a top focus story
here in a big blow to another
institution in the moody government the
two remaining members of the National
Statistical Commission have resigned in
protest claiming that they are being
sidelined PC Mohan and JB Meenakshi
tendered their resignations on Monday
leaving the NSC with only nithya Oak CEO
Amitabh Khan who serves as an ex officio
member and the chief statistician of
India provincial buster
now PC Mohan who served as the chairman
exclusively told mirror now that the
Commission was being sidelined and
neglected felt that NSE was not doing
its job and this was the exclusive
conversation that PC mu'minin' had with
my colleague who said that the former
chairman sat down with Meera now in an
exclusive interview reiterating how he
quit because he felt the institution was
being sidelined and not involved in key
decisions let's listen in joined by PC
Mullen who has resigned from national
statistical Commission we'd like to know
why you have resigned from the C I am a
member of the Commission since 2017 and
since there is no chairman I've been
like discharging the duties of chairman
since last three months me and the other
existing member of the Commission we
thought that the Commission is being
sidelined or not being involved in key
statistical decisions and we were not
really discharging the responsibilities
of the Commission the Commission is
supposed to do expected to do so that is
one of the reasons there is a main broad
reason we are assigned was this a point
where you raised this point with the
government that the Commission was being
sidelined we have in our Commission
meetings noted these issues another
Commission is set up as an independent
kind of thing the link of the Commission
with the government is through the
secretary of the Commission who happens
to be the chief statistician and also
secretary in the department so he
attends the meetings
controversy was there that there was a
collision over the point of GDP back
series data do what what was your
opinion on that see we did not like that
the GDP back series got released through
the nay theorem also we informed we said
so including the other chairmen of the
previous term what do you have to say
about the employment data that is not
being released this report another
commission had already said that first
report will come out in December 2018 so
far I not seen it in the website I not
seen that release publicly meanwhile
Congress leader and former Finance
Minister P Chidambaram reacted to the
two resignations say that he mourned the
death of the National Statistical
Commission and remembered with gratitude
its valiant fights to the release
untainted GDP data and employment data
as well my colleague very now joins me
live with more inputs on this variant
clearly there are two main aspects to
this one being how PC Moonen on record
exclusively speaking to me now has said
how the committee felt sideline more
importantly they had raised the concerns
in the internal meeting but nothing was
really addressed well that's right you
know and let's not forget that this is
an extremely important important body an
important Commission now even before
this resignation there were two seats
are already vacant on this particular
Commission and the man whose quit is of
course the outgoing chairman of the body
so in that really tells you the gravity
of the sort of people who have stepped
away from this Commission both those
who've resigned now let's remember what
the role this that the NSA actually
plays then an important an important
tool for the government and one of the
steps are if that has been asked by the
outgoing channel is to treat this body
has a sort of statutory body which means
that the data that they put out the
reports they put out are accepted but
what what they've actually accused the
government off is actually holding back
a lot of the Bata a lot of the reports
they've they have in fact compile which
is where the where the where the bottom
of heads really began
and once that continued the the
officials really had no option but
do we draw they're the representation to
the sky marina there would be only two
non government non-government employee
you know employees on this on this
particular panel the rest of course is
me t io 7 mr saye and of course you've
got you've got the chief statistician
statistical advisor beg your pardon to
the government who's also on this panel
so they're all there both of them
government employees you know in effect
but what you have here of course are two
people who are so frustrated with the
system so frustrated by the fact their
reports have been have been completely
ignored that they've been in their words
sidelined and that's where this entire
controversy is actually interrupted and
despite the version that's in put out
for the chief statistical advisor to the
government that they did not raise those
concerns when that question was put by
our colleague I respond to the outgoing
the arc when chairman of this committee
he said very clearly unequivocally that
this was raised within the committee
this is poker about and they've had no
option but to step away because of the
current crisis absolutely we're in what
is even more as you pointed out as well
there are two things one being how deep
the chairmen the outgoing chairman very
clearly even mentioned how the NSSO
which is the data that is we put out to
reflect the job losses postie
monetization that was withheld and
secondly also the fact that the recently
launched economic offences was also
withheld thirdly the recently released
GDP back series was not taken into
consideration so there have been series
of data that perhaps were supposed to be
consulted with them but not done clearly
indicating a lot of friction between the
government and this body well that's
right and uh they at least asked to
weigh on these matters of course they do
more than that but you know that you
know the the job loss is suppose D
monetization is something of course like
the opposition parties have been
questioned the government for and that
data was not necessarily put out a call
to them withheld by the government and
you know all these things of course have
have resulted in in the situation that
we see at the moment which means that
the National Statistical Council
Commission in fact just
to members you know and that is that is
where we are and why we her is because
there has been this frustration within
the organization particularly in the
part of these two these two appointees
about the government that nothing was
happening that they were their views
were being completely disregarded they
were not asked about you know this this
back series GDP data during the UPA era
that was put out by the government the
revision in that so all that is really
added to the situation and the
frustration of these two members who had
it seems from their own words no option
but to step aside absolutely and there's
also now will you be giving more
ammunitions for the opposition as well
to now question the government with also
peaches emblem taking to Twitter and
saying in fact mourning the death of
this institution and also calling the
malicious negligence by the government

offering them brights yet Europe are
retorted by saying that they are not
involved in operation Kamala he also
said that the Congress MLAs want to
leave the party due to internal
differences the Chief Minister raked up
the BJP leaders involvement in a similar
poaching row in 2008 so going back to
Sri JA there on the story sri ja this
you know what we are seeing in playing
out in karnataka politics doesn't seem
to end anywhere does it now fresh a
charge is being traded by both the
parties there well clearly there is
political turmoil here in karnataka and
of course just a couple of days ago
where we witnessed all of the MLAs we're
moved out of eagleton resort we hear
from the chief minister of the state HT
kumara Swamy continuing to maintain that
operation table is still on the reason
being just yesterday two of their
Congress MLAs received calls from the
BJP saying that they will be offered a
lump sum amount and also they did ask
question some of the emily's of the
Congress that where should they be
sending their gifts to and according to
her HT kumara Swamy the gifts that we
are talking about here is in terms of
money is what the chief minister of the
state did try and speak and he also
tried and rubbish all the rumours as far
as there is nothing called where they
are trying to ha straight a porch
the BJP ml is at this point in time as
far as the the poaching is concerned it
is only the Congress who's trying to in
fact pin that blame on the BJP why we
did hear from me at Europe at the BJP
state president he continues to maintain
that they are busy with the drought
related issue they are touring across
cannot occur and also understanding the
ground situation as far as drought is
concerned and they had no time to
indulge in horse-trading rights treaty

brave queen of chassis Rani Laxmi Bai
played by Kangana Ranaut it focuses on
the war she fought against the British
East India Company and tells us why she
started to be the most courageous Indian
warrior by the British till date the
film has a budget close to a hundred
crore and you can see that pretty well
on screen the sets have been designed
very well and looks somewhat dreamlike
together everything with the costumes
and styling looks beautifully lavish and
royal just as required the editing is
great and the background score has
magnified the impact too many folds to
be critical the second half is
definitely more impressive because the
first step is to filming it's a little
slow and they're closed to fortify songs
which becomes too much it's after the
interval that the film truly picks up
and gives you goosebumps and the scenes
become more and more powerful few scenes
like when the Queen refuses to surrender
to the life of a widow and decides to
rule and protect her kingdom are
unforgettable even the final war between
the Indian and the British which is a
really long battle they'll give you
chills this is the part where the
audience will truly salute the
conviction and bravery of the queen of
Jhansi and understand why she's
worshipped due date Kangana Ranaut has
delivered one of our Korea's best
performances in this film she's walked
on her accent for sure but it could have
been still better just the maratti touch
was missing somewhere she's emoted very
well and worked hard on her action
sequences overall you won't leave the
theater without being impressed by her
the supporting cast is pretty huge as
there are a lot of characters and I must
say all of them have done a good job
overall manikarnika is a good watch
especially the second half which
deserves some serious applause for its
technical efficiency great work by the
special effects team I'm giving money
card Anika 3.5 stars could have been 4
had the first half being crisper and as
engaging as the second half there are a
few directorial flaws as well but the
film's show deserves a trip from you to

they have faced that the Election
Commission should be taken into
consideration
well the Election Commission today
celebrated the National voters day this
was the ninth national voter day and
along with the National Election
Commission in Delhi in the national
capital this day was celebrated across
India on 6 lakh election commission
offices and several other places the
Election Commission has made it clear
the motto is
no water has to be left behind and for
this the Election Commission has done
every possible thing that can be done
read the use of social media or beat the
use of the foot force that is there
including the BLS and all they have all
been sensitive eyes and they have been
told to go to each of the homes and
ensure that there is a hundred percent
of enrollment for the voter ID cards at
the same time we get to know about the
about what happened in Telangana where
several people like the numbers were
there in ten lakh where people said
their names were removed so Election
Commission is taking a cue from the past
and this time they have said that
they've also they have also tagged with
Facebook remember India has got 200
million users on Facebook and this time
for the FIR for the second time in fact
Facebook would be sending notifications
to all the users to get themselves a
registered on the sweep and NS VP so
that they can attain a good number of
electoral participation that's right our
stay on with us getting in a word here
from our expert with us on our panel
this evening mr. Escamilla rata
appreciate you being with us to what
extent do you think marking this day as
the celebration is guru
not just sensitized voters but also
inform them give them crucial
information on what needs to be done to
be registered as a voter our effort is
to reach every voter in the country and
this yes n SVP and today's the
celebration is a is a step in that
direction so we want the motto of the
Election Commission is that no water to
be left behind and the second water
motto is that every vote counts
so we not merely say that the voters
eligible voters should get themselves
registered but we also want them to come
and vote in their conscience in their
polling stations which we have read it
very
to their houses so that is the eight
consistent and constant effort of the
Election Commission so we hope that if
the Facebook and other this and
particularly NGOs etc they assist we can
we can definitely improve the voting
percentages in this election right so
you're looking in with with respect to
assistance by private players here on
this as well please stay on with us
getting in voice of senior journalist
mister odd rajagopal and with us oh the
phone line as well mister Rajagopal and
in your view to to to what extent and
this is go to help spread the
information this being a very crucial
year the 2019 Lok Sabha elections to be
taking place in a couple of months from
now to what extend this would also help
address voters grievances many whose
names despite being registered have not
figured in the voting list okay we seem
to have lost that line we're going
across to our other expert right now we
have mr. Naveen table former Chief
Election Commissioner with us as well
appreciate you being with us sir mr.
travela a same question perhaps if we
could ask you as well to what extent
this is going to help in taking into
account several voters grievances that
are already in the public domain for
example despite being registered your
name not figuring on the voting list on
the day of voting
the the thank you for asking me I am
aware that the Election Commission has
put mechanisms into place in all the
states and the union territories through
their chief electoral officer z' in
order to take on board all the names
that are not on the voting list as of
now I think that I have also seen their
notice that all the people should check
their names on the latest voting list to
make sure that even if they were there
for a previous election are they there
now because the voting lists are always
revised in January of every year so this
revision is very very critical but I do
need to add one thing that the law as it
stands is that the person has to be
ordinarily resident
for six months in a particular place now
the problem is really with many of our
students who may be registered in their
towns and villages and hometowns but may
be studying in some other part of India
and if they are not ordinarily resident
where they are studying where they have
to be for six months then inescapably
they have to go back to their cities or
home towns or villages in order to be
able to cast the vote right and mr.
Chawla we really appreciate you
specifically mentioning that because
this is part of the times Network
campaign as well we are calling it lost
votes for those who have shifted towns
are not available are not living in
their hometowns between a duration of
six months or more on how to take that
into account do you do you feel that the
chief the the the Election Commission is
taking that into account because their
millions of votes that are lost because
of this process of shifting base
shifting towns
yes and sometimes you know boats are
also lost because say large cities like
Delhi or Mumbai or Bangalore people
shift addresses and shift jobs within
the same city and then and then don't or
fail perhaps to mention to the electoral
authorities that they shifted from A to
B to C in the same city it is a great
problem now but there is another thing
there is another related issue if I may
raise that which is that the constant
refrain is can EVMS be hacked you know I
was on television three days ago because
there was a so-called hackathon in
London not on an election commission
machine and I have a chapter a new book
every vote counts on the very issue of
the EVM now because the EVM is not
linked by wire or by wireless and is not
linked to any computer system is also
the reason for the safety of the EVM
it's like a pocket calculator like I
adding machine it's known it cannot be
hacked by any other system but them but
when that day comes and and it is
important that it comes one day that
people are able to vote from wherever
they are not necessary by postal ballot
by but by by pressing a button is also
the day when the EVM as it stands today
may be in jeopardy so there is a balance
that has to be retained and between the
environment computers only if the idioms
become Wireless right please stay on
with us so we have to take in our
viewers calling in as well our caller
Naveen from New Delhi please go ahead
son hello hello yes please go ahead
hello actually I got my daughter
motorcar desperation done on 31st
October 2017 and the registration number
is application number is Oh Oh foreign
FF readable k4 can put
1 8 1 triple 3 8 2 okay I'm getting the
reveal all right but what is what is the
problem that you are facing I am not
getting the mission done and facing that
the the status when I'm checking the
application status I am said getting the
reply that bll appointed and it is more
than one year and I am yet to receive
the card from verification done from
your side side from Devo ok so so so
this is this is a common problem that
people would be facing mr. Mandela
thought you heard that query here
what are you able to be could you answer
on how to go about this the registration
having been done you've been given in a
registration number as well but you
still haven't got your water card no I
don't first I would like to make a small
clarification about what mr. Chawla has
said now he said that a voter has to E
or Nelly resident at some place for six
months that was a very earlier
requirement now under the law there is
no such a requirement you can you can
just go to the ero but without any
minimum qualification for ordinary
residence because you may change your as
at any time and then you can have your
name registered in the new electoral
roll at any time there is no minimum
stay yeah that is what I am now
answering see our system provides that
constant movement of the application can
be traced from the NS VB but in case
there is some problem he can write to
the Election Commission and first of all
I would say that all electoral rolls
have now been recently published finally
in the month of this January itself
first
let him check whether his his daughter's
name has come in the new role or not
in case that name has not come then I
would suggest that let him put another
application of course that will be
slightly embarrassing for us also but
let him puts immediately another
application in form six on the website
online itself and then he can write to
the Election Commission also saying that
this is the fate of his earlier
application I am sure the Election
Commission will look into it right and
this would hopefully also avoid any
duplication as well stay with us please
move you was calling in Joseph from
Mumbai please go ahead while you are
making sorry hello yes please go ahead
Joseph I'm afraid we're not being able
to understand that query coming in from
our caller our next caller of table
emeth from Bengaluru please go ahead
okay we seem to have lost that line in
in some of these queries of course here
that have come in mr. Naveen table that
there would be a concern here also with
respect to duplication on what muster
scheme and there at the gesture of one
particular person who called us up
having registered already in October 27
and 2017 and still not having received a
voter's card to be applying to the
website again are there fears of
duplication then
and that booth level officer as it were
owns the number of voters in that
polling station whether it's nine
hundred or a thousand or eleven hundred
so that booth level officer is supposed
to go from door to door and verify
removing removing all the people who
have moved out
removing the names of those who may have
passed away and also adding the names of
those who are eligible turn 18 from the
first of January of this year so the the
booth level officer is is a mechanism
that we put in place to become to come
much closer to the voter so if in the
case of any individual viewer who is
watching the program I think the thing
to do is to immediately get in touch
with the representative of the Election
Commission so that the concerned Biello
can come to that house and deliver the
card or or inform the the complainant
the the the complainant of where the
card can be picked up from and that
should be done very soon because there
isn't that much time left mister s
commendeth are we're also wanting to
know to what extent the celebration of a
national voters day really helped people
today of course we've had a function
having been honored by the President of
India several workers and officials of
the Election Commission having been
rewarded for the work that they've done
but our specific queries of people being
taken up like to them to the exact
nature of what we are discussing today
on our show here how does this help the
voter in just marking a national voters
day no national voters day is only a
reminder just to tell you that's a very
important event is now coming up you
have to take care all those conscious
voters they must check up
in weather their names are there in the
final published electoral roll and it's
also an invitation to them that you
please come exercise your right to vote
which is a very valuable right so that
tomorrow you have a effective say in the
election of your representative who will
form the government so the idea is to
give publicity and this function is not
being arraigned only in daily at a
synthetase
it is being arranged at all the police
are trying the country so if n last
election about polling stations are
there normally we are expecting about 7
to 8 / celebrations being done today and
that will definitely a step in the right
direction to teach demand all right and
in spread the word sensitization is what
we're looking at our next caller mr.
Arun Kumar from Jamshed / I don't come
on if my voice is going through please
go ahead yes
my question is how shall I know that my
name is in the current dish okay this is
perhaps would require - for you to go
onto the website NS VP mr. Naveen Chawla
if you could answer that please
specifically wanting to cross check if
the records have been updated and older
names have not been lost would it mean
going directly to the website in a for a
particular zone to be checking your name
there
yes they should go onto the website
first Yuna for that particular city
certainly in that state and through and
if necessary then first checking up
whether the name is there because the
website has already been uploaded and
all the names that are supposed to be
current for the first of January
including the 18 year olds are supposed
to be there so you are absolutely right
the first step is please go onto the
website and check mr. Naveen Ciavarella
mr. s commandeer Atta corresponding
Ayushmann and all our viewers who've
called in with their specific queries on
this appreciate you sharing your views
voters grievances on a significant day

officers can you share more details on
this please that's right after this
incident comes right after how the
tribals got agitated because this goes
back to 2002 when the rehabilitation
process has been going on and many of
these rebels were shifted to Accola
district corporate area since the new
residence was near or semi-open town
they were forced to change their
lifestyle and look for new occupation so
recently Africa they have started moving
back to their villages which now falls
under the tiger is no suicide the danger
to their life living in a designated
reserve is also punishable offense Oh on
Tuesday when last you see when all of
these officers and concerned reached a
village to force the tribal villagers
out they were attacked with shock
weapons such as access and Spears for
that matter so in this entire incident
at least 15 people were injured in
amravati and over a dozen vehicles were
destroyed by tribals and after that is
section 144 was also being enforced in
the area so now the over police has
finally taken action against hundred and
ten tribals here what we understand and
the inquiry also which all other people
are also involved is also underway right
obstructing the duty of a government
officer or assaulting officer on duty is
a criminal offense and therefore this is
a case that has now been registered

easy to launch a satellite and there's
so much of learning to go in that and
your old babies and that but yet I mean

should prioritize miss Butler my first
question is to you you've actually taken
a lot of time and energy and dedicated
it to mental health and you've been
doing this for several years why did you
decide to prioritize mental health so we
started in power three years ago
actually which seems really long but I
mean we've done we've been able to
achieve quite a lot in that three years
and I'm really happy about that
though and on the other side you realize
it's really been a really short journey
the reason I started in power is a
couple of things actually I was running
two schools and I saw it from very close
quarters realized that what you know
what are the kind of issues that
children go through realize that there
was not that much help available parents
are either not aware or not willing to
seek help you know so that was one of
the main reasons we saw difference
examples and because I know there are a
lot of people who are just who got here
because they're wondering what are the
issues that children go through that
perhaps parents don't know how to deal
with so typically of course nowadays
social media and social media addiction
is coming on very strongly but other
than that there is substance abuse which
is a huge area of concern there
self-harm there is of course the
bullying the anxiety and depression that
comes either because of stresses at home
or because of
exam stress and of course and there's
your own component you know if you're a
high achiever that you know you're
driving yourself and then that itself
creates a lot of anxiety so there are
multiple factors that go and creating
that kind of mental health disorder that
children are facing these days dr.
Shetty you know and there are so many
people and one of the questions that
came up on Twitter was this that young
people are going through these problems
and parents seem to think this is like
millennial nonsense you know we didn't
have these problems when we were growing
up we all had exams we all went to
school we all went to college why is it
that he that the kids in school or
college today are facing mental health
problems and the question that well I
was asked on on Twitter was how do we
get our parents to realize that this is
real but let me take that back a step is
it something that's you know particular
to this generation or is it just that we
didn't know it was around of a previous
generation I think let's look at the
context students go to three schools the
school or the college where they really
attend the tuition classes in the second
school and the third school are the
parents who come and say um Nick a Kia
apart from that the emotional contact
time of the students with the parents
have gone down parents are in the midst
of globalization and the rapid change
which is happening in the country they
worker 14 hours tired for four hours so
the emotional contact time between the
children and the parents in Gardner the
third thing is the play has completely
gone down among children and in the
schools and colleges teachers are not
equipped to deal with emotional issues
so there is a big syndrome which I call
is this a disconnection syndrome you
don't have people in in funerals you
don't know who died in your building
it's put in there in the in the notice
so there is a disconnection in the
society where people do not meet people
people have no time to share emotions
and send the families also the families
family contact em has gone down
emotional contact time has gone down
children are in the midst of attending a
lot of schools and colleges financial
issues and she Utley says that the
financial issues of parents are also
forcing kids to attempts who said and
and harmed themselves so there's a whole
host of factors globalization being one
faith the brain has not changed it's the
same brain but the brain has been
killed or shot or hit at by the forces
in the environment depression in this
generation is an artifact of a changing
world a rapidly changing world and a
country which has been caught with so
many things happening all the time both
in the cities as well as in the towns
that's how I sing about parents and
children not being also on the same page
absolutely time so I think like it
schools what we're trying to do is get
all the three stakeholders together that
is the parents the children the students
as well as the teachers because until
all three are not on the same page we're
going to find this disconnect because
you may at school be talking a lot you
know and this is I'm going to ask this
question because I know a lot of people
at home are thinking and it bothers me
personally there are a lot of times
people blame this on working mothers no
no is it which is not fair working
mothers who know how to talk to the
children from the offices it's a skill
okay to make the presence of the mother
felt next to them at home like the three
questions they always ask is did you
have your meal sits in the fridge I can
see the TV on I can hear it did you do
your homework instead of that if they
start talking about
I really am pissed enough is my boss is
really hassling me I was your day
and they talk about small things about
life and that's where the emotional
contact them can be you know what
there's a myth we need quality time with
children know we need intense emotional
contact them so when the mother comes
home and if she says how was the day I
come here let's talk about my day and
your day everything is bonded so so
early the most important thing is
working mothers create very independent
children please say that again create
independent children and and their
ability to communicate with them you
know and they're in at a distance is the
key to make independent strong resilient
you mom at home but if there is no
emotional connect then it really doesn't
matter because of the conversation
between them if it's not happening if
there's no communication between them
then whether the mother is at home or
not at home it really doesn't matter and
about mothers who are educated
and and bored and depressed create more
hassles two children inside the house
happy mother's really rare better
children other so do things I want you
to bring in eight you travel a lot you
meet a lot of people and I'm sure you
encounter several people who are who are
struggling with this and you have
teenage kids yourself yes so you're a
dad you're working through this new
generation millennial on their phones
they're on social media they're
competing with with everything what's
that like and what have you discovered
about this generation how do dads get
more involved sorry how do how do dads
get more involved you know a little
first of all as doctor said I think I
think just being in touch I think every
family has first of all this whatsapp
group you know the close group do you
keep in touch with each other I mean
that's one thing I'm just saying but you
know one point was doctor made earlier
you know I've been visiting a lot of
colleges talking about mental health and
what he said about playtime you know I
went to a college last week about mental
health talking about mental health and
we asked how many kids exercise 45
minutes a day I was in it so the
engineering college and I think 10% of
the hands went up you know I mean people
have stopped you know people we all know
that when you exercise this positive you
know endorphins get released in your
body you know it's very common thing but
exercise is an antidepressant I'm not
saying it W it just says it
that's just exercise and I told them you
don't require a gym just my shoes and
walk on the road you know if you don't
have donated absolutely I'm saying yes
create this scenario right I don't even
can single out and say that you know
this is only the cause only this is a
solution I think it has to throw
everything has to come together cool and
the family have to be a joy to read is
how it should be it's a joint family
yeah oh
Irish I know you work specifically with
the LGBTQ community but I also know that
you work a lot with victims of sexual
assault of rape victims of victims who
were perhaps abused as children
and that you know that has nothing to do
with exercise it has nothing to do with
what you're going through right now it
it sort of finds its way back into your
adult life and that leads to depression
and it's something we should stop
burying under the car I think I think
the first solution to anything is to
accept you know I always say this you
have to undress the issue before you
address the issue as well so accept that
that's something that's happened I think
the worst advice that anyone could give
and give anyone is forget that something
like this has ever happened to you you
can't forget and every time you try to
forget you remember it is we just have
to develop a mechanism where we know
that this has happened in the past and
to allow the past to remain in the past
and not let it interfere with the
present but to actually think that this
has never happened or or or because
because let's face it 2007 that was a
statistic by the woman and child welfare
ministry and it actually said that one
in two children are sexually are
sexually abused which means that and
male children are more sexually abused
than female children so that simply
means that is it's an epidemic
and if it's an epidemic I know of more
people who are sexually abused than
people who are not so so the new normal
yeah so so it becomes extremely
important that we don't try to hush
things under the carpet and we don't we
understand and we tell people that that
hey just as just as you have common cold
like you can't find anyone without a
common cold you can't find anyone
without a mental challenge and just as
you have a doctor for common cold you
need to have a psychologist a
psychiatrist for mental health dr.
Shetty how do we know if there's a loved
one a family member or colleague a
friend a spouse who's going through
mental health problems and perhaps
hasn't mustered the courage to talk
about it can we are these signs of
course what are the so in the family
what's a blooping they've stopped saying
good morning don't say that that they're
improved
maybe they're they're really gone away
and they may be down if in a train when
they are traveling or in the car and
orthotics are the same group sees one or
two people missing it may not be malaria
it may have been depression
if in the office you say hello to
somebody say good morning but the fellow
just walks across it's not attitude he
or she made me depressed so if you're
very dull sleepy or extremely alert
irritable agitated if you feel your feel
you're responsible for all the ills in
the family and in the community
if you sleep less sleep more eat less
eat more you think about death and dying
you think about as if the world is
coming to an end these are the signs of
depression but sometimes if you hear
voices we wash your hands repeatedly if
you get rubbish thoughts which you
cannot remove from your mind at all it
comes again and again and you feel very
scared to fly to get into a car to drive
a car to enter a train or to go up the
lift or get up to the terrace these are
some small sense sometimes if you feel
that your heart is going to stop right
now and it's this palpitations there's
breathlessness but all you see the every
report is normal that could be a panic
attack you feel you're about to die and
this could be a sense of impending doom
and these are the common signs of of
mental symptoms right each one of us can
really check it if they go to the net
and look at self-report questionnaire by
the whu-oh and phq-9
by by also a questionnaire which has
been validated in the country across
many languages so if I notice that
there's something some behavioral change
in someone around me what do I do I
could we started you can walk up to the
person mental health checkup us when you
get pain in the chest nobody waits you
run to a doctor get an ECG when you have
fever olden days there is to wait for
the favored healthy dude all that I
stopped you go and check whether you
have dengue or malaria so if you have a
behavior change screen yourself for for
distress disorder or depression
in fact her shaumbra joins us right now
he's a very young entrepreneur and he's
using technology to help people
understand mental health and perhaps
also diagnose hush could you take us
through what work you're doing at the
organization that you started
yeah sure so we have two products my
child up and be included so one of our
apps called my child app so when I was
young I suffered from a developmental
disorder and it took my parents over
nine years to figure that out
my child app can do all the things that
took my penis nine years in less than
ten seconds so our app acts as an
enabler to help parent figure out
whether their child as a neurological
physical or a speech disorder and where
to go which specialist to reach out if
their child has a different delay this
happens for children between age of 1 to
24 months for an audience between the
age of 18 and above we create a lot of
content on Facebook and Instagram which
is quite ironical but and we use that
content to make them aware make people
on the internet aware about the issues
faced by people with depression anxiety
bipolar or all kinds of disorders and
disabilities excellent
it does seem it does seem extended is
this is there something you feel parents
really need right now
I'm sure you'll really help them you
know if they're if they are able to use
these sort of apps especially if if you
don't have access to mental health
professionals and this could you know be
of good use to that for that especially
user service so on the screen the
sixty-six thousand two hundred we are
short of sixty-six thousand two hundred
psychiatrist that's this yes that's the
gap in between you know you know that's
the question I was going to ask you as
well unfortunately we don't have enough
doctors now India as a country we have
we spend on public health on public
healthcare which means government
hospitals but how many mental health
clinics do we have where someone who
can't afford the services or you know
offer upwardly mobile psychiatrist can
go where does the person go if they feel
that this is you know this too expensive
for me I can't afford it dr. Shetty
where is that person going I think we
need to look at a model which has been
used in Iran we cannot have a
top-heavy model in the country there has
been a lot of training of general
physicians who treat depression without
complications panic attacks so we need
to build a model where we train general
physicians in diagnosing minor mental
health disorders and treating them at
the same time just like an Anganwadi
worker can go and give identify malaria
yes and give chloroquine we need to have
a really top not a top-down model but
bottom-up model and when you train
people at different levels in UK is it
your right now doctors when they're
doing their MBBS are barely talked about
mental health he's in two weeks and that
took two days to find where the
department is look who's the head of the
department four days to hear and two
days to get the signature that you have
completed so there is no impetus but
things are changing a lot of
psychiatrists and even friends like
Harish Nene and atoll are going across
and going into the community and and
really creating a lot of agony so that's
going to build mental health is too
important to be left to mental health
professionals I think what's important
is many times many a times you have your
circle of influence all of us have got a
circle of influence and there are times
when people there is still a lot of
stigma when it comes to power lugia care
thank you doctor capacity Anika here
electric shocks ding it and and let's
face it the because because there's very
little emphasis many I know many
psychologists also come with their own
prejudices you know so so many a times
what really happens is you are the first
person that the person reaches out to
because you are in the immediate circle
and they look up to you and they reach
out to you so first and foremost
responsibility comes on you and you
don't have to be a mental health as dr.
Shetty rightly said you have to be a
mental health professional for Bill for
being a decent person all that you need
to do is you need to have the potential
in you to
listen without judgment and slowly and
steadily because many a times you just
need someone to listen to you slowly and
steadily when you build the circle of
trust it's important that you know that
you can handle or leave this much after
that when you build that trust take the
person stand with the person if you want
go with the person to a mental health
professional yes and then lead the
person over there
I think the first diagnosis of something
first first treatment would have context
point of conscious you each one of us
was watching the show right now and was
a friend who's depressed who's upset has
that responsibility I don't agree with
you more actually because I think the
first point of contact is the person who
can really make a huge difference so I
must share the story which you feel I
met somebody yesterday a young person a
young young adult and so he had come to
the empower Center we had a small
workshop for retractors and he was one
of them I met him yesterday and he was
just telling me that somebody he knew
was almost on the verge of committing
suicide but he remembered what are the
right things to say at a time like this
and he used that with his friend and he
was able to save the life what are the
right things to say as in exactly what
he's saying I mean you know don't be
judgmental just just listen you don't
have to have a solution in hand but most
of the times if you know it's always a
cry for help it's you know so just be
there just listen to the person you
don't have to say key you don't have to
say you know what's wrong with you how
can this be happening to you yes
I think more than of course we need more
therapists I need we need more mental
health professionals but more than that
we need more listeners Ebola so in fact
people asking questions like what is the
difference between a counselor and a
psychiatrist and a psychologist a
counselor is one who's done is arts
degree and has done probably master's in
psychology and fill or PhD he or she may
be trained to counsel provide
psychotherapy to psychological tests and
also to conduct a lot of workshops on
health as well as life skills
psychiatrist does an MBBS and then goes
I had to do his
bloom and psychological medicine or mass
doctor or MD in psychiatry and he or she
is trained in input in diagnosing
psychiatric illnesses and treating them
to the best of their ability many
psychiatrists are also trained in
counseling and psychotherapy and and
they both complement each other a
counselor a psychologist and a site that
is a complement each other and working
together is always to the best advantage
of people who are ill there's also a
taboo about prescriptions that you know
I don't want to take these pills I don't
know what they're going to do with do to
me and a lot of times nobody with those
and specifically when it comes to mental
health people have I mean people will
take tablets for everything else
substance yes to get that relief and to
feel good but you're not willing to take
the medication for it there's not a bias
in the sense nobody will play around the
pills of hard doctor yes just take it
but you we need to have creative
explanation they three things they come
and say cut the goalie chilling it will
when should I take I tell them this is
not a vegetable market that you bring
down the price of the vegetable or the
pill you need to understand you need to
come and tell me get me well do whatever
you think is the best where they have to
give you two medications three
medications for medications and I use
the analogy of if you have anemia
you'll get iron if you have if you have
diabetes insulin will dissolve the sugar
these medications when necessary will
dissolve it thoughts when you have a
fracture of the mind the sprain of the
mind mild mental disorders which can do
well with love counselling psychotherapy
fracture of the mind our mental
illnesses which would need medications
yes I think that's the stigma that we're
talking about really is so much stigma
attached with it so many myths around
this subject for example exactly this
one not will you take medication so I
think if they are able to create more
awareness about it and generate more
conversation about it I think earlier
this in fact we have our phones are
ringing off the hook we don she's on the
phone line from M of the bath we dodged
go ahead I'd like to congratulate you
applaud you for doing this no new salary
the issue is more yes I agree your
question they don't my question I don't
have a question I have two opinions so
first of all what we need to do is we
need to actually include mental health
in a school curriculum because kids at a
young age can learn to be compassionate
to others because because the major
problem is we don't know how the top
specific was suffering so language can
be taught about that biggest big noise
if you go to a psychiatrist people say
it's a family so that's you need
awareness programs to you know this is
important and people are dying it's a
very big killer so you know absolutely
biology on the phone line from Mumbai
apology go ahead yeah yeah how are you
hi I really like to you know what you
have a question for us
yeah yeah definitely but I would like to
congratulate Messiahship II know exactly
water you know a depressed mind
okay alright alright Balaji many thanks
for for calling us we have one more
guest who's here to share her story
Reshma joins us right now Reshma first
of all thank you for thank you for
joining us on the show you've been
working and you've done a lot of work in
the area of mental health disability and
human rights but would you tell us why
you took up mental health and why you
decided this is something you wanted to
dedicate your life to had no choice
for me I was diagnosed with paranoid
schizophrenia at a very early stage of
teenager you know sob story Jardine is a
2002 but I started hearing voices at age
of 15 for me there isn't a choice
people can run campaigns with they have
funds I do not have that kind of choice
in my life from me talking is what I do
I also work with kids and quite honestly
from what I've been hearing in the
discussion I think sometimes the very
system of psychiatrists and
psychologists have also done more harm
than good many of us may not fail to
recover on medications and in the early
stages I'm talking about 2002 it was a
very difficult period because you didn't
have social media to exist you didn't
have people you can pitch out to like
Harry said your closest circle is really
the psychiatrist and the counselor
thankfully I had good ones ethical ones
the question I have been trying to raise
constantly is if people are afraid about
the very support system it's not the
people that we need talked to it is the
support system we need to talk to an ask
them to change their ways there has been
a tremendous top-down approach still
going on within the very field which
makes it very difficult for many of us
to come out and talk about our story so
to even reach out what we do in school
is and in the work that I've done is
creates a peer support model because it
goes down to us being human beings and
finding that human connection you know I
want to talk to someone who has gone
through what I have gone through yes and
that makes it so much more easier it
doesn't matter whether I'm living alone
and you know not connected to my family
but if I have somebody somewhere who has
gone through so much of a similar
experience then I have I know they are
they are working with me as an agent of
supports and making me my own agents of
care so yes the system we try or the
model
try to teach kids is to actually make
them agents off they won't care I mean
teach them to care for themselves teach
them to find out they're always and we
translate that into our grassroots work
at the same time we also include other
practitioners and we simply ask them to
you know change their ways try to look
at people like us as an us being the
experts because yes we have to live with
this for the rest of our lives
not you right and this is this is
important you know in workplaces also
people worry that if my colleagues or my
boss or the organization found out that
I have a problem I'd get fired I'd lose
my job so there's this whole need to
cover it up and to pretend like it's not
happening I tend to because we don't
make or we don't allow people to feel
safe how important is it to put out you
know role models like Reshma who show
that you can live with the problem if
it's properly treated if it's properly
cared for you can live a full and
well-adjusted life touch it many sides
to this issue if you go and share it
with your company
many companies might exclude you slowly
they might not give you any any
promotion number two is that if you
really share it in a company where the
HR guys are very sympathetic the company
has a good policy then you're really
taken care of
number three is companies also are not
sensitive they start giving long
lectures and this so many of them said
don't take medicines take therapy take
therapy don't take therapy take
medicines exit Excel so you need to have
a culture of mental health in the
company where they have hired a
psychologist or a psychoanalyst Aman's
study shows that so in your company with
what we find at people you have 50
people who are mentally ill so they need
to open their eyes except mental
illnesses as normal and believe that
people who are mentally ill can actually
function and work and they need support
when a company does not support there
are relapses if we support someone with
an email if we support someone with
heart disease why can't we support
someone with a mentally the Mental
Health Care Act 2018 talks about it with
Disability Act new Act does talk about
it
there are so many laws which asks
companies private as well as as well as
government to take care of government
companies no problems all that are used
people are not turned out of their jobs
but believe me
private companies where they ask people
do up for 14 to 16 hours yes
that was actually going to be okay good
things yes our vision of the company
mission of the company exactly very
sophisticated Lee they exclude the
mentally ill you know at all I wanted to
ask you this question this is a question
that's come in it says is it necessary
for companies to make us work 10 14
hours a day
can't companies reduce these work hours
and provide solutions that clearly
affect the mental health of employees
somebody else said extend this to the
media industry where it's normal they
have to be I mean 10 14 hours working in
some industries making you for example
you know you guys worked so hard I mean
you work so long hours you know but
mental health as as an issue should be
tackled separately no respect of the
number of hours you work I think 1012
hours everybody works today I think in
Bombay in including travel and things
like that
you know I think but yeah it's just we
as doctors headrest it has to be looked
in its entirety in this totality and not
like you know rushed on of exhaustion
yes here's the question right if someone
turns around and says I don't feel good
I feel low I don't feel involved and it
could be any number of things from
simply being burnt out at your job to
you know maybe there's something
happening in your life or it could be
something medical purely medical right
how important is it for people around to
not say things like our er let's go get
a drink we'll be fine or go you know why
don't you take a few days off and just
chill or go see your parents these are
not solutions go see a professional is
perhaps the only thing that should be
said I guess it depends on how severe is
the situation for how many days it's
really been going on it's just a one-off
episode but if it's been going on for a
while maybe a month or two and it's
repeated and it's really coming in the
way of daily functioning
daily
then yes she he should go and see a
mental health professional because then
going and having coffee is not going to
help or going anything a middle - not
going to help well it's just a one-off
thing then maybe it's just maybe it's
just about regular ability like session
which she did people asked what is the
difference between sadness and
depression how do I come to know yes if
sadness is for a short period like India
loses a match of sad for one day but if
you're you know sad for like a month off
is a problem I mean long time absolutely
depression even it was one patient who
told me my father went and talked to my
boss my child named D and then what
happened I got sympathy but not work huh
so you start to exclude the person from
heavy lifting and you need to understand
that this person should not be kept away
from work if his recovered assess him
and see that he is meaningfully occupied
so we swing to excessive sympathy entity
to hostility and rejection there are
times when people would if they I mean
we need to we need to understand one
thing for sure that most of us live most
of our wait time at workplace yes you
know so it becomes extremely important
in the workplace everyone at workplace
is the alternate family that they're
looking out for and and they find one or
two support systems in that family where
people could reach out and people could
speak about these things most often what
really happens is some ad hoc solution
keep oh cello walk pucelli job to Tico
jogger yes oh this all of this if you
don't know a solution then please don't
advise yes you know so don't tell things
like oh all this is there in your head
everything will get sorted what
everything that you can ask yes you know
yes Wow I remember this conversation
coming up specifically when the pickup
article talked about how she was going
through depression rich people problems
it's a rich people problem B why would
someone who has everything be depressed
it's a fad article fashion who get
depression baldness all of these
things and what we the dis service we
might be doing through all of this is
even if someone wants to talk about it
they probably go back into their shell
because of all the negativity literally
so that's the whole thing right about
this the whole thing about the stigma
you just don't want to talk about it
because people around are not even
allowing you to talk so mental Health's
really doesn't discriminate like amongst
people I mean it can just happen to
anybody I think that's a really
important thing to understand dr. Shetty
you don't even need a reason it's not
like something bad has to happen to you
in order for you cannot do anybody
though some are more prone to it but in
the offices in work places in schools
and colleges we need to train mental
soldiers who can identify early signs
who can help them reach a mental health
professional early and who can
differentiate from a sprain and a
fracture that is the key so just as we
can really prefer still area just as we
can talk about we can diagnose malaria
easily we can diagnose infectious
disease aliy and a common man knows the
signs similarly we need to build this
science into in a common line and I
think companies need to start
understanding that mentally if you if
you incorporate this and you need to
have a culture manager in every
organization so that everyone feels
included everyone feels welcome and
everyone has that one person that they
could reach out to so you might you
might call that culture manager or
psychologists you can call the culture
manager something else but it's
important to have that one person who is
focusing on mental health of the whole
organization so yes we were just
developed a program at Janet's in its in
collaboration with an Australian Foreman
it's called mental health first aid and
that's exactly what it does it drains
people lay people to become the first
point of contact yes other than in fact
a lot of the messages I got on Twitter
were about coaching classes were about
entrance exams
what about board exams and though and I
even got parents who wrote to me saying
you know my deepest fear is every time I
read a news story about a child or a
young person committing suicide because
of exam pressure yeah what do I do
because
a lot of friends also teenagers pull
away from their parents because that's
the natural thing to do at that age it
becomes even more difficult for parents
to look for signs kids today are deaf so
much pressure
first against peer cerebus comparing
each other then from parents then from
car then this entire thing that you know
you know we've been go to college isn't
telling people just chill you know take
it easy this is an exam it's not the end
does it work to tell them to just chill
I I think you know when we talk at least
I give them my examples like I also I am
an engineering I'm good man I had my
etiquette is it's okay to get an 80
Katie it is not the end of the world you
know things don't stop you know fellow
fairly successful today and what I'm
doing it's you know if I would have lost
all hope is that 180 Katie I got a bit
you know miserable so I'm just saying
it's it's okay I mean just take it very
easy you know there's more to life than
just that one exam that one board exam
you know which is there to it I think
it's important that when we when we
always force people to be the first the
second you know you you have to be
number one at everything I think to be
number one and to come and zero in your
personal life is the worst thing that
could happen to anyone so I think if you
are consistently mediocre and if you and
if you count the your success ratio
you'll be much more happier well you
know I remember reading somewhere that
all parents want their child to be best
and first in class and best at sports so
who's going to be the remaining you know
40 from two to 40 who's who's got to
fill those spots and everybody wants to
be the focus should be in being happy
you know a focus is not reaching like
like like a senior really could be could
be that I want to become a million
dollar company but not every employer
what they wants to become a million
dollar this thing the purpose of
everyone is to find happiness I think
it's also important as parents that if
we are able to cull out the best out of
every tribe because every child is
different every child is born with a
different talent and if we are able to
really hone that and bring it out and
get let them perform at their potential
which is obviously going to be different
I think that should be the guiding force
I was a middling very ordinary child my
parents allowed me to do that and they
were very kind we I also go back to her
song yeah because
and his organization are doing something
called Alzheimers week or as Emma's
Awareness Week because of the fact that
we as Indians or Indian families don't
catch it fast enough paying close enough
attention harsh could you take us
through you know the need for
Alzheimer's awareness right now in India
so according to the statistics around 4
million people and more suffer from as
Imus right now in India and numbers are
increasing so my organization of this
year focused on every month we will take
one disorder and we run a campaign on
Instagram to the youngsters Arnold and
the people who are there to make them
aware about that particular disorder in
a very factual way the need of this is
because so for example I will give you
an example people think as dimers
and dementia are the same thing but
depend amenge an umbrella disorder and
as Imus is a disease which is on the
spectrum of the of dementia but has
different properties there are different
ways to treat the both so this confusion
also leads to stigma because of which
people don't live a life of respect as
well and we want that that to change so
that's why we are focusing on each
disorder every every month to make
people more aware about them you know
someone's actually just responded to us
right now saying it's easy to say that
failures alright if you're sitting in a
TV studio but in reality enduring
failure can be very very difficult so
yes I think what is important is we need
to teach life skills to children in
schools managing frustrations managing
anger managing sadness and this can be
actually taught to schools that were
taught to choose not a very early age
but again I'm gonna come back to the
fact that what we taught this I mean I I
don't recall our era was different ma'am
I had six hours to play
I could go to play unstructured games
screams in a structured manner we were
not taught resilience but when we played
it just came in the normal course of
things because you don't can't win every
time so you learn to take failure you
know strife
I feel two years I repeated my twelfth
and I repeat in my first year in BSC and
those were the best years of my life I
excelled in every extracurricular
activity during those years and I think
it's a it's extremely important to
understand as majority said to find out
what exactly a child is interested you
know I read one thing that I really
think parents should know about and dr.
Shetty their parents in India do this
thing where they try and put their child
in a year early so you have someone
who's se5 in a classroom full of
six-year-olds and there is there's
always been this impression that this is
a good thing but research has shown us
that it's a very very bad thing so you
know even I mean just to just admit to
the person six months early you were
born maybe slightly earlier you want to
smuggle that child in it's actually
better for a child to be older and more
developed when they go to school so very
cheaper to choose schools are extremely
sensitive and society is always try to
preempt things there's a tomato shortage
they'll buy all the tomatoes on the same
day but if a relaxer said he will say
will not eat tomatoes let's come later
so it's a mindset issue I think but you
know like at school at the school are
embracing more and more parents now
willing to put their children a little
later but I realize that you know that
the child will be better off being the
eldest in class rather than the youngest
and that's important I hope all parents
watching have registered that the child
is always better off going and slightly
late than going in earlier than
everybody else's one very important
thing you know parents have this
constant parents teachers professors
colleagues bosses all of us have got
this thing of competition but escape
into you know baju share magic abate
echidnas aparajita yep into kitna
chopper die kurta and and you
all these pit people against each other
do I think that will happen like human
beings bye-bye nature will see
differences and anxious human beings
will always differentiate and and
discriminate no it happens on Facebook
people put their results online icse
ninety five point three five and maybe a
person owes put ninety five got ninety
point five point one final feels like
little should have put because my friend
is about ninety five but but they all
were ninety five step forward what is
happening in the virtual world basically
each one of us everyone is trying to
project a perfect was yes because they
want to project that my world is better
than your world picture you know and
actually that that is that is not true I
mean it's a fallacy right a young person
who said that how are people so happy
all the time
because everything looks so good and
people are putting on the you know three
degrees better than their real lives and
dramas yes absolutely
okay to if I'm upset about something the
first thing that I will do is I will go
on Facebook and say today I'm having a
bad yeah it's important to also voice
out these things and to tell people and
when you did so many people do yeah so
this is something I'm sure you used to
saying are one hour is up restart i but
this is I think a really quick one hour
because there's so much to talk about in
this particular topic and I will ask for
a commitment that you guys will come
back and we answer more questions and
will dedicate more time to this again
for everyone who's watching there are
phone numbers on the screen if you want
get in touch with my team and we'll give
you the contact details of someone who
can help out irrespective of whatever
you're feeling even if you suspect
slightly that you have a problem or
you're facing something or feeling
something get in touch and we'll forward
or we will send you to the right person
this is the first time that this is
happening television studio is becoming
a helpline thank you so much
so we will continue to be a helpline I
will personally make a commitment here
that I will dedicate time to the issue
of mental health and we will bring it
into mainstream
so more of us can talk about it for
everyone who's sitting here right now
thinking oh my god is that is my friend
going through something is a family
member going through something should
have noticed just lending listening here
and then offer to go with them to a
counselor offer to find the number of a
counselor or further help in that way do
not ask the person to walk it off to be
happy to get a drink to watch a movie
actually seek help talk about it and
seek help and we're always here if you
were to need us thanks for watching

so we're currently awaiting information
about new CBI chief is likely to be
announced in the next few minutes
Meenakshi my colleague is live right now
outside the Prime Minister's residence
where the meeting is underway where the
panel is currently in the process of
choosing the new CBI chief mean actually
when is the meeting likely to end at
what time did Mallikarjun Carnegie go in
and what what information are you
expecting well of FA as a matter of fact
are we just breaking news that the
meeting has concluded Honorable Chief
Justice of India has left the Prime
Minister's residence and this is a
meeting which comprised Chief Justice of
India a leader of opposition Malkiel
jimkar gay and Prime Minister and has
lasted for one ah
so clearly it is a very very significant
meeting the outcome of which is very
keenly awaited of course there are
probables who are in the running about
10 or 12 of them from which they've
called out five probable candidates the
five or six probable candidates but then
again we've been given to understand at
this juncture that honorable Chief
Justice of India and malik al junker
gave had a very key role to play and why
this meeting has been so important is
simply because of this faith we have
seen the agency in the midst of so much
churning and even today we have seen
some dramatic developments happen in the
Supreme Court pertaining to the interim
director CBI Nageswara Rao his
appointment that petition is still
pending in the Supreme Court Monday so
if a decision or outcome is not arrived
at today that petition will not become
in fractious so it is in the interests
of the agency and also with the role
that honorable Chief Justice of India
would have played in the meeting details
or we will try to gather from our
sources in a short while because
remember this is a breaking news
scenario but we are confirming to our
viewers a faith at this meeting has just
concluded it has lasted for a duration
of one hour honorable Chief Justice of
India has left his residence has left
the Prime Minister's residence and there
is a possibility that some kind of a
consensus
has been arrived at in this meeting
because this is the post a which is so
critical and for all the three parties
to really arrive at a consensus
pertaining to a candidate or with a
decent track record is of utmost
importance yes for restoring the majesty
and the integrity of the agency back to
its original glory I mean actually there
was a statement that was made by
Mallikarjun Carr gay in which he
basically voiced his unhappiness about
the fact that the shortlisted names were
not shared with him he said in fact he
was given a list of 90 names and the
government had not informed him about
the shortlisted candidates but from your
you know from from the report that you
just gave us this meeting only lasted an
hour which means that they might have
reached some sort of understanding or
they would have all you know perhaps
unanimous decision what are you picking
up well yes sir very interesting
questions that and that is a water we
will be attaining clarity on in another
perhaps ten to fifteen minutes time
because of course because the meeting
has been so high octane and because the
stakes have been so high on this one all
that has transpired thus far has been
completely secretive but yes we have
been given to understand that honorable
Chief Justice of India has had a very
very important role to play because
remember even his presence here was
something that he was very confident
about he had announced that he would
attend this meeting in open court and
today he has been present so that is a
presence which will really go on a to be
perhaps the defining factor but again we
are not hazarding a guess at at this
point in time on who are the shortlisted
candidates if or not a consensus has
been arrived at but yes there is all
indication that there is some sort of a
consensus element that these three have
agreed upon and why this is so important
again to underline the fact because
there is a petition already pending in
the Supreme Court which is challenging
the placing of Nageshwar Rao as interim
director CBI is saying that there is no
such provision in law for an interim
director CBI so therefore for this
really very important significant post
this
outcome of the meeting where you've been
given to understand that there could be
a possible announcement about who then
these three have selected or will be
attained that are shortly fake well I
mean actually do you have information on
the names that are under consideration
we understand there were a list of 12
contenders finally that was discussed in
this meeting and very interestingly we
also know that perhaps for the first
time there might be an outside chance
that the CBI would have a woman director
well indeed way those are the
interesting questions that we will be
attaining some clarity on in another
perhaps 10 to 15 minutes once we have
confirmed about what has transpired
inside the meeting remember that far
that the meeting and whatever has
transpired is very very secretive
because there have been only three
people who have been present leader of
opposition Mallikarjun car gay our
honorable Chief Justice of India and the
Prime Minister himself indeed there are
a lot of serving bureaucrats who have
been in the contention of or director
CBI post we have had we have showcased
on well now five or six possible strong
contenders with good prospects but then
again this is something which really
these three only would be a would would
be in a position to share for the detail
so on but we are expecting some some
leads on what has transpired in the
meeting another 10 15 minutes to firm up
faith all right I mean actually in fact
I will give you some time obviously to
pick up more information for us and come
back with more information my colleague
Ben actually they're bringing us
information about the fact that the
selection panel meeting has in fact
ended a little earlier than we expected
this evening and we will have an
announcement fairly soon very
interesting the list of names being
considered by the panel and a huge task
ahead for the person and that's the list
of names a few huge task ahead for the
person who will be picked and the name
that would be announced joining me on
the show analyst Inc for the BGP others
seeing over I for the Congress we need
in senior journalist Kira got the worm
former CBI officer ml Sharma former CBI
special director and Sanjay Haggard a
senior advocate at the Supreme Court
good evening and welcome to all of you I
thank you for your time
mr. Sharma my first question is to you
we will have an announcement in a little
while but this is a you know way
unprecedented circumstances under which
any of these names would be named
director we've had between 30 and 40
transfers happen in the last you know 10
days or so
the CBS actually come out talking about
the fact that it is purging the
organization that there is a massive
cleanup underway we know there are
several positions within the CBI that
have gone on occupied for a very long
time what do you see as the channel the
challenge ahead for the person who gets
elected well the person who gets elected
the first thing he must do is to put a
lid on the transfers at least for first
three or four months of his tenure he
should understand the organization the
working of the organization the
capability of the officers the kind of
work they can do and only then he should
do or undo these transfers this has been
really unfortunate that so many
transfers have been made by the regular
director and the interim director is
totally destabilize a system this
doesn't happen often the CBI but I'm
sure if a capable man is chosen who
knows the CBI
he should take some time and he'll bring
the organization to its glory which it
had one point of time so I'm very
optimistic about it so long as capable
and experienced director and director
who has experience of the organization
if he selected a capable and experienced
director mr. Sanjay I agree obviously a
lot has gone on in the CBI there is
still one case in Supreme Court at this
point when this name is being announced
these transfers again action by
Nageshwar Rao who was not to make any
any big decisions in the last in his
last
before that you know interruption what
what do you personally think would be
the future of the CBI now do you think
that it's possible to sort of forget
about everything that has happened and
start afresh
well the CBI has no option but to do
that because obviously here the past is
the past
you okay you can't expect and nobody
wants those days back we're number one
and number two were fighting
if you I do hope that whichever choice
is made is made unanimously and at least
the two participants in it must be aware
that two three months down the line with
with the elections being there they
their roles could alternate and so what
the CBI must now be seen to have a
director who as fast as possible makes
it a political and an impartial
investigating agency for the past
several CBI directors have been saying
the same thing that the Central Bureau
of Investigation is really the central
the center's Bureau of Investigation
whoever is in power in the center seems
to prod it push it manipulate it in in
in a direction that makes it intensely
political it is time to D politicize
keep politicians at an arm's length and
investigate all of them equally I hope
whoever is chosen has that as a mission
statement regain the impartiality of the
institution first the way without that
nothing else matters the man made the
man made him the man a woman may be
personally absolutely clean but if the
person concerned does not have spine
may I and the sheer bullheadedness to
keep all politicians out I don't think
this CBI will recover the nearest
example I can give to somebody who was
totally a political and who actually
threatened to resign if politicians came
interfered with his working was mister
each other and who launched so many
railway projects and the Delhi Metro
there were times when politicians
suggested things and he just told them
to go fly a kite we need somebody who
can do the same with the CBI mr. Vitti
Turin do you think it's possible to have
a completely apolitical CBI at this
point well as Sanjay rightly says that's
what is the desire and that's what is
the expectation of the nature but you
know based on our past experience it
looks less likely that a director will
be absolutely impartial especially this
being the election here I mean there are
apprehension by their position leaders
that there be tremendous pressure on CBI
to act in a particular way it all
depends on who's selected and what is
his credential what has been his past
who has behaved in the past when he was
posted in the States or in CBI it has he
had or she had a leaning towards any
political party or has been impartial as
he as he or she succumbed to pressures
from political masters or it be the
straightforward person
it all depends on individual sonic
appendage face that you may create any
system but it is the individual which
make or unmake a system so we should
hope that we get such a straightforward
person but it is a tightrope walking for
a new director well another thing and
other thing Bogra here my questions to
you and elegy does this it has the last
three months been clearer evidence of
the fact that politicians in politics
has interfered with the CBI
I do not agree with you faith the last
three months we can say yes it was a
very turmoil period for the CBI when it
went to top officers of the CBI an
organization which is being trusted and
feared equally by the people of this
country they got into tussle and it
became a very serious comic affair but
now the things has been sorted out and
very soon the announcement of the new
director will be there and I'm pretty
sure the trust which the people of this
country has in this organization it will
continue like that only and as one of
our esteemed panelists said that there
should be an officer who is apolitical
and he should have guts enough to say no
to the politician who tried to corner
him so definitely I also agree to it and
no like no one no politician no
political party anybody can force and
any officer to do something which he
doesn't wants to so today we are
empowered in the center yesterday it was
Congress but at the same time to Alec
officers are there they come to the not
they are being posted tomorrow also will
be there so like they are posted there
they are there to do their job to
deliver their duties so I am pretty sure
the highest so one second analyzing
whatever the name of the high level
committee is going to finalize it will
be good enough so I mean I think I'm a
little concerned about the fact that
there's there's no acceptance on this on
the part of government or BGP
representatives that there hasn't been a
can I interrupt
yes Ok Go Ahead Center yeah go ahead no
no I I was just checking some of my
Twitter timeline we and somebody whom I
trust seems to think that no decision
was arrived at today okay so it okay
it's it's possible we don't have a
confirmation on that all we know so far
is that the meeting has ended we don't
know what the decision has been but I
want to go back to what
was saying to say an elegy that there
was no interference whatsoever from
government or from politicians is
actually a denial of the problem how do
we ever fix the problem if the people in
power won't accept that we have a
problem to begin with mr. Rogow Thurman
is a former CBI officer so irrelevant is
is it necessary for government or for
politicians to accept that there is a
problem in the CBI and if we want it if
to be mended and to be healed that
they're going to have to give it some
space yeah what his father past is past
nothing can be retrieved whatever has
been done damage or a demolition or
whatever the name of the institution of
the CBI it's all gone now it has to be
rebuilt and the task the Herculean task
is on the prospective director who is
going to be selected if he is in line
with a politician of a ruling politician
then the same continuous but if he has
the because the tenure post it's a
tenure post and as contemplated he
cannot be transferred or he cannot be
terminated without taking the selection
panel committee so he must be up right
off his earned a straight forward
officer and work knowing officer that
should be the basic criteria for this
work because this safe straight of CBI
is a confused the Bureau of
Investigation now and everybody is
confused we do not know where or what is
going on and which officer is going to
be transferred or which officer is going
to be investigated which case and this
this sort of things is prevailing and
that should be an end to it and the
selection panel committee knows one of
the panel number was telling it is a no
decision has taken it should not be in
my opinion because the interim director
cannot continue to be a director and for
a long time and there may be some gap
between the selection process and all
these things but now that this situation
has come that there is a necessity there
is a necessity to appoint a director one
day the governor and the final number
aren't especially that you
this must insist to come out with the
name because they have to select out of
the panel which has been submitted to
them they cannot now bring a new man
from outside the panel and among the
panel officers only
it's a quatre force to only IPS officers
criminate it so they can't decide it on
this issue and this will be again yeah
damage to the organization and tell upon
the government in action I will tell you
right away yes and I cannot aren't they
especially there is another thing even
if a new director is appointed mr.
Benington our enemy is there and the
entire effort which he has put to Dima
do away with the single director has
become a law and a DSP Act has been
amended the so pundants of the
Prevention of Corruption Act will lie
with the CBC and the other cases will
lie with the government central
government and the director will only
have to look after the administrative
work so if the rule of law is that and
what is the power dependence and
everybody is talking about it which I
don't know who do not know ok the
Prevention of Corruption Act has been
amended the criminal misconduct has been
taken away the boy one day on his left
the flesh and blood of the CBI has been
taken out on account of the amendment of
the Prevention of Correction accredited
ESP Act ok I want to make a point
yes the after the 10 your first worldly
in CBI art after the 10 your first was
introduced only because of Anita
neuronal case yes I see the number of
directors are becoming corrupt and they
are being getting booked or in cases it
is not it was not there earlier but the
normal process had gone to us appointing
a director that was not the case
nobody was chargesheeted for a
corruption charges earlier but now after
getting the tenure post the offices were
important themselves to be anything
whatever they like yes I've got to
corruption yeah I just want to point out
I just I just wanna term a term or 10
you poor yes just sorry for interrupting
you mr öktem and i just want to point
out that our source is also at this
point they're telling us the same thing
that
decision was arrived at in this meeting
that the panel is likely to meet again
we don't know whether that meeting will
happen tomorrow or when that fell when
the meeting is scheduled for but this is
what we have right now meeting has been
inconclusive these are the sources these
are the myriad of sources that are
confirming to us that the meeting was
inconclusive and no decision was arrived
at so just you know what mr. Daaga the
man was telling us that this is perhaps
not a very good sign because the CBI
needs its director as quickly as
possible I saw very thin put his hand up
how long do you think the CBI could go
Israel without a director at this point
that's very unfortunate but the point I
wanted to make was about this canoer
thing as you must have heard me earlier
all Sonia channel another channel that
it has been 21 years since that judgment
came in a while a case with interim case
and we have experienced some very
unpleasant situations when successive
directors have been electing corrupt and
all so I think it is high time that
Supreme Court should I have you know
dwelled upon the subject fixed and or
has not been a very good idea I write I
mean I agree with the panelists there
people are taking it for granted that
now they have a fix I know they can do
anything but firstly secondly the
judgment which came in the case of mr.
al lugar must petition also came very
late and it was nothing new which the
court said I mean that the same judgment
could have come three months before also
that matter should go to the committee
regarding your question about the period
for which we can wait to have a director
I think it should be done as soon as
possible but the question here is that
the process still is very faulty the
panel which has been recommended by the
selection committee to this special
committee the members do not know the
background of these people and in a
one-hour meeting how do you expect Chief
Justice or leader position Prime
Minister know the president of the
division so the suggestions are that
either the name should have been
circulated 15 days in advance or they
should be put up on a website where
people can comment and react
I mean it needs a lot of improvement and
I'm not very sure about the law point
but can it be that the committee meets
and appoints an interim director not
going by the judgement we need a
judgement they should appoint for at
least three months or something and
meanwhile we all work together to
improve the system as we go to our
reporter who's outside of the Prime
Minister's Office minoc Prime Minister's
residence I mean actually go ahead well
laugh a mr. Mali cogent car gay a leader
of opposition has just returned after
having concluded that meeting with the
Prime Minister and also honorable Chief
Justice of India at this juncture flash
sources are confirming to us that these
three will have to meet again
this is mr. Mallikarjun car gay he has
just got back from his meeting with
Prime Minister of India on which Chief
Justice of India we have been trying to
get access to his car but as you can see
he is being thronged by numerous others
and he is engaging in a brief
conversation with those who are at this
point in time seeking some sort of
clarity from him but this much is
confirmed at this point in time trade
that these three will be meeting again
the meeting which we have been
highlighting was so important that these
three arrived at a consensus on possible
a candidate for Director CBI's position
that to consensus hasn't been arrived at
it has proved to be inconclusive the
date for the next meeting is not yet
known but indeed these three will have
to meet again to perhaps finally and
decide on who should be appointed
director CBI the big news breaking at
this point in time as we were just
showing the visuals of malocclusion car
games returned from that meeting after
having met a prime minister Chief
Justice of India for nearly an hour to
maybe pick up what he's telling the
other journalists if he has a statement
to make perhaps about you know about the
decision or the lack of decision that
was taken in today
reading and while meenakshi moves closer
to that car and update for our viewers
the hype the high-profile panelled met
this evening about an hour ago this is
the head of the Opposition mr.
Mallikarjun Cargill the Chief Justice of
India Arjun Gaga and the prime minister
who's the chairperson of this panel to
choose the next CBI chief from what we
understand there were 12 names in the
fray 12 candidates and this is really
you know two comes in from various
levels of screening and it has been
placed before the three member selection
committee they were to make their
decision today remember the CBI has gone
without a director effectively since
October when the director al apartment
was removed and since then it has had a
tumultuous quarter and the interim
directors whose position is also under
question in the Supreme Court of whether
or not his appointment was valid given
that it did not involve this panel that
was meant to appoint him now the interim
director has also actions several
transfers in what the CBI has called a
cleanup of the system they've said and I
quote carried out these transfers have
been carried out to purge the
organization and restore the internal
checks and balances and the strength of
the organization so between between 30
and 40 CBI officers have been
transferred in the last month alone and
this would have obviously led to several
vacancies in the system several
departments that are perhaps without
heads at this point I understand that
Mallikarjun carga has moved away from
where he was and we're just waiting for
Meenakshi to give us a little more
information on on what might have
happened in this meeting and why it was
inconclusive because as we understand
there is a there is a need right now for
the CBI to have the names it says now
this is the information I'm picking up
Sanjay I agree it says meeting was
inconclusive because they were 70 or 80
names under consideration other one
second before I go to Sanjay I agree
with Fidel but I have you picked up any
information from mr. kargh a is there
any information from inside the Congress
right now as to what happened in that
meeting
well perhaps if you'd come to me earlier
I could throw some light this is for the
first time that the government has sent
19 names without giving us any
background of the individuals and their
prior experience how does the government
expect the committee members to take a
decision based on incomplete information
the least the government could have done
is to at least give us prior experience
of these officers so that the other two
committee members can take a decision
can take an informed decision this is
point number one point number two mr.
Modi appears to be desperate to appoint
the CBI director and perhaps that's the
reason why he's withholding information
and this also flows from the fact that
even at the time of removal of mr.
lawhead ma the CVC report the report of
Justice Pat Nayak was not furnished
before the committee members and perhaps
if that report had been furnished the
other member the third member could have
come to a different conclusion as for
the Congress parties concerned Fay we
are very clear we want the process to be
transparent and fair we want seniority
to be followed we want the process to be
transparent in addition to the fact that
all information about the antecedents of
the officers is placed before the
committee number 3 flowing from the
Supreme Court judgment and in occurrence
case unimpeachable integrity is
non-negotiable the Congress party is
very clear about this over the past
three three and a half years we've seen
the institution of the CBI and other
investigating agency is taking a beating
on the point of the CDI is integrity
also I want to remind you that it was in
the 2g scam under the UPA regime that
the Supreme Court called the CBI a caged
parrot but let me just put on the screen
right now the information that we have
and this is this is the information we
have the meeting was inconclusive
because there were 70 to 80 names under
consideration and more details needed to
be sought for the names that are under
consideration which is why the meeting
couldn't reach a conclusion the Prime
Minister will decide the next date of
the meeting likely to be next week and
that's the information we have right now
I want to go back to my guests with this
information when Ethan is
is this part of protocol to have 80
names on the table when the panel meets
how are they to choose 180 names yes
precisely I was mentioning before we
learned for a direct report from the
reporter that background of the
candidate should be put up on a website
or at least the majority members should
get them at least a fortnight in advance
so that they can check through their own
contacts as the Sanjay was also
mentioned a little while ago I mean
there must be a process to eliminate the
less qualified or less competent or less
desirable candidate but in this kind of
a jumbled of you know nobody's numbers
of so many candidates without having
their background it's very difficult for
a member but is this protocol to
represent 80 names this would be all the
names that fall into that category of
the certain of the cauda and the a and
the seniority which means that no
shortlist was drawn up by the government
at all normal normal practice here yes
normal practice has been of much lesser
number of candidate proposed it'd never
been such a large number they've been
about a dozen names which were earlier
acquainted
yes this is unusual what is happening
now today I don't see I see your hand up
go ahead you know feel the Congress
is also highlighted there soon empty no
experience in investigation of
anti-corruption cases is also very
important even in the case of the
previous CBI director we saw we're
actually recommended an officer who had
prior experience and prior experience in
the workings of the CBI so we expect the
government mr. Modi's again pushing
through names that's why I go back to my
first argument it is important to share
their prior experience why is the
government shying away from that is it
because they want to cover up
investigation they want to cover up
tracks for the scans which have been
done this is the way in which the BJP
throttles institutions they withhold
information they mislead committee
members they keep officers were
otherwise were immense experience in
corruption cases outside the zone of
consideration that is why I again
highlight the process must be
transparent and this is where the BJP is
again faltering yes I just want to take
this back to the panel Sanjay Hegarty
information we have right now 70 or 80
names were provided to the panel and the
only information on the candidates that
were given to them apparently was their
dates of joining and their dates of
retirement and this is when the Chief
Justice of India run gen go-go asked for
more details on these names in order to
be able to make a better decision which
is why the meeting was inconclusive
this seems sharply out of ordinary
Sanjay I agree I don't think that the
government of the day was serious in
appointing a CBI director that's the
only conclusion I can draw or that it
has been properly legally advised after
all that has happened in the past few
months if you decide that you are going
into a meeting with the Chief Justice of
India and the leader of the opposition
to decide on who is to head the agency
the least that can be expected is enough
homework done on the part of the
government you can't just say 7080
people okay let's play a any mini money
more you have to make out a case of each
candidate and and
say maybe maybe you could have had a
shortlist of six people 12 people
whatever and out and whoever is the
advising agency we would have to list
out the the candidates merits and
demerits according to any known criteria
the mayor saying that the government
doesn't seem too affected in is the
possibility of a challenge to this
appointment and please if the if the
Chief Justice of India or any senior
judge of the Supreme Court is to be on
the committee you can be jolly very sure
that they are aware that this will come
back to the Supreme Court in a challenge
I have been watching a committee which
is not given enough material or adequate
material to consider yes that
committee's decision would be legally
vulnerable yes okay so for this the
Chief Justice of India was was
absolutely right in saying please give
me material which is relevant right
Meenakshi bunch of my colleague joins me
again she's outside of Marrakesh and
Kyrgyz house main actually what have you
picked up for us what is what are the
sources what are your sources telling
well absolutely fair our we have firmed
up information about why this meeting
has proved to be inconclusive that has
lasted for an odd and this is a top
source based info because remember it
was a very high-powered secretive
meeting but we know the reasons why
today's meeting has proved to be
inconclusive which is this way there
have been about 70 to 80 names that have
been under consideration
but the DOPT sent this particular list
with only dates of joining and dates of
retirement of all these candidates
honorable Chief Justice of India pressed
for greater details in this particular
meeting and also leader for position
mark Arjun kar gaye has sought more
details of these possible 70 to 80
candidates because of which today a
decision or a consensus was not attained
given the fact further clarity on the
details of these possible candidates has
been sought
and therefore our today's meeting stands
inconclusive and adjourned and we've
been given to understand that the next
date of the meeting is going to be set
by the prime minister's office sometime
in the forthcoming week fit all right
Ben actually many thanks for bringing us
that update and we will stay with you
two to break any more information that
you might pick up this evening for our
audience while we try and get more
information right now I want to take the
question to ml Sharma former CBI special
director mr. Sharma in your opinion is
this protocol to present 70 or 80 names
with just the dates of joining and
retirement because from what we
understand IPS officers of the 1982 to
1985 batches were in contention
contention for the post and that would
be the entire list of 70 or 80 people I
see in my opinion our gjermund of the
meeting is a very routine thing okay
reason being that the government knows
all about the professional caliber and
the ethical standards or the officers
but Leader of Opposition perhaps may not
know therefore he goes back with these
names and collects some more information
from his party sources or administrative
sources now the real handicap in my
opinion is that of the Chief Justice of
India he doesn't know any officer so
therefore and he can't go only by record
therefore he goes back and he collects
some more information I think next
meeting the matter will be sorted out to
say that enough information is not put
up before the committee by the
government according to me is not a
correct assessment of the situation
service records are put up and all kind
of details are put up but this hyper
committee each member of it before
putting his seal and signature on
particular candidate has to know more
about him and also more about his rivals
so therefore it's not an unusual thing
for the meeting to be adjourned
and another meeting to be held to
finally decide the meta another thing
that I want to say is that kind of
politics that we have in this country
and going by the past experience the
Prime Minister and the Lehrer position
yes are not going to agree on anyone
names yes even if he is made of gold and
therefore what's all tactical purposes
the casting vote is with the Chief
Justice yes but my colleague buf doshas
on the phone line right now but those
what could you tell us about this
meeting is it unorthodox for the
government to present 70 or 80 names
without any details other than gesture
dates of joining and retirement up here
adding to what special form of special
director I will share one has said these
were peeps one of the most upright
officers in him who had an impeccable
career record these names have already
been vetted by CVC these officers have
spent over 30 years in service they all
have a very clean record
and as he was saying that government
knows about all of them in fact some of
these officers have served in CBI some
of them had virtually or have spent time
in witness department so they all are
they all in fact passed the the laydown
criterion the problem before before the
selection committee is is to find the
right candidate because he has a very
big task ahead he has to clean the image
of CBI it is at at an all-time low he
has to make sure that the controversy
that broke out last year should not be
repeated of these 80 names some of them
had in fact some very long tenure in CBI
some of them have handled very sensitive
cases as far as their officers are
concerned the final list is it turn on
trailer 13 and among them someone would
become the director of CBI maybe by next
week no but above those do we know
whether the list a shortlist of 12 or 13
names was presented to the panel or was
it the entire list of 80 names
ruff - ruff - can you hear me we seem to
have lost our connection
I'm gonna go back to ml Chhabra mr.
Sharma forgive me I apologize to you for
interrupting but you did say of course
that the casting vote will effectively
belong to the Chief Justice of India and
this is going to be like brush was
telling us a very difficult decision to
make
no I'm happy that the meeting has been
adjourned so that the Chief Justice of
India has a little more time to go
through the service records whose names
have come up and also to collect some
more information about these individuals
it's not possible to collect this
information because these officers were
under consideration they have put in 34
to 35 a service so the reputation is
well known in their respective carders
so therefore and since for all practical
purposes Chief Joseph India is going to
be the decider
so therefore it is good that he is
taking time to make up his mind
so I find nothing unusual and I am very
confident that this time going by you
know suffering from the past experience
yes the committee will come up with the
best name I am fond of saying that
director CBI should have three
qualifications one he should have
professional rigor which means
experience of the CBI and second is
integrity top personal integrity
unless year's top facility integrity he
can't drink about integrity in the
organization and third one is neutrality
about which other panels have also
spoken it is possible to find such an
officer country is not bereft of such
kind of officers yes but last ten years
I'm sorry to say it has not happened
whether it is this command or earlier
government yes I am not naming me take
that let me take it back - are those
seniors his hand up other you you had
something to add to mr. Sharma's comment
go ahead please
welfare something that what about though
she had said so after the 2004 judgement
in the in occurrence case the Supreme
Court has said that all IPS officers of
the four senior-most batches are
eligible for consideration so that's
perhaps the reason why the numbers gone
up to 80 or 90 but again coming back to
the moot point the process must be
aboveboard
now the government may very well know
about this about the officers who are
eligible for consideration but it's also
important that the other committee
members are briefed about it it is not
that this high-powered committee simply
is a rubber stamp and has to agree with
the prime minister so therefore the
government before even calling for the
first meeting should have furnished the
information allowing the other committee
members to consider and to thereafter
come to a final conclusion the manner in
which the prime minister has gone about
this entire process and also in
conjunction with Nageshwar Rao
appointment whereby he bypassed the
high-powered committee and appointed a
CBI director where the matter is of
course before the court just shows the
disrespect to legal processes it just
shows the disrespect to the sanctity of
institutions which are running last
question we're in a crisis situation
where whether it's the RBI whether it's
the ni a the CBI Finance Ministry every
institution is crumbling okay therefore
it is all the more important for mr.
Moody on the eve of the elections to
appear to be aboveboard I have one last
question so we denied for the
acquisition against him right so much
goes our days mr. veeth right yes yes
the question right now this means that
for at least another you know we won't
have we won't have a director in in the
CBI I would you to help us understand if
this is the normal process present 80
names then everybody goes back and does
their research on the 80 names and they
come back again and make a choice or why
wasn't the 12 to 13 name shortlist
presented before the panel I don't think
it's a normal practice it has been only
on couple of occasions when the leader
of position didn't agree for example in
the case of mr. Thomas when redeposition
origin they agree on his name because of
some charge it was filed earlier
so this is not a normal practice but
more important issue is which all of us
are equally concerned that despite this
process how it is that we have
successive directors whose character or
whose conduct has not been aboveboard so
there is a need for review but right now
the immediate emergency or crisis is
that the acting director is not selected
to a proper process yes the his
appointment is challenged Supreme Court
the committee has been has bad today but
has been postponed maybe for a week or
so so next one week is going to be of
more anxiety about the functioning of
CBI let's see how court reacts on this
petition I mean the confusion prevails
and no Direction is visible at this
point till the government is able to
sort out well that's what we were going
to leave it right now or this evening I
just want a quick comment from Sanjay
negative before I wrap this up Sanjay I
agree obviously this means that the
turmoil within the CBI is going to
continue this is not the end of it I
don't think that the government wants to
sort the problem within the CBI
they a weak CBI right now suits the
government interim chief who can who can
take who can just look away whenever
some controversial action is taken by
lower-level officers within the
organisation probably suits the
government much more we are already
witnessing certain raids on the a which
seem to have a political impact I think
the government likes this sense of drift
and we somehow wants to work work of the
rest of its tenure without a permanent
chief well I have a minute
a very quickly Anila Singh go ahead
yeah hey I am really shocked the way mr.
odden and mr. he gray has given their
statements regarding this high-powered
committee do they think that the two
more the three most important people in
this country they are going to do some
sort of fraud I mean I heard bill Salado
saying that this should have but this
should have been done that should have
been done
I mean before even listening or getting
the minutes of the meeting you are just
reacting and you're giving your
statements you have given your
conclusion it is not like that I mean we
are talking about an organization like
CBI we are talking about the appointment
of the director of the CBI and you are
simply accusing the government here you
are accusing the prime minister of this
country as well as you are trying to
show that the Chief Justice of this
country doesn't have any strength off
his so named names of 80 candidates were
put in front of this high-powered
committee and I believe let's see
analyzing an elastic you may have
misheard nobody questioned the Chief
Justice of India at all the question
that was raised was simply why'd was
there an list of 80 names placed before
this panel with no other information
other than their dates of joining and
retirement how is any panel however
powerful they are able
how will they choose out of 80 names if
they don't have information about each
of those candidates and if from what we
understand the government had in fact
shortlisted 12 out of those 80 names
why was the panel not presented with the
12-member shortlist instead of the
entire list of 80 names but this is
where it is right now the meeting that
was held was inconclusive the CBI
doesn't have a new chief this means that
interim chief Nageshwar Rao whose own
position is currently in question in the
Supreme Court he will continue for at
least another week when this meeting
when the panel will be reconvened as of
now what seems on which seems unorthodox
is the government's decision to have
placed 80 names before the panel with
very little information to help the
panel choose it's likely that the panel
needed a week to research these names
and come back with a recommendation
remember they have to choose one person
who will be the next CBI chief that's
the breaking information we have on
mirror now right now stay with us for
more news and updates

good afternoon and welcome to this very
special edition of verified as I as you
know unverified I prefer to introduce
you to the quiet heroes in our society
people who are doing real work the
people who stand up for those who have
no voice and today my guest is extremely
special I'm so excited to be able to
introduce him to you
Deas shivanand there is a former police
officer he retired as the director
general of the police in Maharashtra he
served as the police commissioner of
Mumbai and he is now an angel to those
people in the city of Mumbai who don't
have food and he's in the studio with me
today mr. Stephen thank you so much
thank you for it made me to be here with
you in fact I must tell our audience
that you received the president's
Distinguished Service Medal in the year
2000 the merit is Service Medal in 1993
the internal security medal in 1998 so
first of all I want to on behalf of
those people are watching on television
and on Facebook thank you for your
service
that you've rendered to the city and to
the street into the country but before
we start talking about your good work at
roti Bank I want to start at the very
beginning you grew up in the Milan you
went to a government school what was the
electricity board in and one of this low
level jobs and he used to be transferred
every now and then two years and all
that so I used to be shifted so 10th
standard is our old status so five were
schools we have be seen in two two years
and we used to go so I don't have school
buddies to say that I've got a gang and
I got a five gang but all of them so
when you when you were in school did you
know you wanted to become a police order
to be a professor because that's what I
was told that I was a studious guy was
not outdoor type so there's the darshan
Shiva will become a professor and I
became one before my results came out in
the post graduation someone came and
invited me to be a professor dream come
true so I jumped at it and I was
teaching economics for three years in
which call
in climate or it is a part of the
University of Madras at the time there
was only one University yes so I was
enjoying that job but then you know the
inevitable happened so how did the
inevitable is the one thing the teaching
was little getting very monotonous and
second is for a young man you know I
thought it life should be more
adventurous and I shouldn't have asked
for anything better than getting into
the police it happened I appeared for
all exams and I was selected in the
first attempt for the IPS as I thought
every job is the same I jumped into it
and then had a rollercoaster ride let me
take you back one step
your brother joined the Navy yes you
didn't consider the Navy no not at all
not at right oh because he was an
engineer and then it suited him and then
I that way my sister was married to a
fighter pilot
he's from the NDA and all that tiny
school and all this all of us were
different unions must be very that not
what serine is - yeah so you then
cleared the IPS in the first go and what
happened after that how did you how did
you finally get from Coimbatore to
Mumbai
you know you joined the National Police
Academy and they mix you and make you a
cop out of nobody and then they allot
the cauda and then some people go to
their own state and the others rest of
them put into a group and they are sent
to different states it's a kind of a
system where they allot you - so 50
percent of the IPS and IAS officers in
every state have to me from outside so
you find us a dodgy in Tamilnadu or
Kashmiri in Kerala and the Keralite in
Manipur Tripura so that's a sum that
pertains vision that we should have a
kind of a bomb bonding people who will
keep the country together so I'm here in
the in what was your first posting in -
cetera cetera that's urg what I just see
the power yes and then again I went
there after a few years as super the
police so twice Satara twice Pune as the
Deputy Commissioner and in between
Sindhu do get super on the police the
founding super doubly because it was
just you know bifurcated at the time by
D 10 cm then I walked
in Satara again and then a state
intelligence and the Intelligence Bureau
for six years then six years in the
Mumbai Crime Branch and three years in
the Naxalite area as the Deputy
Inspector General of Police and three
years as the joint director CBI West
Zone and then six years as Commissioner
of Police I was not only for Mumbai I
was there before Nagpur and then Thani
for three and a half years then State
intelligence as the Commissioner
Commissioner I must ask you this so
obviously when you first went to Satara
they would have been some questions
about the fact that your what was what
is popularly called Potosi the best part
is I never studied Hindi I used to get a
good zero in that and they never try to
teach also when they were students yeah
I was antic in the agitation we all used
to be participating in that so that one
game I never knew Hindi so the entire
national police academy one year of
training outdoor is completely in indeed
even ak-47 hand grenades everything all
swear boy everything is talked in in the
early so it was a struggle but I managed
to pass all of them I never failed a
mean in any exam any time in my life so
I know you speak fluent well then what
happened I came here then the Saqqara
people don't speak Hindi so the
policeman when they come in front of you
they say Malaya in d8 mahi if you
understand my Marathi you are my boss
otherwise there is no connect so I said
better to learn Marathi I straightaway
jumped into that I've already secondo
occur in Tamil then various thing so now
I started reading full of Deshpande in
Marathi
then I used to hear daily the TV and TV
wasn't there at the time but the radio
the news yes and then and then see
Maharashtra times and compare Times of
India newspaper then it could be a kind
of a translation so it is a struggle but
I came out very well in that but so that
of the food is fantastic it is good you
have Mahabaleshwar yes and there used to
be once upon a time eight ministers in
the cabinet so they consider themselves
very politically very powerful yes
mister why be Chauhan is from that place
cara maria's party'll so that place has
a history and
very powerful set of people these days
they have gone into the black so I want
to ask you or you know such a fast for a
little bit in 1998 which is when you you
know when your career became active and
well-known and you know there were 93
incidents in one year in 1998 in the
city of Mumbai where the gangs of the
underworld was shot at business people
in 93 different incidents and they were
extortion but it was at an all-time high
you took over as JCP crime at that time
and this was your task yeah how did you
say that you know this issue has started
in 1970 you know blood used to be
flowing there between the the fights
between gangs of 4000 Brahim Karim Lala
Amarnath and Aaron gali and various
others and police are also facing that
kind of a thing and they were also
trying to solve it but not very
successfully but then in the year 1997
so we're here October there was a case
of one one encounter by a particular
policeman now who is very well known and
then they said it's a false case there
was a case filed against the Mumbai
police that is a false encounter so a
certain judge inquire into that and said
95 other incidents were also fake then
they were to be tried and things like
that so the police went into the frozen
mode and police was not going to take
any action against so in that bar gain
the gangsters who were building up their
strength from 1970 to 1998 had become so
emboldened that the courts have tied the
hands of the policeman so the went
berserk
so they used to shoot at policemen also
and anybody else who came in the way in
that bargain as you rightly said in
ninety three incidents hundred and one
businessman were killed the earlier in
95 we remember Gulshan Kumar of the tea
series or the QD in Wahid of these two
Astaire lives or soon it cut off cut off
mills so like that you know back then I
mean it's anecdotal now for those of us
who live in Mumbai but people say that
if you bought a car you would get an
extortion call if there was a wedding in
your house you
get an extortion call so almost like the
city had frozen it became a Beirut to
draw a simple comparison anyone who had
a marriage in in the marine drive these
to get a call so as a joint Commissioner
I used to wear uniform go uninvited to
those marriages find the bride's father
and tell him that this is my car that is
my number if they call you you just
connect me to them so I assured them all
that how did you stop it how did you
break that reaching the peak by ninety
ninety three shootouts 101 was a
challenge I came only in between July
July first was my date I wasn't the
jungles unconditionally for three years
before that so I was chosen to be here
Heike I stumbled I failed and I got into
high blood pressure and the blood sugar
and all those things happened and then I
evolved it took some time then once we
had a grip of the events I took time for
me to build a team then spruce up the
law and what all we can do it all that
so it was a six pronged attack which we
evolved into one was making a new law
called the Maharashtra Organized Crime
Control Act yes then other one was
checking them checking all the guns are
no illegal guns they used to carry a gun
and put it there in front of any
businessman and say at a ball like that
so that that was mopped up sixteen
hundred guns were removed and sixteen
hundred approximately of detentions
which the police commissioner at the
power
it's a judicial process and then one
year was spent at the jail so to the 95
percent of the cases were proved to be
right by us because they immediately go
to the High Court did you discover
corruption within your but that was not
my that was not my worry at the time my
charge are my job I assigned to myself
was to stop the blood flowing on the
streets for example this Madras cafe
brothers group brothers that's the name
of them they were absolutely not linked
to anything at all and they being shot
and in the marble floor blood flowing
was something which shook up my
conscience I said I'm not worried about
corruption or India that if there was
any there is an anti-corruption Bureau
was doing a full-time job they could
catch anybody of course we have taken
over a punitive action we I have
dismissed somebody under 311 of the
Indian Constitution and I have suspended
many so that apart the main task was to
control crime so obviously they were a
lot of encounters that happened in your
during your your regime or your your
tenure there are enough questions that
are still being asked about whether or
not encounter is the right route I would
also say no one good conviction is worth
10 encounters equal of 10 encounters but
what happened was this is this happening
from nineteen nineteen seventies it's
not that I'm discovered or in July that
encounter is nothing but a confrontation
between a well trained police force and
a very ill trained criminal group but I
told you earlier because of the
encounter petition which was entertained
in the Bombay High Court which we won
later the police force had frozen and
because of that even they were targeted
before I joined in 1998 to set the
record right two policemen who are going
to check the quality which was happening
in a balloon where killed they were
killed by the criminals later even a
constable in the Bandra railway station
was shot dead by a criminal who when he
was accompanying him to the police
station so it is not that the criminals
were afraid of the police and they were
shooting at the police too and the
difference between them and us is mere
well-trained our guys had better
equipment and better mental and physical
preparation so we had to but I want to
set the record right that encounter is
not a chosen option by us I told you we
had detained 1600 people recovered 1600
weapons criminals were arrested and they
were convicted yes for example the
famous JJ Hospital shootout of 1992 that
taku that Ridley did a dreaded gangster
Taku we got him convicted with a hanging
sentence in our in appeal he got it
converted into life is there in in
summer Matty J so it was a multi-pronged
attack then counter happened to be one
of them you were also part of several
other mocking investigations including
the blasts of the 90s
did and for a lot of I know officers in
the force those blasts actually just it
was a shock for anyone to see it
firsthand what had happened to the city
on that day you know that time I was not
in the police force directly I was
outside the police force on deputation
but I came in August 1993 to investigate
that 1993 blast yes
that was really a bolt from the blue and
nobody ever thought it was it would ever
be happened like that but you must know
that December 1992 sixth day above the
mozzies was brought down and there was a
right and there was a gap and there was
one more riot and then March 12th was
the date that this time they had brought
four thousand kilos of RDX 2,000 ak-47
2000 and grenades to way beyond
anybody's imagination for Mumbai Mumbai
to take that come they abused luckily
only 300 kilos of RDX and other 3700 we
removed from Nagala bundle of taani so
that way it was very very shocking for
anyone to do beyond imagination that and
number of people died was the highest
2257 on record and also missing people
are too many and the properties blown up
was unbelievably the values very very
difficult was that investigation for you
you know that investigation was very
difficult but we had a few lucky breaks
for example that vehicle which carried
weapons and hand grenades
there was a small blast of a detonator
in the van opposite to early our Lee
Simmons office and that vehicle was
registered in the name of Raheem memin
that so that kind of a breakthroughs
then we raided their house and I was
there on the spot with the joint
commissioner mr. Raymond Singh and
others those keys were there of the
sun-blasted motor vehicle
I mean scooter bounder tomps they were
in that goal they will and various other
plays other and other places so we found
them but it was very hard work I want to
say it was a combined work of all but
nobody one person can ever claim credit
that I did this it was a hard work for
everybody
Crime Branch was a challenge they
they charge heated the kisser by
November or even before that then the
CBA took over so I want to say the
Mumbai police given a task are given a
challenge they will race up to the
kitchen and solve any issue they solve
it absolutely beautifully except that
one day before the family flew away yes
that one day before the blast
nobody you made an attempt as well
through your team to bring back chota
rajan when he was in hospital in
Thailand
yeah I actually went through the MEA and
we followed the system of extradition
and I did go to Dubai also a part of CBI
and then we had arranged for the signing
of the thing between the Deputy Prime
and E then Deputy Prime Minister and the
other side because of that about 20 odd
people have come even this Christian
Michael that is all part of the same
series but then this chota rajan
business sir didn't work out we were
going through the MEA and sending all
the papers and all that kind of thing
are you disappointed should Arjun doubt
Eva I'm still not to the book absolutely
no doubt about that because that would
be the pinnacle of the story which we
are talking about but as I accept them
all others have been proved I would use
the word consciously here they have been
proved in Mumbai the taste of the
pudding is that from 2002 to now there
is not been a suit out except the Jade a
2004 once one shoot out of that one
attempt tonic bulk Oscar that is nows
brother attempt otherwise it is
absolutely peaceful marriages are
happening buildings are happening is
getting be happy that money is I also
want to ask you this we we understand
that the CBI will have a new director in
the next two days today yes do you
believe that a lot of irreparable damage
has been done to the to the reputation
of the CBI as a facility thousand days
there in in CBI I used to look after the
Rajasthan Gujarat go on my Raja joint
the director reso and it was a fantastic
organization and all officers were taken
on deputation and they were sent back
and at all the Kennedy had a good all
the high court's on the supreme
and a very high regard for CBI and the
integrity impartiality and industry is
the motto of the CBI but unfortunately
in the last few years it has been
sullied the name and reputation of CB s
being sullied it will take a long time
for us to set it back on the rails and
bring it back to its old glory I have
been very proud about the achievement of
the CBI and I'm highly disappointed that
that these things happen these things we
shouldn't have allowed these things to
happen that way the government should
have before you ask me I would volunteer
to say that the government should have
intervened effectively before this thing
blew up you have two young daughters
yourself will your family ever worried
about your safety given in the picture
they were not worried at all there used
to be absolutely free I never get it
again and never carried a constable
carry the so-called protection because
that actually doesn't work carrying a
constable and guns is not very effective
protection and so I thought I will
protect myself so they were not involved
in the whole thing and they were not
even aware going to office there on
things to do so maybe that would
somebody else would have told them my
wife also would have somebody else would
have briefed her but no they were not
very much they're fully supporting that
way yes I was I was come now to what the
work you're doing at this point with
roti Bank which let me also tell you I
find very moving it's it's a very
beautiful service you're doing to
society where basically from what I
understand you're picking up or you're
rescuing food from weddings and from
large parties and restaurants before it
goes bad and you're feeding people on
the street how did this start and how
many people are you feeding right you
know I've seen hunger and I forgot
personally been a party to it and also
I've seen hunger and poverty in the
jungles of culturally and various other
places in the city
I was DCP addition CP joint CP and
Commissioner also so I have seen how the
street children are now going around and
not getting any adequate
help help and food and education and all
that and I also thought that this
poverty and this kind of a thing growing
at this rate can increase crime rate we
so if you want to control crime as a cop
I will I thought we should take care of
these people and also ameliorating this
poverty which is going galloping kind of
a thing the gap between the rich and the
poor is growing very high the blue glass
is vanishing that way so I thought the
amount of food which is going waste is
almost a thousand X if we need one X
food thousand X food is going waste now
we are trying to bridge the demand and
the food which is going ways it is not
supply I didn't use the word supply
because it wasn't getting supplied yes
so thousands of other organizations in
the length and breadth of the country
are doing it we are doing it in Mumbai
because Mumbai is that is a financial
capital and we should see that people
are taking off the difference between
rich and poor is you can see that things
which you mentioned earlier is a I am
also going to ask you how we can help
people who are watching how can they get
involved how can they lend a hand but
before that there is a question that has
popped up for you on Facebook where
people are saying will you join politics
never never never no not at all not even
one what I will get please tell you ever
that I'm I kind of people wouldn't get
even one vote you know because if you
are straight and direct and then take
things head-on I don't think anybody is
going to work for you they don't want
that kind of a politician that way yeah
today do you believe that you will never
get a ticket because you are
straightforward for me yeah okay so
let's come back to roti rank obviously
for restauranteurs and for people who
are watching right now if you can if you
can lend in a hand in any way we would
be grateful but for the ordinary
citizens anybody who's watching how can
we get ordinary citizens can do a lot
even if the children of a school for
example
collect two roti is once in a month
it'll become 500 mm and that we can feed
them ordinary people can see that the
food is not wasted yes but there's a
challenge let's assume there is a
function in the house um some sort of
engagement some puja I know that they
will be leftover food
how do I get it picked up ring to that
number which is there in the in the logo
and we're going to put it on the screen
I think we have that know there's roti
Bhangra foundation yes the website and
the number will come up on the screen as
well yes and only thing is because of
operational reasons and economies of
scale we will ask a question as to how
much food is there so if it is more than
20 people then our vehicle is worth
going from this end to the other end yes
otherwise the operation cost is there
need to pay for the drivers and the
cleaners and the fuel and various other
things as on today we have got three
vehicles I want the people to contribute
help me getting more vehicles csr would
be a great help and the ordinary people
definitely can be aware this he can see
that the food is not wasted and
restaurant ears can call us and tell us
now on any prosecution or anything kind
of thing they need not worry I can take
care of that I will take the burden of
that and let the check you did say that
you can't pick up after 9:00 p.m. so
ideally college due to a capacity
building when I bring the capacity I
will definitely what we don't have today
is an office lack of an office we are
yet to grow in just one year old but
negate an office maybe I can buy a
freezer i buy a microwave and then I
store it and then recycle it tomorrow
but the point is I consider personally
that food is told and the heated and the
frozen gets bad no I today deliver
within 60 to 90 minutes of collection
how many people are you feeling and what
is your what is your we are feeding a
thousand people in the last one year so
we have reached beyond three and a half
lakhs in the last one year and now my
target is three thousand meals a day so
that we want to reach a million meals a
million meals in fact I have some
messages for you Akhilesh says you are
an unsung hero and Pia booty says very
good initiative kavitha's almost says
what a great guy
encomium and praise has been heaped on
me this is our bingley are undeserving
lee and i'm not looking for any more
thing I want to tell you our viewers I
am doing a silent work and having come
here and meeting a personality like you
is to see that the cause is
in fact I just want to play out some of
the bytes of people who have fed who

professor Midway of the University of
Mumbai
signed a contract with him that 47,000
NSS volunteers would be available for us
at ten of us were contribution of time
they will do yes so it's gaining
momentum and with your kind of help and
though I'm sure it's going to be much
better than before I would most people
to celebrate their birthdays and other
memorable days of their lives by
contributing money so that we can cause
just one meal cost 40 rupees freshly
cooked meal consisting of roti dal sub G
and rice so that if they can contribute
instead of you know doing other things
if they can just continue it even a 4000
rupees
about 120 hundred and fifty people can
be fed we concentrate on Tata
Cancer Hospital area Kem and various
other pieces you are feeding people
outside of outside
we are not allowed you know we're not
allowed and and that's really important
because a lot of times in these
hospitals you have people who come from
other parts of Maharashtra they come to
the city for treatment and they have no
place to live so they're actually
sitting on the footpath outside the
hospital and they're not being fed
because they don't have access I fully
agree they look good they look
middle-class and they're well-dressed so
people ask me why are you feeding these
well-dressed people and they are not
poor but my point is their comfort of
money poor three purrrr Kanpur Lucknow
are very far off places and they can't
stay for too long until the patient is
getting a recovered so III sympathize
with them and give them food they
deserve it they really deserve it as a
city we have to host such kind of people
and see that their people become well
and good and go back home healthy thank
you so much thank you for working with
us and for the service that you do or
should I call you honest I like that you
still do it but we've run out of time

children went missing from chair eye
district of Kerala the tourists who
arrived at shirai are expected to have
being smuggled to New Zealand on a large
boat purchased to enter the country as
illegal immigrants the tourists
allegedly left on a boat on the 12th of
January police have now managed to get
the footage of two men suspected to have
planned this trip okay so that's the
latest that we are getting here the cost
has now launched the search operation
the coastguard the tourists are missing
in chair I of Kerala it's a suspected
case of human trafficking from the
initial information that we are
receiving 50 tourists including women
and children went missing in the chair I
district of Kerala promote mother has
more information on this promote this is
a rather curious case on one hand we are
of course saying that it could be a
possible case of human trafficking what
are the leads that are being worked on
right now what does the police have to
say well from the cops and we are
getting information that like the number
could not even be 50 it could go up to
120 as well because they have bought a
boat a large boat it's not a ship but a
motorized board for 1.02 crores with
hard cash they have filled twelve
thousand litres of diesel and they have
like bought almost three like water
tanks that can fill up to 1,000 litres
so they haven't completely prepared for
almost 4,500 kilometers journey and this
believe that they will either end up in
Australian host or New Zealand host the
issue is that like how was it like
possible for them to leave just like
that what about the security measures
how were they able to leave from a
mumble board with such number of they
are like our people on a board those
questions are still not yet answered
because it is like they're definitely
pointing out to a security lapse but
however the cops claim that like
normally such kind of migration only
occurs from the term not accost
especially from Rameshwaram and since
there are security has been increase in
that area they have tried this part for
the first time but they claim that like
they are out like are trying to find out
like who these people are because like
only a certain number of other cards and
they couldn't like find out from which
they are able to like identify that
these people belong to
I have a sri lankan tamil origin and
they have garlic supposedly come from
various camps police the forces or teams
have also been sent to Delhi cranber-- -
and very alike two more districts to
find out like their whereabouts and the
two suspects who apparently bought the
board a peeper police on the lookout for
them as well it definitely is turning
out to be a big issue but for now cops
claim that you can definitely rule out
human trafficking but it still is an
issue because of like our people trying
to go to another country illegal
immigration and how did it miss out the
security aleca the Coast Guard or the
police on that area that that is like
our are seriously causing a major
putting forward a major question now yes
because 50 tourists and that's a big
number there must be at least some
clarity on the part of the police on how
this could happen in chera of Kerala

night Shyamalan starring Bruce Willis
samuel l.jackson James McAvoy Sarah
paulsen and Spencer treat Clark
Charlotte is known for his trademark
twist endings but it came as a huge
surprise that 2016 split was revealed to
be a direct sequel to unbreakable which
came out in 2000 glasses the conclusion
to this unexpected trilogy in
unbreakable we met Bruce Willis as David
Dunne the only man to survive a
devastating train accident that killed
131 passengers that film also starred
samuel l.jackson as Elijah price an
intelligent man suffering from
osteogenesis imperfecta a rare disease
that makes his bones extremely fragile
split featured James McAvoy as Kevin
Wendell crumb who suffers from
dissociative identity disorder and has
23 personality is emerging from his
psyche in glass Shyamalan brings these
three unique individuals together to
conclude a story that's almost 20 years
in the making
now the writer director has had quite
some highs and lows in his career but I
consider both unbreakable and split as
to offers better endeavors so my
expectations were really high going into
the swim but it left me with a lot of
mixed feelings it's not bad by any means
but you can pretty much see Shyamalan
fumbling as he tries to tell a story
that's very self-aware or in this case
one that constantly addresses being in a
world where superheroes exist this forms
the crux of the overall narrative and as
a result the dialogue gets quite clunky
at times it's also hard to pinpoint the
film's tonality this makes some beats
and dialogue sound funnier than they
ought to be and that's a shame because
there are some other genuinely humorous
moments one of the strengths is that the
cast is really strong overall James
McAvoy can used to be excellent as he
constantly switches between multiple
personalities each one being distinctive
in their dialect body language and
intent samuel l.jackson has a
potentially tricky role to play because
his character mr. glass often veers
dangerously close to being hammy as an
evil mastermind but Jackson is an old
player in the superhero genre so he
knows when to pull back Bruce Willis
doesn't do anything new or even
memorable but he's convincing enough as
a troubled vigilante anya taylor joy is
soon turning out to be my new favorite
actress she is consistently good in
everything she does and is no different
here Sarah Paulsen as dr. Ellie staple
was an okay
and that's no fault of the actress at
all it's just the way the character is
written so while the performances are
good
shamans direction is what makes them
somewhat peculiar because as always he
keeps his cards close to his chest now
the film eventually leads to a
conclusion that's bound to divide
audiences I personally really like the
ending because a lot of sham lands and
ative decisions made sense in the end
but I can see how some will really
dislike it I'm going with three stars
for glass I think it's a pretty good
story in the end with good performances
from the cast especially James McAvoy
but I still think it's a disappointing
way to close this surprise superhero
slash comic book trilogy guys what's
your favorite Shyamalan flick mine will
always be Sixth Sense which i think is
damn near perfect let me know what's

can probably see where this one is going
and yes it pretty much goes there but
it's filled with a ridiculous amount of
plot holes along the way science be
damned additionally some of the dialogue
is pure exposition to the extent that it
becomes unintentionally funny sadly that
also makes it cringe-worthy especially
when the film makes his characters do
some very questionable things let's face
it Keanu Reeves has a limited range he's
fantastic as John wick which doesn't
require too much remoting but anything
outside of that is difficult for him to
pull off especially in the hands of a
director who does not know how to
utilize him you can see him struggling
with a really emotional scenes in
replicas and that makes it hard to
connect with Bill Foster's pain and
sadness which drives him to do what he
ends up doing Alice he was meant to be a
doctor but she doesn't have much to do
as Mona then thus Thomas Middleditch as
Edie and he's okay but his character
really makes you wonder with a moral
scale of the film lies and that's why
replicas truly falls short the ethics of
human cloning has been long debated and
the opportunity to address that is not
only just sidestepped but just ignored
altogether in an absurd loosely written
film that doesn't do any favors for
either the actors or the audience I'm

be confused with hotel Mumbai another
coming film based on the same events one
less God revisits those four horrific
days in the iconic Taj Hotel through two
lenses one from the perspective of the
terrorists and the other from the guests
trapped by them while based on true
events both these perspectives are
fictionalized for the film so this is
not entirely a factual retelling the
guests come from different nationalities
and backgrounds Shawn played by Joseph
Mona Taylor is an Irishman and is the
closest to a main character Salim played
by Igor kremen and EDA played by Riley
O'Brien Inglis are Turkish siblings who
continuously squabble with each other

and elderly grandfather played by
chakras deepak and his granddaughter
Athiya played by Mikah rao are trapped
in another room bretylium worthington
blends real footage captured outside the
taj during the attacks along with
recreated scenes from within
since the guests are all fictional he
takes time to set up their backstories
when some of those eventually contribute
to the narrative a few don't and they
merely add to the film's runtime in the
end I was left wondering if all those
backstories were cut out of the film
would they really affect the overall
impact I think not in fact one of the
characters who doesn't have any set up
delivers some of the film's most
touching moments speaking of which the
are between artheon her grandfather who
she lovingly calls Harada is bound to
pull on heartstrings
with the two of them sharing a genuinely
enduring relationship the performances
from the relatively unknown yet a depth
cast add to the tension there's no
clear-cut protagonist so it's impossible
to predict who will survive the ordeal
the cinematography is also worth
mentioning with some well-planned and
executed shots that immerse you into the
brutality of the attacks but then some
sequences tend to go on longer than
required which dilutes that impact this
is particularly evident when the focus
shifts to the two terrorists and they
are anonymous faceless handler in fact
the angle was the weakest aspect in the
entire narrative as a Debu film director
Liam Worthington Dawn's many had
behind the camera producing editing and
conceptually writing the story as well
for this alone his efforts are
commendable although he tends to drop
one component while juggling others a
key element is an underlying message
narrated at the beginning and end of the
film which runs the risk of being
slightly on-the-nose it's a humanitarian
message that I felt the film could have
done without but I'll leave you to
decide if it works for you or not I'm
going with 300 half stars for one less
guard which might sound pretty generous
but there were points where I was
generally moved and even as I sat
through the unnecessary bits I wasn't
bored at any point one less God revisits

commuters are facing right now in fact
the court said that the city should have
had some substitute for travelling under
such circumstances it also wrapped the
BMC saying BMC should be better prepared
to handle such strikes patience students
senior citizens are affected the most
and the court also said that referring
to BMC and the best administration that
you all can't sit and leave the
situation like it is so this is of
course coming in at a time when we are
seeing that the bus strike has entered
day four and the court has in fact
pulled up both the best as well as the

preparation at all for the fact that

been tracking this court hearings Anthea
please give us all the details
this PIL was filed against the best
strike yesterday the petitioner started
the shuttle arguing and he said that how
the citizens are suffering the senior
citizens students differently abled
people are the one who are actually
suffering the more are the most traffic
chances staffing Champa there on almost
every road of the city trains are more
crowded than usual and if we talk about
the best and the MP lawyer they said
that how a meeting took place with the
union people where Hasina chief would
not agree BMC commissioner and best
general manager everyone was present and
the meeting went on for hours but there
was no conclusion of the meeting
according to the best and BMC lawyer of
lawyers the workers were on strike are
not ready to listen and to that the
court said that the state and the
municipal commissioner the the BMC and
best also have to be very considerate of
the problems of these people what
exactly are they going through what
their issues to which the C&O before I
had to see that they are aware of the
problem and they're working on the
solutions but according the bobbitt
according to both these lawyers the city
is held to ransom by the workers and
that's why it's very difficult to deal
with
but if we talk about the stand of the
cost and marks course hold up
state government and also the Municipal
Corporation by saying that you all
constrict and leave it like this there
is there should be a proper substitute
of proper alternative system for the
citizens in other subsystems in such
situation is we're under such
circumstances if you talk about codes
could also specifically said that bsd
and BMC should be breath better prepared
for such situations so fourth book
Bombay I caught hold up state government
and also a BFC and BMC for not being
prepared to handle this situation
that's anthea right and also the court
said that the state government should
intervene into the matter so were there
any steps highlighted as to what should
be done next given one order to the
state's tutor to the state lawyer to
take or other the directions from the
Transport Minister watch all all can be
done but would have directed the state
to properly intervene in this matter
and come up with a proper solution and
when the hearing was going on there was
no one from the Union to represent them

the cinematography is weak with a great

you can make out that they've used
chroma which is the green screen and
most of the scenes and while there's
