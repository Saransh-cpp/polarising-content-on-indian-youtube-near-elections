Netanyahu's Victory Is Just The Latest In This Trend.,2019-04-10T17:16:50Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/229MyDpzUYg/hqdefault.jpg,"and literally I win we can say that is
an addition to an existing trend a trend
of right-wing leaders emerging
victorious in elections from Donald
Trump in the United States to put in in
Russia and the range Modine in the other
right continues to rise a right-wing
coalition has retained power in Israel
Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party along
with its allies have scripted history
the right underneath in Yahoo has
governed Israel for two decades now but
he's not alone
the list of right-wing heads of state is

president last year gerbils Naro ended a
two decade left rule in the country and
with his emphatic win Brazil marked a
dramatic shift in the country's politics

himself a political outsider is a highly
divisive figure Jerry Belson ro swung
the world's fourth largest democracy to
the right the same year loud mail Putin
secured another six-year term as a
Russian president
[Music]
even though his victory was unexpected
lines putin's reelection was seen as a
step closer to him becoming russia's
leader for life
many believe that putin's views are far
from extreme as per russian political
standards but he is nevertheless a
leader who ignites a wave of Russian
nationalism while his victory was no
surprise Americans voted for a surprise
or as some would say a shock candidate
Donald Trump was elected to the White
House in 2016 the real estate magnate
shed his luxurious life and celebrity
hood to talk about the toiling masses
and for many his triumphant campaign was
the trigger for the rise of the right
across the globe in India narendra
modi's 2014 win ended Congress's
ten-year rule
it marked a rightward shift in Indian
politics
combining nationalistic rhetoric with a
challenge to the political elite
Narendra Modi led his party to
spectacular success in 2014 and he seems
to be going strong in the upcoming
elections as well
in Europe if you chart out the countries
which are increasingly turning right the
map will light up like a Christmas tree
matter salvini the current Interior
Minister of Italy is a far-right
politician when elections threw up an
inconclusive result in June 2018
he became the kingmaker Hungary's Viktor
Orban has been occupying the Prime
Minister's office since 2010 the
far-right nationalist Prime Minister won
his third term in April last year
alternative for Germany is a far-right
party that was formed just five years
ago but it managed to enter the federal
parliament in 2017 and even batch 94 of
the 700 parliamentary seats in France
Emmanuel macron was elected as the
president 2017 but far-right populist
marilla pen gave him a run for his money
the trend is not just of right-wing
parties winning the mandate but also of
personality driven contests it's not
just political parties as a whole they
retract the waters it is also the
charisma of the leader that makes it
more appealing and for now the world
seems to be increasingly staring right

Karnataka both states a high value 108
MPs in on a big day for the Gandhi
family Rahul Gandhi and his sister
Priyanka Gandhi Vetrov are in Amity the
Congress president also addressed a
rally in Bihar the biggest talking point
to day was in order of the Election
Commission of India it has ended the
suspense around the Modi biopic the film
will not release until the election is
over it screening has been banned the
poll watchdog feels that a biopic has
the potential to disturb the level
playing field the Supreme Court had
earlier refused to intervene in the
matter the censor board had certified
the film ultimately it was the Election
Commission that had to take the final
call a panel that will be headed by a
retired Supreme Court or High Court
judge has also been appointed to look
into any future complaints on the matter
this can be considered as a win for the
opposition led by the Congress there
vocally opposed the release of this film
they called it a propaganda movie
but the BJP campaign continues to steam
ahead
the Prime Minister as I said was in
Gujarat and go our today relentless
attacks against the Congress party

the beginning of this week at least 50
locations linked to mother Pradesh Chief
Minister Camelot was searched the
recovery is made from the their run into
crores of rupees but more than that this
is fresh ammo for the BJP against the
Congress
the Congress - got some ammo of its own
today the Supreme Court admitted fresh
evidence in their file case it came at a
great time for Rahul Gandhi he was
animate he to file a second nomination
in fact the full Gandhi family was with
him including brother-in-law Robert
Vadra Trowell Gandhi has represented
Amity for the last 14 years it was one
of the two seats that the party won in
the 2014 election in of the pradesh and
once again the Congress president is up
against a BJP peace with the irani in a
meeting what's different this time is
the fact that the Congress president is
also contesting from Kerala as wine are
no prizes for guessing what he spoke
about today
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was managing her
brother's campaign from Twitter she
tweeted that MIT was the kurma booming
or the land of action for her father
Rajiv Gandhi she said the land was
sacred for her family talking about the
family accompanying mrs. Rudra's
children they were with the Congress
general secretary and those pictures
also came out but what may boomerang for
the Congress party is the presence of
Robert Vadra he is one of the stark
campaigners for the Congress it seems in
this election remember he's facing
allegations of money laundering the BJP
is nathie irani has issued this warning
had issued this morning two days ago and
I'm quoting I would only like to say
this Robert Vadra may go wherever he
wants but the people would be well
advised to keep a close watch on their
lands when he still around now how can
an Indian election go without the issue
of Pakistan being raised just today
before polling Imran Khan interestingly
weighed in on this election as expected
it has sparked a political firestorm
here in India first let's tell you what
the Pakistani Prime Minister said he was
asked which Indian party has a better
chance of settling the dispute with
Pakistan he said and I'm quoting perhaps
if the BJP a right-wing party wins some
kind of settlement in Kashmir could be
reached
so has Imran Khan endorsed Narendra Modi
the opposition is having a field day
that's what they're saying through the
day-to-day leaders from the Congress
party the aam aadmi party the National
Conference and PDP attacked the BJP with
some tweets some other people on social
media even wondered when will Imran Khan
add chalkida to his name the jokes apart
dozen Ron Khan have any other option he
feels that Narendra Modi has the best
chance to form the government by his own
admission Imran Khan says the Congress
may not be able to make any headway in
the peace dialogue what also bothers
Pakistan is its economy a balance of
payments crisis a depreciating currency
forcing Islamabad to seek a bailout on
Tuesday the International Monetary Fund
said that Pakistan's growth rate will
fall in less to less than 3% in the next
two years
unless Pakistan begins to put its house
in order
sensing the perils are further
antagonizing India the Pakistani Prime
Minister seems to have sought an
outreach of sorts and he's not alone
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sharma mood
qureishi had similar remarks over the
weekend first he said that Pakistan has
reliable intelligence that India will
attack them between 1616 and 20th of
April India call that statement
preposterous and irresponsible now
Croatia can change its tune today he
said that the only way for India and
Pakistan to move forward is through
dialogue

but something that we mentioned just now
once our LD chief Ajit Singh's Bastion
now held by the BJP Ajit Singh lost to
SATA Pal Singh from the BJP in 2014 this

giant
Chaudhary vs. such a pal singh from back

the president's police medal Bhagwat is
a job dominated area sati Pal Singh has
demanded a quota for jobs hoping to win
their votes
Jane Chaudhary is also a job so the
jackpot is going to be split Chaudhary
is also counting on the SP BSP Alliance
the Dalit OBC and Muslim votes sector
Pal Singh is known for making peculiar
statements he was a junior minister for
human resource development and water
resources he once said that Charles
Darwin's theory of evolution is wrong
and should not be taught in schools he
also said that ancient mantras had
codified laws of motion before Newton
it's said to be a colourful contest to
say the least the second contest
journalist is Nainital uddham singh
Nagar
this is in Uttarakhand former Chief
Minister Harish Rawat of the Congress
takes on Ajay Bhatt the state BJP
president it's a battle of heavyweights
now but was supposed to win easily from
their natal book Java command support
from the Rajput community the Rajput
voters are angry with the BJP because
the party did not give a ticket to the
sitting MP BS koshari who's also a Raj
booth this is a prestige battle for but
who despite being a prominent leader has
come a cropper in the elections recently
he even lost the assembly election when
the BJP formed the government in 2017 so
he needs this win to survive politically
third on our list is the battle for
Chander poor in Maharashtra junior Home

Congress candidate Suresh Honoka

acid test for a heal because the annual
car belongs to the pune community the
non-elite farmers and with her there a
powerful boat base but the Anoka will
not have it easy because he joined the
Congress too late he may lose the
traditional Congress vote it's a battle
to watch and last on our list is our
natural West
Kiren Rijiju against nabob to clear
mouthwash in contest this residuals
Junior Minister for Home Affairs and the
BJP spy brand leader Turkey is a former
chief minister the campaign trail showed
how critical this fight is it's a
majority Christian area we are talking

face Kiren Rijiju who has become the BJP
face in the northeast so chose
[Music]
no your candidate today we profile Kay
Kavita sitting MP from Telangana and
daughter of TRS chief and Telangana
Chief Minister cage Andrew Shakira
she represented the nizamabad Lok Sabha
constituency in the 16th Lok Sabha she's
a TRS candidate from there again in
Islamabad by the way has 185 contestants
one seat 185 contestants 179 among them
are farmers they are contesting who need
to make a point they want to highlight
the agricultural distress they want to
show the failure of the state and
central government it's a commentary on
their MP - let's tell you more about her
--kavitha is an engineer my
qualification at least she graduated
from the University of Southern
Mississippi and has been a permanent
fixture in Telangana politics since 2006
she's the daily face of the party her
brother KT Rama Rao focuses on the state
with father k CR it's a typical
political family so how has Kavitha
performed as a parliamentarian
her attendance is 56 percent that's well
below the national average she has taken
part in 41 debates again significantly
below average she has asked 284
questions in five years which is not so
bad
she moved three private member bills
meeting the national and state averages
one of her bills was the turmeric war
bill
now her constituency has mostly turmeric
farmers so to that extent she has
represented her constituency well in the
Lok Sabha even the question that she's
raised and the debate she participated
in like the any et debate irrelevant to
her region so will she win she is the
overwhelming favorite she's locked in a
three-way race with Congress secretary
Madhuri actually got and BJP is dr will
now the congress calls to Telangana
Rashtra cemetery the b-team of the BJP
says they have some sort of an
understanding KCR is the king of
Telangana he has hit out at both
national parties he wants to form a
federal government a Third Front but
farmers in Nizam abbath are an angry lot
UK Kavitha will be hoping that a major
part of that anger is directed towards
the central government
[Music]
as we've been saying a few hours to go
for the first phase to begin the one
issue the opposition has been raising is
back on the table
there are foul deal the Supreme Court
had given the government a clean chit a
few months back now the court will
review that decision a three-judge bench
has decided to hear the review petitions
they have to fix a date now this is a
setback for the Modi government the
government had objected to this petition
based on fresh documents the government
said that these documents were
privileged the government said these
documents had been stolen
they shouldn't be examined as part of
evidence in the case the court doesn't
agree with that it will take these
documents into consideration during the
review now there are five cases quite
complicated so let me try and break it
down in simpler terms last year there
was a plea in court it wanted a
corruption investigation into the Rafal
deal the court refused the court did not
consider the issue of pricing the court
did not consider the subject of the
offset partner that was on the 14th of
December soon a review petition was
filed it cited media reports including
one published by the Hindu newspaper
plus a dissent note of domain experts by
members of the Indian negotiation team
the charge was that the Prime Minister's
office overrode their authority and that
affected pricing the government said
these documents were stolen from the
defense ministry they were protected by
section one two three of the Indian
Evidence Act as well as the efficient
Secrets Act they should not be taken
into account but the court doesn't agree
it has decided to consider the review
petition for the opposition this is a
leg up they have been accusing the
governor
and the Prime Minister of corruption and
cronyism Supreme Court nuclear guardian
he chalky dodgy nature recall a supreme
court may accept ki ki Rafael mom lemme
go in a corruption cone a fibrous catch
our one other argument was that
precisely because they relate to defense
you must examine them because it affects
the security of the country it affects
what you have these are documents that
relate to the issues which you have
raised in your order you asked for these
this evidence and we have provided it so
the court has accepted our pleas and
rejected the arguments of the government
we all know very well that the Congress
president probably doesn't read even a
half a paragraph he conveys things which
are being told to him and he understands
things only that far but here by saying
this that court named man Leah and by
also saying that the court has said talk
it out your ear Tokido I mean anil
ambani cojito nafisa Danika man Leah hey
these words on contempt of coat
now the question is will this hurt the
BJP electorally
the government's argument is that there
is no scam there around about
allegations the Congress president has
given different figures conflicting
prices of the Rafale aircraft there's
still confusion on exactly what was done
wrong here until the court decides this
will just be a subject for debate it
made then the BJP is no scam argument
the noise around it will grow louder but
the impact on election is arguable
[Music]
if spoken about Ilias lost waters the
28th crore migrant voters who moved to
different cities for different reasons
and couldn't cast their vote in 2014
this year that number is expected to go
up to 40 crores that's nearly seven
times israel's total electorate think
about it
twenty-eight Pro lost votes higher than
the total votes polled by both the BJP
and the Congress put together and
domestic migrants are just one part of
this massive problem
what about NRI voters reports say that
NRIs can use proxy voting meaning
another person living in India can vote
for them those reports are wrong that is
fake news it's true that the government
has moved such a bill had moved such a
bill in 2017 it proposed proxy voting
but that bill was was blocked in the
Rajya Sabha there is no such rule right
now inner eyes cannot vote by a proxy so
can nr eyes vote at all in this election
yes they can
if the NRI registers in his or her
hometown as an overseas voter and then
of course turns up on polling day you
can't do it from afar there are two
things to be understood one an entire
inner eye can enroll online but will
have to be physically present in the
polling booth to cast his or her vote
and two this facility is applicable only
the NRI does not have foreign
citizenship that takes care of the 3
crore or NR eyes that we have what about
migrant citizens can they use postal
votes the answer is no postal ballots
are applicable only for a certain
category of people those on election
Duty the Armed Forces personnel and
voters in preventive detention the
question is why not the others
can India not take the leap and move to
a voting guess who has done it a tiny
country like Estonia and they have only
13 lakh people they're allowed
electronic voting they had an election
last month half the votes are cast
online the process is very simple you
need a computer with internet connection
a national ID card or a mobile ID with
the required certificates and area codes
you download the voting application you
wreck your record is checked by a
software there if eligible your
constituency and your candidates are
displayed on screen and you watch you
could be living anywhere in Estonia your
vote goes to your constituency only it
is sent to a secure encrypted water
collecting server that is it simple and
easy India the moment does not support a
voting we know that the Election
Commission is considering it though
they've been working with the Center for
Advanced Computing the c-dac to enable
fully electronic internet-based voting
but it's just at research level for me
without it's a wrap on this edition of
India election watch keep your tweets
coming in write to us what do you think
what are the stories you'd like to watch

then a leprechaun thanks very much for
that update the counting will begin
later tonight and the results are
expected sometime tomorrow afternoon
here's something that you did not expect
from Israel why is it taking so long
they still use ballot papers for casting
their votes which is why it will take
hours for them to complete to compile
rather the results for a country that is
known for its advances in technology
Israel still prefers the old fashioned
way when it comes to elections Israel is
well known for developing
state-of-the-art technology its startup
environment is flourishing and its IT
exports are booming but there is one
thing Israelis still do the old way
voting
there is no electronic voting no
glamorous technology in world people
have to queue up outside the nearest
voting station and vote using valid
papers envelopes and a box and whether
you are running to become Prime Minister
or you are Israel's president you will
still have to queue up and follow the
procedure but this is not preventing
people to get out and vote
elections in Israel are a serious issue
and the country's leaders unanimously
call on their people to decide no mercy
not the president and not party leaders
or parties will determine who will be
Prime Minister the only ones that will
determine who will be Prime Minister and
the next government will be you and in
order for you to influence the outcome
you must vote the Democratic game is not
just a game it's a crucial question on
the country's past and the Israeli
society you must vote even if it's hard
at times
finding a voting station is not
difficult there are more than 10,000
places where one can vote and most
public transportation is free once the
identification process is completed
voters are given an envelope where they
will put their voting paper inside the
booth there are trays with tens of small
cars carrying parties symbols and given
that for this election there are some 40
registered parties that makes a lot of
paper every voter should be given the
possibility to vote for every party
so there is almost one voting paper for
every one of the 6.3 million voters
that's multiplied by 40 parties it is
estimated that Israel printed 250
million voting papers for this election
and a voter needs a good memory to move
within the tens of voting cards with
black on white letters symbolizing the
different parties it does not seem the
most environmentally friendly choice but
it is still perceived to be the safest
and most user-friendly way and yes all
of the political of the politics in
Israel are really afraid of like changes
and people hacking to the system so a
lot of old-fashioned voters are really
afraid of stuff that isn't the paper
they put in an envelope Israeli citizens
are excited excited about it I hope they
and it right person will be enrolled and
particularly for this election
the race for becoming Prime Minister of
Israel is on but scripted many voters
are willing to see a change of God
[Applause]
and many others are not
when it comes to deciding what is the
best and safest way to vote well here in
Israel is only a matter of generations
young Israelis that do prefer an
electronic voting machine they say that
it is a closed system that cannot
actually be hacked and they believe it
is only a matter of time and then sooner
or later the country will shift it to
the electronic voting machines but when
it comes to other Israelis they feel way
more confident in casting their votes
are through those newspapers they have
been doing so for decades and there is
no chance to hack those machines and
also they feel confident because voting
through papers does not require any
technology expertise and they do not
feel very confident in using
technological ways to cast up their
preference daniela Pagani in tel-aviv

Boeing CEO Dennis Muhlenberg has finally
acknowledged that the flight control
system on the 737 max 8 may have caused
two fatal crashes the tow pian airlines
flight 395 last November 364 lives in
all were lost in just two crashes
expressing his sympathies for the
families of the victims Muhlenberg said
that the boeing was making fixes to the
planes anti-stall system which is
suspected to be the reason behind the
two plane crashes Boeing also
acknowledged that one more technical
issue which is calling it in fact minor
he said that the company was working on
a fix for it to the full details of what
happened in these two accidents will be
issued by the government authorities in
the final reports but with the release
of the preliminary report of the
Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 accident
investigation it's apparent that in both
flights the maneuvering characteristics
augmentation system known as MKS
activated in response to erroneous
angle-of-attack information the history
of our industry shows most accidents are
caused by a chain of events this again
is the case here and we know we can
break one of those chain links in these
two accidents now this is the first
acknowledgment from Boeing that there
are clear safety issues with its 737 max
8 model the initial report on the
European airlines flight 3:02 crash says
that a pilot error is unlikely to have
caused the accident arrived that the
pilots followed all necessary procedures
instead these planes anti-stall
mechanism or the MCAS is under the
scanner the boeing has said that a
software update is needed to remedy the
fault pilots have told us erroneous
activation of the EM cast function can
add to what is already a high workload
environment it's our responsibility to
illumine
this risk we own it and we know how to
do it from the days immediately
following the lion air accident we've
had teams of our top engineers and
technical experts working tirelessly in
collaboration with the Federal Aviation
Administration and our customers to
finalize and implement a software update
that will ensure accidents like that of
Lion Air flight 610 and Ethiopian
Airlines flight 302 never happen again
the line air crashed the Boeing 737 mats
dipped more than 20 times due to the
faulty anti-stall sensor before crashing
into the sea Boeing claims it knows how
to fix the problem it had said that the
same thing in fact after the line air
crash yet five months later the open air
flight still crashed and factored
scarily similar circumstances and the
other issue too is both airplanes had a
single point sensor the angle of attack
sets are on the left side of the
airplane that in both cases appear to
have failed catastrophic ly Ethiopian

one of the immediate fixes is to deal
with that single point sensor that the

triggered a storm the facts first the
enforcement directorate is investigating
this case it has told a special court in
Delhi that defense officials bureaucrats
media persons and quote-unquote
important political persons of the
ruling party received kickbacks meaning
these were the people involved in
corruption which was the ruling party
the UPA led by the Congress party the
deal was done by the UPA government the
case is a bit of a political pot boiler
now and the protagonist is this man
Christian mission he was the middleman
the broker of the deal he said to have
identified top members of the Congress
party to push this deal through last
year India finally got hold of him India
managed to secure the deportation of
Christian Michele he is now one of the
main accused in this case he used to
send dispatches to his bosses in 2008
and 2009 the investigators have got
their hands on those dispatches which
have some big names in them names of
Congress leaders whom Christian Michele
was in touch with now let's tell you
what the chargesheet says it came that
one mrs. Gandhi was the driving force
behind the deal it mentions about a
meeting with a quote-unquote an Italian
ladies son the investigators also say
that Michelle identified the initials ap
as Congress leader Ayman Patil he said
fan in his notes which stands for family
you can join the dots it's not hard to
guess who are the people he's talking
about
and he has a twist in the plot the
lawyers of Christian Michele told the
court today that they were not given
this copy of the charge sheet
they say that Christian michele has not
named any member of the Congress party
during any interrogation with the
investigators so where did this charge
sheet come from no one's answering this
list of all the BJP they have got fresh
ammunition in election season and firing
from the front is the prime minister
himself helicopter got allocate the

so here's a question how damaging is
this case for the Congress how much will
it help the BJP do scans like Agusta
Westland have any impact on elections
the government seems to be counting on
it finance minister Arun Jaitley says
the Congress is hiding something the
past shows that corruption can be an
emotive poll issue why go far look at
2014 corruption scams black money these
were the terms that ruled the discourse
the Congress government was tainted by
several scans there was widespread anger
against the UPA it fueled the BJP s
campaign it gave birth to new players
like the Anna Hazare campaign and the
Kejriwal led Ahmadi party they call the
in fact used corruption as their
political springboard the anger against
the Congress led to the rise of Arvind
Kejriwal in Delhi after the agitation
for a Lokpal at the ram-leela grounds
the aam aadmi party want power twice in
the national capital they claim to
political fame was the promise to end
corruption at all levels including
electoral finance and street level
bureaucracy the BJP rode on the wave of
anti-corruption sentiment Modi's most
famous slogan a conga nikana do now
still resonates among the voters he also
promised to bring back black money
stashed in tax havens abroad the
messaging against corruption is still
central to mr. Modi's campaign he still
uses old scams to target the Gandhi
family history shows us that the issue
of corruption can make or break
political fortunes take the case of the
beaufort steel allegations of corruption
hit the Rajiv Gandhi led governments so
hard that they lost more than 200 seats
in the 1989 election back then it was
the Janata Dal that gained what
emboldened the Prime Minister further is
the clean record of his government no
minister from the BJP government has
been charged with corruption in the last
five years the opposition has tried to
whip up their file deal but they haven't
been able to show a scam so is
corruption still an issue in this
election yes it is when the Congress be
able to shake off the baggage of
corruption
most likely not

in Afghanistan and Iraq nearly 7,000
American heroes have given their lives
more than 52,000 Americans have been
badly wounded
we have spent more than seven trillion

East as a candidate for president I
loudly pledged a new approach great
nations do not fight endless wars but
Trump is acutely aware that the road to

traveler a plane crash it's worse if the
crash could have been prevented and if
you later find that the greed of an
airline company and the complicity of a
government cost the lives of hundreds of
people we are talking about the Boeing
case what most of us feared has come
true
the preliminary report into the
ethiopian airlines crashes out and all
fingers are being pointed at boeing
let's first tell you what the
investigators have found so far the
plane was fit to fly but once it took
off it nosedived not once not twice but
several times the pilots tried their
level best to save the plane they
followed all procedures recommended by
Boeing but despite their efforts it
crashed their initial findings of the
investigation on the basis of initial
information gathered during the course
of investigation the following facts
have been determined number one the
aircraft processed a valid certificate
of airworthiness the second one the crew
obtained the license and qualifications
to conduct the flight and third the
takeoff roll appeared very normal and
the fourth one is the crew performing
all the procedures repeatedly provided
by the manufacturer but was not able to
control the aircraft
it opened Airlines flight 302 crash last
month minutes after takeoff all 170 157
people on board were killed this is the
second time in six months that a boeing
737 max eight plane had crashed
questions were raised parallels were
drawn was the Ethiopian crash similar to
the line air crash in Indonesia just a
few months ago that was in October 2018
line Air flight jt6 100 crashed into
this
near Indonesia all 189 passengers on
board were killed
now the similarities are evident it's
very clear similarity with with the nine
air accident because number one it's the
same airplane model brand-new airplane
in our case less less than five months
in service I think it's similar with the
nine air
airplane also Beauty opine Airlines
crash prompted airlines around the world
to ground the Boeing 737 max
eight plane they were grounded in India
to Boeing was blamed for withholding
information the charge is that Boeing
did not tell the pilots about a new
safety feature on the 737 max the manual
that comes with a new Boeing aircraft
allegedly did not mention that when the
planes computer detects a stall it
automatically triggers a response like
lowering the nose of the plane it goes
down investigators suspect that this is
the reason why the plane crashed while
this is just a preliminary report Boeing
has been asked to review this aircraft
control system but demands for a class
action lawsuit against Boeing are also
growing a class-action lawsuit is where
one party represents a group of people a
class and it goes to court against a
common defendant in this case Boeing
families of victims of the line air
crash say that both these crashes line
air and Ethiopian must be treated as one
the demanding accountability from Boeing
for the loss of more than 300 lights
and down and up as the pilots but the
MPs and finally similar steep down I've
disabled so that's the big difference
why it is clear Boeing must answer some
tough questions but America's aviation
watched all the Federal Aviation
Administration the FAA should also be
put in the dock they too must be made to
answer some questions why did the FAA
allow the Boeing 737 max safe to fly at
the moment all american-made aircraft
are subjected to testing and evaluation
that is approved by the US Congress on
the face of it it's great but this
evaluation is like an open book exam
what happens here Boeing handles much of
the testing and evaluation of their
aircraft the FAA just supervises this
exam so Boeing is basically testing its
own planes the regulator is watching how
can we then expect Boeing to not cheat
the fact is that what that Boeing has
gotten used to cheating and getting away
with it a large PR effort and lobbying
allows Boeing to fly under the radar all
the time the relationship between US
presidents and Boeing is hardly
metaphoric boeing literally ferries
american presidents in a modified Boeing
747 better known as the Air Force one
ties between Boeing and the current he
was president Donald Trump run deep
Trump is an aviation enthusiast and once
owned the Trump shuttle airline in its
three along its existence this airline
was in close contact with Boeing Trump
also used a personal Boeing 757 before
he assumed office in January 2017
Trump's connection with Boeing CEO
Dennis Muhlenberg is not you either
Trump had personally negotiated with
Muhlenberg to try and lower the cost of
a future version of the US presidential
aircraft then in July last year Boeing
won a 3.9 billion dollar contract to
replace two Air Force one jets
if signposting is anything to go by then
trump's preference for boeing has been
more than apparent the US president has
used boeing products and sites as
backdrops for major presidential
announcements in July last year Donald
Trump used this his visit to a Boeing
plant in st. Louis to talk about the
impact of his tax will tax overhaul bill
but Trump isn't alone in this Boeing
boat there are other talk White House
officials who have close ties with the
aircraft manufacturer take acting
defense secretary secretary Patrick
Shanahan for instance he worked for
Boeing for thirty-one years before
joining the Pentagon former US
ambassador to the United States united
nations rather nikki Haley has been
nominated by Boeing to join its board of
directors
Boeing stature makes it a natural choice
for American administrations to cozy up
to it is the u.s. a second largest
defense contractor the company received
one hundred and four billion dollars in
unclassified defense contracts between
2014 and 2018 it is no surprise then
that the Trump administration has
repeatedly urged its allies to buy
Boeing products but this is what all the
cozying up leads to two plane crashes
346 lives lost lives that could have
been saved whose fault is that we asked
again the manufacturer or the regulators
the important question is what really
was done to prevent such a thing from
happening if the right procedure had
been put in place at the right time the
world wouldn't have seen the death of
346 innocent people 29 October 2018
lion air flight 6 1 zero traveling from
Jakarta to Cal Cal penang with hundred
and eighty-nine souls on board thirty
minutes after takeoff the plane lost
contact with the air traffic control and
crashed into the sea
killing all 189 people 10th March 2019
it's European air flight 3:02 traveling
from Addis Ababa to Nairobi with 157
people on board six minutes after
takeoff the plane reports trouble and
requests a return to the airport
but before the plane could make a return
it crashed all 157 passengers on board
dead both the incidents hauntingly
similar an eerie coincidence
sadly no both the incidents had one very
common factor the plane itself Boeing
737 max age two crashes in less than six
months from new model was highly suspect
so what had caused two new jets to just
drop out of the sky and crash the reason
a faulty sensor on the Boeing 737 max
eight a system that was intended to save
the plane from stalling and crashing
malfunctioned and caused the planes to
lose control and crash a system
malfunctioning on one aircraft can be
acceptable as a technical error but the
same system having the same trouble
again was no coincidence boy claim that
they were unaware of any technical fault
when they sold the planes to different
airlines even if one accepts that the
question remains what happened after the
first crash of Lion Air flight six one
zero in October 2018 the aircraft
manufacturer was informed about the
faulty system and what did they do well
not much actually
the fleet of Mac's seven three seven
eight was not grounded there were no
special trainings for pilots to be
equipped with the Aaron Lewis system and
how to tackle it no special systems
installed just a statement than the
instructed pilots to override the faulty
sensor a hundred and eighty nine lives
had been lost people were still reeling
from this loss when Ethiopian Air flight
three zero two crashed on 10th of March
same aircraft same model same technical
error
one hundred and fifty seven innocent
people lost their lives many countries
across the globe took notice and
plundered the Boeing 737 max eight fleet
boeing stopped the sale of any new
aircraft till further notice
well the soul seems too little donate
three hundred and forty six lives had
been lost lives that could have been
saved we are a report we on well this

stop there he then said that the

gaya in India followed by another in
China and that India and China would do
well to live side-by-side economically
why was he saying all of this the
occasion interestingly was the launch of
a special global educational program for
spiritual emotional and ethical learning
did the Tibetan spiritual leader
overstep his brief some would say he did
for someone who has avoided he refrained
from making political comments that the
Lai Lamas remarks are an invitation to
controversy he said Nehru told him that
Americans would never help Tibet he
spoke about Tibet's future with China he
reiterated that he's not seeking
independence for Tibet but would prefer
a reunion as he calls it with China
under a mutually acceptable agreement
basically all sides open actually
sometimes I assume that telling people I

twenty six lakhs you heard that right
Vijay Mallya on his austerity Drive is
cutting his expenses down to 26 lakhs a

cut his spending the SBI is among the

perhaps it's the exorbitant legal fees
that he is paying that is pushing him to
the brink of insolvency or the cigars
that he smokes or the upkeep of his

Vijay Mallya
towards a more austere lifestyle his

eighty four thousand pounds that is
close to seventy five lakhs from his
personal assistance he also received a

from a business acquaintance that money
amounts to 1.15 crore rupees Vijay

did you know how and when India a
country of two major national parties
became a country of regional satraps the
trend began in the mid 1990s we've seen
ups and downs since and this election
season India is again waking up to the
reality of regional politics as polling
dates draw near the focus is
increasingly on regional and smaller
parties in their houses a plethora of
highly individualistic regions which
have their own history their own culture
in Europe each of them would have been
referred to as a separate nation state
in India they're part of one vibrant
Democratic set up and these regions come
with their own politics and they are
going to have a major say in who forms
the government after the selection the
last time the BJP steamrolled the
opposition to a record 282 Lok Sabha
seats its vote share the BJP food share
was thirty nine thirty one percent close
to that now closer look at the numbers
tells a very interesting story in 2014
the boat share of the national parties
as a whole including the Congress
touched an all-time low of a little over
60% in the 1990s these national parties
contributed to more than 80% of the
national would share
now to register at the state level or a
national political party an outfit needs
to pull a minimum percentage of votes or
win a minimum number of seats those who
do not are termed as unrecognized
parties in 2014 the would share of
regional parties like the aam aadmi
party the Trinamool Congress together
was 22.7% back in the 90s that number
was a mere two point two percent so you
see the rise from two percent to 22
percent in less than twenty years and
now look at this the vote share of
independent candidates has remained more
or less the same about three to four
percent over the last three decades the
hold of national parties on India's
voters has declined their vote share is
just over a half of the total voting
population the BJP in Congress together
won an average of 56.5% seats in the
last four looks of elections a minimum
share of 40% seats remained with the
regional parties despite the anteed
companies
despite regional issues despite
political waves they remain there
between 1999 and 2014 both the BJP and
the Congress foreign governments twice
each with the support of regional
alliance partners while the Congress has
lost steadily and the BJP has gained
steadily in this period the real rise
has been that of the regional players
this includes the likes of the a IBM
came Tamela and the JD s in Karnataka
the RJD in Bihar BDD in Odisha and
others so much of the Congress parties
so much of the Congress Party's lost in
fact has not been directly the BJP is
keen in fact now God is decision to
contest from why not in Kerala seems to
be
a back-to-basics move he's trying to
project the Congress as a national party
that has deep understanding of the
regional issues of the country at least
one of the many regions that's Kerala so
what explains the rise of these regional
parties you may ask two things one
people in states feel that the so-called
national parties are not sensitive not

regional issues and to the national

a modified Boeing 747 better known as
the Air Force one ties between Boeing
and the current US President Donald
Trump run deep Trump is an aviation
enthusiast and once owned the Trump
shuttle airline in its three along its
existence this airline was in close
contact with Boeing Trump also used a
personal Boeing 757 before he assumed
office in January 2017 Trump's
connection with Boeing CEO Dennis
Muhlenberg is not new either
Trump had personally negotiated with
Muhlenberg to try and lower the cost of
a future version of the US presidential
aircraft then in July last year Boeing
won a 3.9 billion dollar contract to
replace two
Air Force one jets if signposting is
anything to go by then
Trump's preference for Boeing has been
more than apparent the US president has
used Boeing products and sites as
backdrops for major presidential
announcements in July last year Donald
Trump used this his visit to a Boeing
plant in st. Louis to talk about the
impact of his tax will tax overhaul bill
but Trump isn't alone in this Boeing
boat there are other top White House
officials who have close ties with the
aircraft manufacturer take acting
defense secretary secretary Patrick
Shanahan for instance he worked for
Boeing for thirty-one years before
joining the Pentagon former US
ambassador to the United States united
nations rather nikki Haley has been
nominated by Boeing to join its board of
directors
Boeing stature makes it a natural choice
for American administrations to cozy up
to it is the USS second largest defense
contractor the company received one
hundred and four billion dollars in
unclassified defense contracts between
2014 and 2018 it is no surprise then
that the Trump administration has
repeatedly urged its allies to buy
Boeing products but this is what all the
cozying up leads to two plane crashes
346 lives lost lives that could have
been saved whose fault is that we asked
again the manufacturer or the regulators
the important question is what really
was done to prevent such a thing from
happening if the right procedure had
been put in place at the right time the
world wouldn't have seen the death of
346 innocent people 29 October 2018
line a flight 6 1-0 traveling from
Jakarta to Puncak belong with hundred
and eighty-nine souls on board thirteen
minutes after takeoff the plane lost
contact with the air traffic control and
crashed into the sea
killing all 189 people 10th March 2019
Ethiopian Air flight 3:02 traveling from
Addis Ababa to Nairobi with hundred and
fifty-seven people on board six minutes
after takeoff the plane reports trouble
and requests a return to the airport but
before the plane could make a return it
crashed 157 passengers on board dead
both the incidents hauntingly similar an
eerie coincidence
sadly no both the incidents had one very
common factor the plane itself Boeing
737 max aged two crashes in less than
six months from new model was highly
suspect so what had caused two new jets
to just drop out of the sky and crash
the reason a faulty sensor on the Boeing
737 max eight a system that was intended
to save the plane from stalling and
crashing malfunctioned and caused the
planes to lose control and crash a
system malfunctioning on one aircraft
can be acceptable as a technical error
but the same system having the same
trouble again was no coincidence
boy claimed that they were unaware of
any technical fault
when they sold the planes to different
airlines even if one accepts that the
question remains what happened after the
first crash of Lion Air flight six one
zero in October 2018 the aircraft
manufacturer was informed about the
faulty system and what did they do well
not much actually the fleet of Mac's
seven three seven eight was not grounded
there were no special trainings for
pilots to be equipped with the Aaron
Lewis system and how to tackle it no
special systems installed just a
statement that the instructed pilots to
override the faulty sensor a hundred and
eighty nine lives had been lost people
were still reeling from this loss when
Ethiopian Air flight 3:02 crashed on
10th of March same aircraft same model
same technical error 157 innocent people
lost their lives many countries across
the globe took notice and grounded the
Boeing 737 max eight fleet boeing
stopped the sale of any new aircraft
till further notice
well the soul seems too little to Nate
346 lives had been lost lives that could
have been saved we are a report we on

_aE3a8LfHPE,Exclusive: Buttler on Rajasthan&#39;s IPL campaign,Rajasthan ended their three-game losing streak in the Indian Premier League beating Bangalore by seven wickets on April 2.,2019-04-04T16:19:53Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_aE3a8LfHPE/hqdefault.jpg,"now a yer in the week on Tuesday
Rajasthan Royals back their first win of
the season in it was a half century from
Jos Butler the man who began the IPL in
the eye of a monk earning controversy
that played a key role in the successful
chase against Virat Kohli's Royal
Challengers Bangalore I had the
opportunity to speak exclusively to Jos
Butler earlier today and I began by
asking him if getting that first win
under the bed was a big relief for the
team after they had squandered a few
promising positions in their first three
games yeah it's a big relief to get our
first win you know we played some good
cricket in stages and the previous games
but haven't managed to put together a
whole performance and get the win for
the team so yeah obviously it breeds
confidence for the wind guys are
delighted to get that first one on the
board and hopefully we can now get on a
roll
second 50 of the tournament for you
personally just talk us through how you
were approaching the chase because it
was one of those tricky targets wasn't
it
yeah I think you know Jaipur
last season as well we saw that the
first six is generally the best time to
bat so I was nice to get a partnership
going with a Jenko and set the platform
for the chase the bowlers had bowed
really well for us you know show us
gopal in particular a fantastic spell of
legs been bowling which kept RCB to a
manageable total and we managed to just
build some partnerships and work our way
towards the score jociel for scores in
the tournament so far read their two
fifties and to single digit returns I
guess it shows how dangerous you can be
once you get your eye in and you seem to
be continuing from right where you left
off last season how do you look at your
role in this batting unit is it to try
and play through the innings or is it to
give the team a quick start
I think the role
and it changes a little bit depending on
the situation of the game that the other
night was trying to you know I was
disappointed to get out and not be there
at the end that was something I wanted
to try and do and get the team over the
line and I think you have to just react
to the conditions of you know sometimes
we get on great wickets where you really
need to be a really positive from the
start
sometimes early honest can be quite
tricky so going through that bit and
taking your time and you might be able
to catch him later so I just try and
assess the conditions when they get out
in the middle beginnings from Steven
Smith as well against Bangalore on
Tuesday he seems to be slowly getting
back into his rhythm what's it been like
to have him back in the camp you know
with reference of course to how he's
coming back to Big Time cricket after a
year and had that injury to contend with
as well yes he's been great in the squad
of sales fantastic to have him in our
team and delighted to be playing
alongside him he's a fantastic player
and let you say he looks to be getting
back to her to his form is you know had
a a couple of really good outings raised
you know not getting massive scores but
he's batting well and and doing his job
for the team and you know I think
world-class players like him it's you
know they're always consistent they're
always contributing and we always expect
so much of them as well so you know I
think it's he's been great for the side
he's obviously bring us a lot of
experience and knowledge and has played
with lots of IPL cricket as well so it's
been great for the squad
yes one final question then just so you
have a couple of break nails before
taking on the Kolkata Knight Riders on
Sunday it's been a similar start of the
tournament for Rajasthan as last year a
bit slow off the blocks but eventually
you did make it into the playoffs ten
more games to go this season so it is a
long way away but what kind of small
targets do you think you need to set as
a group to make sure that you get there
again this year yeah we need to just get
on a little bit of a roll i think in
three games we've lost we had chances
to really win those games and we're just
the big moments didn't quite hit our
straps but I think you know in this
tournament we've had a few games spent
some time together as a squad getting to
know each other and know each other's
strengths and settling into the
tournament so now it's really important
that we could start to climb that table
and get into the playoff playoff places
you Joss Butler there of the Rajasthan
Royals at peace with the monkeying
controversy but also insisting that the
rules that are currently in place are
not clear enough any beliefs that is
what has led to a controversy",True,en,146,0,3

without a doubt it is the F in the fang
stocks among the top five tech stocks in
the world
the other being Apple Amazon Netflix and
Google but Mark Zuckerberg its CEO wants
our help to run the company he's facing
criticism the world over Facebook is
being misused to influence elections and
now Zuckerberg has asked governments
across the world to come up with one
unified regulatory policy one set of
rules that will apply the world over
basically he's passing the buck he's
telling governments to legislate first
he has specifically sought help in four
areas one preventing harmful content to
upholding election integrity three
ensuring privacy and for data
portability he has asked countries to
adopt the European Union's general data
protection regulation so technically
Facebook is asking governments to
regulate meaning asking governments to
do what Facebook itself should be doing
isn't it the job of this company
Facebook to regulate what happens on its
platform and it knows that it's asking
for the moon it is almost impossible to
get a global consensus on how the
internet should be run and that's what
Mark Zuckerberg is now asking for every
country has its own internet laws is
Zuckerberg trying to subvert the
internet laws of individual countries by
seeking one global internet law besides
what is right in one country may not be
right in another but the issue that he's
raised is crucial because right now
anyone sitting anywhere in the world can
influence voters in any other part of
the world not everyone trusts Facebook
NOTAM to fix the mess that it has
created on its platform Singapore for
instance has decided to not wait for
Facebook to crack down on fake news the
city-state is planning fake news
legislation which will require social
media sites to carry warnings on posts
that the government certifies as false
they are also expected to remove
comments that are against quote unquote
public interest violations could attract
fines of up to seven hundred and thirty
seven seven lakh thirty seven thousand
five hundred dollars and ten years in
prison
now Singapore's stringent laws follow
France Russia Germany and Malaysia
why is it crucial you may ask because
the world's largest Democratic exercise
is just a few days away we are talking
about the election in India more than
900 million people will be voting in
this election that will be held in seven
phases from the 11th of April through
the 19th of May now facebook claims to
have 300 million active users in India
making India its single largest market
social media will play a pivotal role in
the world's biggest test of democracy
although the Election Commission has
already announced a code of conduct that
will have to be followed by social media
companies as well as political parties
there is some skepticism over Facebook's
commitment why would they do it Facebook
says it will implement its learnings
from recently concluded elections in
Brazil in the US and Bangladesh but
Facebook has not told us how it's going
to do it it's not providing any
guarantees under intense scrutiny after
the Russian meddling in the u.s.
election the allegations of those chief
executive Mark Zuckerberg had said and
I'm quoting we've certainly made a lot
of progress but no I don't think anyone
can guarantee in a world where you have
nation states that are trying to
interfere in elections there is no
single thing we can do and say okay
we've now solved this issue and this
comment says everything that has to be
said facebook claims that it is
determined to fight misinformation but
at the same time it wants users to
regulate it says there's no guarantee
that it can crack down on fake news in

Pakistan it is about the newest addition
to Imran Khan's cabinet in Pakistan you
would assume that it will be just
another member of his party that
tehreek-e-insaf but the latest entry in
Pakistan's government is not just
another politician his name is a Josh
Shah a former chief of Pakistan's
Intelligence Bureau and a former member
of the iSight take a look at his CV he
Josh Shaw served as the director general
of the Intelligence Bureau during the
reign of pervez musharraf during the
reign of pervez musharraf he was counted
amongst the president's loyalists
Jasha is accused of plotting the murder
of Benazir Bhutto and more importantly
he was the caretaker of Osama bin Laden
v Osama bin Laden the al-qaeda terrorist
the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks in
America now Josh Shah helped hide Osama
bin Laden he's widely believed to be the
mind behind the Abbottabad safehouse
that is where Osama bin Laden was living
before he was killed it is said that a
Josh Shah was harboring Osama he ordered
the construction of this three storied
walled compound that housed Osama bin
Laden the chief of al-qaeda and pervez
musharraf
had full knowledge of all of this now
the same man has taken oath as a
minister in Pakistan the Minister of
parliamentary affairs
Jasha always had political ambitions we
are told he made several attempts to win
a seat in Pakistan's National Assembly
in the first two attempts in 2013 and
2015 he was handed a defeat but in the
last general election in all this last
year a Josh Shah was fielded by Imran
Khan's party from the n na one 1/8
constituency and this time he managed to
win he was third time lucky early
reports had indicated that a Josh Shaw
could be the next national security
adviser of Pakistan especially after the
exit of nasa's chandra imran khan took
several weeks to decide hey Josh Shah
was picked for the cabinet but was
ultimately given the portfolio of
parliamentary affairs be that as it may
he is a minister now is part of the
cabinet he's swearing in is extremely
controversial it has opened another
political war between the Imran Khan
government and the Pakistan Peoples
Party
days after Benazir Bhutto's death a
letter had come out it was a letter that
was written by benazir bhutto herself it
was addressed to pervez musharraf and in
that letter Bhutto had accused Yasha of
hatching a conspiracy to kill her his
appointment is also a statement on Imran
Khan's cabinet so far the pakistan Prime
Minister has inducted 16 former
loyalists of pervez musharraf perhaps
the Pakistani Prime Minister prefers to
have ministers were known to be loyal to
the military eg Asha is yet another
example the message to the world is
clear those who harbor terrorists are
rewarded with cabinet berths in Pakistan
the not Sonia Pakistan of Imran Khan and
the timing of the swearing-in couldn't
have been worse because Pakistan is
under pressure to prove to the world
that it is cracking down on terror safe
havens India's diplomatic hits have left
Islamabad helpless foreign minister of
pakistan shah mahmud Qureshi has
indicated that his country could be
blacklisted by the Financial Action Task
Force or the F ATF and he has blamed
India for this the F ATF remember is a
global watchdog that combats money
laundering and tariff financing around
the world it had - it had in fact put
Pakistan on its gray list last year
which basically means that Pakistan is
under watch a great listing means that
Pakistan's domestic laws are weak to
tackle money-laundering and tariff
financing the f80 have asked Islamabad
to make amends it told the government of
Imran Khan to comply with a list of 27
demands and so far their progress has
been unsatisfactory Pakistan has not
been able to limit financing to terror
groups we all know that instead it has
been blaming India for its misfortunes
shah mahmud Qureshi the foreign minister
says that Pakistan could be blacklisted
because India has been lobbying against
it
sure enough India has been lobbying and
Pakistan's actions have made India's job
easy
terror financing in Pakistan is no
secret recently a team from the f80 if
had traveled to the country they
conducted a thorough review the question
before them was this as Pakistan done
enough to be excluded from the grey list
the answer was no the F ATF team
serious reservations they felt that
Pakistan has not done enough to curb
terror financing India's diplomatic
campaign is about making the world aware
of Pakistan state sponsorship to
terrorists and that is why India has
been backing has in fact got the backing
of countries like the United States the
United Kingdom France and Germany
what worries Pakistan more are the
financial losses that will follow all of
this the F ATF's clamped down will bleed
Pakistan they could suffer losses to the
tune of ten billion dollars every year
that's a lot of money they're already
struggling financially
the Imran Khan government is negotiating
for a bailout from the IMF the
International Monetary Fund any more
curbs any more curbs on the financial
sector will hurt Pakistan terribly the F
ATF crackdown will squeeze their economy
further make it harder for Pakistan to
meet their debt obligations force
foreign institutions to downgrade
Pakistan's debt ratings
this means that Pakistan will find it
hard to raise money from international
bond markets it could also hurt its IMF
bailout prospects and this too was part
of India's plan to punish Pakistan India
wants Pakistan blacklisted after the
pull bomber attack India shared a
dossier with EF ATF reports say that
India shared specific information on the
JSA muhammad's links to the pull Varma
attack this dossier talked about the
al-rahim a trust in particular this is a
non profit outfit it is believed to be
funding the activities of the Jesse
Muhammad the al Rahim a trust was set up
by Masood Azhar in 2002 while America
has tried to curb its activities this
trust still enjoys public and state
support in Pakistan
India's diplomatic initiative could very
well paved the way for Pakistan to be
blacklisted by the FA TF according to
Pakistan's own admission as I said it
has lost or it is going to lose ten
billion dollars every year after being
placed on the f80 of realist in June
last year it now stares at the prospect
of being blacklisted Pakistan has
prepared a report card for itself it is
full of holes
take a look
[Music]
after being placed on global terror
financing watchdog the FEC ebbs gray
list in June 2018 Pakistan had agreed
upon a 27-point action plan in February
2019 the F ATF narrowed it down to a
simple 10-point plan and asked Pakistan
to implement all of those points by May
2019 we own world is one accessed the
compliance report on that 10-point plan
prepared by Pakistan and surprise
surprise Pakistan has patted itself on
the back and claimed progress on almost
all of the f80 s demands Pakistan is
basically fudged its way through the
whole progress report and for every
point asked by the F ETF Pakistan has
given itself a thumbs up
telling the F ATF that action has been
taken on all counts what's important to
note here is the highlighting of the
pour rate of convictions as demanded by
F ATF in the 10-point plan where point
number seven reads as demonstrating the
terror financing prosecutions result in
effective proportionate and dissuasive
sanctions and to this end even Pakistan
admits that the rate of conviction
stands low for now however it does
assure that action has been initiated to
strengthen the judicial process but on
all of the counts action has already
been taken or is currently underway bear
in mind the Pakistan now needs to submit
this compliance report on the 15th of
April to the F ATF APG that's the F
ATF's asia-pacific group while the
report compilation process is underway
sources tell beyond that the final
detail report will end up running into
over 165 pages the report will then be
debated by the F ATF APG in its meeting
scheduled to be held in Sri Lanka s
capital Colombo from 20th to the 22nd of
May and that's where Pakistan's lies
will eventually be thrashed out based on
FA T f EP G's assessment of the debate
it will then give its findings report to
the F ATF plenary
the plenary is scheduled to take place
in June in Paris where the matter of
blacklisting of Pakistan will once again
come up for discussion
Bureau report we on world is one now
Pakistan spheres are being blacklisted
are not unfounded look at the
preliminary findings of the F ATF team
and you'll get the drift reports from
the draft say and I quote activities of
banned organizations still remain
unchecked at provincial district and
grassroot levels this means that they
still they can still freely raise funds
whole meetings and rallies and the
effort EF report then goes on to say
that Pakistan has so far failed to
demonstrate a proper understanding of
terror financing risks posed by groups
linked like the lashkar-e-taiba and
jaish-e-mohammed and this is my way of
reports but this is what the f ATF seems
to have found in Pakistan join the dots
they make one word blacklist and that is
Pakistan's future

hello and welcome to yet another episode
of India election watch the only show
that brings you news updates all the
latest from India's electoral scene
developments as they take place without
spins or twists we bring you clear to
the point analysis and bulky sham our
party I let's bring you up to speed with
what happened today
[Music]
eight days left for the first phase of
election in India the Congress party has
released its manifesto today first
impressions it's a real page-turner
let's break down the key promises for
you the Congress flagship scheme the eye
drops the list has expectant the
promises to give the poorest 20% of
India seventy-two thousand rupees every
year other promises include filling
filling up 22 lakh government job
vacancies giving 10 lakh youth
employment in gram panchayats guarantee
150 days of employment under the MN Re
Ga the Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme
a separate budget for farmers of India
and allotting six percent of India's
budget for education all of it sounds
great
but the devil they say lies in the
detail first of all are these promises
even relevant will the manifesto
resonate with the voters of India
especially after Bala quote Leon's
political editor Karthik a chinois put
that question to Rahul Gandhi himself
Raji I Marquardt occasional from beyond
my question to you is that your
benefactor is very job economy pollution
civic amenity centric do you think that
in post
bala quote political narrative it is
enough to propel Congress back to power
I am absolutely sure that the issues in
this election are unemployment and the
state of formers I am absolutely sure
about that if you go to if you go out
that's what the country is saying so I'm
absolutely certain that the issue in
this election is rose gar and Kazan
rushed ajar and near you job the
Congress president was quite vocal today
his target was the Prime Minister his
election season there is no room for
politeness Rao Gandhi called Narendra
Modi a liar
when we started this process about a
year back I spoke to mr. Cheetham Brahm
mr. Gowda and I gave them two
instructions I said this is not to be a
manifesto made in closed rooms I
understand that the Congress party has a
lot of expertise but this manifesto
should reflect the wishes of the people
of India that was the first point and
the second point I said was whatever is
going to be in this manifesto has to be
truthful I do not want a single thing in
this manifesto that is a lie because we
have been hearing large numbers of lies
spoken every day by our prime minister
let's get down to the meat of this
manifesto the promises that the Congress
party has made today are they achievable
the first major promise 22 lakh
government vacancies will be filled by
the year 2020 how will they do it what's
the plan many of these vacancies we know
are years old both at the central and
state level these posts have been vacant
for a long long time both the state
governments and the center do not have
the cash to fill them up their budgets
are stretched how will mr. Gandhi do it
promised number to me I or the minimum
income support program the Congress
claims it is doable critics say it is
debatable many experts feel that the
burden of this program could push the
central government winning India into
debt the Congress says that it has no
plans to end existing subsidies then
where will the money come from
probably the super-rich in the middle
class people like you and me they will
have to pay more taxes that brings us to
agriculture Congress is promised yet
another loan waiver in states those
states that haven't already been given a
loan waiver that could further
complicate the budget math
not to say increase India's fiscal
deficit but there are some welcome moves
to like an emphasis on the protection of
personal data it's the need of the our
it has been part of the public discourse
for some time now but no political party
has taken it up as a manifesto issue the
Congress has promised to protect
personal data unfortunately they haven't
given any details on how they'll do it
another commendable promise is to treat
air pollution as a national public
health emergency it most certainly is it
should be recognized as such the
Congress party wants to strengthen the
national clean air program but yet again
they fail to give a plan now he has an
interesting observation both the
Congress and the BJP have announced
similar initiatives to clean the Ganga
but they are yet to achieve any concrete
results me that has it made wrong and
he's confident about his party's
manifesto so much so that he has
challenged Narendra Modi to a one-on-one
debate before the selection of Marisa
Marisa haka debate curry national
security we mentioned the victory I
challenge the toner in the Medeco
National Security promote a debate
containing foreign policy permuted
America design corruption prosperity
rhetoric merits a push to pradhan mantri
options are basically part of their
afterthought to Nevada they opted
articulate the gloves are truly off so
how could the BJP fall behind
finance minister Arun Jaitley levied
some serious charges against the
Congress
listen to what he said about their
manifesto
even though there was a drafting
committee but it appears that some of
the important points have been drafted
by the Congress presidents friends in
the Tokra to correct gang Indian Penal
Code say section extra Chavez capital a
sedition Italian Agha
destro karna Abba Prada nahi hoga Joe
party strata Ghana Cartier voice - K air
to be warty Hakka Dharma here strong
words it's time to tell you about the
controversial bits in the Congress
manifesto the Grand Old Party wants to
do away with the Sedition law as mr.
Jaitley said that is section 124 a of
the Indian Penal Code it made headlines
in 2016 remember this was when
anti-india slogans were heard in the
Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi
sedition charges were slapped against
students the Congress wants to scrap
this law it doesn't end there the
Congress also wants to amend the
controversial Armed Forces Special
Powers Act have spa the party says it
wants to quote unquote strike a balance
between the powers of security forces
and human rights of citizens there is
another proposal no immunity for the
Armed Forces in case of forced
disappearance sexual violence and
torture those people who lay down their
life for the country you want them to be
prosecuted at the behest of terrorists
or their friends or relatives
ingratitude is the biggest sin that any
political party can commit or rj dar

this was another opportunity for the
finance minister to criticize the
Congress knew I skim the BJP has already
termed it unimplemented well Arun

it wasn't just New Delhi that were to
stall the election action today while
the Congress president was hard selling
his manifesto the BJP stopped two
leaders were out travelling across
states that go to polls in the first
phase let's pull up our rally roster for
you Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in
Odisha and Bihar today he addressed
three rallies both of these states
account for 51 seats in the Lok Sabha
BJP president Amit Shah was in southern
India he travelled to Tamil Nadu and
Karnataka winning the South remember is
critical for the BJP if it wants to
retain majority just these two states
hold 57 seats between them
Prime Minister Modi addressed a rally in
calahonda in the state of Odisha today
calahonda falls in the kvk region
calahonda balan gear Koraput often
synonymous with extreme poverty so
Modi's address targeted what he called
the elite Congress party he accused the
Congress party of using the poor as a
vote bank he said they'd snatch the
entitlements of the poor he recounted

now elections in India I have always
been polarized they're just getting
worse with time
politicians are pushing the boundaries
stooping to unforeseen lows and it's
across the spectrum not one party one
has come to expect it in fact but some
things really are beyond the field when
governors favor parties when the army is
politicized the country cannot sit and
keep waiting for action
last week Rajasthan governor Kalyan
Singh branded himself as a BJP worker he
even rooted for Prime Minister and rain
nari the Modi's reelection
[Music]
Ingram a movie April - tripping a DD
couple hard windriver gonna get - GD
ouch again automatically object now
Kalyan Singh is a governor that's a
constitutional post a governor is
supposed to be neutral a governor is not
supposed to make political statements
needless to say Kalyan Singh was
criticized today and the Election
Commission has said it will write to the
president about this incident it said
that Kalyan Singh statement has lowered
the prestige of the high office held by
him unfortunately Singh is not the lone
offender a couple of days ago today she
described the in that comment has drawn
angry reactions what has the election
watchdog done we asked we've sought a
report from the district election office
in Ghaziabad now seeking reports in
bringing the matter to the notice of the
president are all good and fine but they
sound extremely bureaucratic and slow
moves in a fast-moving election story
shouldn't there be immediate action
exemplary action in cases like these
what takes the election commission so
long to act on violations it took them
nine days nine full days to even notice
that Kalyan Singh had violated the code
and they're still mulling writing a
letter they haven't written one yet
is it sluggish or is it toothless the
Election Commission of India can it
really punish offenders should it be
given independent authority to act in
such matters because these violations
are becoming more frequent by the day
the last time a governor in India was
found in violation of the model code of
conduct was in the 1990s the then
Governor of Marshall Pradesh will share
em and had campaigned for his son Sayeda
but in the mud the pradesh election will
shale was from the congress party so
clearly no parties in the clear and
unless the model code of conduct becomes
legally binding that is enforceable by
law such violations will continue let me
explain my point further do you know
that the model code of conduct has
something about manifestos what does it
say about manifestos it says that
election manifestos cannot make undo
promises to exert any undue influence on
the voter in other words no freebies no
swaps that amounts to bribery the rules
say that manifesto should only indicate
means to achieve promises meaning plans
now tell me how many political parties
follow this rule and what action to
their face when they break it the answer
to the both both these questions is one
none zero so when we talk about election
reform in India this is where we must
begin enforcing the law on those who
want to be lawmakers
every election season in India there are
a few constants rallies celebrities
turning politicians and the National
Conference asking for a separate prime
minister and president for the state of
Jammu and Kashmir this time is no
different
[Applause]

homer Abdullah's comments are nothing
new as I already said there's a long
history here months after India's
independence homer Abdullah's
grandfather sheikh abdullah was worried
about his future muhammad ali jinnah had
eclipsed Congress leaders in Pakistan he
was behind the fall of leaders like
frontier Gandhi in the Northwest
Frontier Province he made the Premier of
Punjab province run for cover to London
Sheikh Abdullah was worried that he will
meet the same fate to save his position
he wanted Kashmir to remain in India he
used his friendship with Jawaharlal
Nehru to have his way once the Maharaja
of Kashmir was exiled Hari Singh Sheikh
Abdullah became the power center in
Kashmir he achieved the extension to
India through article 370 he encouraged
Duvall on a route to bypass Parliament
all this is part of record numerous
historical accounts attest to the story
now Sheikh Abdullah achieved all that he
wanted independence from Jinnah and
absolute power in Kashmir it was an act
of an uncanny politician once stuck
between Jinnah and the Maharaja now
shade of the lie become the de-facto
power center in the state of Jammu and
Kashmir he won all the 75 seats in the
State Assembly election in 1951 he
remained prime minister of Jammu and
Kashmir till 1953 and then something
gave way in 1953 Sheikh Abdullah was
dismissed for conspiracy against the
state of India and he was arrested in 12
years time the National Conference
merged with the Indian National Congress
it became the Jammu and Kashmir branch
of the Congress party Abdullah was
arrested again in 1965 who was in jail
for three years he started a splinter
group
called the plebiscite front this play
beside front took the name of the
National Conference the party that Omar
Abdullah is now representing so did
Sheikh Abdullah want to referendum he
did till a certain point in time
separatism was it was his political
bedroom the party his party used
separatism to appease the separatist
elements in the valley and to win their
books but when the election was done
they duly sided with either the Congress
of the BJP to grab our shaykh abdullah
himself struck a deal with Indira Gandhi
in 1975 and he became chief minister of
Jammu and Kashmir if the National
Conference was against abuse of power as
they call it the party should have
contested against in their aah Gandhi's
Congress right after the emergency
that's not something they did in reality
its power that mattered to this party
like most parties to be fair it
contested in alliance with the Congress
it even won two seats Sheikh Abdullah
became the chief minister yet again
after Shaykh Abdullah State Farooq
Abdullah his son became chief minister
in 1982 three generations of this family
have rigged up issues like separate
prime ministership and separate
Constitution
they've remained supportive of article
370 and 35 a but that hasn't stopped
them from joining the bjp-led NDA homer
Abdullah's Jammu and Kashmir national
conference was part of the NDA the
bjp-led alliance till the year 2002 they
quit only after the party lost the
assembly election for National
Conference separatism is an election
issue an Omer Abdullah's Commons
demanding separate prime ministership
should be seen in the context of his
party's history and its alliances we
believe that Jammu and Kashmir's
problems are a combination of many
factors and the only solution is
and complete unification and once that
is achieved all the so-called separate
measures given to it during extension
must go no two ways about it we have one
country one diverse country but the law
should be the same for the land the
Constitution of India provides for it
and the very same Constitution the
constitutional validity of articles like
378 35 they are still disputed
[Music]
and here's an interesting story one for
the trivia lovers what happens when
there are more contestants for a
constituency then can be accommodated in
one electronic voting machine and this
is not a hypothetical question it's
something that the Election Commission
is facing right now in nizamabad in
Telangana there are 185 candidates in
the frame we hold em to IBM's electronic
voting machines can only accommodate 64
names this is almost thrice that number
and this is easily the largest number of
candidates in one seat in the 2019
general election it's a record of sorts
so what is the Election Commission doing
about it
are they reverting to the paper ballot
after all extraordinary times call for
extraordinary measures but that's not
the measure that the poll panel is
exploring no paper ballot the commission
has ordered listen to this a whopping
twenty six thousand eight hundred and
twenty ballot units two thousand two
hundred and forty control units two
thousand and six hundred BB packs of
third-generation EVMs and all of it for
this one constituency in Islamabad so
what is the difference between these two
a b and c old one and the new one we all
voted machine as I said can accommodate
only 64 names the new one can list a
maximum of 384 candidates that should
cover it
among the 185 contestants in Islamabad
is Telangana Chief Minister KC our
daughter Kavita
she's decision sitting MP from the sea
while the other 184 people against her
you may ask farmers mostly nearly 179 of
them 179 farmers are contesting from
this one seat
rosamma bar they're contesting of
independent candidates they're making a
statement on the rural distress in the
region now that is done did you know
which constituency had the maximum
number of contestants ever the answer is
also in Telangana the constituency is
now lagonda in 1996 480 people contested
from Nalgonda now part of Telangana at
that time it was part of United Andhra
Pradesh number two on this list is 456
candidates bingum in Karnataka it was
the same election 96 now Nizamabad has
taken the third position number 4 is
east date again in 1996 the constituency
had a hundred and twenty-two candidates
the same number of candidates as Bhavani
in Haryana in 1989 another feature to
watch is the number of candidates who
lose their deposit in such a multi
cornered race
for 77 477 out of 480 in a lagoon that
they lost their default deposit for 54
out of 456 in Belgium 120 each in East
Delhi in Bhavani a candidate who fails
to get 1/6 of the vote for feeds the
deposit we have to see how many of the

The World is One News, WION examines global ...",2019-04-02T12:02:14Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BFk6C3UFUq0/hqdefault.jpg,"the budget smartphone market is getting
competitive by the day and xiaomi has
now introduced them much awaited redmi
note 7 pro in india but the question is
is it worth your money take it out finds
out let's start with the design because
that's the most important deciding
factor whenever we plan to buy a new
phone the redmi note 7 pro doesn't have
a unique design but it looks premium it
has an old glass design that makes it
attractive but at the same time it makes
it prone to smudges as well but
interestingly the glass at the front and
the back is protected by the Corning
Gorilla Glass 5 to ensure high
durability we have been using the phone
for nearly a week now and it hasn't got
any scratches the camera is neatly
placed at the back and the front talking
about the display the dot notch makes
the display neater
also the 6.3 inch full HD plus display
is pleasing to the eyes and is viewable
under direct sunlight the phone is
comfortable to hold and operate but I
wish it had a slightly slimmer profile
the phone is available in black blue and
red and we must say that the black color
looks pretty sophisticated
next comes the camera which is one of
the key highlights of the phone the
phone sports this dual camera setup with
a 48 megapixel sensor and a 5 megapixel
sensor but before you jump the gun let
us tell you that the megapixel count
alone isn't an indicator of the photo
quality so let's directly look at the
results generated by the camera in
daylight and here's a video taken with
the note 7 pro's camera
[Music]
the phone also has a Pro Mode to let you
take photos like who else but a pro the
camera in bright areas captures sharp
results with true-to-life colors well
that's about daylight wondering how does
it perform in low-light areas we tested
the phone in a dimly lit restaurant and
took some photos and videos the results
are detailed and they are free of noise
also note while the phone comes with a
48 megapixel camera it's set to 12
megapixels by default this has been done
by the company for the judicial use of
the storage space so whenever you want
to take a picture in the highest
resolution you can set it to 48
megapixel also the front camera captures
results of acceptable quality the only
downside in the camera app is that
sometimes there is a slight shutter lag
all in all the camera of the redmi note
7 pro is impressive
we used the phone extensively for a long
period and we didn't face any lags
packed with a four thousand milliamp
hour battery the phone lasts for over a
day it comes in two variants 64gb
storage with 4gb of RAM and a 128
gigabyte model with 6 gigabytes of RAM
the base model is priced at 30 thousand
999 rupees and the other one costs 16
thousand 999 rupees
the phone will go on sale in India from
March 13th and it's time for the most
important question where does it stand
in the crowded smartphone market the
redmi note 7 pro has the potential to
disrupt the budget smartphone market
while the budget market is flooded with
great contenders the note 7 pro can take
on leading rivals the new xiaomi phone

of features and now the question is can
it disrupt the loop of smartphone market
check it out finds out
the phone comes with a good build
quality and a nice design the gradient
finish at the back makes it stand out in
the low-cost category the phone has an
average weight it's neither too heavy
nor too light and the curved edges make
it comfortable to hold so it looks and
feels good
the rear panel is prone to smudges
[Music]
talking about the display it's one of
the very few phones in this category to
come with a dewdrop notch also the 6.2
inch display produces satisfactory
colors and offers a fair contrast no
matter how good our phone looks it can
be easily dismissed if it doesn't
perform well so let's move straight to
the camera test and see what it delivers
[Music]
the phone features a dual camera set up
at the back let's take the results
captured by the camera
[Music]
the camera captures true to life colors
and the results are reasonably good
[Music]
increasingly its front camera is among
the best friend shooters in this price
range look at the forges and decide for
yourself
overall the camera is of acceptable
quality
[Music]
coming to its performance the four did
not slow down during the review period
it worked pretty smoothly and had no
heating issues
[Music]
the face recognition feature is accurate
and fast
pad for the big battery the phone easily
lasts for a day the phone is available
in two variants 32gb and 64gb prices for
the phone start at eight thousand nine
hundred and ninety nine rupees and now
it's time for the most important
question is it worth the price tag to
sum it up we think the real mystery is a
good low cost food with a nice design
acceptable cameras and a satisfactory

there's no dearth of low-cost phones in
the market and joining the rape is the
Samsung m10 the phone has plenty of
interesting creatures but how good is
the overall performance
[Music]
let's start with the design for a
low-cost form that galaxy m10 has pretty
neat aesthetics the phone doesn't weigh
much and fits comfortably in my hand
it's slim profile makes it easy to hold
and use the phone has a 6.2 inch display
it's not monstrous in size the screen
comes with a water drop style not that
makes the display even neater the color
reproduction is satisfactory but the
display does appear to be a little dull
if it's not set to full brightness added
size for the fun part
that camera then let's see how good this
for deliver
the phone features a dual camera setup
one with a 13 megapixel sensor and the
other with a five megapixel sensor
here's a look at the results generated
by the phone
interestingly the phone lets you capture
ultra wide-angle shots and i'ma say it
does a good job here's a photo taken
with and without the ultra wide-angle
mode
and this is a panorama captured with the
Galaxy m10
[Music]
[Applause]
and this video has also been recorded
with the rear camera
[Music]
all-in-all the camera satisfies us in
bright light environments but in low
light setups the camera generates
average results some of the results come
out grainy
[Music]
talking about the front camera it's 5
megapixel sensor produces results of
acceptable quality
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
coming to the performance the battery is
the biggest downside of the phone it
charges pretty slow also the absence of
a fingerprint sensor is another concern
here during the review period the phone
didn't trouble us with any lags of
slowdown issues it comes in two variants
16gb with 2gb of RAM at 7990 rupees and
32gb with 3gb of RAM at 8990 rupees and
finally it's time for the verdict on the
galaxy m10 should you buy it or not
we think this phone is pretty average
but if you do plan to buy it
pick the 32gb model over the 16gb
variant

Huawei has launched a new set of
variables in India that new devices
include a SmartWatch and two fitness
bands let's find out what they have to
offer
[Music]
while we watch TV is the most expensive
of the three variables that have been
launched in India the new SmartWatch
looks elegant it works for both looks
beat high street fashion or business
fair the watt sets comfortably on the
wrist and the premium design makes it
noticeable also the watch is set to
vision Cillian to accidents because of
its ceramic bezel design and the
stainless steel chain one of the key
highlights of the SmartWatch is its
battery according to the company
the high tech watch consumes low power
and can last for up to two weeks well
take it out he hasn't tested the watch
for a longer period so we would like to
hold on to our verdict on that featuring
a double crown design the watch includes
of 1.3 9 inch AMOLED display which is
vibrant but also easy on the eyes also
the option to choose between different
watch faces adds to its look and feel
are the features of the watch include
GPS and sleep and heart rate monitoring
features the idea is to track fitness
and encourage users to stay healthy
interestingly the Huawei watch GT
supports the 24 hour continuous smart
heart rate monitoring which means it can
detect the user's exercise status before
he enters the exercise mode this is to
ensure that users are provided with
accurate data the war wave watch GT is
priced at sixteen thousand nine hundred
and ninety rupees for the classic
Edition and fifteen thousand nine
hundred and ninety rupees for the sports
edition
[Music]
well that's about the watch but how good
are the fitness bands and most
importantly can they take on the leading
rivals the war wave band 3 Pro is a
sports wrist band with a touchscreen the
band features a 0.9 5 inch HD emulate
color touch screen to display key data
the controls are easy and intuitive
users can navigate various options on
the screen by swiping vertically or
horizontally or by tapping the screen to
return to home it also comes with heart
rate and sleep monitoring features the
Huawei band 3e has a bracelet like
design that offers a smooth and
comfortable fit other than standard
features it also includes a new footwear
mood to provide precise running data
with the press of a button according to
our way the band is water resistant up
to 50 meters which means you can wear it
even while swimming the war wave band
through flow is prized at 4699 rupees
while the band 3e carries a price tag of
1699 rupees the new variables are
promising but we suggest that you look
at other alternatives to before you buy
one

1PLTzl3rvbo,Oppo F11 Pro Review: Is it worth the money?,We tested Oppo's new camera-heavy smartphone on the streets of Mumbai. Check out our full review before you plan to buy one.,2019-04-02T11:43:31Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1PLTzl3rvbo/hqdefault.jpg,"[Music]
I'm from Delhi and I equally lumumba
there is something special about this
city of dreams whenever I visit this
city it makes me all the more hopeful
most importantly it offers leave it
something new and it hasn't changed
because this time the new experience is
going to be with the latest or
smartphone that I am going to test on
the streets of Mumbai
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
there is one thing smartphone makers are
paying high attention to HD camera after
vari vivo and samson or poe is not very
with its camera heavy phone the Oppo F
11 pro features a dual camera setup at
the back the primary camera has a 48
megapixel sensor and the secondary
camera comes with a five megapixel
sensor while the rear camera stands out
for its high megapixel count the 16
megapixel front shooter catches our
attention for its interesting camera
placement it has a pop-up selfie camera
which isn't unique but new to open in
fact we have seen the same design on
vivo phones as well well the camera
appears to be promising but the question
is does it deliver as much as it claims
so let's put it to different tests and
see how well it performs and I'm going
to start with the mural paintings of
Bollywood star that are right behind
[Music]
what I love about Mumbai is that every
street has its own distinctive style
making it a treat for every photographer
so I kept my camera on throughout the
day to capture the elements of the city
that never cease to amaze me and here
are some of the shots that I took in the
regular
[Music]
and look at these photos clicked in the
portrait mode in daylight the camera
generates fairly nice results with good
colors and sharp details but I think the
results should have come out of bed
brighter and the portrait mode could
have been a little better
but wait what about the videos let's see
how well it first in the video mode
[Music]
but that's about the regular camera
features I put the phone to as many
tests as I could in a day
look at this slow-mo video taken with
the food
[Music]
so right now I'm at Nariman Point this
is one of my favorite spots in Mumbai I
usually like to come here sit for hours
and do nothing but today I'm going to do
a little more than what I usually do I'm
going to test the panorama feature of
the Oppo F eleven Pro and let's it does
it justify the beauty of this place all
in all in bright light that rear camera
delivers satisfactory results and not
just the rear we also put the front
camera to test as well and it doesn't
disappoint not even during night time
[Music]
that's a problem with every new gadget
to get swing mode then you forget
everything else like I forgot to do it
right so I'm going to have my water
power before I talk more about the for
[Music]
the taste lived into sunset life in the
maximum sit is so fast that time just
flies by and I decided to determine its
potential in low-light as well as during
the night when you're a tourist in
Mumbai how can you not visit marine
drive at night at least that's what
completes my trip to Mumbai every time
[Applause]
and what better than a time lapse to
show the frenzied and fast pace of the
city
[Music]
while I do like its performance during
the night the camera disappoints in
areas that are not properly lit up and
even the nightscape mood can't do much
justice while it manages to retain the
details it fails to impress overall the
colours are a little washed out other
than this the camera app includes more
features like HDR and an export more to
help you shoot like a professional for a
phone that is priced under 25,000 rupees
I think camera is of acceptable quality
[Music]
one thing I really like about Mumbai is
its nightlife I mean it looks beautiful
and I just can't get enough of it but
wait let's not digress I should rather
be talking about the look and feel of
the phone and not the sitting other than
the camera another key deciding factor
while buying a phone is its design
talking about the Oppo f11 pro the
phone's rear panel is pretty distinctive
it has a gradient design with streaks of
purple blue and black and not just the
rear panel the frontal design with a
pop-up selfie camera makes room for a
clean display it produces nice colors
but a downside here is that it's not
easy to view the display under harsh
sunlight also talking about the look and
feel
I find the phone a tad thicker which
also adds to its weight having said that
the phone is comfortable to hold and use
when smartphone makers are moving to the
USB type-c format the f11 pro cell comes
with a micro USB port which is a little
disappointing
[Music]
and now comes another important question
how is the performance the phone packs
of 4000 mAh battery which easily lasted
for a day given that I used it heavily
what I don't like in the phone is the
user interface the UI is neither
appealing not neat but it has a decent
RAM and storage so I've come full circle
I'm back to from where I started my day
in the morning but that's not important
what's really important right now is to
understand where the Oppo F 11 pros
stands in the competitive smartphone
market
[Music]
the highlight of the phone is its camera
and it passes the camera test with a
good score for overall the phone has a
few hiccups that prevent it from
becoming a create package it's a phone
that can be considered but the market
has better options available

released its flagship report and global
warming for this year for the year 2018
and as expected the findings are pretty
grim the report says that extreme
weather affected nearly 62 million
people worldwide last year extreme
climate change has also forced two
million people to relocate globally an
estimated nine million people have been
affected by drought worsening the global
flood shortage food shortage problem
rather and that's not all floods have
also affected 35 million people the
world over record emissions of
greenhouse gas continue to drive global
temperatures towards dangerous levels
the past four years have been the
warmest on record ocean heat has reached
a record high and the seas are getting
more acidic and losing oxygen carbon
dioxide levels in the atmosphere have
also hit record highs the United Nations
chief Antonio Guterres has asked
countries to come up with concrete plans
for the September climate summit
fighting how extreme weather has
disrupted lives worldwide he said it's
high time to take action to fight
climate change that's all very well
global warming and climate change might
have dominated discussions among people
for a while now but the subject has been
a non-starter in the world of politics
we've the developed countries of this
world are the ones which are still
developing when it comes to elections
global warming is not a priority at all
no government is voted to power based on
its plans to fight climate change a next
report shows you why good climate policy
makes bad politics
uN chief antonio guterres has said that
climate change is a security and health
issue for the world but no election in
the world is fought on climate change
Donald Trump became President of the
United States after calling climate
change Hawks while in India which is
gearing up for its biggest elections in
recent times climate change is not a
priority on the manifesto of any party
to put it simply global warming just
doesn't make for good politics and
that's because it's directly related to
economics economies around the world are
dependent on energy sources or
manufacturing techniques that release
greenhouse gases at almost every stage
of production transportation storage
delivery and disposal carbon dioxide
emitting fuels continue to be abundant
and their prices consequently low
advanced energy technologies that can
realistically replace the role of fossil
fuels have not kept pace with a rate of
climate change while some developed
countries like France have been at the
forefront of fighting global warming
their efforts to reduce global
temperatures have produced subpar
results on the contrary measures to
contain climate change have resulted in
a massive backlash the French
government's move to increase fuel taxes
hoping to reduce consumption trigger off
the Yellow West movement u.s. President
Donald Trump took a jab at Frances
president emmanuel macro and the Paris
climate agreement claiming that the
riots in the French capital were a sign
that the climate deal wasn't working out
so well for Paris he tweeted and I quote
people do not want to pay large sums of
money much to third world countries in
order to maybe protect the environment
meanwhile developing countries including
India do not have cost-effective access
to advanced energy technologies but
countries like India are industrializing
at a fast clip and their energy needs
are ever rising for developing countries
climate change ends up being an
impediment to their economic development
some developing nations also blame the
developed world so having created the
global warming crisis
in the first place all said and done
climate changes yet to become a key
factor to consider for the boating
public almost no leader is water to

it has been 67 years since India held
its first election and the story of the
Lok Sabha is also the story of India's
elders we often say that life begins at
64 a politician in this country has it
always been the case did you know did
you know about the average age of MPs in
India over the years but first why does
this even matter
why does age matter because India is a
young country 50% of India's population
is below 25 years of age 65 percent
below 35 in 2020 the average in the area
of an Indian will be 29 years much
lesser than China's 37 so we expect
young voters to be represented in
Parliament but that's not the case in
the first lok sabha the average age of a
lawmaker was a little more than 46 years
that number has shot up consistently
the second lok sabha that was formed
after the 1957 election
the average age had increased to forty
six point seven years it crossed 50 for
the first time in the sixth lok sabha
that was right after the emergency and
since then they have been they have been
only two instances when the average age
of india's lok sabha was below fifty
that was in 1979 and then again in 1998
and that will be highly watch by the
15th lok sabha headed by the UPA was the
oldest the average age of an MP in the
2009 looks of ours nearly 58 years the
current Lok Sabha is the second worst 56
years of the average let's bring you
some more numbers forty four percent of
the looks of our members right now our
age between 356 and seventy ten percent
of MPs are from the age group of twenty
five to forty and ten percent are above
seventy one years the lower house
basically is a senior citizens club
[Music]
let's break it down further for you 1/4
of India's population is below is
between 25 to 40 years of age their
representation is only 10 percent 10
percent for 25 percent of India's
population just 8 percent of India's
populations between 56 and 70 years and
their representation is 50 percent this
parliament is not for the young and I'm
not an ageist but performance shows the
younger lawmakers cloth better
attendance they ask more questions they
take part in more debates they introduce
more private member bills the record
show this the older ones not so much we
understand that in a country like India
to win elections you need to be a known
face you need to be known over a period
of time and youngsters are not taking a
politics like this stead of political
debates on social media but that needs
to change
in a changing world full of
technological disruptions and changing
views on of forced officials like LGBTQ
rights rights like adultery law marriage
and rape and data privacy laws shouldn't
young India be the majority voice in
Parliament the answer is yes but the
reality will be different the next Lok

how do you qualify as a national party
in India how many do we have in this
country can parties be demoted from the
national status to a regional status
first things first what is a national
party to be called a national party you
must fulfill one of the three conditions
one when two percent of the seats in the
Lok Sabha from at least three different
states to have four looks of our seats
plus 6% of the vote share in four states
in either the Lok Sabha or the assembly
any assembly three be recognized as a

national parties are there in India
seven right now
the BJP the Congress the CPI the CP the
CPI M the Belgians our March party the
Nationalist Congress party NCP and the
All India Trinamool Congress seven
parties in all for now the CPI M faces
risks of losing its status it failed to
win the minimum seven seats in the Tamil
Nadu sembly election in 2016 the CPI has
already lost its status as a national
party it lost it in 2009 but the
Election Commission of India has relaxed
these norms now they consider the
performance over two elections which
basically means that the Left parties
retain their national status for now and
yes national parties
lose their place let me tell you
about some parties which have certain
theta party remember that one it was the
one it was one of the first parties to
challenge the Congress it was once a
national party no more genital party
which rested far from Indira Gandhi VP
Singh's Janata Dal which we please Rajiv
Gandhi they were all national parties we
all lost that status so who decides if a
party is national first any group of
citizens or Association can register as
a political party with the Election
Commission of India and a section 29 a
of the representation of people's Act
1951 depending on the criteria the poll
panel will list you as a national or a
state party but what happens if this
political party this new entrant does
not fulfill either criteria then it
functions as an unregistered party now
what are the perks of being a national
party one is the symbol that that's
available to state parties as well to
candidates of a national party need only
one person one person to propose their
nomination three they get two seats two
sets rather of electoral rules free of
cost for there are lot of dedicated
slots in public broadcasters like dual
darshan and the All India Radio during
general elections and national parties
are allowed they are in fact allowed to
nominate 40 star campaigners during
elections an unrecognized but registered
party can use only twenty star
campaigners
so next time in a party calls itself a
national player you know how to cross
check you also know that it's the status
that they must earn
election after election and here's a
correction that we won't put out two
days ago we decoded the Congress BJP
list our graphics showed that 68 sitting
MPs of the Congress got a ticket while
150 were new faces what we were trying
to say was that 68 candidates who were
allotted tickets in 2014 were given
tickets again this time that is
incumbent candidates who made that

With the deadline ...,2019-03-28T17:57:27Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j2arXG135HE/hqdefault.jpg,"it has all come down to this another
vote I'm sure you're wondering what I'm
talking about of course the brexit mess
so the House of Commons will debate a
motion on Greg's ax tomorrow but there
is no clarity on whether this would lead
to a formal third vote on Theresa Mayes
Greg's a deal but how is that even
possible just a week ago the speaker
ruled out another vote on Mays deal but
the European Union wants to clear the
mess that they have gotten into with
Britain they are ready to offer breaks
it extension till the 22nd of May if and
only if the British Parliament approves
the deal within this week and Theresa
May is putting her job at stake last
night she said that she would give up
her post if her break the deal is
approved it means brexit and we're going
to make a success of it brexit knees
brexit I'm very clear brexit does mean
brexit oh yes Briggs it does mean Greg's
it but will it be the brexit that
Theresa May wanted here's a quick check
to get it through the Parliament
tomorrow the Prime Minister needs the
support of 75 more lawmakers the
Conservative Party does not have a
majority in parliament their allies do
not agree which every sameas deal so
other conservatives ready to back
Theresa May we do not have an answer I
doubt Theresa May does the Conservative
Party is deeply divided last time around
157 MPs back the deal 93 voted against
it now 20 more conservative lawmakers
are ready to back the deal but she has
to persuade some more at least 60 more
so what next
breaks it now depends on the Labour
rebels most voters think the brexit
negotiation has been badly handled we
agree it's evident for the world to see
and there may now be a slight majority
so staying in the you know EU rather no
brexit many Conservative MPs say Theresa
May herself has caused this chaos by not
negotiating harder with the European
Union this is the Prime Minister his
last chance to persuade Euroskeptics
to back her deal irrespective of the
decision her job is on the line who are
the potential successors then Michael
Gove Boris Johnson David leading ttan
Jeremy Hunt Jacob Riis MOG and even
Sajid Javid and Andrea Lisa it's a long
list there in London Theresa Meers
offered to resign was trolled in the
British media some have labeled it drags
it now if there will be a brexit there
will be a thread zipped word play a part
there is some appreciation for the Prime
Minister - he's had a very tough job
anyway so I caught Mara from that but
actually I think if that's the way that
the deal gets done then that's probably
for the picture I wish she would quit
she's the worst Prime Minister I can
remember in my adult life she's long
overdue she should have gone she doesn't
listen to anybody she's not interested
in their cabinets opinions she's not
interested in any of the politicians
opinions all the people's opinions we
really need to stop the way to break the
impasse shambolic that is the state reg
citizen right now there's uncertainty
ahead of tomorrow's vote and this is a
country that will be struggling for
essential supplies in case of a No Deal
dregs it and that No Deal bread that
will hurt the European Union - it's
clear that the House of Commons has
underestimated the magnitude of the
decision to leave the European Union
people's livelihoods are at stake even
as parliamentarians get set for yet
another vote

getting the ribbed on Twitter this time
for his Sarab acronym for the Alliance
in utter Pradesh though he was drawing a
parallel between cherub or alcohol and
his opponents the humour was lost on way
too many people some founded below the
dignity of his office while the
pronunciation Nazis called him out on
using the sure sound instead of the
sound of the other way round that's in
there for you
[Music]

mr. Modi is in Jammu and Kashmir in
Jammu specifically and Jammu and Kashmir
is a state that has seen huge violence
over the last few years stone pelting
incidents rise in violence and militancy
and a muscular policy from the central
government they've all impacted the
politics of the state the question we
are asking today is this which party has
an edge in this election but before we
come to the Achatz underline how big a
deal it is for the Election Commission
to be holding this ball they face two
critical challenges one is to hold
peaceful elections especially in
terrorism affected areas like Pulwama
and two to ensure the safety of voters
in 79 booths that fall within Pakistan
shelling range it's going to be a tough
election the state has six looks of our
seats Jammu and Kashmir the last time
round in 2014 the BJP won in Jammu
Ladakh and Odom for three seats the
People's Democratic Party the PDP won
from Baramulla Srinagar Ananth na later
Farooq Abdullah of the National
Conference was elected from Srinagar in
2017 after the PDP candidate resigned
now the state is in turmoil it has been
under President's rule since December
last year many parties have demanded a
simultaneous assembly election in Jammu
and Kashmir both the major parties in
the state the PDP and the MC have
attacked the BJP in the recent months
the PDP remember was the BJP zalaya they
parted ways
recently will the regional players then
be able to push the BJP out who has the
edge in 2019 let's start with the BJP it
is at a disadvantage but the recent
Mallicoat airstrikes could help the
party in jamun in comparison the
Congress National Conference Alliance is
strong at least electorally
but there is a dichotomy this is what
their alliance looks like the National
Conference in the Congress party have an
alliance in the Jammu region but in the
Kashmir Valley they will fight each
other the medium is not impressed at all
it calls this alliance unholy
double-faced double-tongued
the numbers tell an interesting story
there in the Lok Sabha election of 2014
the BJP pulled more than 30 percent of
the votes
the BJP got more than the PDP I'm sorry
got more than 20-percent the Congress
polled 22% the National Conference
bagged 11% of the vote
now the PDP is not fighting as part of
the NBA it's a separate entity so it's a
three-way race on the one hand we have
the PDP second we have the Congress plus
NZ Alliance and third we have the BJP
and all three have nearly one third of
the total vote back to the map 2033 and
30 that complicates matters may have
oval fees image has taken a beating in
the state there is anger that she
couldn't control the violence or soften
the government policy despite being part
of the NDA alliance on the other side
Congress and national conference are
trying to consolidate their vote back
Faruk and Omar Abdullah have remained
consistent in their opposition to the
BJP so as I said it's a three-way race
it could be a heated battle in Jammu
with the BJP having a slight edge while
the Congress in NZ could clinch it in
the valley but more than the results the
return of elections the conduct of
democratic process in Jammu and Kashmir
is the bigger headline

in Gujarat the state election of 2012 he

the Parliament this is his report card
he has logged 65% attendance in the

of 78 percent he has been involved in
just three debates again below the
national average of 11 he has not raised

performance under Amit Shah they won 73
out of 80 seats the first time they did
it in independent India he set up the
well-oiled election machine that is
called the BJP now and now he's heading
back to his home state of Gujarat where
he was elected as an MLA from the

it's first day first show for Narendra

his re-election campaign he held three

mr. Modi is taking his campaign from the
world of social media to the ground here
I think he has an exaustive rally roster
in the coming month already the Prime
Minister's held more than 50 public
meetings he's expected to address a
hundred and twenty-five rallies in all
here is a strategy behind this plan the
BJP basically has divided the entire
country into different clusters each
cluster has three to four parliamentary
seats now the Prime Minister will
address one rally in each of these
clusters that really covers pretty much
the whole country now if you think this
is a lot 125 rallies then think again
look at Marines Modi's record his
campaign was much more aggressive in the
last election in 2014 he addressed and
listen to this mr. Modi alone addressed
437 rallies more than 5,000 events and
he traveled nearly three lakh kilometers

right before meeting Israeli Prime

Second Temple period and onwards have
been uncovered in the Golan Heights
during the 52 years that we've been here
the Golan has always been Jewish and has
always been Israeli today's present
Trump's declaration signature
complements this signature and indicates
that the Golan is Israeli and that
always stays ready Trump's decision
overturns more than five decades of US
policies in West Asia the Golan Heights
were part of Syria before the Israeli
army snatched them in the 1967 war and
unilaterally and next them in 1981
serious diplomatic and military efforts
to retake the area have failed the
occupied Golan lies between Jordan Syria
and Israel Syria's capital city Damascus
can be clearly seen from these Heights
and now that the Iranian military is
well in
in Syria occupying this plateau is for
Israel of more strategic importance than
ever and for the United States to
president Donald Trump is spearheading a
relentless international effort to
isolate Iran plus the Golan Heights

Israeli farmers to grow profitable crops

drones are undoubtedly the future of
flying they are already being used to
deliver goods shooting films and in
combat zones I caught up with one of the
known names in the area of drone
technology
Timothy Reuter and the World Economic
Forum thanks for talking to us Timothy
first of all services what do you think
about the Indian market because India
has committed the commercial use of
drones I think the the biggest story in
drones this year is the opening up of
the Indian market as you probably know
the Directorate General of Civil
Aviation passed the first regulation
starting in December of last year that
finally permits commercial drone use and
companies around the world and
domestically in India are trying to
figure out all the different ways they
can use drones to help people and make
money as well tell us something about
the future of doing technology so the
new applications that are emerging that
I'm most excited about are in drone
delivery we've seen in places like
Rwanda and Switzerland the use of drones
to bring medical supplies in some cases
to remote areas and across cities and
we're beginning to see also heavy lift
drone delivery emerging which has the
potential to transform logistics and
supply chains but what about the
incidents like the Gatwick Airport
incident where it would have to be shut
down what do you think about the future
of the technology in light of such
incidents absolutely so what happened to
Gatwick and then Heathrow and then
Newark points to the need for an
unmanned traffic management system and
actually India is working on this with
their digital skies platform where every
drone has to be registered in a central
database and then checked before it
takes off so that the central
authorities can see all the drones on
the air at the same time and track
people who are breaking the rules but
what could be the biggest impediment for
the spread of drone technology couldn't
be the high cost actually drones are the
least expensive form of aviation out
there and what really excited me about
this technology is that ordinary people
could start getting the same perspective
from the sky but used to only be
available to governments and large
corporations
and talking about the future of drones
or what is your assessment over there so
we just published a case study on what
Switzerland and Rwanda have done being
pioneers in national scale drone
delivery and urban drone delivery but
one of the most exciting issues in the
space is that there is no established
leader so any country that is willing to
be bold and innovate has the opportunity
to really capture the possibilities of
this market and deliver those benefits
and the industrial advantages as well so
if India decides to move in that
direction they can be a leader just you
know as much as China from flashmob
dances to on both performances Holi is a
festival that Indian carriers have been
celebrating in different ways before we
say goodbye we get you a mashup of how

since China is deploying troops and send
troops from the People's Liberation Army
they are in the thar region just 90
kilometers away from the Indian border
this information has come from the
Indian intelligence agencies and this is
what we know right now the pla troops
have been deployed to guard the coal
mines of thar the thar region is located
inside the third Piccard district of
Pakistan just 90 kilometers away from
the indo-pak border several Chinese
projects are on in sin they face stiff
opposition from the locals their sources
tell us that India's border security
forces have noticed the movement of
Chinese troops close to the border what
does this indicate nervousness on the
part of Beijing they're worried about
the safety of Chinese project in Sindh
and Balochistan local protests are
intensifying now whenever the Chinese
invest their money they hold all the
cards that's particularly true for
Pakistan when Beijing agreed to invest
in Pakistan it wanted the Pakistani army
to guard the projects but it seems that
China is losing faith in the Pakistani
security establishment and they've
decided to decide it to take matters in
their own hands
Pakistan is said to have deployed 17,000
1/7 17 thousand soldiers for the
security of CPEC and this includes their
Special Forces but Beijing is not
impressed an attack on a Chinese
consulate in Karachi last year made
matters worse it put a question mark on
the ability of the Pakistani military to
secure Chinese interests in November
2018 three armed gunmen tried to raid
the consulate the attack was carried out
by the Baloch Liberation Army it's a
rebel group the demanded independence of
Balochistan from Pakistan after the
attack Beijing wanted Islamabad to
guarantee the security of its citizens
in Pakistan the stakes remember very
high for China here the china-pakistan
economic corridor is spread across 3,000
kilometers as of 2017 the value of this
project stood at 62 billion dollars the
project has led to increase movement of
Chinese citizens in Pakistan close to
60,000 Chinese are believed to be living
in Pakistan the crowning jewel of this
in
vestment is the gladder port more than 1
billion dollars being pumped into the
sleepy town to turn it into a global
trading hub but this project faces the
biggest threat because brother is
located in the southwestern coast of
Balochistan arrested province the
atrocity is committed by the Pakistani
army here have not gone unnoticed forced
disappearances are a common affair in
Balochistan Pakistan military is accused
of illegally detaining 19 thousand men
women and children many of them have
been raped and killed bodies of many of
these detainees were later found from
mass graves that is the state of affairs
it's been more than five years since
China and Pakistan started the crucial
china-pakistan economic corridor or CPEC
it respect as a game changer an avenue
of economic development for the people
of Balochistan
but it seems China has only furthered
its own economic interests in this area
and that's something that the Baloch are
now protesting
the china-pakistan economic corridor
starts on the Pakistani Arabian Sea port
of Gwadar and goes into China's Xinjiang
region pallucci stan is crucial to the
success of the multi-billion dollar
china-pakistan economic corridor or CPEC
but many sections that the Belushi's
want none of it they're up in arms
against what they see as Beijing
attempts at exploiting their natural
resources without creating jobs or
assets for the Balu cheese
Bellucci activists who are opposed to
China's growing presence in the region
believe that in pursuit of its economic
interests Beijing is supporting
Pakistan's army and its efforts to crush
the Baloch movement for independence
[Music]
the Belushi's view Chinese investment in
Balochistan as usurpation and
exploitation of their resources they
believe that the Chinese projects are
aimed at colonizing Balochistan and they
must be resisted the launch of the CPEC
project has led to a number of attacks
against Beijing's assets significantly
impacting the economic projects in 2017
a Chinese couple was abducted from
Coweta and their bodies subsequently
discovered in the Balochistan town of
Matsu in August last year a suicide
bomber from the outlawed volusia stand
Liberation Army attacked a bus carrying
Chinese engineers in Balochistan the
attack was significant as it was the
first time Baloch separatists had used
suicide bombings to target the Chinese
in Baluchistan then in November 2018 the
Chinese consulate in Karachi came under
attack with three gunmen trying to enter
it and killing seven people in the
process
and again the Balochistan Liberation
Army took responsibility for the attack
the Pakistan Army increased the security
cover to the Chinese establishments
after the attacks but the beluche
separatists have been unrelenting and
planned to continue targeting the
Chinese presence in the area Bureau

further it is calling the European Union

max aircraft have suffered crashes in

crashes have prompted a worldwide ban on

Boeing doing two things one the company
will make a previously optional cockpit
warning light mandatory this warning
light will be added as part of a
software upgrade in the past Boeing
offered the a Oh a that is angle of
attack disagree alert this alert wants
pilots when a reading does not match but
this facility was optional in the past
why is this important because
Indonesia's line air did not install
this warning light to keep an emergency
service optional think about it besides
this Boeing has also not outlined the
automated system the MCAS in the flight
manual for specific model experts
believe that the new flight control
system may have been a factor in both
these crashes the US government took the
decision to ground the Boeing after 12
countries did so why so did the Federal
Aviation agency just accept Boeing
statement that the plane was safe
what's more intriguing here it is the
company was today awarded a four billion
dollar contract to produce 78 Navy Jets
now is the US government's way of easing
the financial pressure on Boeing that is

between the president and the company is

fifteen point one million dollars just
the last year alone and their head and
shoulders above any other defense
company when it comes to lobbying in
America so where does this donation from
lobbyists go straight into the kitty of
House and Senate appropriation committee
members these members decide how to
spend the defense budget and they're
likely to favor Boeing dishing out
contracts this lobbying of course has
worked for Boeing in 2018 alone there
are 60 bills that allegedly favor boy
and if you think lobbying is where
Boeing spends all its money to buy
influence you're mistaken
since Boeing is a government contractor
it cannot fund elected politicians but
then in the US super political action
committees or super PACs through the
super PACs route the company has donated
more than thirty two million dollars in
the last forty years now here's the
clincher Boeing doled out eight hundred
and twenty seven thousand dollars in
political contribution in the month of
February alone according to a newly
filed report with the US Federal
Election Commission
that's more than Boeing's political
action committee has ever reported
donating in a single month it's a record
Boeing is likely to have spent more on
political donations as it faces enormous
pressure in Washington over its
inability to come clean on software
upgrades which are largely unknown in
the aviation world and this is not the
first time that Boeing has bought
influence through political funding in
the 2018 midterm election Senate
leadership fund it is a super PAC that
favors Republicans it received the most
donation from Boeing and all this is
data from the Center for Responsive
Politics Boeing essentially has strong
influence in the White House it funds
the parties campaigns it lobbies hard to
get law saying the company it gets tax
cuts in return from the government it
funds the inauguration of American
presidents it manipulates markets and
when accidents happen due to oversight
and utter lack of care it can of course
clean up the mess with free upgrades
upgrades that could have prevented
accidents from happening Boeing's Boeing
so-called clean up act looks very murky
indeed
the United States President Donald Trump
took the world by surprise when he
announced on Twitter that he recognizes
the Golan Heights as Israeli territory
it's one of the most contested strips of
land in West Asia it once belonged to
Syria it's been on the back burner for
years now so why has Donald Trump
decided to take it up and change
America's long-standing position and how
did the world react our West Asia bureau
chief Daniella Pagani reports after more
than five decades of considering the
Golan Heights as a contested territory
US President Donald Trump took a major
shift and told the world it was time for
Washington to recognize it as Israeli
territory US Foreign Minister Mike
Pompeo on an official trip to Israel
praised his president's decision tonight
President Trump made the decision to
recognize that that hard-fought
real-estate that important place is
proper to be a sovereign part of the
State of Israel President Trump made a
bold decision to recognize that an
important decision for the people of
Israel will truly be historic and the
people Israel should know that the
battles they fought the life that they
lost on that very ground were worthy
shortly after the announcement Israel's
prime minister expressed his gratitude
President Trump has just made history I
called him I thanked him on behalf of
the people of Israel he did it again
first he recognized Jerusalem as
Israel's capital and moved the u.s.
embassy here then he pulled out of the
disastrous Iran treaty and we imposed
sanctions but now he did something of
equal historic importance he recognized
Israel's sovereignty over the Golan
Heights and he did so at a time when
Iran is trying to use Siri as a platform
to attack and destroy Israel and the
message that president Trump has given
the world is that America stands by
his room Trump's tweet comes barely
three weeks before Israel's election and
could boost Netanyahu's difficult race
for office he's facing charges for
corruption and bribery and is locked in
a neck-and-neck race against Israel's
former army chief
Benny Ganz since his first mandate in
2009 Netanyahu has maintained a tough
stand on the Golan the Israeli prime
minister personally pushed the u.s. to
recognize Israel's sovereignty during
his first meeting with President Trump
in 2017 the Fertile Golan plateau was
part of Syria but Israel militarily
occupied it during the 1967 war and
unilaterally annexed it in 1981 United
Nations peacekeeping forces oversee the
Golan Heights patrolling the
Demilitarized Zone where a peace
agreement forbids Israeli and Syrian
military forces presence Israel's
annexation is not internationally
recognized the UN Security Council
resolution 497 defines it quote null and
void without international legal effect
Syria has always claimed the Golan
Heights pact military and diplomatic
attempts to retake control over this
area have repeatedly failed an estimated
40,000 people between Israeli settlers
and members of the Druze religious
minority live in the Golan Heights the
Syrian government condemned Trump's
unilateral decision and pledged to
continue its effort to retake the Golan
Heights Turkey and the Arab League
echoed serious condemnation to Canaan

President Bashar al-assad said Trump's

Israel claims that it is now more
important than ever for the
to keep control over the colon in order
to control all Iranian activities inside
Syria Israel is conducting a parallel
war in Syria and has launched some 200
airstrikes against Iranian positions
based in the country Iran has militarily
supported the Syrian government
throughout the war and deemed u.s.
decision over the Golan Heights as
illegal when it comes to countering
Iranian presence in Syria there is
hardly a place more strategic than the
Golan Heights the plateau gives to the
Israeli army the chance to oversee what
is happening inside Syria and to keep an
eye on Iranian movements inside the
neighboring country and when it comes to
president Donald Trump well Washington
is spearheading an international attack
against the Iranian premises against the
Iranian expansion in West Asia and
Israel it's of course the most important
ally they have in this struggle in West
Asia vanilla pagani reporting from
Jordan per diem well this one after
retired couple of weeks where Theresa
May lost the support of the house more
than once the European Union has finally
agreed to a delay in the brexit deadline
Britain can breathe easy at least for
now so for how long is this deadline
deferred till the 22nd of May but
Theresa May is in a hurry she wants to
have a third meaningful vote as early as
next week
meaningful vote on what you may ask
after all the House of Commons have been
voting on one thing or the other for the
last few days
Theresa Mays Briggs the deed has already
been voted down twice and a speaker
ruled out another vote on Mays deal last
week but looks like that deal is again
back on the table
but even this did not come easy for the
United Kingdom the EU initially rejected
Theresa Meers proposal for a delay and
imposed their own it's a two-part
timetable so what's the agreed brexit
plan as of now the UK will be offered a
delay until the 22nd of May but for that
to happen lawmakers must approve the
withdrawal deal negotiated by the EU
next week what happens if the House of
Commons does a House of Commons that's
what for steel down even next week if
Theresa Meers deal fails next week the
EU will back a shorter delay that is
until the 12th of April so the deadline
shrinks allowing the UK time to get the
deal through or to indicate a way
forward the Prime Minister has welcomed
the decision of course
she will welcome this after all she gets
another chance to get her deal passed
think what this decision tonight does is
show the clear choice that is available
open to MPs getting the deal through
next week in a meaningful vote means
that we can have that extension to the
22nd of May get our legislation through
deliver on the referendum leave the
European Union and do it in an orderly
manner not getting that vote through
means that we will obviously as the
council has said come back to the
council before the 12th of April with a
plan for the way for the way forward but
that if it involves that further
extension would mean us candidates being
stored in the European parliamentary
elections I think the choice is clear
for people but the dissonance between
the UK and EU continues to persist
soon after Teresa Mae's optimistic
statement the European Council President
Donald Tusk said that all brave
adoptions were still open for Britain
until the 12th of April in the first
scenario that if the withdraw agreement
is passed by the House of Commons next
week the European Council agrees to an
extension until the 22nd of May in the
second scenario that is if there is
wrong agreement is not approved by the
House of Commons next week the European
Council agrees to an extension until the
20th of April 12 12th of April
while expecting the UK to indicate a way
forward what this means in practice is
that until death date all options will
remain open and the cliff edge dates
delay the EU nations have issued a
warning to the UK as well Germany's

x76QuQlqQNg,India Election Watch: It&#39;s Rahul Gandhi Vs Smriti Irani Again In Amethi,Smriti Irani had lost to Rahul Gandhi in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls but once again It's Rahul Gandhi Vs Smriti Irani In Amethi.,2019-03-22T17:37:18Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x76QuQlqQNg/hqdefault.jpg,"now a matey once again will be amongst
the most watched contests this year
smithy Ronnie from the BJP versus round
Gandhi from the Congress party will she
be the giant-killer
here's why this question is critical
look at a matey's history the
constituency was created in 1967 it has
almost always gone to the Congress two
exceptions one was Sanjay Gandhi he
famously lost the seat after the
emergency and two in 1998 when the BJP
beat the Congress in vote share the
first time any party beat the Congress
in both share the Congress lost a
meeting a meeting the family bastion
Sanjay Gandhi Rajiv Gandhi Sonia Gandhi
and Rahul Gandhi have all been elected
to Parliament from a meeting but the
resurgence of sweetie irani and the BJP
should not be surprising in the first
election here in 1967 the party of Jana
Sangh the party Jennison candidate came
a close second to the Congress party
that for 67 and for all Gandhi the
margin of victory in Amity has been
decreasing in 2004 he won by nearly
three lakh votes in 2009 three and a
half lakh votes in 2014 barely one lakh
the drop in margin was sharp the
opponent was no pushover sweet irani a
known face a forceful orator rode on the
back of anti-incumbency and the pro Modi
wave to challenge the Congress president
Rahul Gandhi won all right but the
headline was this Smriti irani pulled
more than three lakh votes against Rahul
Gandhi the political careers have
evident flowed since 2014
Smith irani became a high-profile
minister she remained in the news with
some controversies their appointments to
institutes her education of
qualifications her comments on sedition
charges there was a lot of news around
her but irani story is one of a fighter
she sprung back after every setback and
she still remains a known face a key
vote puller and someone who seems to be
in for the long haul in politics
contrast this with Rahul Gandhi
ridiculed for a long time as pappu
losing elections until things change for
the better for him he has repeatedly
targeted the prime minister but he has
also failed to resolve the tussle
between the old guard and the new
leaders in his party though the Congress
does not announce prime ministerial
candidates it is clear that the party is
betting its fate on Rahul Gandhi and
this makes Amity a very crucial contest
since losing in 2014 Ruthy ronnie has
cultivated a strong presence here she's
often visited a mate he pointed to the
lack of facilities despite Amity being a
high-profile seat
she's also brought several schemes and
projects to a meeting it's a fight all
right and Rahul Gandhi will do well to
treat it as one a change in Amity has
indicated a change in India 1997 1977
I'm sorry 1998 and who knows 2019 this
pretty Ronnie gets second time lucky or
will the Gandhi Science survived the
battle once for 23rd May

has announced that it is time to ban
Israeli sovereignty over the Golan
Heights making us the first country to
do so Golan Heights is a plateau along
the north of Israel's border with Syria
that Israel had seized in 1967 Trump's
announcement marks a dramatic shift in
the u.s. policy and might give a major
boost to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in the middle of his
re-election campaign which is mired in
corruption allegations the decision also
comes days before Nathan yahuwah's
visits to Washington Netanyahu welcomed
the move by saying that Donald Trump has
created history the president Trump has
just made history I called him I thanked
him on behalf of the people of Israel he
did it again first he recognized
Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moved
the US Embassy here then he pulled out

something of equal historic importance
he recognized Israel's sovereignty over
the Golan Heights and he did so at a
time when Iran is trying to use Siri as
a platform to attack and destroy Israel
and the message that President Trump has
given the world is that America stands
by Israel we're celebrating poram when
2,500 years ago other Persians led by
Haman try to destroy the Jewish people
they fell then and today 2,500 years
later again Persians led by Khomeini are
trying to destroy the Jewish people and
the Jewish state they're going to fail
again we are deeply grateful for the US
support we're deeply grateful for the
unbelievable and unmatchable support for
our security and our right to defend
ourselves and everything that you do on
behalf of Israel and for the State of
Israel in so many forms but the latest
position taken by the u.s. is
controversial because Israel's
annexation of Golan Heights is not
recognized by the international
community
Trump's move greatly compromises a
couple of standing international laws
such as the UN Security Council
resolution 242 or the land for peace
resolution which has been in place since
the end of the six-day war of 1967 the
resolution affirms that regional
countries cannot take land from others
the u.s. s latest move also undermines a
UN Security Council resolution 497 that
notes that acquisition of territory by
force is inadmissible but from decision
might boost Netanyahu's chances of
victory in a really tough election on
the 9th of April Netanyahu may probably
be indicted on corruption charges by
Israel's Attorney General but the latest
shift in the policy stance of the u.s.
is also being seen as Trump coming to
the rescue of his friend now Trump has
already been called out by Syria and
Turkey Damascus condemned the US move
Syria vowed to use all available means
to recover the Golan Heights Turkey's

do you know the winner of the 2014
election don't laugh yet it is a serious
question in fact there was a group which
was larger than the vote share of the
Congress and the BJP that's the section
of people who did not vote nearly 28
crore eligible voters did not cast their
vote in 2014 to put it in context
the BJP polled a little over 17 kroll
woods the Congress got nearly 11 crores
and 28 crores did not cast a vote
these were eligible voters and this
number of the voting population sitting
out an election 28 crores is bigger than
any other democracy in the world
the combined registered votes in Germany
Spain United Kingdom and South Korea
together add up to 28 cruel words that's
the scale of India's non voting
population India is a country on the
move look at the economic survey of
2016-17 census 2001 census 2011 between
8 to 29 percent of the Indian workforce
is a migrant workforce now what happens
to their votes if one third of the
population does not vote can we just
ignore the problem let's take two census
2011 data more than 45 crore Indians are
migrants of these 4 crore people have
moved for jobs 22 crore have moved for
marriage
40 million for business no clarity on
the others in all they make up nearly 18
crore eligible voters among these 45
crore migrant Indians - poor people have
been at their place of residence for
less than a year 7 crore for less than 4
years so the question is this why can't
we take a fundamental right to vote with
us wherever we go in India
wouldn't that address the fallen voter
turnout now the government has given a
right to vote by proxy for the NR eyes
but the BJP and the Congress have tried
to woo both both of them have tried to
do to move the 1.34 in our eyes but they
haven't insured right to vote for the 45
crore migrant Indians and this is not
even a utopian thought higher water
turnout will reduce electoral
malpractices now what happens if you are
registered in your home state but have
moved for a job first of all you cannot
enroll as a voter at more than one place
you have to transfer your vote by only
applying for fresh enrolment and there
you have to make a statement or
declaration stating that your name is
not included in the electoral roll of
any other constituency remember a false
statement can get your jail term so how
do you register as a voter by filing the
application form it's called form number
six the application should be directed
to the electoral registration office of
your new address you can also apply
online and once your application is
completed your name will appear on the
electoral rolls you will get your voter
ID card it's a long process it takes
roughly five to seven weeks that 35 to
49 days water registration laws are in
place only to avoid double voting now
there's a reason why whoa ting is called
a right not a duty when parties
political parties ask you to vote you
can turn around and ask them this how
have you political parties help me cast
my vote India will have 1.5 crowd
first-time voters in this election many
living away from home and their polling
booths failure to ease them into the
voting process is only going to hurt the
democracy if in this day and age we
cannot use technology to provide the
basic right to vote

Beijing's decision to block a bid in the

Masood Azhar as a global terrorist he
said and I quote we believe that China
and the US share a mutual interest in
achieving regional stability in peace
and that any failure on the Security
Council as part to designate Masood
Azhar as a terrorist would run a counter
to this mutual goal that China and the
United States have unquote now after the

no your candidate today we profiled
Supriya Sule a daughter of Sheriff Bob
our president of the Nationalist
Congress party the NCP NCP is a
prominent part in Maharashtra it is an
alliance with the Congress that's about
the party now about the candidate so
Priya Soleil is 49 years old she's had
it easy in politics given her father
stature
zulay was first elected to the Rajasuya
in 2006 from maharashtra she was elected
to the 16th Lok Sabha from Baramati also
in Maharashtra this constituency is a
bit of a family bastion Sharad Pawar was
repeatedly elected from Baramati so how
has Supriya solely performed her
attendance is a whopping 96% you heard
that right 96% it's much better than
both the national average and the state
average Supriya Sule a is very vocal in
Parliament participating in more than
150 debates that's more than twice the
national average but the metric she
stands in her own league is in the
questions raised over the last five
years Supriya Sule a listen to this
carefully so pre actually has raised
nearly 1200 questions in Parliament the
national average is a paltry 293 1200
even by Maharashtra standard she's an
outlier in a good way
Supriya Sule a has brought in nearly 22
private member bills ten times that of
the national average again crucial bills
gender sensitisation with the right to
disconnect with family is a farmer bill
breast cancer with universal health
coverage bill the mental health bill the
children protection bill the free and
compulsory secondary and senior
secondary education bill
all of them initiated by Supriya slowly
and she has shown no sign of tiredness
she has been one of the more
consistently active members of the 16th
Lok Sabha
so what are her chances this time
victory is almost guaranteed as much
because of her activism as a father's
hold over the Baramati constituency but
Supriya Sule his career is not without
blemishes reports say that sheriff
Govardhan Supriya Sule a old part of the
firm that had bid for Pune a franchisee
of the Indian Premier League now this
was a time when reports of IPL
irregularities at surfaced and a father
sheriff Koval was the ICC president
reports said that a firm partially owned
by Supriya Sule a husband had exclusive
broadcasting rights of IPL matches what
does this mean this means cronyism and
conflict of interest Supriya Sule II of
course has denied these allegations but
questions have a nasty habit

The World is One News, WION ...",2019-03-20T17:48:42Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MfNhCsFjdsQ/hqdefault.jpg,"but talking about Chinese goods in the
indian market as things stand today the
Indian market is heavily dependent on
Chinese products in their imports nearly
seventy billion rupees worth of Chinese
goods and services every year seventy
billion if India chooses to stop these
imports it will impact several sectors
sample some of these numbers Chinese
companies control nearly 51% of India
smartphone market as far as electronics
is concerned that number stands at more
than 60% that's the kind of penetration
Chinese companies have in India in the
renewable energy sector India meets more
than 90% of its solar equipment demand
from China in 2018-19 China supplied
more than 80 percent of the antibiotics
that India imported so what happens if
India decides to boycott all of these
Chinese products prices of these
products in all these categories will
shoot up the demand will be high and
Indian manufacturers may not have the
wherewithal not just yet to meet the
needs of the market and that means there
will be a huge shortage of key consumer
goods so can in there really boycott
Chinese products that is the question
yesterday the configuration of all India
traders moved to set Chinese goods on
fire and this association is not the
only one doing this it represents nearly
7 crore Indian traders their grouse a
simple China blocked India's attempts to
designate Masood Azhar as a global
terrorist at the UN the anger they say
is justified but is this response
logical can India and China both
practice protectionism in a globalized
world let's look at the figures again in
2018 Indian for today Li 77 billion
dollars worth of products while it
exports about 19 billion dollars to
China China is one of our biggest trade
partners and Indochina tries to remain
strong after the Wuhan summit yes China
stands on masood azhar has been
disappointing but China is crucial to
India and vice versa last year China
even opened its Agra market to India
this allows an export market for India's
farmers besides this India has been
running a trade deficit with China for
for a very long time since the early 90s
and who's to blame
let me tell you a story between 1991 and
1993 India ran a trade surplus with
China after which our exports fell with
China's imports to India rose
drastically the problem was simple the
falling export competitiveness of India
and who's to blame our policymakers the
Chinese imports to India cover a range
of products from mobile phones to
watches to electronic goods to toys to
clothing to form to drones everything
and why are Chinese products it is
irresistible price competitiveness that
is a simple answer in other words they
come cheap and I've not even spoken
about manufactured goods even steel from
China is cheaper than steel from India
the sad fact is true for many grades of
steel so here's the thing protectionism
is not the way to go about this so
should China be let scot-free not at all
it's also wrong it will be wrong to be
so dependent on another economy but
before we increase our export
competitiveness and produce products
with better price competitiveness all
this burning of products will be little
more than she then symbolism

India will not accept any project that
does not respect its sovereignty and

China's much-touted belt and rude

forum India's ambassador vikram mystery

it's a snub to the Chinese president the

prestige for Xi Jingping Pakistan's
Imran Khan Italian Prime Minister Recep
Conte and Singapore Prime Minister
Leasing loom are among the leaders

stance of the belt and road project is
nothing new in fact India was probably
the only major country to have not sent
a representative for the first VRI event
that was in 2017 just before dokyeom
happened delhi boycotted that event the
Bri forum Chinese Foreign Minister Wang
Yi said and I quote no matter how things
change in the world in the region China
that firmly support Pakistan and
upholding its independence and
territorial integrity and dignity weeks
ago China's foreign ministry also said
this vow from him to Italia what the
father
kaity Monaco general to God now the
Indian ambassador mr. mystery questioned
the record of the belt and road project
on three specific points cooperation
transparency and financial
sustainability and here's why mr. e
stance hits the nail on its head the
flagship project of the belt and Road
initiative is perhaps the seed back the
china-pakistan economic corridor it
passes to Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for
India Kashmir is an integral part of its
territory put simply the cippec project
of VRI violates India's serenity hardly
the win-win cooperation that China's
foreign minister has been parroting
about in an interview to China's Global
Times ambassador mr. e said that India
would not be happy with China's words
and that action must follow he said and
I quote connectivity initiatives must be
based on universally recognized
international norms good governance and
the rule of law this is consistent with
India stand on this controversial
project more importantly it puts the
onus on China to not violate the
sovereignty of other countries it serves
as a reminder to Beijing and China needs
such a reminder now more than ever
because the country assured unwavering
support to Pakistan sovereignty
territorial integrity and socio-economic
development but China does with Pakistan
is not India's business but when it
comes to talking about territorial
integrity of Pakistan it will only be
right for China to remember its own
track record besides this China has also
blocked India's bid to designate muscle
desert as a global terrorist at the
United Nations now Masood Azhar has
masterminded many terror attacks on
Indian soil you don't need me to tell
you this isn't that a violation of
India's serenity - that's not all an
article in the chinese state media the
Global Times says that India will be
hurt if it tries to reduce Chinese
products that may be the case but if a
market is as huge as India and it
resists China
if boycotts China's cheap low-grade low
price steel and many other gadgets China
too will suffer is this Beijing's way of
warning India about the consequences of
protectionism we believe that India and
China have to meet halfway to resolve
their differences but before that China
must stop protecting terrorists who hurt
India and be more transparent on Bri
if Beijing fails to do so India will
have no choice but to boycott the belt

few cases are as political as this one
Robert Vadra the son-in-law of the

political implications are immense
interestingly the old case is back in

Enforcement Directorate of India has
sought custodial interrogation of Robert
Vadra meaning detention right now mr.
Vadra is on anticipate tree bail a belly
court has extended it till the 25th of
March the court has asked mr. Vadra to
participate in the investigation the IDI
says he is not cooperating so they must
take him into custody
special judge alvin kamara is granted
relief to mr. Vadra brother-in-law of
congress president Rahul Gandhi it's a
case of money laundering as I said while
buying a property in London
investigators say that they have fresh
information there are various new
properties in London which allegedly
belonged to mr. Batra this includes two
houses of five and four million pounds
each six are the flats and then some
more properties the case is on you'll
hear a lot more about it in the days
ahead watch this space meanwhile Rahul
Gandhi made a big announcement today
with just 22 days to go for the election
for the first phase the Congress
president has sharpened his attack and
today's target with the BJP is economic
policies Rahul Gandhi was in Otago the
capital of Arunachal Pradesh and he said
that he will scrap the GST the gabor
sink tax as he calls it if his party
came to power telegin of that
not many iodized our only special
memories are carbon eggy syntactic amaku
GST GST GST sovereign GST comes to come
back it's wrong Gandhi's favorite
punching bag the GST remember what he
did in 2017 during the Gujarat assembly
election Rahul Gandhi tried to whip up
the gstl as a major election issue so
has he said that he'll do away with GST
yes and no his promise to scrap what he
calls the Gabbar Singh tax is talking
about simplifying the GST the goods and
services tax he's promising a single tax
rate one rate at the moment the GST
operates on five tax lamps is it even
possible to bring it down to one the BJP
has dismissed the idea the Finance
Minister of India Arun Jaitley has been
particularly critical of Rahul Gandhi
back in December he'd called it a stupid
idea in a tweet he said and I'm quoting
a single slab GST argued by the Congress
president is indeed a stupid idea
luxury and sin items cannot be taxed at
the same rate as the common man's item
interestingly the Congress claims
ownership for the goods and services tax
it was their idea but they could never
implement it critics say the UPA lacked
the political will to get the bill
passed when they were in government the
GST came into effect on the first of
July 2017 and achievement that the BJP
will not shy away from showing off in
this election season but what's
happening with the grand alliance in one
word nothing the Congress has not been
able to break the deadlock as things
stand today the Congress party will
contest 350 for looks of our seats
spread across 23 states alone blame the
last assembly elections after victory in
mother Pradesh Rajasthan and
Chhattisgarh the Congress is not willing
to give up seats it wants an equal seat
sharing formula and that is something
that's not acceptable to the regional
place the Congress has failed to secure
any alliance in two of the biggest
states of India
the SP BSP combined have ruled out an
alliance in Uttar Pradesh and West
Bengal mouth of energy wants to fight
the elections alone so in both these
cases the Congress is now at the number
3 spot that's not all the Congress has
failed to make any headway in
Maharashtra and Bihar either in my
rashtra the Congress and the NCP have
announced that they will contest the
polls together but there is no agreement
yet on seat sharing the story remains
the same in Bihar the announcement of
the Congress RJD alliance has been
delayed the Congress is demanding more
seats in Bihar but Laloo Prasad the
other party is not willing to give up
more than 8 seats on the other side the
BJP seems to be doing a much better job
of securing alliances especially in key
battleground states and be hard for
instance the BJP has secured an alliance
with the jdu in Tamil Nadu the ruling AI
DMK and in Maharashtra with the Shiv
Sena the BJP can now count on the
support of 18 parties in this election
so far
Manifest rolls once used to be a major
thing to look forward to they were a
blueprint of a party's policies not
anymore
now manifestos read like a fantastical
list where parties promised the sky
it happened in thermal art today the two
heavyweights in that state the DMK and
the AI DMK released their manifestos
let's start with the AI the MK what do
they promise a national level poverty
eradication scheme 1500 rupees for every
family below poverty line no word on the
fiscal cost of such a scheme where is
the money coming from other promise is
included water management schemes
diverting water to drought it areas the
interlinking of rivers sounds good on
paper non-starter on the ground
what does interlinking of rivers do it
hurts forests it creates land disputes
it's not a new promise and do not be
surprised if it's made again in the next
election there are other dangerous
promises like making education a state
subject exempting Tamilnadu students
from neat any et the national
eligibility come entrance test its
address for medical students
but this case has been decided by the
apex court
how can a party make this promise now
isn't this contempt of court Sam see
next is an emotional pitch investigation
into the alleged war crimes against
Tamils in Sri Lanka and releasing the
seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi
assassination case again it's something
that the courts have rejected let's talk
about the DMK now their manifesto was
also released today lots of common
points despite their rivalry for the
last 52 years the manifestos read like
photocopies of each other listen to this
the DMK also wants to exempt Tamil
students from a national entrance test
in fact they want to abolish NEET all
over the country the DMK also wants to
make education a state subject they also
want to release the killers of Rajiv
Gandhi and they also want to interlink
rivers so what are they fighting about
if they're both offering the same things
the same spiel essentially the DMK also
wants to make the maillard an official
Tamil Rada an official language in
central government offices they want a
high committee to revive the economy for
the record India already has a monetary
policy committee of the RBI the Planning
Commission in the past and now Neath the
IO the Finance Ministry besides industry
bodies like Viki so what will a new
committee do they want a wave of student
loans the DMK
it's a clear pitch for first-time voters
but at every party promises and then
waves loans who is going to look after
India's banks we asked the dmt has
spoken about reviving the sato samaram
project
but no details it has commercial
benefits ecological pitfalls and it
appeals to the majority vote besides the
DMK wants reservation in the private
sector attempt to woo voters again the
thing that stands out in a politically
charged atmosphere is this the promise
to release the seven convicts in the
Rajiv Gandhi assassination case it is a
cheap attempt by both the parties to
play to rise in Tamil nationalism first
there are legal issues around it to
successive governments have passed
ordinances in state assemblies on this
the Supreme Court in 2015 said it cannot
release these convicts without the
centre's consent and the centre has
refused saying it's a matter of the
assassination of a former prime minister
the convicts have been in jail for 27
years now so here's what we think about
these two manifestos they speak about
social justice about the upliftment of
Tamils but they lack vision there is no
clarity on how these promises will be
delivered almost no plans to tackle real
problems like lack of jobs or
agricultural distress
let's shift our focus ruther Pradesh
where the Congress general secretary
Priyanka Gandhi Bhadra is campaigning on
Modi stuff it's the second day of a boat
ride from prayer garage to Varanasi the
Congress has high hopes from this Ganga
yatra it hopes for an inflow of votes
Priyanka Gandhi is not disappointing
them the mean pea kisara decay kick-ass
city new report card retiree but if

cuckoos lamella Tanika Alan Wake is a

parcel Circle Mary Pat Sonoma happening
akia
so what is the plan behind this campaign
it's a two-pronged strategy the focus is
on two major goat banks the upper castes
and the Dalits both groups voted for the
BJP in the last election but this was
also the Congress's original world bank
remember before the rise of caste based
parties like the SP and the BSP the
Congress had a firm hold on these votes
upper castes and Dalits made the
Congress's core vote bank in the times
of narrow and Indira Gandhi but all that
changed in 1989 this was mainly due to
the rise of VP Singh the issue of
reservation rose to the mainstream in
1990 and Congress lost its vote back the
upper caste votes account for 16% of
UPI's voting population the campaign pit
stops are designed to attract these
votes especially the Brahmins that's 8%
of votes in Uttar Pradesh to attract
these Priyanka Gandhi's on a Temple Run
on day two we saw a second visit she
also went to a Durga today and there's
something else that we must note here
the campaign companion a companion on
the sea atre Dalit leader
savithri by fully no coincidence they're
the highest number of votes from Uttar
Pradesh 34 percent to be exact
belonged to the backward castes hence
the Dalit leader Priyanka Gandhi speech
is clear the attempt is a bold one it
not only challenges the SP BSP combined
it also sends a message to the BJP
remember the Prime Minister of India was
elected to the Lok Sabha from Varanasi
and that's where Priyanka Gandhi Vadra
has begun her work

national average is 559 she introduced
three private member's bills 2 which are
constitutional amendments she has raised
issues ranging from bonded labour
farmers women and children to textile
railways and commerce calimary seen as a
father's literary heir she's the chief
of the DMK swing of art literature and
rationalism but what about claiming his
political legacy she rose to prominence
on the wrong note the 2d scam she was
acquitted in December 2017 but the
shadow of the scam still haunts her so
what are her chances now can calimary
win Tuticorin the district has a sizable
presence of another community tani Morys
mother belonged to this community the
voters see her as one of their own
so she has an edge over the DMK there
but the BJP too has fielded another BJP
state president tamil sighs on the Rajan

contesting from the same constituency
what where's the pitch father is the
political vacuum in Tamil are both the

experts say that the 2019 general
election will be the most expensive in
India do you know who will fund it where
is all this money coming from what are
the rules let's take these questions one
by one can you believe that corporations
even some owned by foreign entities can
fund political parties anonymously yes
anonymously that's the level of
transparency in political funding in
India business can bankroll political
parties through instruments called
electoral bonds in fact the NDA brought
in new rules recently rules which make
it easier for anonymous donors to
support parties where you get these
electoral bonds anyone can buy an
electoral bond at the State Bank of
India the bonds come for anywhere
between 1000 rupees to one crore rupees
and more importantly these board these
bonds to not bear the name of the donor
plus they're exempted from tax so why
was this rule introduced when it was
done finance minister Arun Jaitley said
that this will improve transparency
household because political parties will
have to disclose what they received the
success of that is debatable in the last
year alone electoral bonds worth 10
point 6 billion rupees have been bought
now that we've established how anyone
can fund the parties let's look at who
gets how much according to a report of
the Association of democratic reforms in
the last financial year FY 2018 the
ruling BJP received 80 percent of the
total income of the National Party's
in the same period electoral bonds worth
222 crore rupees had been purchased
again more than 94% of these bonds went
to the BJP alone that's a little over
210 crore rupees and if you think this
is huge
think again these figures are only for
the first phase of the issuance of bonds
there are only up to March 2018 the
final figures will only reflect in the
next audit the FY 19 ordered report of
political parties now the BJP has also
raised 167 crore rupees from electoral
trusts last year
144 crores from just one lender that is
prudent electoral trust between 2004 and
2014 election spending rose drastically
in India from just fourteen hundred and
eighty three crore rupees in 2009 it
jumped to nearly four thousand crore
rupees in 2014 and the figure is only
going to go up from here
some estimates pegging it to six
thousand four rupees clearly the BJP
tops the list in political parties with
donations but is this wrong what does
the rulebook say what does the Election
Commission of India say first the
Commission wants a cap on political
funding it says unchecked unaccounted
money is a major threat to democracy and
that's not all the Election Commission
has also tried to cut candidate
expenditure limits that's the cash that
can be spent by a candidate this year
the limit of expenditure for each
candidate has been set at 70 lakh rupees
but what about political parties is
there a limit to what parties can spend
not yet how is it done now the countries
you may ask India's rules are lose on
this front for instance in the UK
companies can make donations to
political parties in the oldest
democracy the u.s. unlimited funding
takes place through political action
committees they're called super PACs but
even there the name of the donor is
disclosed so why do Indian parties allow
this why hasn't any party in India
objected because it suits them all when
the rules were amended in 2017 the
opposition did not protest not a word
they kick up a storm about other issues
no such reaction on political funding
who doesn't need money and opaque
instrument like electoral bond does not
exist anywhere else in the world it
facilitates the flow of money through
invisible channels parties can easily be
the source of unaccounted money they can
also serve the interests of their donors
but if the donors are not known there is
frankly nothing that can be done in a
recent interaction Rahul Gandhi the
Congress president said that he would
only bring political parties under the
RTI
when other arms of the state are brought
him other arms as in the judiciary the
executive and a media a classic case of
what about arre there now Rahul Gandhi
or anyone can highlight the lack of
transparency in political funding but
none of them none of them does it it is
just a political pitch to blame others
the cloud of opaqueness helps them all
the political parties besides money
helps win elections
we're wrapping up with that do share

when it rains it pours and Boeing is
under such an unrelenting Shah right now
as trouble is flying at it from all
sides the company's stock dropped
sharply after the crash in it in
Ethiopia and it has fallen by 11 percent
in the past two days they recovered a
bit in yesterday's trade but the
sentiment is far from bullish there are
demands for compensation as Norway's

compensation from boy after its planes
were grounded now region air has had to

running into losses if the disruption
continues for a long period of time it
will have to deploy new plane to ferry
passengers according to one estimate the
airline could pay up to 1.5 billion
dollars for the crisis and is expected
that boy will foot that bill and that
other low-cost carriers could raise
similar demands Boeing is also facing a
string of lawsuits filed by families of
the line air crash victims many of them
have been filed in Chicago where the
company is based in the long term this
crisis could severely impact the
business of Boeing as the company had
planned to dedicate nearly 64 percent of

pilots lose faith in the company it
won't be able to sell new planes not
this plane at least that's not all the

the aircraft makes up 33% of Boyd's

they could lose all this money if

correspondent joins us now in the FIR
line good evening to Zealand what are
the latest reports coming in these are
initial media reports there hasn't been
any word from the the Indian Air Force
on a deep evil plan but of course the
situation remains 58 years in the
aftermath of the india-pakistan tensions
and of course the dogfight degree so in
the end of every month we also know the
Pakistani airspace has been closed for
days now it will be closed till 14th
14th of March now and of course focus
right now is to show that depends we
also know the talks will be taking place
between India and Pakistan officials
diplomats no official started to arrive
in the Indian city of Amritsar will they
will be going to Atari Wagah border when
the talks will take place apart but by
and large what has happened in the like
enlarged to assertiveness is its
development which still has to be
confirmed by the Indian Air Force thank
you so much for that report surrounded
and he will of course be keeping us
up-to-date with the latest in a few
hours from now the United Nations
Security Council will decide on the fate
of Jewish imahara chief Masood Azhar
China is the only permanent member which
has so far blocked the listing of Masood
Azhar it has done so three times already
and it looks like Beijing is going to
block the move yet again just ahead of
the vote China hinted that it may once
again block the bid to designate Masood
Azhar as a global terrorist
China's foreign ministry spokesperson
state and I quote the
a solution that is acceptable to all
sides is conducive to resolve the issue
unquote
while India has pushed for sanctioning
Masood Azhar Pakistan has continued to
get Beijing's support unblocking the bid
China has been insisting that the
solution should be acceptable to all
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said
and I quote I want to say that China
always adopts a responsible attitude
engages in consultations with various
parties and properly deals with the
issue the discussions must follow the
rules and procedures of the relevant
parties and only the solution that is
acceptable to all sides is conducive for
resolving the issue and approach we
spoke to a tool and Ajay a senior Indian
journalist in Beijing and asked him why
China is blocking India's bid to ban
Masood Azhar and what Beijing stands to
gain from blocking it let's listen in
the Chinese here are playing a long game
and after India which was obviously
object and protest in case as we assume
that China will not allow Masood Azhar
to be designated as an international
terrorist it would probably try another
round of engagement where it would try
and build consensus through a very
active diplomatic initiative between
India and Pakistan in the long run China
wants both India and Pakistan to be on
board its Eurasia centric project and we
know a India from getting too close to
the United States Japan Australia at the
court and the International and the
Western alliance system so I suppose
you're not seeing an end to it whether
it's going to succeed or not there is a
million dollar question as of now India
goes into election mode so I doubt
anything much is going to happen from
the Indian side but I think around
summer after the election results are
over we might see another round of
diplomacy where China makes an attempt
to reconcile differences
Indian pact between Pakistan and India
not sure whether it's going to work but
the Chinese have actually taken a very
high-profile stance now to interject in
the india-pakistan equation something
which has which they have never done
before in terms of visibility as they're
doing now all eyes are on the United
Nations Security Council but in Pakistan
stand on Masood Azhar's listing that
continues to remain unclear Pakistani
Foreign Minister shah mahmud Qureshi has
said in an interview that Pakistan will
not put its friends in trouble but
Pakistan's foreign ministry spokesperson
had told we are wolves one that
Islamabad decision on Azaz listing would
be in the country's interest meanwhile
China's junior foreign minister was in
Islamabad recently and sources told we
on that issue of Masood Azhar's listing
was a part of the discussion a Chinese
foreign ministry spokesperson said that
only a solution acceptable to all sides
is conducive to the issue Beijing said
that Masood Azhar's listing must follow
all rules and procedures of the United
Nations
remember China has already blocked the
listing three times
India has slammed Pakistan at the
fortieth session of the UN Human Rights
Council for its sustained support to
terrorism and packing up the Jammu and
Kashmir issue it comes just ahead of the
decision on the listing joshi mohammed
chief Masood Azhar under the UN terror
list by the UN ac-12 67 Committee in
Indian diplomat representative said that
Islamabad continued supporting terror
attacks against India the latest being
the Parma terror attack many Devi c'mon
reminded Pakistan of its infamous
distinction of hosting 132 UN designated
terrorists and 22 terrorist entities
Pakistan's continued support to
cross-border terrorism is the main
challenge to protecting the human rights
of our citizens in the Indian state of
Jammu and Kashmir the confirmation of
using UN prescribed terror organizations
Jesse Mohammed is an instrument of state
policy by Pakistani military and

meanwhile the sentiment was also echoed

England
sighs jet has earlier defended the
Boeing 737 max calling the model highly
sophisticated but why exactly is Donald
Trump's Federal Aviation Administration
not grounding bow insane 3:7 max the
reason appears to be more political than
operational ties between Boeing and US
president Donald Trump run deep
first Trump is an aviation enthusiast
and was once an owner of an airline
Trump's shuttle was in close contact
with Boeing during its three-year long
lifespan and before entering the White
House Trump had his personal Boeing 757
second Trump's connection with Boeing
CEO Muhlenberg isn't new
remember Trump had personally negotiated
with Muhlenberg to try and lower the
cost of a future version of the u.s.
presidential aircraft in July last year
Boeing won a 3.9 billion dollar contract
to replace the two Air Force one James
3rd Trump used Boeing products and sites
as a backdrop of major presidential
announcements in July last year Trump
spoke about the impact of his tax
overhaul Bowl during his visit to a
Boeing plant in st. Louie it isn't just
the US president top White House
officials to have close nexus with
Boeing u.s. acting defense secretary
Patrick Shanahan worked for Boeing for
31 years before entering the Pentagon
former US ambassador to the United
Nations nikki Haley has been nominated
by Boeing to join its board of directors
the heart from these there are some more
facts that helped solve the puzzle of
Trump's Boeing bias Boeing is United
States second largest defense contractor
the company received hundred and four
billion dollars in unclassified defense
contracts between 2014 and 2018 it is no
surprise that Trump administration has
repeatedly urged its allies to buy
Boeing products according to reports it
was Trump who had pressed the em'ly of
Kuwait to go ahead with a long delayed
deal with Boeing for it if a 18 Super
Hornet fighter jets this is by no way
the first time that Trump is betting for
Boeing CEO Muhlenberg had earlier said
that purchases of us-made aircraft could
be a part of the china-us trade deal
Mike ek a former RAF pilot and
investigative journalist joins us live
from Paris good evening to you what is
your assessment of how safe or how risky
the boeing 737 max 8 is when we're
talking about the term unsafe in
aviation terms I think the professionals
would use the term risk and risk is
probability versus consequence and I
think that's how the progress or the
forward decision-making going on beyond
the Ethiopian Airlines crash the 737 max
aircraft should be assessed it should
should be through a process of delicate
risk assessment and what do I mean by
that I mean that as it stands right now
there is limited evidence as to what
actually happened to the Ethiopian
Airlines crash coming out of an attack
of a Omri tonight Nairobi the two black
box is the flight data recorder and the
cockpit voice recorder have been
recovered and the latest reporting on
the data assimilation of those two boxes
is that the Ethiopians don't have the
technology or the best technology to
actually gain that data and they're
going to send it out of the country for
that data to be analyzed probably I
would suggest to the United States the
NTSB you have all the technology to be
able to gain the data from these two
black boxes as quickly as possible so I
think what we're talking about is the
aircraft safe to fly based on what
countries are deciding to ground this of
the UK's decided to ground it Australia
has China has or in many many countries
that have taken the precautionary
measure two down two to ground the 737
max a but the United States has decided
not to do that the FAA
has decided that there isn't going at
the moment to ground those aircraft
alright so then what then do you think
is holding the FAA back why the FAA
might be making this decision I think is
the most interesting question if I was
part of the investigation team or I was
the CEO of a major airline that was
understanding trying to understand the
risk as to whether to ground the
aircraft or not and obviously that that
that is determined by the FAA or the CIA
or whatever operating Authority our
operating Authority it is I would be
looking at the previous information and
evidence that came from the lion air
crash in October 2018 and the
conclusions of that and those
conclusions if I can just sort of
briefly go through what the the
conclusions were was it was effectively
a problem with the angle of attack
sensors on the new aircraft what is
angle of attack well this is called
the leading edge of a wing and this is
called the trailing edge of the wing and
the line between these two and the line
between the forward airflow this angle
here is called the and a little bit sac
and that's really important in aviation
because as the angle of attack increases
the potential for the airspeed to
decrease if the throttle isn't pushed
forward the power is quite high and as
the ASB decreases in the angle of attack
increases it brings the aircraft nearer
to what's called a stall and a stall is
a catastrophic loss from lift so what
these sensors on the 737 max 8 do is
they detect when this angle of attack in
the airspeed is getting low and they
push that information into what's called
an MCAT which is a fancy name
maneuvering characteristics augmentation
system for a digital box that sends
messages to the flight control system to
push the nose forward that's an
automatic
occurrence within the software and the
equipment on this new type of 737 so
what happened in the line aircraft was
that you were getting erroneous messages
from these angle-of-attack sensors when
the actual angle of attack wasn't that
high which was forcing the aircraft to
take nose down or trim down attitude and
that's obviously at low altitude and at
fairly high speeds you know that is a an
extremely dangerous situation for the
crew to be in the reason why this is all
important money is because when that
information came out the FAA decided
that it was going to issue an emergency
air worthiness directive and that came
out in December 2018
and that basically advised Boeing to
incorporate procedures and information
about this erroneous occurrence into the
operating manuals of all of the airlines
that were operating the 737 max eight
and nine why would Boeing not lay enough
emphasis on system specific training so
what what where we're at basically is
we're trying to understand how much of
the air worthiness directive that the
ordered Boeing to incorporate procedures
and protocols and information about
these erroneous instances that are
happening between the angle of attack
sensors and the MCAS how much of that
information was a included in the
operating manuals and B was acted upon
by the airlines and the operating
authorities in terms of the training
that the crews got about the actual
software the training and understanding
that the crews got and the conclusions
of the lion air crash and I'd say most
importantly the opportunity for crews to
act upon that information in a emergency
environment in the simulator to practice
that emergency
and so that is going to be different I
would suggest from Southwest Airlines
that operates it in the United States
through to ethiopian airlines that
operate obviously in ethiopia and
Indonesian Airlines and all of these
airlines that operate this particular
type of 737 around the world so going
back to the initial question how safe or
unsafe visit I would use all of that
information to assess the risk depending
on what action the airlines are taken
based on the information the Boeing put
into the operating manuals if they were
all the operating manuals of all the
airlines have that information in it and
then how much time energy and resource
was put into training the crews up to
try and understand and deal with that
problem if it ever happened
thank you very much for that there Mikey

this evening in a few hours from now the
United Nations Security Council will
decide on the fate of the JG Mohammad
chief Masood Azhar now China is the only
permanent member which has so far
blocked the listing of other it has done
so three times already and it looks like
Beijing is going to block the move yet
again now just ahead of the vote China
hinted that it may once again block the
bid to designate other as a global
terrorist China's foreign ministry
spokesperson said quote the solution
that is acceptable to all sides is
conducive to resolve the issue end quote
while India has pushed for sanctioning
other Pakistan has continued to get
Beijing support on blocking the bid
China has been insisting that the
solution should be acceptable to all
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson
said quote I want to say that China
always adopts a responsible attitude
engaged in consultations with various
parties and properly deals with this
issue the discussions must follow the
rules and procedures of the relevant
bodies and only the solution that is
acceptable to all sides is conducive for
resolving the issue end quote
so as expected China's speak on the
issue of masood azhar is confusing to
say the least
we spoke with Attilan Asia senior Indian
journalist in Beijing and asked him why
China is blocking India's bid to ban
Masood Azhar and what Beijing stands to
gain from continuing to do so this is
what he told us listening the Chinese
here are playing a long game and after
India which was obviously object and
protest in case as we assume that China
will not allow Masood Azhar to be
designated as an international terrorist
it would probably try another round of
engagement where it would try and build
consensus through a very active
diplomatic initiative between India and
Pakistan in the long run China wants
both India and Pakistan to be on board
its Eurasia centric project then we know
a India from getting too close to the
United States Japan Australia at the
court and the international at the
Western alliance system so I suppose
you're not seeing an end to it whether
it's going to succeed or not there is a
million-dollar question
as of now India goes into election mode
so I doubt anything much is going to
happen from the Indian side but I think
around summer after the election results
are over we might see another round of
diplomacy where China makes an attempt
to Deccan sell differences between India
and Pakistan and India not sure whether
it's going to work but the Chinese have
actually taken a very high-profile
stance now to interject in the
india-pakistan equation something which
has which they have never done before in
terms of visibility as they're doing now
now what's clear from all of this is
that India stands on the muscle as an
issue has been the same the whole time
but Pakistan stance on Masood Azhar's
listing is what remains unclear
Pakistan's foreign minister shah mahmud
Qureshi has said in an interview that
Pakistan will not put its friends in
trouble but the foreign ministry
spokesperson had told we on that
Islamabad's decision on others listing
would be in the country's interest
meanwhile China's junior foreign
minister was in Islamabad recently
sources told we on that the issue of
Masood Azhar's listing was part of the
discussion a Chinese foreign ministry
spokesperson said that the only solution
acceptable to all sides will be the one
conducive to the issue Beijing has said
that others listening must follow rules
and procedures of the United Nations but
remember China's already blocked the
listing three times in the past
meanwhile India has slammed Pakistan at
the 40th session of the UN Human Rights
Council for its sustained support of
terrorism and for raking up the Jammu
and Kashmir issue this comes just ahead
of the decision on listing of the je M
chief Masood Azhar under the UN terror
list by the UNSC one two six seven
committee an Indian diplomat
representative said that Islamabad
continues to support terror attacks
against India the latest being the 14th
February pull wama terror attack she
reminded Pakistan of its infamous
distinction of hosting 132 UN designated
terrorists and 22 terrorist entities
Pakistan's continued support to
cross-border terrorism is the main
challenge to protecting the human rights
of our citizens in the Indian state of
Jammu and Kashmir the confirmation of
using UN prescribed terror organizations
Jesse Mohammed is an instrument of state
policy by Pakistani military and
political leadership is already in
public domain on the issue of Islamabad
waking up the issue of Indian minorities
at the world body the Indian diplomat
refocused the attention on Pakistan's
treatment of minorities and their
persecution under the blasphemy law and
denial of basic rights Pakistan is known
to the international community for its X
of aggressions harboring safe havens for
terrorists
three courts trying civilians harassment
of man I treat minorities through
blasphemy law forced conversions and
marriages of minorities the sentiment
was also echoed by Kashmiri political
activists and intellectuals who called
out Pakistan's duplicity and hypocrisy
on Jammu and Kashmir firstly Pakistan
invaded Jammu and Kashmir in 1947 since
then it has been an occupier and now
it's a broker as it is negotiating the
sale of gilgit-baltistan to Beijing mr.
president Pakistan has forcibly divided
Jammu and Kashmir while it continues
from ending terrorism and keeps the
ceiling the world by manifesting itself
as a self South protector of the rights
of the people of Jammu and Kashmir for
over seven decades now on the eve of the
UNSC vote the US State Department deputy
spokesperson Robert Palladino said that
India and the US are working together on
counterterrorism Palladino said that
China and the u.s. share a mutual
interest in achieving regional stability
and peace and the failure to designate
azor would run counter to this goal
here's a snippet from the State
Department briefing is the u.s.
concerned that China might block the
UNSC 1267 listing requests for Jesse
Mohammed chief Masood Azhar because
Beijing made some comments yesterday
that would suggest that China was
potentially going to put a hold on it or
block it regarding Masood Azhar the
United States and India worked closely
together on counterterrorism efforts and
that includes at the United Nations and
our views and Ayesha Mohammed and its
founder are well known Jem is a United
Nations designated terrorist group the
char is the founder and the leader of
Jem
and he meets the criteria for
designation by the United Nations Jem
has been responsible for numerous
terrorist attacks and is a threat to
regional stability and peace the United
Nations sanctions committee their
deliberations are confidential and as
such we don't comment on specific
matters but we'll continue to work with
these sanctions committee to ensure that
the designation list is updated and
accurate regarding your specific
question on China I would say that the
United States and China share a mutual
interest in achieving regional stability
and peace and that a failure to
designate bazaar would run counter to
this vote I feel the watching
proceedings at the UNSC very closely and
will of course get you an update as and
when a decision is made on Masood Azhar
but for now let's turn our attention to
the other big story that's been brewing
since Sunday since the Ethiopian
Airlines crash near Addis Ababa India's
aviation regulator has finally
effectively barred the Boeing 737 max
fleet from flying over the Indian
airspace after meeting of the agency's
top heads a few hours ago the
director-general of civil aviation said
that no Boeing 737 max Jets will take
off or land at any Indian Airport all
the aircraft 7 max they have been ground
anyway they have been you know short by
2:30 and then as you know that we have
also taken in no time
that no aircraft should over fly or come
to India or fly outside so that no team
have till 4 that was there so everybody
even with the international players they
had enough time to adjust to that so
after for the AI has passed orders to
everyone that no aircraft with Max the
sweetie in max
aircraft that has to be accepted so that
will be fully complied with late last
night
India finally decided to ground all
Boeing 737 max Jets three days after the
Ethiopian airline crash India's aviation
watchdog the DGCA decided to suspend the
aircraft until appropriate modification
and safety measures are undertaken to
ensure safe operation in India SpiceJet
and Jet Airways both operate this
particular aircraft SpiceJet has 13 of
this model in it 75 strong fleet while
jet has 5 B 737 max its following the
DGCA order spice shed issued a statement
I'm going to read it out for you now
spice jet has suspended boeing 737 max
operations following the DG c s decision
to ground the aircraft safety and
security of our passengers crew and
operations are of utmost importance to
us and we will be working with the
regulator and the manufacturer to attain
normalcy in our operations we are
confident of accommodating the vast
majority of our passengers and minimize
inconvenience and court SpiceJet had
earlier defended the boeing 737 max
calling the model highly sophisticated
but why exactly is the US President
Donald Trump's Federal Aviation
Administration or the FAA not grounding
the Boeing 737 max the reason it appears
is more political than operational now
ties between Boeing and the US president
run deep first Trump is an aviation
enthusiast and was once the owner of an
airline that's Trump shuttle which was
in close contact with Boeing during its
three a long lifespan before entering
the White House Trump had his personal
Boeing 757 as well secondly Trump's
connection with Boeing CEO Muhlenberg
isn't new remember Trump had personally
negotiated with Muhlenberg to try and
lower the cost of a future version of
the u.s. presidential aircraft in July
last year Boeing won a 3.9 billion
dollar contract to replace the two Air
Force one Jets third Trump used Boeing
products and sites as a backdrop of
major presidential announcement
in July last year he spoke about the
impact of his tax overhaul bill during a
visit to a Boeing plant in st. Louis but
it isn't just the US president top White
House officials have a close nexus with
Boeing as well the u.s. acting defense
secretary Patrick Shanahan worked for
Boeing for 31 years before entering the
Pentagon the former US ambassador to the
UN nikki Haley has been nominated by
Boeing to join its board of directors
apart from these individuals there are
some more facts that help solve the
puzzle of trumps Boeing bias Boeing is
the USS 2nd largest defense contractor
the company received 104 billion dollars
in unclassified defense contracts
between 2014 and 2018 it is no surprise
then that Trump's administration has
repeatedly urged its allies to buy
Boeing products according to reports it
was Trump who had pressed the Emir of
Kuwait to go ahead with a long delayed
deal with Boeing for its f-18 Super
Hornet fighter jets this is by no way
the first time that Trump is batting for
Boeing Boeing CEO Muhlenberg had earlier
said that purchases of us-made aircraft
could be part of the us-china trade deal
in other news the three-story building
has collapsed in Nigeria's largest city
Lagos the building had a primary school
on the top floor and many schoolchildren
are among those fear trapped a massive
rescue operation is currently underway
these are visuals of course from Lagos
the capital of Nigeria where a building
has collapsed it housed a school and
there is fear that there are a number of
school children who are also trapped
under the debris there is a mask massive
rescue and search operation that is
currently underway to ascertain how many
people are trapped under and to provide
relief immediately

house of commons after lawmakers have
dealt a major blow to Prime Minister
Theresa May resoundingly rejecting a
brexit deal just 17 days before the UK
is due to leave the block let's listen
in to the debate happening now in the
House of Commons own deal has been
decisively rejected when will she listen
to those workers who are concerned about
their jobs those businesses are
concerned about their future and accept
the case there has to be a negotiated
customs union with the EU when it comes
to the CPI the CBI said that the Labour
government's policies would lead to a
drop in living standards that's not very
good for the people he claims to stand
up and represent but he talks about he
talks about a customs union which of
course was part of proposals he put
forward but it's yet another position
that he's taken he's moved to being in
favour of the second referendum that I
know the last night he didn't actually
refer to a second referendum
he's just spoken about a deal about a
customs union that's already been
rejected and actually in the past very
often rejected by him rather represent
any option at the present time for the
primary so would have thought I don't
think her answer will help workers it to
Honda in Swindon or those in Nissan in
Sunderland or many others that are very
concerned about their future because of
the danger to manufacturing industry mr.
speaker Britain's food producers are
also in despair a coalition of UK food
producers asked the Prime Minister to
call for tariff free access the single
market with their red lines now in
tatters will she now back the view of UK
food producers and back close alignment
to the single market to secure their
industry after all she promised at
Chequers
there would be frictionless trade
so the right honorable gentleman that
the deal that we have negotiated
includes access to the European Union on
the basis of no tariffs my chart we've
actually read it
[Applause]
mr. speaker it was a former Defra
secretary the member for North
Shropshire who was campaigning to leave
in the referendum and actually said
during that and I quote was it's not the
kind of language I would use only a
madman would actually leave the single
market the Prime Minister's previously
said you can't just reject No Deal you
need to be for something so with her own
deal now so decisively rejected can we
be informed by the Prime Minister
what is she now for does she now
recognize the Labour alternative the
five pillars we put forward is the
credible show in town available and
ready to be negotiated is it time she
moved on from her red lines and faced
the reality of the situation she has got
herself her party this Parliament and
this country into talks about not
wanting no deal yet repeatedly votes in
a way that brings no deal closer can I
say to right honourable gentleman the
deal that he's proposing actually has
been rejected several times by this
house I may not have my own voice but I
do understand the voice of the country
they
the house must calm itself I will tear
what the Prime Minister has to say what
everybody has to say and it should not
be necessary for voices to be raised for
a member to be heard the Prime Minister
and that is people want to leave the EU
they want to end free movement they want
to have our own trade policy they want
to ensure laws are made in this country
and judged in our cause that's what the
deal delivers that's what I continue to
work to deliver it used to believe that
- why is he just trying to frustrate it
I do have sympathy with the Prime
Minister voice and I hope it's soon
recovers I understand how painful this
is
the Prime Minister the Prime Minister's
deal has failed she no longer has the
ability to lead this is a rudderless
government in the face of a huge
national crisis the Honourable member
for broxbourne recognises it saying and
I quote the government is not fit for
purpose we're not doing what we need to
do which is govern the country properly
and effectively where the Prime Minister
has so obviously failed this house meets
to listen to the country listen to
unions listen to people in work fearful
for their future manufacturers and
businesses workers and European Union
citizens who've made such a fantastic
contribution to our society and British
citizens across Europe all facing
uncertainty jobs and industry at risk
the country in crisis she needs now to
show leadership
so can the Prime Minister tell us
exactly what her plan is now I continue
to believe that the House today will
have an opportunity to vote on No Deal
they will then have an opportunity
tomorrow depending on how they
tonight to vote on the question of the
extension of article 50 and as I said
last night there will be hard choices
for this house but this house will need
to determine at what its view is on the
on the way forward as far as the
government is concerned we want to
continue to work to leave the European
Union that's what we deliver for the
people in the on ma go to the referendum
we will continue to work to deliver
leaving of the European Union for to
deliver leaving the European Union with
a good deal and as regards the right
honourable gentleman he doesn't agree
with government policy he doesn't even
agree with Labor Party policy nothing to
offer this country
[Applause]
mr. speaker the whole house will want to
send its condolences to the families of
the recent victims of knife crime
including the 17 year old Jody Chesney
who was tragically murdered in my
borough of Havering but when two thirds
of those carrying a knife escaped
custodial sentence and when one in five
repeat offenders avoid prison what
assurances were the prime minister give
that we are serious about getting tough
on life crime and does she understand
why so many people are fed up with soft
sentencing

this is Mirage Mirage makes a living as
a travel writer he loves motorcycling
golf playing the guitar and just bumming
around he's decided to travel for a year
to find himself about time this is Johan
Johan is a photographer you're on a
Swedish but he's lived and worked in
four continents he's done some pretty
interesting gigs along the way yawns
current obsession is shooting astral
time-lapses he plans to backpack in
India for a year of travel an adventure
[Music]
I've been fascinated by India ever since
I was a child when I think of it now I
can't put a finger on what it was about
this country that attracted me perhaps
it's the fact that life in India is so
different from the sanitized existence I
had in Ludo and my hometown back in
Sweden the melting pot of people
language and cultures
mirage was skeptical when we started our
year-long travel in march this year he
didn't want to travel with someone who
he thought would not be able to adapt
quickly enough to the unique challenges
that traveling india can throw at you i
don't blame him for thinking that way
India with its flavors colors sounds
smells not to speak of the cultural
shock can be a handful for any European
but I've lived and worked in four
continents and unlike mirages who's used
to luxury I have back packed a fair bit
around the world as this how you dress
to get him Oh charlie girls it's hard to
pinpoint special moments in our eight
months ride for me everything is new and
therefore special but still there have
been times which literally took my
breath away like the time we boarded the
canopy of a hot air balloon in some ode
on the way to Jaipur
nothing like taking in the landscape
from the air but unlike a flight a
balloon lays us across the sky giving
you lots of time to take in the sights
I remember feeling envious of the life
that bowed bucker or Dutch pilot hat
traveling across the world flying
balloons and that's the bit that really
stays with me people who have crafted
these incredibly fulfilling lives for
themselves the most funny thing to fly
I will show you fix you later there's
one German company they have a balloon
that flies upside down it's not real but
if you see it flying it's a bit why is
this flying upside down but the top
basket is not a real birthday it's made
from fabric and a real basket is ended
in the balloon a little bit so you
cannot see it yeah it's a German it's
festive company very very nice to fly
the balloon but but like in the US if we
fly de Delon in the u.s. we call
nine-one-one first because we tell the
people if anybody calls for foreign
balloon accidents this one something
upside down inverted it's just supposed
to be like that you just don't react on
it and we will call you back after we
land
[Music]
I don't know if there's a landscape that
India doesn't have less than a month
after traipsing around in the desert
sands I found myself in a chairlift
slowly making its way up a mountain in
complete fog
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
you're gonna show you go ha now it's
done
they're gonna first see ya they're gonna
be like all right
laughs forward
[Music]
I hadn't been on a snowboard for many
years and then I found myself going down
a treacherous mountain in Gulmarg
[Music]
when the clouds rolled in we were stuck
in very low visibility and had to board
over throttle nines to be able to see
anything
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
the write-down condor mountain was
accelerating to say the least
also foolhardy if you ask me but I made
it down in one piece and that's all that
matters
[Music]
some areas were completely unwritten and
I got a chance to try out goo marks
famous powder living every snowboarders
dream of gliding over freshly fallen
snow I did struggle a wee bit and found
myself gasping for air at some points
but I had to remind myself that these
hills are more than twice the altitude
of the highest slopes in Sweden
one of the things that excites me the
most about traveling is extreme sports
activities where the adrenaline gets
going and in the past year I've gotten
to try out almost every conceivable
adventure sports available in northern
India in Kula Valley
I went paragliding from Doby near Naggar
town which has the biggest height
difference of all jump off points in the
area in vashisht near Manali tired after
a long trek we decided to take a
shortcut using this zipline
[Music]
[Music]
from Coulibaly to the hills surrounding
la the state of Himachal Pradesh is a
paradise for adventure sport growing up
in Sweden I loved mountain biking and
spent many years of my youth riding
around Lully oh I wasn't nervous about
my abilities but would I be able to
navigate the treacherous trails nuku
free it didn't help that I was riding
with some of the finest young riders in
India
thankfully my skills on a mountain bike
have stayed with you in 10 minutes I got
my bearings and in half an hour I even
showed off some tricks to the youngsters
there was no competition though these
kids had some serious endurance managed
to pedal back uphill all the way almost
the same time it took us in a car next
up a mountain man's workout on our
travels we met several people with
exceptional fitness levels in Manali a
fitness enthusiast and Mountaineer put
us to the test I did rather well if I
say so myself for the next one that we
are going to try is called figure of
four and the name is so because of the
shape that you make
given your climbing basically it is used
while climbing and overhangs or or
climbing a ceiling because because your
weight is actually not on your feet okay
so you have to use a lot of upper-body
strength and core okay and basically
like forearms and shoulders and lot of
course
[Music]
yeah Locke yeah lock in on your wrist
and this can be free or you can lock
lock lock yeah so did it nice yeah nice
I did rather well if I may say so myself
then there was Reggie Tecate an
international level MMA fighter who I
grappled with in Delhi
[Music]
[Music]
Hucky is half my size and thrice as
strong I didn't stand a chance against
these guys would practice these
techniques for many years although
exhausting it was a great evening on a
fortunately cloudy day during the summer
I went for a track warrior competition
where the first stage of the competition
was to ride a 4x4 around the track
given that no one even asked me before
putting my name up for this endurance
run in gurugram I started with all guns
blazing
[Music]
without to pace myself out and nearly
passed out of exhaustion here we can see
me running out of energy in 3 2 1
burn
[Music]
here I thought if I could just die here
I wouldn't have to finish the race I
survived to tell the tale
barely
[Music]
things took a masochistic turn in shimla
at the onset of winter and a feel-good
gathering I found myself among a group
of people who'd volunteered to dive into
a pool for an ice bath called wim HOF
method and used as a training exercise
for self-development this involved
dipping into water that was on the verge
of freezing over after a bit of focus
and determination the shivering stopped
and it was easy to see mind-over-matter
in action
[Music]
on our travels around the country I ran
into a number of people who like me came
to visit India but stayed on and made it
their home
oh hey are you doing I ordered you a
lemon Anna I remember how we had lemon
on us here before man this is great
this place is great for that Oh Alisa
Patterson lives and studies in Rishikesh
and is fully immersed in the Indian Way
of life looks like there's a few
different options here ya know what is
the what is the difference on these ones
so I think these have slightly more
rubber and less cork and this one has
mercy bulk and less rubber
what do you recommend I mean in terms of
grip in this hot weather
with sweat I think is gonna be the one
to go for probably cheaper too it was
less pork in it yeah how does it feel it
feels good that looks good to me I'll
take this one
[Music]
I met up with her for a yoga session on
the guts of the Ganga and the roasting
heat of the summer
[Music]
can't wait to go for Elissa took me for
a ride afterward I've written a lot in
India but that was probably the only
time I got to ride pillion Elissa didn't
seem particularly amused by my
suggestion to ride that's great let's
take it for a spin
you want me to driver
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
Mirage and I both have a thing for
motorcycles and his rigged up
motorcycles for us a number of times in
the summer he took off to Prague for a
harley-davidson parade in a rare gesture
of kindness he arranged a gorgeous
adventure machine for me and I took a
solar trip to Rome gar
this bike was something else it was the
first time I rode a big engined machine
and its power was exhilarating for its
size it handled rather well to people
overseas have often asked me about
riding in India it takes some getting
used to for sure here's a quick list of
things you need to adapt to road
conditions can be patchy adherence to
traffic rules is faradic
plus you need to watch out for stray
dogs and cattle on the road but do not
let this discourage you as long as
you're not over speeding and have your
wits about you traveling in India on a
motorcycle is one of the most rewarding
travelling experiences you can have
anywhere on the planet
just last month both of us wrote to
Bharatpur in Rajasthan
[Music]
sometimes when I see how people can set
up shop just about anywhere it amazes me
to see the ingenuity of how workers in
India can get by running a small
business without much more than a mirror
and a chair
I suppose that for many Indians this is
just a slice of daily life for me it's
not I suppose it's the unconventionality
I feel of getting a shave on the side of
the road that I found amusing
[Music]
a tequila do National Park I traded the
bike for a slightly simpler mode of
transport cycle rickshaws are the best
way to get around in the park I asked
the rickshaw puller if I could have a go
much to the amusement of other visitors
it's much trickier than it looks
- even though I didn't think much of it
at the time it seemed to have really
struck a chord with people out there and
I keep hearing about it we had so much
fun on those bikes than instead of
heading back we rode all the way to
Chicago T that really turned out to be
quite a bonus because in Chicago T I saw
Rajasthan hinterland a far cry from
cities like Jaipur and new Thai food
[Music]
but as far as true adventure goes
nothing beats the bike ride which took
him Delhi looking for a blue water lake
that sounded like a wild goose chase not
only did we find it
but widowed right in
[Music]
[Applause]
just make you fancy a dip I'm pretty
sure I will
elegy
mammy Roger you on it I'm now in Sana'a
Madonna regards but I know this is you
on Costas there's no basement nucleoside
whatever see if you tell me
seafood should think you should before
just to make sure and if you can make it
back just to make sure there's no
crocodiles for you no no only fish
[Music]
that has to be the most unexpected
experience I've ever had
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
but of all the experiences I've had in
the last year nothing has made a deeper
impression than the street food and
India is really one of those places
where you can find the most delicious
food in the most hectic places now that
my Constitution has been adequately
fortified I can handle anything let me
say for the record I've never had kabobs
like the fantastic 2g kabob skewers
grilling over coals across Srinagar Dal
Lake these kebabs must be among the best
in the country for the fabulous kebabs
at Ghalib kebabs in Nizam Adina in Delhi
I had no idea that such fantastic Street
food exists outside of all Delhi that is
until we took a food walk with an expert
on above sopra who runs deli food walks
[Music]
what do you see
[Music]
all right let's go while I'm a natural
carnivore the beardy the puri and the
potato curry combo we had in Agra man
that really took the cake
[Music]
don't wait up you have a special
procedure preparing this like a
combination of down so no no it's
basically I basically then I have the
will be DS I don't know the Agra version
of a for a subject but bro I just
figured up right now I I thought look
like where I go you go healthy food for
you first thing in the morning all right
[Music]
thank you
that's like a we're gonna deep fry Puri
you know and I look like well that was
like you know like bossy potato and this
is a banana leaf it Cervelo organic
interesting taste but I don't think I'm
gonna adopt this if my breakfast habit
you reckon deep fried oh come on
this whole food what yeah I know you
have all this I know you're on the
health thing but that was the moment now
that I think about it in India finally
felt like home for a change even mirages
agreed
[Laughter]
when looking back at the years I've had
of traveling I'm often reflecting on how
am I thinking about the traveling that
I'm doing has also changed in 2007 when
it all began I was traveling and taking
pictures along the way dreaming about
one day getting paid to travel
I quickly envisioned a life of
travelling by lifestyle say forward five
years and I'm not just traveling and
taking photos as an added interest and
now traveling just to take photos to
find scenic vistas in remote corners of
the Himalayas I discovered how rewarding
it can be to shoot time lapses which
turn into a passion in itself
keeping up with mirage and traveling
with the writer turned into a great way
to learn more about storytelling and
getting a deeper understanding of the
places visited we have gone through most
of what is somewhat accessible by car
from Delhi and explored many different
parts of the Hills some of the most
memorable experiences that come to mind
must be the views from Bob Dodds place
in cassar-daley the views from Cali atop
the Sun Rise from a hot-air balloon
sipping over the rural landscape in
Rajasthan the spectacular sunrise over
the Taj Mahal in Agra that one sunrise
was all over Missouri town and thing
turned out great the campout with Bonnie
under a starry sky were fires on sticks
led up to tents that was indeed a
beautiful scene

this is Mirage Mirage makes a living as
a travel writer he loves motorcycling
golf playing the guitar and just bumming
around he's decided to travel for a year
to find himself about time this is Johan
Johan is a photographer you're honest
Swedish but he's lived and worked in
four continents he's done some pretty
interesting gigs along the way Iran's
current obsession is shooting astral
time-lapses he plans to backpack in
India for a year of travel an adventure
so the tug-of-war is about to start I'm
taking part in this activity by being on
Team a which team will be able to stand
its ground by the looks of it not the
team I'm in which basically comprises of
thin lanky lads who work for the balloon
company the other team has burly
mustachioed guys we're going to get
whipped
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
what do you know with the police officer
in your team chances are high that you
will win now we have to switch sides and
compete again just to ensure it's all
fair and square
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
when it comes to a tug-of-war fault then
looks can be deceiving drawn it's no
good
[Applause]
[Music]
so intuitive to tug-of-wars
we 100% you can't argue that it's a
slippery ground we want no matter what
yeah team a as it turns out being on the
same team as the balloon to her company
crew was a good idea I guess they do
pull on ropes all day to make the
balloon land where needed
[Music]
Casey Amin noticed let me add that I
managed to do my best while keeping my
turban in place I've always been
fascinated by the myriad kinds of
turbans people wear in Rajasthan and
I've always wondered how to tie one or
how much time it takes a bunch my name
in for a turban time competition at the
run at poor festival a two-day carnival
at the small town in Rajasthan but first
how I ended up here so I've been riding
a car all day without Mirage this time
I'm going to the Roenick por festival at
this festival they have a ton of
different stuff going on it should be
quite the spectacle everything from yoga
and meditation nature walks safaris
different competitions horse show
camel polo you name it the thing I'm
most excited about is the turban tying
competition
but before I do anything else I have to
buy a turban okay so these are all
turbans all right some of the different
ones to choose from what about this one
this one looks like a popular one but
how can I tie it now my goal for this
evening since I've been on the road all
day is to reach the Genaro
royal castle it should be a place with a
favorite of history I think the place
was built in 1606 so I'm hoping to make
it there before nightfall
[Music]
if you're traveling from Delhi to Ghana
in one day then it's a good idea to
leave at first light of dawn so you can
get in before nightfall it's dusk
already in this Heritage Hotel I'm
staying at
Goneril castle is turning out to be
rather hard to find this castle looks
much bigger than it did in the pictures
I saw online
[Music]
walking around here is a bit like trying
to trace your steps in a maze
[Music]
my room or rather suite is bigger than
my apartment in Delhi
[Music]
I'm going to head straight to bed to get
an early start tomorrow morning
[Music]
so I'm here at the helicopter ground
hermana hotel in Roenick por as you can
see if there's a balloon ride going on
there they've set up a hot air balloon
which is going up and down and up and
down just to give people an overview of
the area I'm gonna get a chance to try
it out alright the first test run is
complete now it's our turn
[Music]
[Music]
there we go
lifting up over the scenic vistas of
runner cool no one to cross up your
bucket or fry from the ballooning tour
we went for in samode this short ride
was worthwhile nonetheless this was by
far the smallest balloon I've ever been
on the distance here I'm thinking maybe
about 50 meters off of the ground
can't go very far for safety reasons but
you know this whole kind of thing smells
a little bit of gas quite funny and look
at these guys yeah attachment duct tape
Oh safety 101 and in case you know it
goes out then you got a extra igniter
right here turbo turbo it's so small it
feels like a toy the flexible floor
didn't add to any feeling of safety
that's it for that balloon ride up and
now fast whoa
[Music]
we're gonna launch the Indian flag with
the balloon we'll see how it goes
[Music]
hoping it's gonna stay level
yeah buddy
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
okay the moment of reckoning is here my
turpentine skills are going to be put to
a stern test although I did figure out
the basics yesterday it might be a good
idea to solicit some expert advice
certainly if you're looking for help in
tying a turban then there's no dearth of
teachers in Roenick for step by step
talk me through the process
okay first under the chin okay under the
air and then you're holding it there as
I have only just learned how to tie a
turban I am a bit nervous I did expect
other foreigners to be here as the
organizer had told me some fifteen of
them were registered to compete but it
seems they got cold feet last minute and
pulled out of the competition
[Music]
and we're off we have only three minutes
to tie a turban in this competition and
it is not only a matter of speed to win
the game a sense of style is taken into
account as well by the looks of it I'm
failing in both to my surprise the old
man next to me has already finished in
less than 60 seconds next on the
festival Satine ireri is a fourth show
Ajit Singh breeds Marwari horses and
takes tour groups around the hinterland
in this region Marberry horses are a
hardy indigenous breed and well adapted
to this area dat monment there's no show
jumping or dressage at the show but
rather a curious mix of tricks the poor
horses have to pull for our
entertainment I'm not sure I like this
we are at the fairgrounds near the
Hanuman temple in town and the teams are
set up for camel polo there's there's
Indians versus foreigners
Paulo is a pretty speedy game played on
sprightly steeds but this is a more
laid-back version played at a more
leisurely pace not on a Nancy stallion
but rather the ship of the desert itself
since there's a break before the next
event at the festival I'm going to see
dr. Ajit stables at Sun on a village
[Music]
I have come to meet with dr. Ajit Singh
who runs horse Heritage gnarley' he is
offered to give me my very first horse
riding lesson we'll see how we go
[Music]
[Music]
so what is the name of this gorgeous
horse oh he's good too dad's garage
that's ready to go
yeah yeah yeah his daddy he's excited
and he's not interested to wait in his
top on the place Oh his mocking is very
special like lucky he's like a lucky
star when you're talking about the
marking you mean like the the white
color yes like the good thing is like a
for for socks okay okay oh these are
called socks socks okay for white feet
and the the mark on forehead yes and and
these are five things means five lucky
things on the horse and if you if you
notice if you notice if you will see
some of horses normally they are like
one or three also this is the various
one of your favorite oh yes yeah yeah so
what should I think about considering
this my first time taking a proper
riding lesson what is there any kind of
safety advice that you can give me so
that you before mounting you need to
wear the helmet long sleeves are nice
come slowly in front of him so you hold
the rain and you touch like that nicely
smoothly yes like the polite way to yeah
politely and then he's preparing himself
for you and then you start like that
yeah very gently
it's a gorgeous horse huh yeah he's
taller than I am even yeah so let's go
yes
[Music]
when I got on the horse IG told me I was
taking a test driving lesson on a
Ferrari many people have told me that as
soon as you get on a horse the horse
knows if you have experience or not
gosh Raj has presumably figured out
quickly that I have no idea what I'm
doing
and I can tell he's getting anxious the
lesson ends pretty quickly
[Music]
you wanna have a go yeah I wanna show
how it's really done
so how did you listen well the Ferrari
thank you very much but he tells me to
come back anytime for another lesson at
which point he will assign me a mayor
which is more forgiving for beginners
Ajit has a pretty interesting setup here
getting to spend a lot of time outdoors
showing people the real countryside of
Rajasthan after a long day out I'm
heading to the amphitheater in ranakpur
to relax to some cultural performances
[Music]
[Music]
when there's a cultural evening with
different
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
what a welcome change from the hustle
and bustle of the city the castle is
very much a retreat and I've barely been
able to see all of it
[Music]
amat Singh the owner of the castle has
given me some gem known what to do with
the city the next thing on the festival
that inner area is in the evening and
I'm going to make the most of the day
I've also been told about the temple
that's inside a cave
I don't usually miss the temples but
this one sounds too interesting to pass
up
[Music]
love temples
Ches
[Music]
Genaro town has more than 30 different
stepwells and this one is called suraj
cool it's the biggest of them all
[Music]
this is awesome I love stepwells for
shooting it's a lot larger than I
thought it would be this one it's called
Suraj kun and if you look in the middle
right there where these where these
stuffs are flying there's a beehive
hanging right from the middle ledge
let's get you
[Music]
[Music]
these have got to be some of the most
exquisite detailed stone carvings I have
ever seen
the light inside this temple during this
time of day is just gorgeous the colors
of the stones change depending on how
the light falls at different times of
the day as I entered the temple such in
Sharma a Jain priest walked up to me and
offered to take me around he explained
the layout of the temple and the
extensive planning that must have gone
into the construction of the temple in
the fifteenth century this saying I have
seen on a photograph I think always just
a snake that doesn't have a tail the
snake without an end the infinitive
snake there is a thousand and eight
heads up for us okay there is an end
somewhere but you can't find the end of
the text over it it's like a puzzle it's
this entire piece made of one cut of
stone also
[Music]
here's the last green that's the
second-last that's a very impressive
piece so coming to this place seeing
this place from the outside it appears
very symmetrical when you first come up
to the temple but taking a walk inside
this place and just realizing the sheer
scale of this work it's it's an absolute
Monument every single pillar is carved
in a different way and this 1444 of them
it is overwhelming to stand in these
open halls and just look up at these
domes and see the level of detail it's
absolutely mind-boggling to think about
the man-hours that have gone into
creating all of this intricate stone
carvings that are on every single pillar
it's just incredible definitely worth a
stop it's not going out of your way to
just see this at least if you are on the
way in between jodhpur and who type or
traveling in this distance this is a
definite stuff to check out super
impressive
[Music]
at dusk the entire silhouette of the
temple is lit up with lamps a striking
sight if there ever was one it is an
occasion all right winter solstice a
full moon and here I am in a small town
in Rajasthan in front of an ancient
temple that scene rites of passage for
centuries right now in ranakpur I truly
feel part of a moment in history
[Music]
from earth ironic poor too glitzy otaku
the city of lakes forts of the biggest
nest you'll ever see on a mango tree at

kRxOMh07uYg,DGCA grounds Boeing&#39;s 737 Max 8 aircraft,"Responding to the recent crashes involving Boeing's 737 MAX 8 jets, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) decided to ...",2019-03-13T06:29:44Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kRxOMh07uYg/hqdefault.jpg,"and following the Ethiopian Airlines
crash on Sunday Indian aviation ministry
has now decided to ground the Boeing 737
max eight aircraft with immediate effect
now the Ministry of Civil Aviation
tweeted the decision stating that the
safety of the passengers is the top
priority the decision comes days after
an Ethiopian airline crash killed 157
people on board including four Indians
the planes will remain grounded till
appropriate modifications and safety
measures are undertaken to ensure their
safe operations this is the same airline
whose flight crashed into the Java Sea
minutes after takeoff in October last
year killing all 189 people on board
currently SpiceJet and Jet Airways
operate the 737 max eight spy jet has 13
of the model eight variants in a
seventy-five song fleet while jet
airways has five such aircraft chair
Davis has grounded the model eight
variants SpiceJet
had earlier defended the Jets and called
them highly sophisticated
now Boeing says it has full confidence
in safety of the 737 max and is not plan
to issue new guidance to operators the
statement read and I quote we understand
that regulatory agencies and customers
have made decisions that they believe
are most appropriate for their who
markets will continue to engage with
them to ensure they have the information
needed to have confidence in operating
their fleets it went on to also say the
United States Federal Aviation
Administration is not mandating any
further action at this time and based on
the information currently available we
do not have any base to issue new
guidance to operators
now there's another question to consider
over here in an attempt to develop
fuel-efficient claims has been
compromised on quality one of the
biggest reasons why Boeing 737 max has
been successful is its fuel efficiency
what we call mileage which is why this
new plane has found several buyers in
developing markets the company has
orders for more than 5,000 planes in an
attempt to build such a plane boeing had
to design the 737 max a bit differently
that could have had some unintended
consequences whenever you have a new
change or a new aircraft or a
substantially different model as in this
case the engines are different to get a
more economical fuel burn and they are
moved forward changing the weight and
balance of the aircraft so there are
substantial changes to the airplane
whenever you get this there are often
issues that come up that are
unanticipated and if they must be dealt
with immediately and significantly the
FAA will issue an air worthiness
directive what is happening inside
Boeing after these two air crashes
remains a mystery last time around the
company got away after issuing an
advisory this time around it has
promised a software update to patch any
problems on the 737 max in a statement
the company has announced that it will
release the update by April boeing
describes the software update as an
enhancement and says it is related
through the line air crash by the crash
in ethiopia is only mentioned in passing
as boeing maintains a shield around
explained several regulators around the
world are relying on the assessment of
America's Federal Aviation
Administration so far they say that
Boeing's plane are safe to fly but that
is just one assessment
people around the world are looking at
boiling with a magnifying glass China
has taken a firm stance Beijing won't
allow Boeing planes to fly until they
are declared safe with regard to when
the Chinese side will lift the ban the
notice of the sea AAC has clearly stated
that they will ask Chinese aviation
companies to lift ban on commercial
operation of Boeing 737 max 8 unless
they are assured by the US Federal
Aviation Administration and Boeing
Company and they have taken related
measures to guarantee safe travels so it
is hard to give a detailed timetable
before we get a reliable guarantee in
case of any safety rests I think it is
also a responsible attitude to all
passengers within America Boeing is
facing intense scrutiny and one American
lawmaker disagrees with the FAA s
assessment Democratic lawmaker Dianne
Feinstein has called on the American
Aviation watchdog to ground all Boeing
737 max eight planes she said and I
quote until the cause of the Ethiopian
crash is known and it's clear that
similar risks aren't present in the
domestic fleet I believe all Boeing 737
max eight series aircraft operating in
the United States should be temporarily
grounded this aircraft model represents
only a small fraction of the domestic
fleet and several other countries have
already taken this important step
including China and internation but US
lawmakers speaking out against Boeing
remain a minority there is a strong
reason for that Boeing is one of the top
spenders when it comes to lobbying
American lawmakers in 2017 the company
spent more than 16 million dollars on
lobbying efforts in 2016 the companies
spent more than seventeen million
dollars

the risk of a damaging nodi brexit and
has made it clear that there would be no

an unchartered territory with no of this
way forward speaking after the vote
Theresa May started stated that she
remains committed to delivering drugs it
and leaving you in an orderly way i
profoundly regret the decision that this
house has taken tonight I continue to
believe that by far the best outcome is
United Kingdom leaves the European Union
in an orderly fashion
with a deal and that the deal we've
negotiated is the best and indeed the
only deal available but Mr Speaker I
would like to set out briefly how the
government means to proceed two weeks
ago I made a series of commitments from
this despatch-box
regarding the steps we would take in the
event this house rejected the deal on
offer I stand by those commitments in
full
therefore tonight we were tabled a
motion for debate tomorrow to test
whether the house supports leaving the
European Union without a deal on the
29th of March the leader of the house
will shortly make an emergency business
statement confirming the change to
tomorrow's business this is an issue of
grave importance for the future of our
country
just like the referendum there are
strongly held and equally legitimate
views on both sides for that reason I
can confirm that this will be a free
vote on this side of us
can I have first me struggled with this
choice as I'm sure many other humble
members will I'm passionate about
delivering the result of the referendum
but I equally passionately believe that
the best way to do that is to leave in
an orderly way with a deal and I still
believe that there is a majority in the
house for that course of action and I'm
conscious also and I'm conscious also of
my duties as Prime Minister of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland under the potential
damage to the Union that leaving without
a tea or could do when one part of our
country is without devolved governments
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn once again
pressed for a general election and for
the Labour Party to take over
negotiations with the EU the party has
put that proposal and we will put we
will put that proposal again because the
dangers the dangers of what what the
Prime Minister proposing are basically
that we carries on threatening us all
with the danger of No Deal the danger of
that knowing full well the damage that
will do to the British economy this
party will put forward our proposals
again which are about a negotiated
customs union access the market and
protection of rights those the ones will
put forward we believe there may well be
there may well be a majority for them
but there will also be the potential of
negotiating them the Prime Minister's
run down the clock and the clock has
been run out on her maybe it's time
instead we are a general election and
the people who
government should be European Commission
President Donald Tusk expressed his
regret at the result of the water and
said that EU had done everything
possible to reach an agreement he also
noted that even if the UK voted to rule
out an oddly and requested an extension
to article 50 a delay was not a given as
it would have to be considered by the
remaining 27 EU members our London
bureau chief Mandy Clarke joins us more
from London and let's quickly go across
the Mandy Mandy how large was the defeat
for Theresa May and what lies ahead now
it was another crushing defeat for
Theresa May it wasn't as historic as
that January defeat when the deal was
first presented to the House but it was
very large and we saw signs of that
early defeat in the day when legal minds
came up and said the deal shoes put for
it doesn't really represent the legally
binding changes that she had promised
that was enough to convince privateers
and also the DUP that's the Northern
Irish party that she needs to support
her deal to simply say no and without
their support that there was no real way
this deal could pass through Parliament
so what's next we will see vote now on a
No Deal brexit so she's allowing the
house decide whether they want Britain
to leave the EU without a deal or not
she says it's a free vote so MPs can
vote with their conscience
she says she herself is going to vote
that Britain should not leave with a No
Deal that they should have an orderly
exit and by and large the House agrees
with this and most people believe that a
No Deal situation is bad for the economy
in Britain so in all likelihood we will
see the house decide that they do not
want a No Deal situation if that's the
case the very next day on Thursday there
will be a vote for the extension of
article 50 which simply means they will
turn to Brussels and ask for more time
to negotiate now is up to Brussels if
they want to grant Britain that
extra time so still even though they
might not want to know deal situation
Brussels may say no and they might end
out crashing out of the European Union
so is still unclear even after this
defeat exactly what we can expect by the
end of the month and the end of the
month is when brexit is due to take
place when Britain and the EU are
supposed to perfect right okay Mandy now
following the defeat of the war now what
is the mood of the British public on
this latest round of voting the public
mood in Britain is pretty sour there is
enormous feeling that the politicians
are not working together and they are
just out to frustrate the brexit process
they don't really want to deal this is
more about personal politicking rather
than the benefit of the nation so
there's an enormous level of public
frustration about how this process went
many people question how did we get to
this situation was just 17 days left in
the brexit negotiations they had a solid
two years to come up with the terms of a
deal to leave the European Union this is
not even trade talks we're talking about
just the agreement on the divorce
settlement they can't manage that that's
really frustrating the British people
whether you're a remainer
or you're a brexit ear both sides feel
that they've been disappointed by the
politicians and have lost faith in this
process it is indeed a frustrating
moment for the UK but we will continue
to track the latest developments on
brexit thank you so much Mandy Clark for
bringing us the latest onna breaks it

Elizabeth Warren and Mitt Romney said
that the FAA should not wait for answers
before taking the Boeing 737 max out of

today immediately the FAA needs to get
these things out of the sky one also
called for congressional hearing on
whether the administration that we used
to stand up that used to stand up to
Saudi Arabia to protect Boeing arms

for the same reason but it despite pleas
from lawmakers of both parties the FAA
has refused to suspend the model the FAA
Administrator Dan Elvis said and I quote
thus far our review shows no systemic
performance issues and provides no basis
to order grounding of the aircraft and
will said that FAA will take immediate
and appropriate action if such evidence
emerges now

u.s. President Donald Trump spoke with
the Boeing CEO Dennis Muhlenberg and now
a Muhlenberg assured Trump that the 77

temporary grounding of the Boeing 787

of fires linked to it Cigna theam ion
batteries and my colleague Kevin gets us
in this report there are obvious you
know comparisons being drawn to the fact
that Donald Trump
and the Boeing boss they've had been
head to head they've locked horns in the
past they haven't always agreed yes
Boeing gave a million dollars to Donald
Trump's inauguration but Boeing also
gave it a million dollars to the 2013
inauguration of Barack Obama's clearly
something that this multibillion-dollar
company decides to do I think Donald
Donald Trump talking to the Boeing boss
was was always likely you know he has
been at Donald Trump's mar-a-lago estate
they clearly have some kind of
relationship there but it's really down
to his government you know the FAA
that's their job to decide and determine
what's fit to fly Donald Trump is not a
pilot as far as I know he's not an
aviation expert as far as I know but on
Twitter today he sort of hinted at this
notion that there was too much
technological advancement in modern day
planes perhaps taking some of the
control from the pilots what he's
nodding Pat perhaps there too is this
issue the scrutiny over the the flight
software in this particular Boeing 737
max a perhaps that what that's what the
president was alluding to but look
experts will turn to Donald Trump and
remind him that of course air travel is
still considered the safest travel among

against maids breaks a deal by a hundred
and forty nine votes the lawmakers will
now vote on whether Britain should quit
the European Union without a deed or not
the European Union has warned about the
resistance of a damaging node eprix it

be no more negotiations with London on
the divorce terms the wart has now put
UK in an uncharted territory with no
obvious ways forward speaking after the
war tourism a stated that she remains
committed to delivering brexit and
leaving the European Union in an orderly
way point of order mr. speaker i
profoundly regret the decision that this
house has taken tonight I continue to
believe that by far the best outcome is
United Kingdom leaves the European Union
in an orderly fashion with a deal and
that the deal we've negotiated is the
best and indeed the only deal available
but Mr Speaker I would like to set out
briefly how the government means to
proceed two weeks ago I made a series of
commitments from this despatch-box
regarding the steps we would take in the
event of this house
rejected the deal on offer I stand by
those commitments in full
therefore tonight we were tabled a
motion with a debate tomorrow to test
whether the house supports leaving the
European Union without a deal on the
29th of March the leader of the House
will shortly make an emergency business
statement confirming the change to
tomorrow's business this is an issue of
grave importance for the future of our
country just like the referendum there
is strongly held and equally legitimate
views on both sides
for that reason I can confirm that this
will be a free vote on this side of us
can I have firstly struggled with this
choice as I'm sure many other honourable
members will I'm passionate about
delivering the result of the referendum
but I equally passionately believe that
the best way to do that is to leave in
an orderly way with a deal and I still
believe that there is a majority in the
house for that course of action and I'm
conscious also and I'm conscious also of
my duties as Prime Minister of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and of the potential
damage to the Union that leaving without
et who could do when one part of our
country is without devolved governments
the labor leader Jeremy Corbyn once
again pressed for a general election and
for the Labour Party to take over
negotiations with the European Union the
party has put that proposal and we will
put we will put that proposal again
because the dangers the days of what
what the Prime Minister proposing are
basically that we actually carries on
threatening us all with a danger of no
deal the danger of that knowing full
well the damage that will do to the
British economy this party will put
forward our proposals again which are
about a negotiated customs union access
the market and protection of rights
those the ones will put forward we
believe there may well be there may well
be a majority for them but there will
also be the potential of negotiating
them the Prime Minister's run down the
clock and the clock has been run out on
her maybe it's time instead we are a
general election and the people who
should be the European Commission
president has expressed his regret at
the result of the world and said that
the European Union had done everything
possible to reach an agreement there he
also noted that even if the UK voted to
rule out a No Deal and a-- quested an
extension to article 50 a delay was not
a given as it would have to be
considered by the remaining 27 European
Union members a London bureau chief Andy
Clark gets us this report
it was another crushing defeat for
Theresa May it wasn't as historic as
that January defeat when the deal was
first presented to the House but it was
very large and we saw signs of that
early defeat in the day when legal minds
came up and said the deal she's put for
it doesn't really represent the legally
binding changes that she had promised
that was enough to convince brexit ears
and also the DUP that's the Northern
Irish party that she needs to support
her deal to simply say no and without
their support that there was no real way
this deal could pass through Parliament
so what's next we will see a vote now on
a No Deal brexit so she's allowing the
house to decide whether they want
Britain to leave the EU without a deal
or not she says it's a free vote so MPs
can vote with their conscience
she says she herself is going to vote
that Britain should not leave with a No
Deal that they should have an orderly
exit and by and large the House agrees
with this and most people believe that a
No Deal situation is bad for the economy
in Britain so in all likelihood we will
see the house decide that they do not
want a No Deal situation if that's the
case the very next day on Thursday there
will be a vote for the extension of
article 50 which simply means they will
turn to Brussels and ask for more time
to negotiate now it's up to Brussels if
they want to grant Britain that extra
time so still even though they might not
want to No Deal situation Brussels may
say no and they might
and out crashing out of the european
union so is still unclear even after
this defeat exactly what we can expect
by the end of the month and the end of
the month is when brexit is due to take
place when Britain and the EU are
supposed to part ways

Molly compete the New York Times has
done it again the American newspapers
latest article on the pole vomit terror
attack is an example of how Western
media misleads readers and tries to
influence the narrative about India the
headline of the article first described
the pol vomit terror attack which
remember killed 40 Central Reserve
Police Force personnel in India as an
explosion
it said in India's election season an
explosion interrupts moody's loved
Indians worldwide called out the
newspaper for its bias rioting and said
that the article is actually an
unsubstantiated opinion piece rather
than a factual report the online outrage
finally forced the New York Times to
change the headline the word explosion
was then replaced with the word bombing
now this is not the first time that the
New York Times has spun stories against
India an article on the dogfight between
Indian and Pakistani warplanes on the
3rd of March had come under sharp
criticism as well the article questioned
in there's capability of waging a war
following the aerial clash between India
and Pakistan most importantly the
article left out the fact that an Indian
Air Force mig-21 bison shot down a u.s.
manufacturer f-16 jet
[Music]
and it was not just the New York Times
headline that was misleading it turns
out that the entire article has a many
instances that stand questionable years
why the article is also factually
inaccurate a look now at the first
example the article says the Prime
Minister Narendra Modi's biggest
vulnerability is the economy the New
York Times says that India's economy
grew 6.6 percent in the most recent
quarter and called it the slowest rate
in five years and that is not true the
slowest rate in five years was 5.7
percent in the first quarter of 2017
next India was referred to as India's
economy growth in fact was referred to
as quote-unquote faster than most
developed countries India is the fastest
growing large economy and is growing
faster than all and not most developed
countries thirdly the article claims
that farmers are quote unquote furious
with the way things have been going the
article says and I'm quoting Prime
Minister Modi had promised to ensure
that farmers received prices high enough
to make a profit but export controls and
overproduction have got deeply into
prices for crops like onions and
potatoes that's what the article says
the article therefore conveniently
ignores proactive measures for the farm
sector such as minimum support price at
1.5 times the input cost and 6000 rupees
directly credited into the bank accounts
of nearly 120 million small farmers
lastly the article directly claims
without any facts figures or numbers
that hate crimes against Dalits exploded
in this case isolated incidents are
being painted as widespread alienation
of certain groups and all eyes are on
the brexit water and all of course a lot
has been said about what whether or not
the deed will actually sail through the
UK Parliament let's go straight across
to your houses comments
if the Honorable lady if the Honorable
lady wants us to get onto the NGO stage
in the future relationship vote for the
deal tonight
[Applause]
now important important though the
backstop is it was not the only concern
honorable members had another was in
regards to the political declaration
because it provides as the Honorable
lady has hinted at in her question it
provides respect from of possible
outcomes members asked how they could be
confident but I what sort of future
relationship the government would
negotiate
can I just continue to make my point of
although I'm sure we can all learn
lessons from how we approach this first
phase of the negotiations as we move on
to the second for my part I've no doubts
that the government does need to build a
strong consensus in the house before we
go on to negotiate the future
relationship not needs to ensure the
process of ratification is smoother than
that for the withdrawal agreement and
that's why we've committed to give a
much stronger and clearer role for this
house and for the other place during the
next phase not just a consensus in
Parliament either businesses trade
unions and civil society must all play a
much bigger part contributing their
expertise in a collective national
effort to secure the very best future
relationship with the EU that's new
approach that if I just wait for a
second that new approach will start with
withdrawal agreement bill if the deal
passes tonight notice of presentation
will be given tomorrow and the bill will
be introduced on Thursday and as we
discussed that bill we could debate how
exactly we will ensure that this
Parliament has the full say it deserves
mr. speaker given the clock is ticking
there are millions of people working in
businesses up and down this country that
want the most certain outcomes and
voting for this deal today is the best
way of delivery
voting the deal down will need to more
uncertainty none of us know
so I thought one will be supporting the
government the planet can I thank my
uncle fact he has made a very important
point rejecting this deal tonight the
only certain certainly rejecting this
deal tonight is that increases
uncertainty businesses and individuals
and I I do feel for my my honorable
friend with the through this and she's
got at the moment I really do but having
said that she's referred to the fact
that the backstop is very important we
all know that and rightly so the
question however is also one that this
withdrawal agreements and that withdrawn
implementation bill which is to come
first of all we haven't seen a draft of
it and hoping we can get that very soon
by Europeans Christian Committee have
just said in report but the second thing
is that in there it is quite clear that
we will not be discharging what she said
herself at Lancaster House we would not
truly leave the European Union unless we
regain control of our own laws under
article 4 it's clear that that is not
the case what is the answer of my
honorable friends at that point first of
all I'm pleased to hear that he's keen
to see the with withdrawal agreement
bill that bill of course as I've said
will be presented to this house this
week if my honourable friend and others
vote for this deal
[Applause]
I've known it friendlies but I also say
to my to my honourable friend yes there
are provisions in relation to the role
of the European Court of Justice during
the period for our winding down a
winding our way out of the European
Union but it is clear and that covers
the implementation period what is
absolutely clear is once we are beyond
that point there is no jurisdiction of
the European Court of Justice other than
for a limited period of years in
relation to citizens rights there is no
jurisdiction of the European Court of
Justice in this country she just said
that if she manages to get her
withdrawal agreement approved by this
house she doesn't want the next stage of
serious negotiations about our long-term
future to proceed in the same way she's
giving a greater role to Parliament I
strongly endorse that we can't have
another arrangement where she just that
reaches a perfectly satisfactory
agreement on the three points she did
and then we defend in two parliamentary
fast as different people argue about
what changes they like so isn't the best
way of proceeding if she gets her
withdrawal agreement through then to
have some indicative votes in the House
of Commons before the serious
negotiations start so the government can
go into this negotiation knowing what a
broad mass of parliament is likely to
support and back her up if she can
achieve it actually I think there are a
number of ways in which we can ascertain
what the views of the house would be
prior to entering into the next stage of
negotiations and obviously we have been
looking at the details of that and we'll
want to be consulting and talking about
across the house in relation to that
matter but of course the first step is
my right honourable and Lerner trend
rightly indicated in order to get on to
that stage is to pass the deal tonight
mr. speaker
oh I'm really I'm gonna try make a
little more progress I have been
extremely generous with interventions
not everybody in this house is as
generous as aya
[Applause]
mr. speaker I set up to the house two
weeks ago the specifics of what will
happen if the deal is rejected tonight
we will first of all return tomorrow to
consider whether the house supports
leaving the European Union on the 29th
of March without a withdrawal agreement
and a framework for a future
relationship if the house votes against
No Deal
it would vote on whether to or not to
seek an extension of article 50 I
sincerely hope I sincerely hope that the
house will not put itself in this
invidious position we can avoid it by
supporting what i profoundly believe is
a good deal and a substantially better
deal than we had eight weeks ago but if
it comes to it the choices would be
bleak in the long term we could
ultimately make a success of No Deal but
there would be significant economic
shock in the short term and being no
doubt about the impact that would have
on businesses and families we would lose
the security cooperation that helps
keeps us safe from crime terrorism and
other threats and we would risk
weakening support for our union I note
that the right honourable member for
Ross Skye and Lochaber
had tabled an amendment seeking a second
Scottish independence referendum polling
shows that support for those Scottish
independence and United Ireland would be
higher if we leave without a deal
while a No Deal while a No Deal in the
absence of institutions in Northern
Ireland would create a substantial
problem of governance there should the
house rejects leaving on the 29th of
March without a deal and then support
the government seeking an extension to
article 50
our problems would not be solved an
extension without a plan would prolong
the uncertainty threatening jobs and
investment yet even as it did so it
would not change the debate or the
questions that need to be settled it
would merely pass control to the
European Union they would decide how
long an extension to offer meaning we
may not get what we asked for
they could even impose conditions on an
extension that could be moving to a
brexit that does not meet the
expectations of those who voted to leave
or even
or even moving to a second referendum
with all the damage that that would do
to trust in our democracy equally
equally there is a risk that having
voted for an extension this house would
still not be able to agree away forward
and we would end up leaving without a
deal and and just one moment I give way
to them if any of these things were to
happen it would be no good blaming the
European Union responsibility would lie
with this house our failure to come
together in the national interest to
deliver on the folks of the British
people oh dude wait so gentlemen and
then they all were gentlemen I'm
extremely grateful for her giving way
the first of her breads accepted brexit
secretaries is sitting in his place time
after time after time he stood at that
despatch box and he promised this house
that we would get the exact same
benefits after we leave then we
currently enjoy with the EU does she not
accept that raising expectations that
high set a level that she has absolutely
failed to meet that is damaged trust in
her brexit that has caused a situation
that we're in now and we have to find
another way forward gentlemen that we
have set hours in the proposals that the
government itself put forward a way of
ensuring that we maintain that we
maintain a very close economic
partnership with the European Union in
the future a closer security partnership
with the European Union in the future
but that we are also able to have the
benefit of acting as an independent
country of being that sovereign state
and of having our own trade deals with
other countries around the world I said
I'd give way to the gentleman at the
back I thank the promise of a giving way
and I welcome her commitment to
potentially legislate for the political
declaration albeit I believe doing so in
the with durable only once we voted to
endorse the political declaration maybe
a sign
convoluted way so could I suggest that
there may be a third option to consider
if the deal is not pass this evening
what the promise that could do it
independently legislate the political
declaration now setting out in law what
the endpoint will be and what role
Parliament will have in statute before
we are asked to vote together on a
further deal because that would give
people like me the confidence to
understand that by voting for the
withdrawal agreement there is certainty
on the physical declaration about where
we're going I thank the Honourable
gentleman for his proposal in relation
to that matter I think one of the issues
though is that there were elements of
the political declaration of course the
remains being negotiated where there is
not the certainty that I think he was
searching for in the proposal 30 he put
forward but he certainly I give him the
credit for inventiveness and thinking
carefully about these about these issues
mr. speaker I'll give way I will give
way one final time to the rajah manager
she's being very generous she agree with
me however that whatever happens today
where the her withdrawal agreement is
passed or not we are going to have to
have an extension to article 50 because
there is not time to complete the
business we will need to complete before
the 29th of March let's get the deal
agreed tonight then the usual channels
will work to see what it's necessary in
relation to getting legislation through
this house mr. speaker it was not this
house that no I've said

use terrorist outfits to engage in proxy
warfare against its neighbors the UN
Security Council's consolidated list of
terrorist individuals and entities
includes 139 entries from Pakistan Jaya
Mohammed lashkar-e-taiba Haqqani network
and Gemma to Dava are all based in
Pakistan and believed to be receiving
state protection in the wake of the
recent terrorist attack improve Amin
indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir
perpetrated by Joshua Mohammed
Pakistan's subsequent airstrikes unveil
an ugly truth the country is willing to
bring the world to the brink of war and
threaten to use its nuclear arsenal just
in order to defend its terrorists the
sheer thought of such a totally reckless
behavior should horrify all of us in a
recent interview with BBC the Pakistani
ammonia foreign minister himself
accepted that the government of Pakistan
is in contact with Jaya Mohammed
exposing the country's depletions
rhetoric visible terrorism India has
also mounted an intensive campaign
globally to ensure that the world
community pushes Pakistan to dismantle
the terror infrastructure and support to
terrorists
all right we're cutting across to the
British House of Commons the brexit
debate is on remember this is ahead of a
crucial vote that lawmakers will be
taking on the Brick City let's listen it
and the Attorney General knows it in
these circumstances despite any
assurances about a temporary nature of
the backstop the reality is that it can
endure indefinitely 92 days after the
prime minister abandoned the first
meaningful vote in this Attorney
General's view the legal risk remains
unchanged mr. speaker what the Attorney
General was asked to do and what the
Prime Minister promised in this house on
the 29th of January to change the text
of the withdrawal agreement simply isn't
possible he's a lawyer he isn't a
magician doesn't this whole episode of
recent weeks show that when national
leadership is required this Prime
Minister as always puts party before
country
[Applause]
mr. speaker the Honorable gentleman asks
me about my opinion well he knows that
my opinion is that there is no ultimate
unilateral right out of this meant out
of this arrangement the risk of that
continues but the question is whether it
is a likelihood politically I have to
say mr. speaker that one thing we didn't
hear from the Honorable gentleman is
what the blame of got party's position
was on the back stop do they accept the
back stirrup
do they think it's a good thing and if
they think it's a good thing why on
earth are they criticizing it or is it
just the usual political opportunism
that one expects to hear
and let me say to the Honorable
gentleman he says to me there's nothing
new in this agreement that is not so and
some of the authorities that he has
quoted are saying it this morning there
are material new obligations for example
in relation to alternative arrangements
there is a heavy emphasis now upon a
swift and expedited track to negotiate
them and it would be unconscionable if
having made that emphasis having said
the times of the essence the European
Union simply refused to consider or
adopt reasonable proposals relating to
alternative arrangements that is new
what this document does is address the
risk that we could be kept in the back
stop by the bad faith and deliberate
manipulation of the Union and what this
does is make significant reductions in
that risk mr. speaker so I say to the
Honourable gentleman it would be a good
thing if we could hear from the Labour
Party just occasionally more than just
political shenanigans but some sincere
some sincere engagement with the real
issues that this withdraw an agreement
now raises the question now Mr Speaker
is do we assume our responsibilities as
a house and allow not only this country
yearning as it is for us to move on but
the entire continent of Europe and to do
that mr. speaker the time has come now
to vote for this deal
[Applause]
Duncan Smith mr. speaker can I first of
all welcome my right alerted friend to
his place he has shown absolutely that
he is what he should be an independent
advisor to the government and I
congratulate him for that for that is
exactly what he should be can I ask him
this particular question given the
clarity of his advice as he will know
that I and others have spent some time
looking and working on alternative
arrangements I would like to clarify
exactly what force he thinks that those
would be as he said just now that they
have an obligation to consider and/or
adopt such proposals if made in a
reasonable way how does that square with
his paragraph 16 where he says it would
be highly unlikely that the United
Kingdom to take advantage of the
remedies available to it if such a
breach under the would role would even
occurred speaker my right honourable
friend has by paragraph 16 wrong if I
may respectfully say the the what it
says was I advised in the past that that
was so what I now considered at part a
paragraph 17 is that the binding
provisions of this joint instrument and
the content of the declaration reduced
the risk that we would be held
involuntarily and by bad faith why
because these new provisions make it
easier facilitate an effective claim to
the arbitrator that that conduct is
being exhibited and those are cumulative
I say that my right honourable friend if
one has to look at the agreement as a
whole the instrument as a whole if one
puts it all together as a whole one sees
that is promises to go on for a while
will of course get you an update on what
exactly comes out of that crucial debate
but for now let's turn our attention to
elsewhere in the West the New York Times
has done it again
the American newspapers latest article
on the pole vomit terror attack is an
example of how Western media misleads
readers and tries to influence the
narrative when it comes to India the
headline described the pol vomit terror
attack which killed no less than 40
Central
police force men an explosion it said
port in India's election season an
explosion interrupts for this slump and
quote Indians worldwide called out the
newspaper for its pious writing and said
that the article was actually an
unsubstantiated opinion piece rather
than a factual report the online outrage
finally forced the New York Times to
change the headline but they simply
replaced the word explosion with the
word bombing but this isn't the first
time that the New York Times has spun
stories against India an article on the
dogfight between Indian and Pakistani
warplanes on March 3rd had come under
sharp criticism as well the article
questioned India's capability of waging
war following the aerial clash between
India and Pakistan most importantly the
article left out the fact that an Indian
Air Force mig-21 bison shut down a US
manufactured f-16 in fact we ons
political editor Kartika Sharma spoke
with the BJP general secretary RAM
Madhav on the international medias
narratives on India and the government
listening to what he had to say do you
think that international media treated
the rains were these below code
surgical-strike unfairly not that we
care about it not that we care for the
attrition but yes not just below code
not just the recent terror things the
general tenor of the international media
has been over the last three four years
has been largely negative great
achievements of this government also
have always been projected are thought
to be projected in a very negative and
poor manner I probably think that you
know the the caliber of the reporter who
is reporting from the spot it also
matters in in any given report but as I
said it's so serious
press is an independent institution let
them do their job
but just as press is independent we are
also in
political entity we go to the people
without what I wasn't just a New York
Times headline that was misleading it
turns out that the entire article is
devoid of facts fully researched and
reported here's why the article is
factually inaccurate let's take a look
at the first example the article says
that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's
biggest vulnerability is the economy the
NYT says that India's economy grew 6.6
percent in the most recent quarter and
called it the slowest rate in five years
well that's not true the slowest rate in
five years was 5.7 percent in the first
quarter of 2017 next India was referred
to as the fastest growing economy among
hodor unquote most developed countries
but India is the fastest growing large
economy economy and is going faster than
all and not just most developed
countries thirdly the article claims
that farmers are quote unquote furious
with Prime Minister Modi the article
says and I quote he had promised to
ensure that farmers received prices high
enough to make a profit but export
controls and overproduction have cut
deeply into prices for crops like onions
and potatoes and poor the NYT therefore
conveniently ignores proactive measures
for the farm sector such as minimum
support price at one and a half times
the input cost and the 6,000 rupees
directly credited into the bank accounts
of nearly 120 million small farmers the
article also claims without any facts
figures or numbers that hate crimes
against Dalits have exploded in this
case isolated incidents are being
painted as widespread alienation of
certain groups

Airlines crash the black box of the
aircraft's a digital flight data and the
cockpit video recorder have all been
recovered this could help find answers
that could reveal what led to that
aircraft thrashing the fingers meanwhile
are all pointing and drawing one of the
largest plane manufacturers in the world
the crash plane was the Boeing 737 max 8
the type that has crashed twice in less
than six months now so is the problem
with the plane and by extension with
going
let's explore and understand the story
in five questions question one what
happened on Sunday its European airlines
flight 3:02 crashed it was bound for
Nairobi in Kenya it had left from
Ethiopia's capital addis ababa six
minutes after takeoff the plane lost
contact with the air traffic control
just before that happened the pilot had
sent out a distress call he was cleared
to return to the airport
that never happened now he must tell you
that Addis Ababa and Nairobi are two of
the busiest capitals in East Africa the
cause of the crash is still unclear but
one fact that cannot be ignored is that
this plane was a Boeing 737 max eight
just like the lion airplane that crashed
into the Java Sea in Indonesia last year
in October question 2
how did it happen what we know so far is
that minutes after takeoff the plane
struggling to ascend at a stable speed
within moments it fell from the sky me
and Bischoff to that South is from Nathe
European capital the weather was good
the plane was almost near if your PIN
airlines got this plane in November last
year and reports say three minutes after
takeoff the vertical speed or the rate
at which the plane climbs up was unusual
to fly data recorders from the doomed
plane have been found and more details
are expected in the coming days
question three who is to blame or better
still how can we ask this question may
be the cause of the crash has not been
established we will tell you how
maintenance wasn't a problem routine
checks had not revealed any faults the
pilot wasn't a problem he had flown for
more than 8,000 hours he had an
excellent flying record but make if the
plane could have been a problem the
Boeing 737 max eight many countries have
grounded it following the crash a
question for why this is worrying apart
from the fact that he left hundred and
fifty seven people dead the boiled crash
has sent a
Lahm bells ringing in the global
aviation industry and with good reason
it has never happened that two new
planes that are of the same make and
type have crashed fingers are being
pointed at Boeing investigators will be
looking long and hard at this angle and
finally question number 5 what is Boeing
doing about this so far nothing boeing
has released some routine statements the
investigation is still in its early
stages and so on it has not issued any
new guidance to pilots who are flying
this plane around the world
so there are 300 of them 300 point 737
max 8 planes are in service right now
airlines may not have grounded the
planes but markets have been unsparing
Boeing shares in America tanked by more
than nine percent and this may just be
the beginning so while the investigation
into the crash is under way the family
is that the victims are still trying to
come to terms with the loss the people
who died came from 35 different
countries at least 22 worked for the
United Nations here's the story of those
they left behind no other version of the
truth can console the kin of the victims
who were on board the Ethiopian Airlines
flight 83 0 2 the plane came down within
minutes of taking off
passengers from 35 nationalities were on
board a plane
the air road between Ethiopian capital
Addis Ababa and Kenya's Nairobi is
frequented by employees working for
various United Nations affiliated
agencies at least 22 employees of these
agencies were on that flight one of them
was Chicago an Indian citizen who was a
UN consultant attached to India's
Ministry of Environment Shekhar was
travelling to Nairobi to attend a
meeting of the UN Environment Programme
three other Indian citizens have also
passed away in that crash so among the
most affected as you may expect is Kenya
which had about 32 passengers on board
out of the 149 passages other
nationalities invoked with the number of
passages in the flight were Canada with
18 Canada with 18 China with five sorry
China with 8 neither odds with five
Egypt with six
Ethiopia with nine France UK seven each
India with form Italy with eight and
then we have silver Kia with four in the
USA with eight the other nationalities
who had like one or two passengers on
board but one passenger had a lucky
escape
Emmet Khalid was supposed to board the
Ethiopian Airlines flight eighty three
or two he was traveling from Dubai to
Addis Ababa
but his connecting flight was delayed so
he missed his flight
but Emmitt Khalid did witness the panic
that soon after people around the world
are mourning the loss of all the hundred
and fifty seven victims who were on
board
soon after the news of the crash spread
there was an outpouring of shock and
sadness and social media several world
leaders sent their deepest condolences
to the families of the victims at the

I'm here with the new canon eos RP which
is the latest release and the canon eos
of our lineup
[Music]
it's an incredibly light full-frame
digital mirrorless camera and it is so
small comes in at 485 grams and it has
26.2 effective megapixels so I'm gonna
play around with it for a minute and
give you my first hand impression
[Music]
so I've had a chance to use the camera
now for a few minutes at least and I've
gone through the different new
innovations that they've introduced the
focus wheel is obviously on anything
with these RF lenses and it becomes so
handy to be able to have one dial for
f-stop one dial for shutter speed and
one one dial for ISO that means that
when you're shooting on a manual
settings all the way through it's all
right there mechanically very quick to
change the settings
[Music]
and the autofocus it's so fast
it is very impressive it's like it is
absolutely instantaneous and with 4900
all the focus points I'm not surprised
that it is this path
[Music]
but my first impressions is I'm quite
impressed with just the usability how
user-friendly this camera really is
really lights and it has a flip up
screen so for vloggers this is a pretty
ideal camera let's see what the video
functions are like
[Music]
when it comes to video it's really nice
to see
[Music]
yessuh inbuilt stabilization and it
comes in at a good price point
[Music]
drawback is that the 4k video that it
best shoot is an extra mode you don't
utilize the full size of the full-frame
sensor when it comes to slow motion it
doesn't do 100 FPS it only does 60 all
in all though I'd say it's a pretty
attractive choice anyway because it's
only one like ten thousand for the body
it's one lakh ninety-nine it could go
with the 24-105 kit

I have with me the Samsung Galaxy S 10
plus the phone is here to read the store
shelves in India but we are here with a
full review already so that you have
enough time to contemplate and make a
wise buying decision
[Music]
there's nothing innovative about the
design and aesthetics of the s10 plus
but it still ticks all the right boxes
the phone is lightweight and has a slim
profile it's comfortable to carry around
[Music]
what's interesting is that the 6.4 inch
display on the phone doesn't look
monstrous in fact it easily fits in your
hands also the display is nearly bezel s
and it's curved design adds to the
viewing experience
[Music]
the display on the galaxy s 10 plus is a
treat for the eyes it generates vivid
colors and has a great contrast as you
turn the phone around you find a shiny
glass back which looks elegant and adds
to its premium touch
[Music]
even the camera units are neatly placed
both at the front as well as the real
all in all the design isn't
extraordinary but it's nice
now it's time for the camera this
Samsung is boasting a lot about its
camera so let's put them to different
tests and see how well they perform
[Music]
the camera is one of the key deciding
factors in any phone and in the
flagships it's expected to be the best
so where does the s10 plus this camera
stand in the market the rear camera has
a triple camera setup and here is what
it can do so let's understand it this
way one lens is an ultra wide lens
another is a wide-angle camera and the
third one is a telephoto lens
let's see the difference it can make to
your composition
you can easily choose between the tree
as per your frame interestingly the
ultra wide lens can capture pretty wide
shot
before we move on to its other promises
let's take a look at the results
generated by its camera results uh not
only shop but they're also detailed and
bright
the colors are true to life and not just
during the day the phone performs well
even in low light and soft light
environments as well
but there's more another highlight of
the phone is its light focus feature
while a lot of phones allow you to blur
the background before clicking photos
the Galaxy S 10 plus takes it a step
ahead
you can set the intensity of law and the
color and this permutation and
combination enables you to customize the
frame even more creative ways and it
doesn't end here
here's a slow-mo captured with the s10
plus
[Music]
[Music]
and a time-lapse made with it
[Music]
and your is the video from a moving car
[Music]
[Music]
and weep what about the selfie
they are bright full of details and free
of any kind of distortion
[Music]
other than that the camera includes a
lot of other features so that you can
shoot like a pro
overall the camera gets a good scope
from check it out
[Music]
while the camera manages to please us P
interfaces for food disappoints us a
little I think the interface could have
been designed meter and better and some
of the app icons really need an overall
talking about the performance the face
unlock feature in the phone is fast and
accurate I didn't have to struggle to
unlock the phone with facial recognition
even once during a review period the
battery lasted for a little more than a
day on regular use other features of the
phone include wireless charging stereo
speakers AI support and a faster
processor talking about the price the
phone comes in three variants 128 GB 512
GB and 1 TB prices for the phone start
at 73 thousand nine hundred rupees and
go up to one lakh seventeen thousand
nine hundred rupees and it's time for
the most important question does the new
Samsung flagship justify the high price
tag
[Music]
the phone comes with great upgrades but
doesn't come with any path-breaking
innovation having said that the Samsung
Galaxy S 10 plus is a good package and
can take on leading flagships take it
out recommends you the new warrior phone
from Samson

as International Women's Day the day
once celebrated to commemorate women
struggles for equal rights around the
world it has now evolved into a day
where headlines and arclights
are dominated by commerce there is no
dearth of sales promos from limited
edition products to special discounts
and offers in an in an attempt to trick
women into feeling special for one day
of the year this ignores the vast
majority of women on the planet to
observe the day in a variety of ways
that reflect their concerns and
aspirations the apartment of
advertisements and messages of discounts
and special offers from various brands
and commercial outlets in the name of
making women feel special and cherishing
womanhood that is Women's Day for an
average woman across the globe that
brings to the question when did Women's
Day start first of all why Women's Day
was supposed to be the anniversary of a
strike by working women fighting for
equal rights yes you heard that right
fighting for equality equal wages equal
political rights equal opportunities but
today Women's Day has been reduced in
nothing but a commercial gimmick a day
that brands and outlets used to make
money at the expense of women they posed
to support and once they are done
celebrating women for one whole day in a
year it all goes back to normal the same
gender discrimination oppression
violence against women and what not not
just brands and companies even political
leaders cash in on Women's Day
celebrations they pose with women give
them flowers and gifts all of them with
some awards declare a public holiday but
none of them talk about gender equality
women's emancipation or empowerment

just a holiday it is not about presents
and flowers women across the globe are
still aware of the significance of this
day and some are protesting and raising
their voice to get what they believe is
rightfully theirs we are humans before
we are your sisters before your mothers
before your nieces we are humans first
and so feminism is a very necessary
conversation and we the people in power
who have participated in generous
balance who have done anything to to
perpetrate gender-based violence out to
be a police officer we want to highlight
around the city the women's strike and
the fact that without us the world stops
and that there are no other ways to do
things women around the world don't eat
one day a year to be celebrated they
would much rather have important issues
addressed such as achieving gender
parity women's emancipation and safe
environment for all women across the

good evening everyone the top story on
dispatch though is from Bala coat all
eyes are now on the Bahawalpur
headquarters which is where the JJ
Muhammad operates out of we on has
access the latest visuals of Masood us
as den in Bahawalpur
on your screens is the sprawling
compound which has been the headquarters
of terror ironically this Heartland is
now being guarded by Pakistan's police
force you can see armed policemen
positioned right outside the enormous
steel gates of the compound safeguarding
terror is ironical but the irony
remember is not new to Pakistan and I
believe that has repeatedly been lost on
the country joshan Mohammed is the same
terror group that attacked a convoy of
Indian security forces in Jammu and
Kashmir's Pulwama area the jesh admitted
to loading a vehicle with explosives and
ramming it into a bus ferrying Indian
CRPF personnel 40 Indian soldiers died
and India and Pakistan were almost
brought to the brink of war now rising
tensions between the nuclear-armed
neighbors set alarms off across the
world but it's business as usual in
Bahawalpur where emotions run high in
favor of the Jesse Mohammad the group
wields significant influence over the
locals a fact that is evident from the
manner in which they refer to the terror
group Muslim plan acharya cadets at the
Gazebo questioning i'm non-commissioned
Tomas Miranda Thacker John Daniel Lugo
Camus Eagleton who has a come name a
bill called Pakistan is repeatedly
claimed that it has cracked down on
terror the Imran Khan government says
that it believes in a zero-tolerance
policy on terrorism in fact Pakistan's
counterterrorism agency says that the
government has outlawed 68 militant
groups including the Jesse Mohammad but
this site of a police cover for a UN
death
a terror group tells a rather different
story altogether
vilius pakistani government had promised
to take action but they have not done so
so problem is that it has come back to
haunt Pakistan and not only because of
it it was a great dangers to Pakistan's
own national internal security but also
actually there's always a danger that
they could use Pakistani soil to launch
attack across the border Pakistani
government has taken control of the
Jamaat agava headquarters two days after
banning the Ju D and charity wing the
fillet in sannyas foundation or the FIF
Pakistani authorities have now sealed
the Lahore headquarters of the two Hafiz
Saeed LED outfits as part of its ongoing
crackdown against terror groups in the
country the Pakistan Punjab Home
Ministry has said that they have taken
complete control of the band
jod headquarters in the cities of Lahore
and mereth King now remember just two
days ago local authorities had taken
controls of mosques seminaries and other
institutions run by the Ju D in
Pakistan's capital Islamabad meanwhile a
total of 121 members of banned groups
have so far been taken in to
quote-unquote preventive detention
across Pakistan after sealing the
headquarters of the Jamaat a dhaba in
Lahore Pakistan has barred the Mumbai
attacks mastermind Hafiz Saeed from
delivering the weekly Friday sermon at
the ju d headquarters this is the first
time in years that Syed will not be
delivering the Friday sermon
despite being present in Lahore Syed has
never been stopped from delivering these
prayers now the senior official said
that sides request to be allowed to give
the friday sermon at the mosque was
rejected since the premises had been
sealed hours later Syed went into hiding
he skipped the Friday prayers after he
was denied permission to give the sermon
this is the first time he has skipped
Friday prayers as well
he's always been present at these
congregations despite such takeovers in
the past by Pakistani authorities the
Pakistan government has bought the
Reuters team from going to Java top the
area where India conducted airstrikes on
a je M tariff camp now this area is some
20 kilometers outside of Bala code a
town in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
province Pakistan has blocked Reuters
reporters for a third time in nine days
from visiting the attack site Pakistani
security officials are guarding the side
and have cited security concerns for
denying access the Pakistani military is
press wing has called off visits to the
site twice already
they cited weather and organizational
reasons to deny access an efficient
later claim that's a visit won't be
possible for a while due to security
concerns I must remind our viewers at
this point though that it was the we on
team that was first to be denied access
to java talk they close to where the
Indian Air Force carried out the strikes
on February 26 that was when the IAF
fighter jets entered Pakistani airspace
and dropped bombs on Java top India said
that it hit buildings inside the je
mohamed complex pakistan permitted a
local united nations team to visit bala
code however they were limited to
viewing the forested area where pakistan
claims india struck trees in its
february 26th air strike pakistan had
said that it would allow journalists
access as well to prove its stand that
nothing had been struck by the indian
ships but it seems that it has had a
change of heart and doesn't want
journalists visiting the area at all
this decision comes nearly two weeks
after india conducted a preemptive
aerial operation on terror
infrastructure in bala court however
pakistan has repeatedly denied that
india struck its intended targets
through the air strikes
now in light of similar in tensions
between India and Pakistan China has
said that the two neighbors should
resolve their issues through dialogue
Beijing has asked both sides to exercise
restraint the Chinese Foreign Minister
Wang ji has said that China hopes that
India and Pakistan can transform their
crisis into opportunity but it needs to
be noted that at a time when the world
is taking a stand against terror and
pointedly standing by India and its
fight against the Menace China has once
again shied away from calling out
Pakistan and from asking Imran Khan's
government to act effectively against
terror but in what can be seen as a
balancing act the Chinese Foreign
Minister praised India China ties saying
that the trust between the two countries
had deepened after Prime Minister
Narendra Modi's 2018 meeting with
Chinese premier Xi Jinping in Wuhan he
appeared for India and China to work
together as partners in progress a
historic meeting between President Xi
and Prime Minister Modi in Wuhan created
a new model of high-level interactions
between our two countries it not just
deepened the trust and a friendship
between our leaders but also sets the
direction for our future relations as
two ancient civilizations with a
combined population of 2.7 billion two
large developing countries and

of ending long-standing conflicts
positively
but Hyderabad lawmaker Asaduddin Owaisi
objected to the nomination of Sri Sri in
the panel on the grounds that he is not

making mediation an important part of

stopping by this is a poetry collective
performance there are a few poems to
read pen and paper if you wish to write
oh okay
let's see what people have written
beautiful place beautiful face love is
around peace knows no bound I found
myself in nature's solace nowhere else
I'd rather be
other than this place that's sweet love
on key I hope it remains the same when I
come around beautiful mountains and
trees to have us surround alright
once again I'll lose myself and be sound
alright suppose I should also write
something pen and paper okay hmm land or
reminds me of a dream I once had
standing in tall grass a long time back
somewhere on the edge of the great ice
spear in hand gazelles on my mind and
then I wake and like all childish things
I put the spear aside
[Music]
land aura it's only 300 meters above and
a few kilometers away from Missouri but
it might as well be on the moon it's a
it's a world apart from its more popular
neighbor and that's because Lando is a
Cantonment town all the trees in a
Cantonment town belong to the army which
basically means there's no felling and
which is why you see such a diverse old

Annelle Picasso runs the place is an
old-time land or resident Anil has had
to shift his cheese-making unit to Vera
dune to cater to increase demand for his
cheeses that are then shipped across the
country it's a rite of passage for Anil
whose grandfather he tells me was the
first person to make cheese and not
India almost a century back like his
ancestor Anil still prefers touring and
aging the cheese's in a cellar in
landlord's pool clients
okay so all these will be made by you
huh yeah start I've started not making
about four or five different languages
just to make sure earlier okay now I'm
doing call da edom cheddar god I don't
you have like a predisposition towards
Dutch Jesus then well couple of that
Jesus because they are more palatable to
Indian palate are they really no that's
actually quite an acquired case whereas
0ne ago more for softer and milder
cheating
so this is which this is now this is
Adam that you are having mmm so it's
kind of really mild you know yeah it's a
low-fat cheese as you try this one no
this is this is a go de Gouw so similar
to Adam but potato is more pungent aged
whereas this one try this one this is
Jada three months old Jenna we age it up
to a year you do yeah that's better for
it
well it gets more Funyuns up so that's
what Kapila where did you pick it up how
to make cheese etc well I was in
Switzerland also I spent as a season
there in Switzerland and I was making
cheese there how long everyone that was
about 20 I think about 1516 years back
but before that I was making two zeros
wrong but I learned to make the squeezes
there I really like this cheddar cheddar
is nice this is all this three-month-old
you said it's kind of young right now
yeah my grandfather came here in 1940
but my grandfather mother was already
here he my grandfather fell in love with
her and he married a yeah good she was
from sisters was that oh yeah smart move
that so you can't possibly imagine
living anywhere else I suppose oh no no
not at all right I'm hope to disturb
this is really addictive so I'm going to
take some of I'm rooting one of every
I'm gonna take a wheel unfortunately but
I'll definitely take a slice of voltaic
as chunks small and also have some smoke
god I don't think I can get something
but thank you
[Music]
I did a very interesting story a couple
of weeks back about the caretakers of
the cemetery it's a Hindu family and the
lady's husband has passed away and so
she was talking about how she has
literally well spent the last two or
three decades of her life here and the
children were born and brought up here
and how she would tell them that it's a
garden and not a cemetery so they
wouldn't get scared and she signed off
with one of the finest lines I've ever
heard
she said Marie Giovanni Cobra Stan maybe
toddy to up to berapa yeah but her
father Giovanni say Willem Botha which
roughly translates into I spent my
entire youth in a cemetery now I'm in my
old age and they say old age is even
longer than youth something very
poignant about that anyway I'd hoped to
meet her but I really don't want to go
and disturb people in any case it's bad
luck so I'm gonna get that miss
after the first war of independence in
1857 the the British in India grew
increasingly wary of their safety and
sort of retreated to these little
garrison towns which were easily
defensible land or being amongst them
and it was primarily the British and the
Europeans who lived there before
independence of course and all that
changed after 1947 but the grieves are
still here so many of them are still
buried here and the houses still retain
some of their original Irish Scottish
Welsh names we crossed a shamrock
Allendale a parsonage a number of famous
personalities are believed to have
houses here mr. Ruskin born being among
them I really like mr. bond and I've
read a lot of his work but and I even
toyed with the idea of sort of reaching
out to him but then I read a report
about how he's being high ranked by
tourists who go and you know knock knock
on his door every day and he's just he's
just about had enough of them and I
don't blame him so what I know of him
through his writing is a gentle gentle
soul and I decided I'll just let him be
[Music]
you know I really want to get land or
sandals me they're very popular in fact

Thank You ji
[Music]
Bharath lives in Dehradun and has been
guiding visitors in these parts for over
two decades now we've decided to take a
bit of a trek starting from Everest top
a viewpoint on a hill on the late Sir
George Everest estate it's bitterly cold
this December morning and the wind chill
on the peak makes it downright frigid
but the sunrise is magical for the
pictures make the entire exercise worth
the effort
[Music]
this entire area is part of Sir George
arists estate and his house lies just
below Everest
top the man who Mount Everest is named
after was the surveyor General of India
in 1830 and was awarded a medal from the
Royal Astronomical Society in 1847 he
spent 35 years of his life surveying
India from the southernmost tip all the
way north to Nepal a distance of 2,400
kilometers
his house even though it's still
standing it's in poor shape with
graffiti tags and ardent declarations of
love scribbled on its walls
[Music]
that was a really scenic sunrise up at
the estate yeah but what are we gonna do
now so would you like to go for a walk
definitely wait and this place is called
urban wildlife sanctuary Bharath suggest
we take a trek through the Bennett
wildlife sanctuary toward camp T Falls
the falls
I want to avoid as I've heard the
weekends can get pretty crowded
apparently this region was a popular
picnic spot with the British in pre
independent India
[Music]
okay so the trees most of that is you
can see yeah these are the oak trees
basically but these are oak trees and
you might come to see some harder than
anything maybe it was funny that there's
no pine trees around yeah yeah I've done
put the pine trees or the other side of
the ridge actually on the little higher
ground they are planted actually okay
the pine but these oak our nature oh
yeah these pine trees can really take
over an entire forest sometimes yeah
nothing but pine trees yeah and most of
the part of the the otter account or
some part of the module you can see the
couple the whole region is covered with
the pine forest River in this bridle
path were walking on was in fact built
by Sir George Everest they use mules to
carry heavy survey equipment to the top
of the note Mountain to map the
Himalayas for the great orc of India
survey first though we got to climb a
pretty steep hill called Jamal Debbie
after a local goddess the hill has a
great vantage point to get a view of the
region the note Wildlife Sanctuary is
part of the Raja Dee National Park and
is home to a number of animals including
leopards and bears Barratt assures me
that the likelihood of running into
large animals is miniscule
he urges me to keep an eye out for the
birds bird watchers love this part of
Missouri and there have been sightings
of many rare birds so when we're looking
for though is the emollient quail that
hasn't been sighted in a hundred thirty
nine years but birders haven't given up
hope yet
we didn't really see much wildlife the
weather hasn't been great and the skies
have looked ominous all day I did see
this one Kaito high up hovering in
midair being buffeted by the wind I
don't think we have the ability to feel
freedom the way birds can and I wonder
what they think about their world being
circumscribed by us humans who can't
even fend for themselves in the wild let
alone fly
imagine being expected to confine
yourself to a sanctuary when you can
take off and fly wherever you please
again I find myself questioning or
arrogance at claiming this world for
ourselves with no thought to all our
animal friends who also inhabit the
earth 2018 what a year it's been Johanna

another terrorist attack has rocked
Jammu and Kashmir today a grenade blasts
at one of the busiest bus stands in
German the police says his bull
Mujahideen was behind it one teenager
was killed 30 others have been hurt
this comes exactly three weeks after the
terrorist attack in Kashmir is Pulwama a
manhunt was launched immediately after
the strike the attacker has been caught
initial rounds of questioning he has
confessed to his crime his name is
Yasiin Javed but his son of Javed a
McNutt resident of Canberra Dasan he is
also known by the name of Iran in the
preliminary interrogation he has
revealed that he was tasked to throw
this grenade by the district commander
of Hezbollah Mujahideen in Colgan by the
name of Farooq I'm a part alius Umar
meanwhile the Pakistan government
continues to drag its feet on Masood
Azhar on Tuesday we on had reported the
Interior Ministry of Pakistan has
recommended the arrest of the Joshi
Mohammed chief the ball was in the court
of Prime Minister Imran Khan and it's
still there
he has taken no decision or he's not
been given a signal by his military
masters now sources in the Pakistan
government say that the Prime Minister
wants to consult opposition leaders and
more importantly defense Chiefs before
he can decide of course he wants to
consult with the defense Chiefs his
global PR effort meanwhile is already
crumbling the government of pakistan
said that it is cracking down on terror
but it continues to shield terrorists
terrorists like half his side Pakistan
has blocked the United Nations from
interviewing half his side the
mastermind of the 26/11 terror attack in
Mumbai some time back Hafiz say it had
moved a proposal he wanted to get
himself removed from it from the United
Nations sanctions list for that purpose
an official from the United Nations must
conduct an in-person interview of half a
site that is
the procedure for D listing that is what
half is Sade wanted so the UN appointed
an independent Ombudsman to evaluate the
plea but the Ombudsman cannot interview
half is safe the Pakistani government is
not allowing him access it has refused
to grant visa to the United Nations
representative as a result of which the
UN has now rejected half aside speak
that should be good news news that India
should welcome but here's the catch
sources told beyond that this Ombudsman
this UN representative had already found
sufficient evidence to keep the ban on
Hoffa safe this recommendation was
endorsed by the United Nations sanctions
committee so the Pakistani government
decided to block the representative to
avoid more embarrassment and to risk
being exposed further these are critical
times Hafiz Saeed remember was banned by
the UN Security Council back in 2008
this was right after the terrorist
attack in Mumbai in 2017 Hafiz Saeed
filed an appeal with the United Nations
through Allah Hall based firm he could
file a UN appeal while he was still
under house arrest in Pakistan so much
for crackdown meanwhile the focus
remains on the other big terror
mastermind in Pakistan muscle desert we
have no doubt about his outfit the JJ
Mohammed's role in terror attacks in
India but for those who have here is a
clinching answer and this answer comes
from none other than pervez musharraf
former president and army chief of
pakistan when General Musharraf was
president JJ Mohammed was routinely used
to attack India Musharraf has said it in
so many words himself he was giving a
telephonic interview to a Pakistani
Channel the clip has gone viral because
here but ways Musharraf is revealing
Pakistan's worst kept secret he has
confirmed the tyre between the
government and terrorist groups the
question then is if it bothers Jenny
Musharraf so much if it pricks his
conscience why did he not break this
nexus when he was in par when he was
president when he was army chief
why did Musharraf not take action
against the terror outfit during his
tenure he was asked this question and
this was his response
the general stumbles Amano Walter give
me somebody intelligent very involved
picks potato rassa between India and
Pakistan Pakistan me bond rhetorical
already I'm with the crew already eaten
terracotta silty rose the marimba
crewmen who still remained in on it
Oscar very neatly Oh Danny bean thank
you he did not insist he says Musharraf
stance is in line with most Pakistani
heads of state Bush Tara create
terrorist sanctuaries in Pakistan and
when they hurt you blame India Musharraf
statements are particularly bizarre
because in the same breath he also says
that the JJ Mohammed tried to kill him
he says he was the target of at least
two assassination attempts by the Jesse
Mohammed it's a bit hard to digest which
head of state will not act against a
group that tries to kill him forget head
of state which individual in his right
mind will do nothing against a group
that tries to kill him
you cannot be in cool major get around
be a terrorist organisation in order to
make what we heard attack here to also
buggy to the other you terrorist
organisation here or do you get a love
car white buoy on a tie I'm very happy
end
so now belatedly General Musharraf is
welcoming reports of a crackdown on the
JJ Mohammed the crackdown which is also
farce but at least this interview has
again put on record
the government's confluence with
terrorists now here are a few questions
that come to mind after hearing general
sheriff's comments the gist of this
interview is this one that successive
governments in Pakistan have failed to
take action against terrorist outfits
because they work with Pakistan
intelligence agencies to attack India if
a former Pakistani president confirms
this what should India do take action
and if the Indian government takes
defraction against terrorism in Pakistan
should Pakistan not welcome India's
actions if it really is a peaceful
country like its Prime Minister Imran
Khan caves point number two the timing
of Musharraf comments
Pakistan is on a tight deadline with a
financial action task force they have to
prove that they're stopping terror
funding if Pakistan ruling establishment
cannot take action race against outfits
like the Jerry Muhammad should
institutions like the F ATF show
lenience to Islamabad
point number three if Pakistan's
government intelligence agencies and
terror outfit like GE and work with the
same goals that is to target India
shouldn't India declared Pakistan a
terror state perhaps Imran Khan should
consider taking a deep hard look in the
mirror and answer these questions but
then again they do not need pervez
musharraf to expose them they do a
pretty good job of it themselves for
starters the Pakistan government
administers cannot make up their mind on
some very basic questions is Masood
Azhar in Pakistan does the Government of
Pakistan know his whereabouts we know
the answer to both these questions is
yes but the Imran Khan government is
tying itself up in knots trying to
answer then they got mixed up with
numbers how many Indian pilots did
Pakistan have in its custody last week
first they said to then they said one
now they say three it's incredible they
need an abacus and Austin K makes the
Pakistan key a retaliation man
boardercross kiya unko shoot down Kia or
gibiatti on Azhar to the pilots of our
esata the one leading Pakistan's
Ministry of confusion is none other than
its foreign minister shah mahmud Qureshi
his interviews to global TV stations on
Masood Azhar have made him a
flip-flopper of epic proportions first
mr. khureshi as india to handover proof
he said Pakistan needs proof to arrest
Masood Azhar this was after the Jha
mohammed itself had claimed
responsibility for the pull varma
attacks and yet mr. khureshi wanted
actionable evidence or proof from India
then he referred to Masood Azhar as JM
chief he said Masood Azhar is seriously
unwell and he is not in a position to
leave his house in another interview mr.
khureshi said that the Jha Muhammad is
not responsible for
Kalama attack how did he know he was
asked this question and so mr. khureshi
said on camera that the Jay Z Mohammed
quote-unquote leadership had confirmed
it to him he said the government of
pakistan was in touch with them
mr. curry she further said that people
who are known to jesh claim no
responsibility and in the same breath he
invited india for talks is the
optimistic or is he delusional you
decide let me also tell you that mr.
curry she is not the lone culprit here
Pakistan's army has beaten all in making
u-turns army spokesperson major-general
a similar for says that the JJ Mohammed
does not exist in the country then he
contradicted himself by saying that the
responsibility for the Pulwama attacks
did not come from the JJ Mohammed inside
Pakistan and wait there is more
another u-turn major the four said that
action against JJ Mohammed is not being
taken under anybody's pressure how does
this even work
if the JJ Mohammed does not exist at all
in Pakistan as the army spokesperson
said then who is mr. khureshi speaking
to and who is he referring to when he
says JJ Mohammed leadership again if the
judge does not exist in Pakistan why is
the army spokesperson saying that the
responsibility for pull Varma did not
come from the JJ Mohammed operating
inside Pakistan where is the gesture
Mohammed then and we are not done with
that yet as major the force said if the
JJ Mohammed is prescribed in Pakistan
can the government show the list of
actions taken against it and if Pakistan
is not taking action against anyone
under anyone's pressure why did the
government place 44 members of banned
organizations under preventive detention
yesterday and that list by the way
includes two members of Masood Azhar's
family the head of Jessie Mohammed in
simple words if there are no terrorists
in Pakistan who is the government
cracking down on major The Fool may be a
seasoned soldier but numbers are not a
strong suit soon after the Indian
airstrikes in Bala court he tweeted from
his personal handle that two Indian
aircraft had been shot down inside the
Pakistani airspace one pilot was
arrested two other
in the area that's what he said
fact-check now it was one aircraft and
one pilot wing commander of in London
Bertha man who is now back in India
where are the other two and the missing
aircraft major the food has not answered
and I doubt he will the fact is that
Pakistan has a vested interest in
protecting Masood Azhar which is why he
can hide in plain sight
just like Osama bin Laden did in
Abbottabad Masood Azhar safe house is in
Bahawalpur that's in the punjab province
of pakistan he lives inside
Jamia Masjid Subhan Allah that's his
address it's a mosque it is along
Pakistan's National Highway five it is
minutes away from Pakistani military
academy this complex itself is believed
to be spread across three acres reports
say that it has several modern
facilities including a state-of-the-art
gymnasium and a swimming pool an f6
fighter plane is on public display
barely a kilometer away from Masood
Azhar safe house just eight kilometres
away is the Bahawalpur cantonment it is
home to Pakistan's 31 Corps this is a
unit of the Pakistani army that
reportedly has around 30,000 troops
muscle desert it was born in Bahawalpur
this is his hometown when the Jha
Muhammad was prescribed by the United
Nations in 2002 Masood Azhar started a
trust to raise funds for his terror
activities and reports say that he used
the very same money to build the
state-of-the-art the state-of-the-art
safe house some other reports suggest
that a secret nuclear facility of
Pakistan is also quite close to muscle
vessels fortress now let's tell you
about what's behind those walls this
complex is used to recruit and train
terrorists recently the Pakistan
government claimed that it has taken
control of this compound but has nothing
to show that it has curbed the
activities of the JJ Mohammad are there
to crackdown or rather there to secure
Masood Azhar and his outfit it is well
know that Masood Azhar enjoys the
support of the Pakistani military and
the security establishment experts
believe that the resurgence of Masood
Azhar would not have
been possible without the aid and
support of the Pakistani army and the I
side so basically the architect of the
pull Varma at AK is living in a safe
house that is behind high concrete walls
and protected by Pakistan's military and
security establishment who does this
remind you of Osama bin Laden perhaps
the al-qaeda boss had a similar safe
house in Abbottabad also in Pakistan he
was found and killed within nine minutes
the Americans carried out the operation
can India do the same that's the
question we are asking tonight can India
send troops to gun down Masood Azhar
inside his fortress the prime minister
gave a hint I became you to two novel
Aquila jobs articles I am the polymer
ghee dr. haataja by Yana receipt and I
am garment goose Kumari me with the
sitaji cursive para maana here mooted
team demerit history
[Applause]
Finance Minister of India was more
specific listening to what our own
Jaitley said after India conducted the
Bala code strike a preemptive strike
deep into Pakistani territory with a
Hideki jabber the United States enabled
seen avert about say Osama bin Laden :
okay um Nagar something you cable-car
punahou TT each OT t it frustration
thought they not shopping at the movies
above a political declarations aside can
india really carry out such an attack
let's assess - the rhetoric with the
bala quote operation india has proved
that it has the capability to hit deep
inside Pakistan
Mallicoat is around 65 kilometers from
the line of control
Indy I use the Mirage 2000 in this
mission a jet that travels at speeds of
more than 2,000 kilometers per hour and
that speed it will take just a few
minutes for
Indian jet to reach ba hovel pool where
Masuda there is believed to be living
Bahawalpur is nearly 150 kilometers from
the Indian border
similarly the capital of Pakistan
Islamabad is a little over 100
kilometers from the border and the
garrison city of Rawalpindi the seat of
the Pakistani military is nearly 133
kilometers if Indian Jets can drop bombs
in Bala code can they not do the same in
Baja Ville pull what will it take to
carry out a mission like this India
could deploy its own Special Forces we
are talking about the Indian Navy's
Marine Commandos and Marcos the elite
Special Force of the Navy earlier this
year the Indian government had also
cleared plans to raise an elite unit of
commandos drawn from all the services
they will be placed under the Armed
Forces Special Operations Division the
special wing will be built on the lines
of the US Special Operations Command or
Navy SEALs who took out Osama bin Laden
we spoke to Major General Gigi the way
they - but to better understand what
such a mission will take we have created
a inter service organization in which we
are going to learn Special Forces of all
the three beings that have Army Navy Air
Force under one organization which will
be commanded by the to stargell Major
General under the headquarter under the
energies or headquarter integrate
different stuff
so therefore this type of operation will
be a you know combined operation we had
all these three services Special Forces
will be involved because it will require
you know as I said either aerial
insertion or ground insertion then
hitting the target and you know coming
back from the target many other defense
experts we spoke to have the same
opinion that India is very much capable
of conducting a complex operation just
like the Americans did in Abbottabad but
they all point to one crucial factor
actionable and real-time intelligence
such a mission they say cannot be
successful without precise intelligence
you can just take some of the Laden's
case in point
you see that special operation was done
on 2nd May 2011 what it involved was
three things firstly building very
accurate interiors then inserting the
forces or to the target and then
exfiltrating means exiting from the
target the first building intelligence
is one of the most important component
you'll be surprised that this operation
intelligence gathering started way back
in 2007
so almost four years that it took to
build up the intelligence now until you
have very specific intelligence and
real-time intelligence means that at
that point of time when you engaging the
target the target you are giving that
individual or that person must be
present unfortunately the debate in
India is still over Bala court in
election season there's much politics
and a growing demand for proof and those
who are looking for proof should
consider this story from America going
forward the CI will not have to report
the casualties caused by air strikes the
American president has revoked an old
policy he's basically giving his
security personnel greater latitude to
conduct airstrikes less scrutiny more
freedom as expected several rights
groups have criticized Donald Trump's
move they say it reverses a hard-fought
effort for transparency and
accountability in drone strikes the
development comes at an interesting time
it follows a growing demand in India for
the government to provide proof of
casualties resulting from the Bala code
attack a number of political parties and
members of the public have accused the
government of using the strike as
campaign fodder ahead of the general
election they want evidence of the
damage inflicted on the Jaya Muhammad
terror camps to be made public that's
all very well transparency we understand
is the bedrock of democracy there should
be transparency but even transparency
has its limits especially when it comes
to safeguarding strategic secrets there
has to be a line there needs to be a
line and
secrecy is one of the most critical
tools of national defense the preemptive
strikes in balla court were based on
actionable intelligence the government
has said so security forces have said so
if critical details about the operation
come out they could reveal the source of
the information
this could compromise national security
interests the Indian Air Force has in
fact shared proof of the Bala Court
airstrike with the government this was
after a report by News Agency Reuters
used images from commercially available
satellites to discredit the Indian
operation the interne Air Force has
rejected these claims by Reuters it says
Indian Jets had dropped precision bombs
that hit a jesh terror camp end of story
it is now up to the government to decide
if it wants to share the evidence or not
we do hope better sense prevails on all
sides we also hope that politics over
national security stops not only does it
hurt national interest it is an insult
to those who died in the service of the
nation and those who continue to
safeguard the nation tonight away from
the political bickering we want to bring
you the story of some fierce women who
stayed calm and faced terror head-on in
pool bomber
at least 40 crpf personnel were killed
on February 14th and Pulwama in one of
the deadliest terror attacks on security
forces the bus carrying martyred Jevons
was part of the Cornwall comprising 78
vehicles of Central Reserve Police Force
power of the corn boy was also the CRPS
battalion of women who witnessed the
horrifying blast and it's gruesome
consequences at close quarters the hot
bharata maca was the capybara sorry
Gilliam victim are geeky look take them
perfect sir or Joe it's a dead body

no dynast
can claim to be above the Supreme Court
or the back a 3200 word long sermon on
privacy from facebook feed that the
company's CEO Mark Zuckerberg says
Facebook plans to encrypt conversations
in its messaging services to ensure
privacy suddenly Mark Zuckerberg sees
privacy as a significant aspect of
Facebook's future but should his
promises be taken seriously at all after
all Facebook CEO has done nothing but
apologised whenever his firm is pulled
up for privacy violations
he has Mark Zuckerberg new business plan
he calls it his vision sure that was a
big mistake
it was my mistake and I'm sorry a
long-winded poster convey one simple
message Facebook CEO says that he wants
to convert the social media platform
from a digital equivalent of a town
square to a digital equivalent of the
living room
in a nutshell Zuckerberg is now batting
for privacy
he plans to pivot the platform towards
encrypted private messaging
it'll be a fundamental change in the way
Facebook works
besides end-to-end encryption Zuckerberg
plans to eliminate the permanence of
messages lower retention time of
messages and store less metadata about
message content in a blog post
Zuckerberg says that in future
communication will shift from public to
private where people can be confident
that what they say to each other stays
secure the same confidence that
platforms like Facebook have destroyed
we didn't take a broad enough view of
our responsibility and that was a big
mistake
it was my mistake and I'm sorry but
should Zuckerberg be taken seriously at
all he has a history of breaking privacy
promises the anonymous login feature
that he hyped up so much in 2014 never
saw the light of day and the clear
history button was announced 10 months
ago no user has seen that feature so far
but if at all for a change
Facebook sticks to its promise and makes
a shift towards privacy what could
happen a the company will need to find a
new business model the newsfeed would
become redundant and so the lifeblood of
Facebook advertisements will be out of
the window be Facebook will face a ban
in many countries the moment it ships to
enter an encryption
Russia and Vietnam want data to be
stored locally for law enforcement
reasons and see law enforcement issues
will hurt the social media giant because
threats of terrorism and misinformation
will become harder to track Zuckerberg
has run from pillar to post to apologize
over privacy breaches including the
Cambridge analytical saga
News on Facebook is unreliable clickbait
is the name of the game and ironically
journalists who are hired to check the
spread of fake news don't believe in
Facebook themselves innumerable
instances of user data breach and
profiling have haunted Facebook users
are beginning to feel the fatigue this
announcement from Zuckerberg could be
similar to his grand pronouncements in
the past most of which he hasn't kept
and to top it off the tech giant says
that he will not store data in countries
which have a track record of violating
privacy and freedom of expression now
believe it or not it's the CEO of
Facebook
who's saying all this the same face book
that sold user data to a third party the
same Facebook that is accused of
influencing election campaigns and the
same Facebook which can't check the
spread of fake news misinformation mob
lynching and many more

telecom giant Huawei has sued the US
government in a district court in Texas
Huawei said that the law limiting its
business in the u.s. is unconstitutional
it is challenged section 8 8 9 of the
National Defense Authorization Act this
act was brought in by Donald Trump it
bars American agencies and contractors
from procuring Huawei's equipment and
services it limits Juarez business lobby
says this act as an attempt to blacklist
the company in America a nine is
unconstitutional in its singing out of
far way by name but at least in it
damaging its reputation and denying it
anyway to clear his name and escape
sanction its attack on highway is
purposeful and planet Eve is based on
numerous false unproven and untested
position contrary to the statues promise
who is not on the contoured or
influenced by the Chinese government
moreover Huawei has an excellent
security recorder and program the
robbery case is a tipping point in the
ongoing confrontation between the US and
China the last year alone saw us
imposing import tariffs on Chinese goods
and China retaliating with import
tariffs on US goods basically a
full-blown tariff wall between America
and China 2018 ended with the arrest of
Huawei CFO among Wong's ooh in Canada at
the request of America man Wong who is
accused of bank fraud wire fraud and
violating US sanctions on Iran men's
arrest is just one part of American
action against Huawei the u.s. accuses
this company of spying and data theft
the u.s. believes that Huawei is closely
linked to the Chinese state several
other countries have followed suit and
that has prompted Huawei to hit back
Naomi went to control [ __ ] I object to
what the US has done this kind of
politically motivated Act is not
acceptable the u.s. likes to sanction
others whenever there's an issue they'll
use such methods we object to this but
now that we've gone down this path we'll
let the court settle it the company has
already sued Canada and now taken the US
government to court crucially why we
continues to get the backing of the
Chinese government

Bobby says that there is no proof of any
wrongdoing by the company but experts
say that Robbie's lawsuit could get
dismissed that is because courts in the
US are generally reluctant to
second-guess national security determine

in a

judges have to decide I have decided to
take Juarez case if they decide to do it
then the Trump administration could be
asked to submit proof of spying by this
company the wari case could continue for
months or even years but more than this
specific case the issue threatens to
derail the trade ties between the top
two economies in the world such a
prolonged trade spat would hurt global
economy and value chains u.s. President

to ease trade tensions but this lawsuit
could hurt the prospects of a truce

the relationship between China and

in addition China has also arrested
several Canadian diplomats and accused
them of stealing state secrets
if proved such a crime carries severe
punishment in China the Canadian
diplomats under arrest could be used as
pawns in this bar game between America
and China it is clear that the Huawei
case will be a significant factor in the
ongoing trade dispute between the US and
China the story is far from over
now this was a flop summit it yielded no
deal but that's not how the North Korean
government sees it at least that's not
how the North Korean government wants
its people to see it so the government
has released a film on Kim Jong Un's
second summit with US President Donald
Trump the summit that just concluded in
Vietnam this film - some important
details our next report tells you what
the movie doesn't mean about your
daughter on skis or pushing for young
nerds Agha
North Korea's state TV has aired a
documentary glorifying Kim Jong Un's
recent visit to Vietnam the 78 minute
documentary that followed Kim's 11-day
train journey to Hanoi for the summit's
short the highlights of Kim's 9 they
stay in the Vietnamese capital shivering
on Han we share you know scooting
million dong including his exchanges
with trumpets wizard to North Korean
embassy and the tour of tourism and
industrial sites by his top aides the
strictly controlled North Korean state
media however very conveniently omitted
the phase nuclear negotiations with
President Donald Trump's Hanoi years old
jungle care from Yong Hwa's humble
Russian gasolina the film features the
two leaders smiling and shaking hands
even after they ended the summit without
a deal and saying they had agreed to sit
face to face more often and continue
constructive dialogue do you have junk
food and gone mica Pompeo the
documentary also cited Kim saying North
Korea and US must put an end to their
decades-long animosity and
confrontations but there was just no
mention about the lack of an agreement
following the summit the Hanoi summit
broke down due to disputes over how far
North Korea was willing to limit its
nuclear program and the degree of u.s.
willingness to ease sanctions Washington
and Pyongyang blame each other for the
talks break down but both sides still
leave the door open for future
negotiations I want to keep the
relationship and we will keep the
relationship we'll see what happens over
the next period of time but in the
meantime we'll be talking Mike will be
speaking with his people North Korean
documentaries are typically propaganda
generating Kim Jong Un's
the subject of a strong personality cast
among the not 25 million people some
observers say omitting the status of the
nuclear talks also shows the North
Korea's hopes to continue negotiations
while cleverly excluding information on
any diplomatic failures that could
damage Kim's leadership predictably much
of the documentary is devoted to
burnishing Kim Jong Un's credentials as
a statesman
and the documentaries release comes at
an interesting time when the news of
North Korea rebuilding a key long-range
rocket site is doing the rounds Bureau

But Should Transparency ...,2019-03-07T17:43:24Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Kax4g2SToc/hqdefault.jpg,"unfortunately the debate in India is
still over Bala court in election season
there's much politics and a growing
demand for proof and those who are
looking for proof should consider this
story from America going forward the CIA
will not have to report the casualties
caused by air strikes the American
president has revoked an old policy he
is basically giving his security
personnel greater latitude to conduct
airstrikes less scrutiny more freedom as
expected several rights groups have
criticized Donald Trump's move they say
it reverses a hard-fought effort for
transparency and accountability in drone
strikes the development comes at an
interesting time it follows a growing
demand in India for the government to
provide proof of casualties resulting
from the Bala Court attack a number of
political parties and members of the
public have accused the government of
using the strike as campaign fodder
ahead of the general election they want
evidence of the damage inflicted on the
jury Muhammad terror camps to be made
public that's all very well transparency
we understand is the bedrock of
democracy there should be transparency
but even transparency has its limits
especially when it comes to safeguarding
strategic secrets there has to be a line
there needs to be a line and secrecy is
one of the most critical tools of
national defense the preemptive strikes
in balla court were based on actionable
intelligence the government has said so
security forces have said so if critical
details about the operation come out
they could reveal the source of the
information
this could compromise national security
interests the Indian Air Force has in
fact shared proof of the bellacourt air
strike with the government this was
after a report by News Agency Reuters
used images from commercially available
satellites to discredit the Indian
operation the internet force has
rejected these claims by Reuters it says
Indian Jets had dropped precision bombs
that hit a jesh terror camp
end of story it is now up to the
government to decide if it wants to
share the evidence or not we do hope

and Kim Jong Un's second meeting on us
Korea peace talks was held in Vietnam
South Korea's spy agency reported that
North Korea has restored part of a
missile launch site experts believe the
North Korea appears to be rebuilding a
key long-range rocket site it promised
to scrap as a possible sign of its
displeasure over the collapse of
denuclearization talks at the second
summit here's a report north korea has
an incredible brilliant economic future
if they make a deal but they don't have
any economic future if they have nuclear
weapons it's really a bad thing for them
it was a clear message to North Korea
give up the pursuit of nuclear weapons a
message that has clearly not been taken
seriously by the Kim jong-un regime a
recent briefing by South Korea's spy
agency noted that North Korea has
started restoring structures at its
Sohee satellite launching station on the
launch path to support cranes are
observed at the building walls have been
erected and a new roof added at the
engine tests and it appears that the
engine support structure is being
reassembled two cranes are present and
construction material is spread across
the stands April the North had
previously begun dismantling the
rail-mounted transfer building on the
launch pad along with the engine test
and last year this dismantling started
after the first summit held between US
president Donald Trump and the North
Korean leader King John cool in
Singapore recent commercial satellite
imagery however showed that efforts to
rebuild these structures have resumed
recently sometime between 16 February
and 2nd March
this news comes just days after talks
for a denuclearization deal between
Trump and North Korean leader kim jong
hoon and annoy had ended up dropping
differences had arisen between the two
leaders on how far north korea was
willing to limit its nuclear program and
the degree of u.s. willingness to ease
sanctions we have to have sanctions and
he wants to denote but he wants to just
two areas that are less important in the
areas that we want we know that we know
the country very well believe it or not
we know every inch of that country and
we have to get what we have to get
because that's a big that's a big give
despite the disagreement both sides
attempted to gloss over the rift noting
that they had parted ways amicably with
President Trump even showing great faith
in the North Korean leader a German Kim
promised me last night
his regardless he's not going to do
testing of rockets and nuclear I'm not
going to do testing so you know I trust
him and I take him at his word I hope
that's true
far from what Trump believes experts are
of the view that the rebuilding of the
nuclear site is an act of retribution by
Kim after Trump refused to lift the
sanctions though the so he large
facility is also used by North Korea to
launch satellites and other technology
missions recent developments on the site
are perceived to be forgetting the Trump
administration's attention and possibly
to bring Washington back to the
negotiating table

that it's been ten years since the first
one was reported without any cases in
between and therefore there are a number
of questions that were asked as to what
was special about the first case was it
a patient factor that was not repeatable
or was it something about the regimen or
was it the radiation that he had and
also so could it be repeated I think
it's important to have to have repeated
it potentially there is already activity
in the field of modification of cells by
gene editing and so editing or modifying
white blood cells that are the targets
of HIV is very attractive and it's in
development we just need to optimize it

transport cargo we visited one of the
world's largest international cargo
airlines Emirates sky cargo in Dubai the
sky cargo facility ships out
pharmaceuticals to more than 150
countries and this requires a high level
of expertise when it comes to moving
pharmaceuticals time is of the essence
as is the temperature control the
products must be delivered on time and
intact which is a big challenge for all
transporters Farmar is a very focused
product for us it uses very specific
temperature control regulations to move
pharmaceuticals we've reached out to our
customers and we saw the growing demand
for pharmaceuticals and it so it's a big
a growing demand across and especially
across our network into developing
countries the temperature sensitive
cargo needs to be handled carefully

freight operations it is from here the
products are shipped in and out of the
country
if you take India for example India by
far is the largest farmer origin that we
fly pharmaceuticals out of have a
another airport just up the further up
the country DWC so we use we use trucks
to move the pharmaceuticals to and from
the passenger and traitor so we can
connect either from a passenger to
freighter and from freighter to
passenger all in under five hours so for
example if you take a shipment coming in
on a freighter from Mumbai we land in

summarize the Trump Kim summit in Hanoi
in simple words the summit ended without
any agreement the two sides were far
apart on key issues disarmament of
nuclear weapons and relief from
sanctions Donald Trump just walked away
from it and the reason he cannot accept
North Korea's demands to lift all US
sanctions basically they wanted these
sanctions lifted in their entirety and
we couldn't do that they were willing to
dhenuka large portion of the areas that
we wanted but we couldn't give up all of
the sanctions for that so we continue to
work and we'll see but we had to walk
away from that particular suggestion we
had to walk away from that Trump still
says that the talks were productive and
that Kim jong-un is quite a character
and a guy but Trump did not come all the
way to Vietnam to give a certificate to
the North Korean dictator did he left we
spent pretty much all day with Kim
jong-un who is he's quite a guy and
quite a character and I think our
relationship is very strong but at this
time we had some options and at this
time we decided not to do any of the
options and we'll see where that goes
but it was it was a very interesting two
days and I think actually it was a very
productive two days but sometimes you
have to walk so where does this lead to
there's no indication that the two
leaders will sit for another summit but
Donald Trump is in no rush to strike a
deal it seems he wants to strike the
right deal and there is no clarity on
what the so-called right deal is North
Korea wants to escape the sanctions and
they have promised to denuclearize
promises that the country has not kept
for decades and Donald Trump's statement
after the abrupt end to the talks is
more ambiguous than the summit itself
can you just give us a little more
detail did you get into the question of

is the new phone that we will be 52 and
we've all used on camera specific so I
just want to the sport of
it's part two for the camera
[Applause]
I can't remember I can't find it left
front camera there is a front camera
trusty cameras in the back
oh oh it's popping up on the camera pops
out
[Music]
one thing is clear the front camera is
one of the three highlights of the vivo
v15 tool and it's just one about the
design and the unusual camera placement
in fact the camera sensor comes with a
high megapixel count but the question is
does it deliver as much as it claims
let's find out
this is not the first time that Devo has
come up with a phone with a pop up front
camera last year this feature was
introduced in the vivo necks for the
highlight of the Nuvi 15 row is that its
front camera comes with a 32 megapixel
sensor as you enable the front camera
the shooter elevates in less than a
second while that could be speculations
that the camera might behave erratically
and it might not pop up sometimes but
that's not the case
throughout the review period we didn't
face any problem with a pop of feature
of the front camera we have to say that
this innovative design makes the display
look neat the camera looks like catching
but how well does it perform here are
some of the results taken with the front
camera of the Revo v15 crow
[Music]
the results are impressive they not only
bright but capture the minutest details
now follow through your camera the phone
fax the chuckling camera setup with the
most of a I powered software features
before we get into the specification
let's take a look at the results clearly
the phone captures two two light colors
and the photos look sharp
[Music]
even in portrait mode the camera
effectively blows the background and
produces great results
[Music]
we find the camera results to be of
great quality
[Music]
besides the porch camera offers a suite
of features and much to customize your
photos well the camera gets a good score
from take it out but what about the
design and aesthetics it's an all screen
phone with a seamless display the
display is viewable even under direct
sunlight the phone is neither too heavy
or too light but it's comfortable to
hold and operate who we have to say that
the slightly khadi design puts us off a
bit the heavy glossy finish does not
look premium for the vertically
placement of the real cameras does make
the design stand out
[Music]
quite like other phones the we will be
15 tour comes with a face unlock feature
it's simple you set up the face unlock
on the we 15 pro 1 setup it unlocks the
phone instantly we didn't face any lags
also the quick charging feature is
satisfactory for instance its battery
reaches from 25 to 80 percent in nearly
30 minutes before neither slowdown not
stuttered during the time we spent with
it or we believe that the user interface
can be improved it can be made a little
simpler and neater and it's time for the
most important question show you whether
we will reach if control or not rise at
29,000 990 rupees the phone is value for
money but it has its own share of
drawbacks
so as the design is not a constraint and
you can manage with a not so neat user
interface you can opt for it we do think
that there are better alternatives
available in the same price range

MY5TDtGXRc8,iRobot Roomba i7+ review: A new-age Robotic Vacuum Cleaner,"The vacuum cleaner includes cutting-edge innovations, but can it really clean up the mess? The World is One News, WION ...",2019-02-26T08:29:32Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MY5TDtGXRc8/hqdefault.jpg,"[Music]
iRobot has come up with a new vacuum
cleaner in India the Roomba i7 plus well
the vacuum cleaner promises a lot of new
smart features but the question is how
effectively do they perform check it out
to find out the Roomba I 7+3 look like
its predecessors but it's easier to use
and in many ways motto setting up the
vacuum cleaner is simple enough
download the home app on your phone or a
tablet and pair it with Roomba i7 plus
and voila with this app you can get the
room by the world from the comfort of
your couch it also allows you to
schedule and keep a track of the
cleaning cycles but the real fun begins
once it's set up one of the USPS of the
vacuum cleaner is that it can map your
home with ease and adapt as per the
floor plan which means you can specify
your bedroom living room study kitchen
and bathrooms and Roomba can detect all
of them
[Music]
in other words you can instruct Roomba
to clean a specific area or a room like
this if I want to clean my bedroom I can
just go to the app and select bedroom it
receives the command viola Slee look
it's my bedroom and gets down to the
task at hand
[Music]
okay now that it's done I would like to
clean my living room
[Music]
it can navigate my home by keeping a
track of the areas covered and those
that are yet to be clean
[Music]
once it has understood the floorplan it
moves around the house smoothly but do
note that setting up the floorplan for
the vacuum cleaner requires time and
patience
it could take around 20 minutes to an
hour to map your floor
[Music]
and what is even more interesting to see
is that how it disposes the collected
dust and
the Roomba i7 plus takes care of the
cleaning from start to finish which
means it doesn't only collect dust but
it also manages to dispose it without
any human intervention
once it's a scheme the floor and is back
to its home base the vacuum cleaner
automatically empties the garbage into a
built-in back the garbage bag traps dirt
and dust so that the particles don't
escape into the air the canister the
base can store up to 30 loads before
needing to be emptied saving you the
effort of emptying it out regularly the
user is notified when it's finally full
and now comes the most important
question is it value for money or not
the Roomba i7 plus is promising but at
eighty nine thousand nine ninety rupees
we think it's slightly overpriced the
additional drug disposal bags are pretty
expensive too they're available at 1006
ninety rupees for a pack of three bags
we wish the company had Christ bought
the vacuum cleaner and the garbage bags
more competitively

of the 2012 garment factory fire one of
the worst fires in the country's history
in November that year a fire ripped
through a clothing factory near Dhaka
killing over a hundred people at least
200 were left injured an investigation
later found it was caused by sabotage
and that plant managers had prevented
victims from escaping but seven years
from then not much seems to have changed

a rather grim picture out of over 2,600
establishments that were inspected less

satisfactory fire safety measures in
particular hospitals across the country
are vulnerable no government hospital in
the capital is equipped with enough fire
safety equipment 97% hospitals in the
country's capital of fire risks the

establishments are fire risks because
private company owners are unwilling to
invest in fire safety equipment and

students can apply through our web
website and then we can go through a
screening we filter them according to
their requirement which is age education
requirement and then put them through a
selection process talk to us about the
planes which are right now pod here and
what are the you know big USBs or
uniqueness of these planes here the
whole concept is started of training
airline pilots so basically looking at
somebody who will go and join the air
land rather than go and join the the
general flying so we've been very
precise on our selection this aircraft
is the service sr22
it's the 6th generation digital cockpit
or glass cockpit it has unique features
that are also close to to an airline and
then when the student finish from this
aircraft they move into the phenom defin
on 100 evie which is an upgrade in
avionics and they also they have the the
jet engines so they can experience the
jet jet engine flying and have flying at
high altitude and here there's a fire
tender also and also an ATC tower as
well correct it's a very very unique
facility we have our own many airport
located at a big airport of Al Maktoum
Airport which is the world's largest
airport we adjacent to to Al Maktoum we
use most of the facility from a maqam
however we have dedicated runway that we
use it's fully lighted it has
the instruments approach on one side
it's a test on dedicated control tower
firefighting facilities and our party
and as you can see the the hangar that
we are at our next stop was the air
traffic control station from where the
movements of these private airplanes is
monitored and coordinated if you look
closely the equipment there controller
has available to achieve this task we
have a a field ground lighting panel a
winner panel showing us the weather
forecast and where the warnings in
traffic monitor that assists the
controller locating the aircraft other
than by visual means and as well a
flight register board that the
controller uses as a situational display
of the perfect that he is controlling
and very important probably the most
important is a voice control switch
that's the main how we manage the ground
to hear air-to-ground and telephone
communications with the aircraft this is
a place from where you can see the
overall the space you can see sky you
can see the runway you can see the
flight training academy as well hangars
also are visible from here it's a place
where there are dedicated disks for
doing that work from where the
communications happen and in case there
is one communication and there is a
failure there there is a backup as well
the Emirates flight training academy has
invested over 39 million u.s. dollars in
a modern fleet of 27 training aircraft
the cadets need to complete at least a
thousand one hundred hours of
ground-based training under 30 hours of
simulator flying and a hundred eighty
five hours of actual aircraft flying
so as my dream to be a pilot and my
family encouraged me to enter this field
and because you have fewer numbers of
female pilots and they
I want to join the school so I applied
for the cadet program and as I joined
this program they trained us to be not
only first officers they trained us to
be
a captain's to sit in the left hand side
hopefully the new flight training
academy will help grow the talent pool
by hundreds of qualified airline pilots
every year",True,en,17294,18,350

special many have asked us why we chose
the city of Dubai India and the UAE
share what has been described as a
comprehensive strategic relationship
with a 3.3 million strong population the
Indian diaspora in the UAE is largest in
the world these are to moderate
countries which share a deeply common
goal of combating extremism and
ideologies of hatred and who better to
grace the summit as a chief guest and
the guest of honor
then his Excellency Sheikh nian Mubarak
a lion he's a cabinet member and
Honorable Minister of Tolerance in the
government of the UAE and we are going
to have him very shortly with us to talk
about what he thinks the future holds
for the India you a relationship and why
this first-of-its-kind summit ladies and
gentlemen marks a new beginning - here
in Dubai as we said beyond is a very
very special initiative it is a channel
that fosters India's thought as we keep
saying it is India's perspective that
we're presenting to the world and when
this channel was envisioned there were
lots of doubts about how we are going to
do it what we plan to do here what is
India's perspective what is India's
narrative and we've tried to address
that in the last two years and we are
trying to take it forward with this
conversation
as we wait for our GPS to arrive I also
want to tell you what we want to achieve
through today's summit as the
editor-in-chief here Sudhir Chaudhary
said that this is going to be a
constructive approach this is not an
effort at one-upmanship we want to talk
we want to create a cogent strategy for
a shared future and this is a region
that houses one-fourth of the world's
population it has a lot of potential
which needs to be unleashed by a
collective effort and today's summit is
an effort in that direction I'm told
that the chief guest is about to arrive
in the meantime I also want to talk
about the India UAE partnership as you
may be aware that Indian Prime Minister
Narendra Modi visited this country in
2015 it was a big moment in this
bilateral relationship the last Indian
prime minister to visit the UAE was mrs.
Indira Gandhi in 1981
so after 34 years an Indian Prime
Minister an indian head of state came to
this country and that key that gave an
impetus that gave a boost to the ties
that these two countries share we have
with us ladies and gentlemen some very
eminent speakers and masters of their
domain who are going to sit and
strategize and discuss what we want to
do next what we can do next and this is
not going to be an easy endeavor because
terrorism whether we like it or not
remains the biggest issue in the
subcontinent in the region of South Asia
as you know one of our sessions today is
going to discuss about about
state-sponsored terrorism and that is a
big question especially in the wake of
what happened in poleramma India is
dealing with some very difficult issues
now some very difficult decisions and so
you could say that the timing of the
summit couldn't have been better for
India to talk to its friends for
representatives of India to talk to its
friends to see where they stand to see
if we have the collective political will
to take on the single biggest issue that
faces all of us state sponsorship of
terrorism and that is something that we
want to address that is something we
want to discuss in fact this region
Afghanistan Bangladesh Sri Lanka we've
all seen more than our fair share of
violence and you know it better than I
because we've served a lot of you have
served in these countries you understand
the issues we face and yet we ask after
70 years of being an independent nation
with a civilization that is thousands of
years old
why is it that we are not being able to
solve the single biggest issue that
India faces what are the options is this
a problem that we will live with for the
rest of our lives or will there be a
solution we hope that today's
deliberation today's consultation is
going to throw up some answers or at
least a framework as to how we need to
approach this governments have come and
gone in India different ideologies
different promises but we continue to
face the same challenges so we want to
discuss today if any government if any
party has a realistic strategy to deal
with what we face state-sponsored
terrorism I work in television and I
could go on and on with what I'm saying
that is what I've been trained to do but
before that before we invite our chief
guest I think it would be it would be
fair for me to stop for a bit and for
you to see a little bit more of what we
do and beyond and and what we're trying
to do

research and intellectual capabilities
that allow for innovation and continued

increase its participation in national
and regional development and in turn and
the global economy and perhaps more
importantly how to develop the leaders

full potential in terms of economic
social and human development

it much faster and I don't have to do it
for the election I've already done a lot
of wall for the election 2020 and the
only reason we're up here talking about
this is because of the election because
they want to try and win in an election

QXJD2E1NVD4,Dji Pocket Osmo Review: Yay Or Nay?,"The new handheld camera from DJI looks promising, but how well does it fare in the real world? Check out our full review.",2019-02-19T10:26:03Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QXJD2E1NVD4/hqdefault.jpg,"in this episode of check it out we are
reviewing the DJI Osmo pocket which as
the name suggests is a tiny device that
fits in your pocket this is a 3-axis
stabilized gimbal that u4k 60 video it
shoots slow-motion it shoots time lapses
and photos and this device retails for
around $349 which translates to about
25,000 rupees and today we're gonna try
it out at some of my favourite places of
historical significance in and around
Delhi
[Music]
this little device also has selfie mode
[Music]
I just wonder how good the audio is I
suppose we're about to find out Wow
[Music]
I am standing in the shade doing a
selfie video but it looks like it's kind
of burning the background a little bit
unfortunate so this is the built in
sound quality the old small pocket
records the audio clearly and generates
pretty good results
[Music]
as we can see the video quality on this
device is absolutely spectacular in
daylight another thing that comes to
mind immediately when you start using
this device is just how small and
portable it is it is absolutely tiny and
it is just packed with features which
brings us to the next test we're gonna
keep testing out these different
features in different locations so we're
going to move on
[Music]
all right so I'm making a move right now
to the next location so I'm gonna head
go ahead and try to shoot a little bit
out the car window to see if I get any
useful footage from that so I'm setting
it to 60fps so that we can slow down the
footage in code let's see how this turns
out as you can see the videos captured
by the ausma pocket or not shaky even
while shooting from a moving vehicle
I've been using this device now for
about an hour and a half and it seems to
be draining the battery quite fast it is
down to 75% after only an hour and a
half of usage so if you're planning to
use this all day you definitely need to
carry a battery bank with you
[Music]
so i breached jama masjid then it's time
for another test this time i'm gonna try
out the face track feature well paste
the camera in one position and then i'll
move around and see if it follows me
around let's check it out
[Music]
next drag is on let's see how it works
once the face track feature is activated
the camera follows you as you move
this is interesting especially for
content creators who produce videos all
by themselves or solar travelers who
want to be recorded while on the move
and when ad jama masjid how can we
forego the delicacies
but that doesn't distract me from the
testing spree that I'm on so I will put
it to the slow-mo test here
[Music]
the slow-mo results are impressive
[Music]
I'm in connaught place right now base
track seems to be working and I'm
burning the background it seems yes
[Music]
here I will put this kind of device to
the panorama test
[Music]
all right so I've come to cannot place
for the final test of daylight which is
the panorama photo function I'm also
going to set up a time-lapse if we get
time and I'll have an overview of CP
behind me so we'll see how it works out
[Music]
we are surprised to see that the camera
fails to capture details in soft light
[Applause]
[Music]
so I reach India gate for the final test
of this review which is a low-light test
now I have heard that this camera is not
very good for low-light so I'm just
gonna try out both video and photos and
see how well it works in these
conditions not just at India Gate I shot
the time lapses at other places too
during the day I must say the Osmo
pocket captures high quality time lapses
[Music]
at least when there's plenty of light
available all in all the results are
pretty good
[Music]
but here are a few downsides the battery
drains pretty fast I was down to 20%
after 4 hours of use
[Music]
also the accessories that can increase
its functionality multifold don't come
with it be it amount or a waterproof
case which means you have to buy them
separately and they haven't even been
released yet so I've spent an entire day
out with the DJI Osmo pocket and I've
tried out all the different functions in
various different environments around
Delhi now comes the most important
question should you buy it the DJI Osmo
pocket is a handy device with good
features a great lens and a premium
build quality it gets a thumbs up from
take it out

Cx_5aIlprNw,Easyfone Star: A Phone For Kids,"The new phone promises to keep your children safe, but would you buy your child this ultra-basic handset? The World is One ...",2019-02-19T10:23:13Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cx_5aIlprNw/hqdefault.jpg,"[Music]
it's never easy for parents to send
their kids away from them not just
because they miss them when they're away
but they also worry about the safety
when they're out of sight but technology
promises to make life easier for both
parents and children
[Music]
this is the easy polish are a new phone
that's been designed for children to
keep them safe and connected with their
parents but is it a phone that a parent
would like to buy a child and most
importantly is it a phone that a child
would take a fancy to take it out we'll
find out but first let's take a closer
look at the phone as you can see the
phone doesn't have a traditional keypad
[Music]
instead it just has a few keys which
means that kids can only make calls to
preset numbers and these four keys that
are labeled as M 1 M 2 M 3 and M 4 can
be personalized with pictures of family
members whose numbers you would want to
preset on the phone as you would expect
the phone includes a GPS location
feature so that you can keep tabs on
your child's whereabouts also there is a
Help button at the back that enables a
child to get help in an emergency once
activated it not only calls family
members but also sends them the GPS
location it also sets up a siren or an
alarm alerting people about the SOS
situation the phone also allows you to
discreetly listen to what's happening in
your child's surroundings this could be
useful especially when you are away from
your child and he's being looked after
by a nanny or other caregivers
and most interestingly it comes with an
auto callback feature so if your child
doesn't answer your call you can use the
feature the phone will call you back
automatically and activate the
loudspeaker
but the question is what children want
to use such a device especially when
they are used to viewing interesting
content on large screens how about
giving the phone to children and see
what they have to say but I don't know
how to do it up we let three kids play
with the phone for a while and to our
surprise it got mixed reactions from
them I don't like it when we phone from
this phone it's it's easy to call we
have to just press one button and fun no
button it doesn't have anything not new
to not list or not any games it's okay
so me I don't know I don't think it will
like this you won't be getting YouTube
they won't be getting games it's just
bonus for emergencies then we can use it
interestingly we rain mentioned a very
valid point the volume of the along
should be louder then water is now like
this and here is what resonates with
parents I like to buy this kind phone
for my daughter
so all in all most kids are unlikely to
like the device but it's pretty handy
and affordable so parents might like to
get it for their children clearly this
one can in no way replace warden day
smartphones but that's not the purpose
its intended for either it in practice
made for parents who want to limit their
choice smartphone use and yet have the
convenience of staying connected with
them and for that it takes all the right
boxes

living oh this one is the galaxy M 20
from Samsung Oh a new model yeah there's
a new model recently launched okay that
looks pretty interesting yeah why not oh
yeah this is the new phone the galaxy
and this one is the new samsung galaxy
and 20 galaxy M 20 from Samsung as you
have seen there is a lot of buzz around
the new Galaxy M 20 and why not the
phone looks promising but the question
is does it live up to its claims let's
find out the galaxy M 20 has a simple
design but it's appealing the phone is
comfortable to hold and easy to use
while it has a six point three inch
display it's not unwieldy we found the
phone's display two beats for striking
features its vibrant and sharp the color
reproduction is on
and also it's easy to use the display
even under direct sunlight and the
knotch design leaves a lot of viewing
room well the phone scores good on the
design front but how is the camera for a
lot of people the cameras are a major
deciding factor while choosing a phone
the phone features a dual camera setup
at the back and here are some of the
results taken from the galaxy and xx we
got different people to test its 8
megapixel front snapper
[Music]
now for the pros and cons the results
taken in bright light setups are vibrant
and generate trade contrast but we found
that though the photos look great on the
phone screen the details are not as
sharp otherwise so you can expect the
phone to be a little disappointing in
low-light environments
[Music]
and next comes the video test before the
quality of the videos to be decently
good but it doesn't come with a
stabilization feature we think this is
acceptable given that it's an affordable
phone
[Music]
interestingly the cameras come with a
lot of options for users to click
photographs in different modes over all
the false cameras generate satisfactory
results
[Applause]
the phone has a great battery life it
easily survives for over a day it has a
neat user interface and the performance
is satisfactory we did not find any lag
or heating issues during our review
period the galaxy m20 CAD is a price tag
of ten thousand nine hundred and ninety
rupees for the 32gb model and twelve
thousand 990 for the 64gb model and it's
the word ik time interestingly after a
very long time Samsung has come up with

offers good features and is

but what if we tell you that you can
fill all of those pictures with ease
bring those heartwarming moments to life
and keep them near you maybe at a
workstation or in your room this is the
fujifilm instax shear sp2 smartphone
printer the instant printer has a neat
design with a few buttons this is the
compartment that accommodates strange
sheets
[Applause]
and this is the outlet that dispenses
the printed photos
[Music]
interestingly the LED lights near the
dispenser update you about the number of
sheets left inside also it's light in
rate while the smartphone printer is
portable we find it to be slightly on
the thicker side we wish it was a little
more compact and this is where the HP
sprocket has a slight edge over the
fujifilm instax sheer sp2 the design is
nice but what about the performance but
before that let's see how the printer is
better it's easy to set up the printer
pair it with your phone wire Wi-Fi
download the Instax share app and there
you go you can print photos from the
holes gallery or from your social media
accounts like Instagram and Facebook
also if you print a photograph from your
Instagram you can keep the number of
flights and captions on it the app also
includes other customization options for
users to add creative elements to the
photos and now comes another important
question how is the photo Corner
here are some of the photos printed with
the Instax share SPD the photos are
clear and reasonably detailed also they
produce good colors and generate
contrast of an acceptable quality and
it's time for the verdict so should you
buy it
[Applause]
priced at $12,600 value for money but
the HP sprocket has a slight edge over
it both in terms of design and price

5gJP2VGpaF8,Honor View 20 Review: Hit Or Miss?,"Honor View 20 is the first phone in India with a hole-punch display. But is it worth your money? The World is One News, WION ...",2019-02-19T10:03:41Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5gJP2VGpaF8/hqdefault.jpg,"if you are planning to buy an Android
flagship there is a new contender in the
market the owner of u-20 which happens
to be the first phone in India with a
hole-punch display but the question is
should you buy this phone
let's find out
[Music]
[Music]
the owner view 20 might look like a
regular phone but it has its USB the key
highlight of the phone is its hole punch
display that replaces the knotch design
and accommodates the front camera in the
top left corner
the display is neat and leaves users
with more viewing area also the display
is easily viewable under direct sunlight
the phone has curved edges and it's
light in weight this in turn makes it
comfortable to hold the right panel of
the phone is made of glass and it can't
fail to get your attention
the glossy finish appears to be a little
gaudy something you wouldn't expect in a
premium phone but as the design is
subjective you might like the bright
finish of the phone the camera is one of
the biggest highlights of the honor of
u-20 so let's try it out and see what it
delivers the phone features a forty
eight megapixel camera at the back and a
twenty five megapixel front shooter and
before you wonder how good is the camera
quality here are some photos and videos
taken with the phone both the front and
rear cameras capture detailed photos in
bright light and soft light conditions
also the front camera captures good
photos with noticeable details we are
pretty satisfied with the camera
performance other than that
the camera has come with advanced
features that you would expect in a
top-of-the-line phone we spent around a
week with the phone and it went along
with us pretty well we didn't face any
lags or heating issues backed with a
4000 mAh battery with support for fast
charging the owner view 20 offers a good
battery life the base model of the owner
view 20 comes with 128 GB of storage and
6 GB of RAM it costs 37 thousand 999
rupees the high-end model however has
256 GB of storage paired with 8 GB of
RAM and it's priced at 45 thousand 999
rupees
and it's the verdict time so if you have
a budget of $40,000 just you to take it
into consideration

I'm delighted to have with me a true
legend of world sport from Ground Zero
in Monaco he's a six-time Olympic
champion in track cycling and a member
of the Laureus Academy Sir Chris Hoy
thanks so much for your time as Chris
we're calling these awards the night of
champions you're on we on and how apt
because nowhere else perhaps only at the
opening ceremony of the Olympics are
there's so many sporting superstars all
under one roof at the same time yeah
it's a huge honor to be part of to be an
Academy member is it's amazing you know
you look her in the rim and you see the
kind of people that you cheered on and
you you supported on TV as a child and
as you grew up
so I'm very proud to be part of the
Laureus Academy and great that we can
can do something for something positive
for the rest of the world to raise money
and to improve the world through sport
you know so Chris well most Laureus is
all about the awards but what you really
do is use sport to do good it's a
strange world that we live in quite a
bit of inequality but sport has the
power to heal doesn't it yeah well I was
Nelson Mandela who is the person who
helped to to form Laureus and in the
very beginning and he said that sport
has the power to change the world and I
believe it does it's a very powerful
tool and you know and it's there for
anybody at any age any level of ability
even in the most impoverished parts of
the world sport is so important to bring
people together and it's great for your
health it's great for your mental health
it's great for your the social side of
things too but Laureus aims to fund lots
of projects around the world which help
to improve the lives of people through
sports and they're doing a great job and
we hope to do even more in the future
now 2018 was such a great year for sport
so Chris and it reflects it in your list
of nominees obviously I can't ask you
who's going to win but a look at say the
men's nominees first Novak Djokovic
Lewis Hamilton LeBron James Elliot Kip
shogi Luka Modric Killian and Bob
a water list and all the very best in
their respective sporting disciplines
yeah I mean if all they all have the
right to say that they could be the
ultimate and champion this year it's
each one of them has had an incredible
year from from Lewis Hamilton for
example to become a five-time five-time
world champion and f1 is incredible
Novak Djokovic in such a competitive era
you know to continue to keep winning
Grand Slams to win the Wimbledon it's
yeah incredible but who knows who's
gonna win it but yeah there any one of
those the nominees would be a worthy
winner and in a year of the Winter
Olympics Oh Chris you would expect to
see many of you know the winter sports
stars in the nominees list there are two
sports in the sports woman category
Michaela sheffrin and Esther Latika
there are also two tennis players but
also Simone biles whose triumph at the
world Gymnastics Championships was so
special given what US gymnastics was
going through with the fallout of the
sexual abuse case yeah as against wide
open
you know Simona BIOS I think was one of
the most high-profile athletes this year
and her World Championship success was
was outstanding
Bella deca yeah thank you no to when a
little bit Gold's in different different
sports I went to Olympic golds that's as
far as my way I don't think it's been
done before certainly not and they're in
the modern era so yeah it seems it's
almost not enough to just be the best in
your sport you seem to have to take it
to another level entirely so yeah
whoever wins the the female sports
Person of the Year will certainly have
learned it from an Indian perspective
circus we have a finish forgot in the
running for comeback of the year she's
up against the likes of Lindsey Warren
and Tiger Woods but as Indian sport
grows do you think we should expect more
Indians to be up here amongst the best
in the world absolutely why not I mean
you have you know a huge huge country a
huge number of people living there and I
guess it's having given them the
opportunity to get into sports and if
you give them your the chance to show
what they can do then
they clearly will shine at the highest
level so it's it's about opportunities
about facilities it's about funding but
I guess it's about that first stage
getting the interest into sport and
giving them the chance to show how good
they can be and when you see you know
the number of top Indian athletes over
the years clearly the talent is there
and the number of people are there so
it's about opportunities and it's you
know it's it's a chicken and egg
scenario you've got to have the
facilities and the and the money first
before you can get the athletes but it's
hard to get the money in the first place
- there is one place where I think that
the Academy you know will be quite
confused as to who to pick as a winner
is in the team of the Year category it's
the year of the football World Cup
rather it was the year of the football
World Cup and France are nominated
Mercedes have won a fifth straight
constructors title the Ryder Cup was
enthralling for Europe and who can
forget Real Madrid's hat-trick of
Champions League titles it says and I
think it comes to into what sports your
most passionate about you know it's you
can't really compare it's you can't say
one is better than the other because
they're all so different but they've all
earned the right to be in that list of
nominees and whoever wins it will will
as I say both Aaron debt I'm sure but
it's down to who you who you have the
most or who the fans and who their
people were voting and have the most
passion for so it's yeah you certainly
think with we're here in Monaco Formula
One Grand Prix you know that's the heart
of f1 and with with Mercedes being five
times Constructors champion is name
would have a very good chance okay one
final question sir Chris not only have
you got some great nominees you also
have a huge turnout of sporting stars in
attendance
it is a high-profile event but where
would you want to see these awards say
in five years from now
well five years from now I hope that we
have raised the profile or the the
awards are even bigger and and the
awareness around the world and so when
you go anywhere any come to the world
and you say Laureus Sports Awards they
know immediately what you're talking
about and it's you know we have in the
Academy some of the most well known
athletes of all time and we have you
know an amazing charity amazing
foundation that's doing so much to try
and prove the world through sport so we
I think we need to
raising the profile and and hopefully
and you know athletes know about it but
the general public I think needs to know
more about it so hopefully explain the
world and India as well we see that's
that's a big part of it too so yeah I
hope it's even bigger and better and
even more people are aware of the
Laureus and the work they do so Chris
it's been an absolute pleasure speaking
to you thank you very much for joining
us exclusively here on be on and have a
great ceremony thank you very much

on g20 countries to act strongly on the

action against the issue of terrorism
remember g20 countries include India and
Argentina last year Argentina hosted the
g20 summit in which it was announced
that India will be hosting the g20
summit in the year 2022 but all in all
it's the issue of terrorism that India

the Indian Prime Minister also called on
world to speak in one voice on the issue
of terrorism India has been calling for
consensus when it comes to the
comprehensive Convention on
international terrorism that calls for a
common definition of terrorism the world
has not been able to come out with a
common definition on terrorism consensus
is still lacking India will be focusing
at the United Nations that that there is
a common definition through this

comes as diplomatic rift between India

following Friday's dastardly terror

India now British regional airline fly
BMI has canceled all its flights and has

carbon costs and due to the brexit

difficulties including recent spike in
fuel costs the latter arising from the
European Union's decision to exclude UK
Airlines from full participation in the

that once prayer across much of Syria

now us-backed city and democratic forces

civilians are being held in a village in
eastern Syria by Islamic state fighters
the extra masuka's closed off all the
roads in and out of the village of bagus
SDF officials have said that the extra
mists are hiding among civilians in a
tented village and using a network of
caves and tunnels the Islamic state
which once ruled of proto state in large
parts of Syria and Iraq is clinging on
to an area less than a square kilometer
in this village the extra missed me
include high-level commanders and could
be holding hostages the u.s. fact
commanders are confident that the
Islamic state terrorists will soon give
up as they are running out of ammunition
the capture of the last pocket of
territory held by the Islamic state
would mark the end of a devastating four
year-long global campaign to end the
extremist groups so-called caliphate at
the height of their power in 2014 the
action was to control nearly a third of
both the countries of Syria and Iraq

sport for good award and I have with me
Nita raha Rose and France many
congratulations first of all I must ask
you that the award here standing next to
was also held by Roger Federer last time
how do you feel being given this award
I am feeling really happy that this time
we are getting this award okay yeah yeah
I would say both like Joe you are who
people students football players were
back at you are it's gonna improve their
lives and its future of many girls back
at sharkon so it's like really excited
really proud and very emotional to get
these awards like really nice you gone
through a lot haven't there and to hear
them speak the way they do now and
probably it's much later they'll realize
the significance of what you all have
achieved as as a team as well to get the
award from arsene wenger of the legends
they even actually ended up playing of
mini football match this morning with us
and Wenger World Cup winning captain
cough who just talked me through the
idea behind you guys you know and you've
been around for a while both of you
where did this come about and and and
and your journey arose in the last 10
years you can start first and then we
get to France
okay so you were started in 2008 and it
began as a girl scholarship program and
initially football was not even a part
of it it wasn't until a group of girls
came and and asked Franz here if he
would coach a football team that we even
started using football and France had
only knew the American football II
didn't know too much about this football
right not even American football Franz
is actually a skier and a judo judo
player but not a football player but the
girls wanted to play football and where
we where we live and work and world to
our kind there are very few
opportunities for girls to play girls
have very few very less free time when
compared to boys boys are given a lot of
privilege in each family they're sent to
better schools they eat first they're
allowed to do what they want whereas the
girls have very limited opportunities
and so initially us started using
football as a way to bring girls
together and create a positive space for
them and then over time we've added more
and more depth to the program to really
enable girls to take control of their
own lives and determine their own
futures and in order to accomplish that
we have started a full-time girls school
every girl who's in you'e practises five
days a week one day a week she has a
life skills workshop where she learns
important information about her health
her rights and about future planning as
well so you was a very deep program
that's focused on enabling girls to
truly take control of their futures
Ron's last thing we come to you because
you know when you set this up you
obviously didn't envision this getting
so big these are things changing on the
ground now do you see a change happening
there is acceptance you know early they
wouldn't even be allowed to come and
play they they'd have to hide and come
and play it reminded me of some great
Indian stories from sport where parents
don't allow your kids to play they their
girls they're supposed to get married at
the age of 15 and 16 you think the
mindset is changing and is that
ultimately what will be the the main win
for you not this award but if you can
change those mindset back in rural
charcoal and and all of India's well I'm
really proud to bring this award back to
India because I've never been in a place
that has so much you know so much talent
where the kids especially if the girls
are so hungry to learn and to get ahead
and India is a young country you know
the majority of people in India are very
young and I think that there's a lot of
energy and a lot of kids want to play
sport they want to change their lives
they want to have a safe and positive
space that's what Uwe has created that's
what these girls are creating now as
coaches and for us to be able to bring
this award back to India I think really
it proves that that young people can
really change the world when they've got
just a little bit of support so we're
we're thrilled to be holding the same
trophy that Serena Williams and Roger
Federer
you know and and the legends of sport
have had and we're hoping that this is
going to bring bring more support in
India to these girls and what they're
doing and and thanks to to all of you
guys for for coming here and helping us
with that okay just the third time this
lovely trophy is headed back to India
but it belongs to you and enjoy this
moment girls keep the dream going keep
the flag flying keep enjoying sport and
may you win in life as well

this difficult time the world powers
have expressed their solidarity with

billion dollars of security aid to

financial straits that Pakistan is in
hitting Pakistan financially is where it
would hurt the most now the former
Indian ambassador to the United States
are a Singh is of the opinion that India
should expose Pakistan's role in
two-parameter attack the Financial
Action Task Force which has put Pakistan
on the green list for terror financing
should be engaged with to isolate
Pakistan further besides this India
should question any international aid
routed through the IMF for Pakistan's
financial stability as this cannot be
offered to a country which encourages
violence and terrorism as a matter of
state policy secondly India's response
to the pole vomit air attack should be
different from what it has been in the
past now after the terror attack on the
Pathankot airbase India had invited the
Pakistan's joint investigation team with
the Isar members in it to investigate
the patent code attack after the 26/11
Mumbai attack India gave dossier after
dossier of evidence to Baucus not to
prosecute the perpetrators of the attack
to deal with Pakistan and such good
faith is a mistake strategic affairs
expert Bromwich Alani is of the view
India must downgrade as diplomatic
relationship with Pakistan it cannot be
business as usual we cannot expect to
isolate Pakistan internationally if we
ourselves do not change our diplomatic
stand in Pakistan and describe for what
it is a terror state we should also
suspend the permit in this commission
which in these circumstances will be
legal as Pakistan has been
like a rope steel however the elephant
in the room of course is China when it
backs Pakistan constantly we wake adju
the former ambassador of Carson says in
there should not shy away from dealing
with China directly on this China has
repeatedly obstructed the designation of
muscle other as a UN designated terrors
a spirit of Wuhan is fine but India
should take up this matter with China in
the wake of what has happened now and
these are of course some of the options
which India should pend upon besides the
four points formulated by the government
after topkapi a cabinet meeting there
have also been other innovative ways
which India should come up with to make
Pakistan change its tune earlier we all
spoke to the tried left-hand generals I
had a Taha'a man who told us what he
thinks about India's options what the
Prime Minister has been saying in the
last 24 hours
the Prime Minister has mentioned three
times the promise of retaliation and
retribution I think that sufficiently
sends over message and this is election
time we don't have time on our hands
obviously the political environment is
such and the public pressure through
social media is very very intense
I suspect they adhere do not have too
many options the diplomatic option I do
not think is only a it's only a shaping
of the environment and nothing else the
military options are very much there and
there's a range of military options
there is a range of military options
which are shown the Indian Armed Forces
are looking at very seriously

VjwL2gukMQA,WION Gravitas: Airbus to scrap production of A380 superjumbo,Europe's Airbus announced plans to scrap production of the A380 superjumbo on Thursday. Watch full video to know more.,2019-02-14T17:05:54Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VjwL2gukMQA/hqdefault.jpg,"one of the most iconic engineering
marvels of the last decade is the Airbus
a380 it will be scrapped from production
now what went wrong with the super jumbo
jet which is still regarded as the last
word in luxury commercial flights here's
the answer the Airbus a380 made its
commercial debut in 2007 it was an
engineering marvel specifically designed
by Airbus to challenge the dominance of
the Boeing 787 Dreamliner in the
aircraft market but after having been in
production for over a decade in a move
which did not come as a surprise to many
Airbus announced that it was scrapping
the production of the world's biggest
commercial jet if you have a product but
nobody wants anymore or you can sell
only below production cost you have to
stop it as painful as it is know this is
the right decision right now you can
trust but we have not been giving up
easily on the 380 and I think you know
that we did various analyses in recent
years what else we could do with the
free ad but it turned out red for
measures like re-engining or stretching
the aircraft we wouldn't find customers
or not enough customers the last straw
was Emirates Airlines this cancellation
of its order for 36 a380s
in favour of the smaller a350s the
world's largest jet provides for a
seating capacity of over 525 people in
the three class configuration for up to
850 three people in an all-economy class
configuration since its debut ever sold
over three hundred and twenty-one a380
jets each one priced at 446 million
dollars the double-decker wide-bodied
for engine jet provides more space for a
traveler than any other aircraft but it
was precisely this which
proved its undoing although Airlines and
passengers value the aircraft space and
luxury the cost of the plane and the
consequent rise in operational expenses
made it unaffordable aviation analysts
have compared a scrapping of the a380 to
what happen with a Concorde the fastest
commercial jet which could cross the
Atlantic in just three and a half hours
at twice the speed of sound Concorde
redefined commercial flying but it was
too expensive and was eventually retired
at the time it was said that the
Concorde was ahead of his times a
sentiment echoed by the Airbus CEO what
we're seeing here is the end of a large
four-engine aircraft and that is what it
is I mean as been speculation for years
whether we were ten years too early good
380 all through history humans have
strived to design the biggest and the
fastest engineering marvels and just
like the Concorde the super jumbo jet
has been retired due to it being an idea
whose time has not yet come Bureau

Oliver now lots of people are going to
be losing their jobs it seems a bus has
already called this decision painful how
do they plan to sort of absorb this
workforce into the larger air bus
company well this was the main problem
with the a380 it was a very complex
build of an aircraft the wings were made
in Wales part of the body was assembled
in Hamburg then the rest of the body was
made at the main plant here in France in
Toulouse so when you don't have that
centralized structure butchers what
Boeing has in the u.s. then you've got
job losses on three different plans
really that are going to be taking the
impact across three different countries
so it's going to be a testing time for
those employees the Airbus has said
though that the planes will be produced
in two of them until 2021 and Emirates
have said that we will be seeing the
plane in the skies until at least the
2030s so there will be some time yet to
see the Emirates air so the Airbus a380
in the air we just need to wait and see
how long those job cuts will take to
come into effect and worldwide of course
airlines have been suffering for the
last couple of years and you know
airlines have not been doing well for
various reasons fuel pricing being one
of them but how would you see the
failure of the Airbus a380 panning out
and what were the specific reasons
according to you we've already discussed
some of them here but do you think that
even on busy routes such as Asia people
are preferring you know local Airlines
other than say an a380 a local mix so
one of the major distinctions that I
noticed when I was living in Sydney was
the fact that you've got Airlines now
such as Qantas and Singapore Airlines
which are deciding to go direct from
destination to destination so from Perth
to London in one hop using the Boeing
Dreamliner and that's the same from the
Singapore to Newark in New Jersey route
those are ultra long distance flights
taking up to 18 19 hours and passengers
get to do it in a more fuel-efficient
aircraft
aircraft that have got better ergonomics
they make you feel better because as
extra oxygen flow within the cabins and
you do it in one hop you don't have to
stop off in a hub airport like those
Gulf states of Dubai Abu Dhabi maybe
even Doha all of these are the key
things that the aviation industry now
sees as the future of aviation aircraft
whereas before people thought that
Hobart airports such as Dubai were going
to be the future that everybody would
want to have a stop off and going by the
duty-free before getting on to their
next long-haul flight it's proving the
case that actually a lot of people do
just want to sit on that plane get the
pain out of the way and do a one
long-haul stretch and then arrive at
their destination

ordered Russia to unplug itself from the

test if cyber defenses the test will
mean data passing between Russian
citizens and organizations stays inside
the nation rather than being routed
internationally a draft law mandating
technical changes needed to operate
independently was introduced to its
Parliament last year the test is
expected to happen before the first of
April but no exact date has been set now
the dark law requires Russia's ISPs to
ensure that it can operate in the event
of foreign powers acting to isolate the
country online the law could also see
Russia creating its own version of the
Internet's address system or domain name
system with the idea being it could
still operate if links to servers
located abroad artists connected
eventually the Russian government wants
all domestic traffic to pass through its

censorship system akin to be to be seen
in Park in China which tries to scrub
out prohibited traffic the nation is
accused of planning to use submarines to
cut vital international cables wants to
make sure its own economy can survive
offline so this of course is going to be
the big news coming April if Russia can
actually make it that firewall and go
offline but what are the reasons well
Julie Chapman is now joining us live
from Moscow for the very latest on this
and Julia so how does the unplugging
from the world of internet work and what
is the real plan behind this how is it
going to book well I think a lot of
those details haven't quite yet worked
out been worked out I think this is the
first reading the bill has passed the
first reading in the Russian parliament
but there's still a long way to go
before it actually becomes law and
there's certainly a lot of changes that
could be made between this reading and
the second reading which could happen in
the next few days or weeks so as for how
it would actually be implemented
the details are still as of yet unknown
but the idea basically behind this
entire bail behind this whole proposal
as the people putting it forward say is
to try to protect the Russian internet
space from any attack from outsiders so
that's them saying that they are
concerned that some countries they've
named specifically the u.s. because the
US has of course accused Russia of
carrying out a number of cyber attacks
they say that they are now trying to
protect Russian internet from any kind
of outside attack that would be in
retaliation for what they say the
Americans say has been some cyber
attacks carried out by Russia so the
idea is to sort of isolate Russian
internet to have Russian internet
operating on its own servers and not
having to go through servers in other
countries that would be more secure here
in Russia but they say that this would
only be used in cases of emergencies if
there was to be an attack from an
outside country right Julia thanks very
much indeed for joining us with the
latest there on the Russian government's
plans to go offline for a few months to

can look at China we have a team right
now in China they want to make a deal
very badly those tariffs are costing
them a lot of money and they're going
into our treasury remember that we're
filling up with billions of dollars and
did you see the you know I haven't been
here very long the trade deficit really
went down very big in this last month
and people are saying whoa I told you so
that's what I do
and we don't want China to have a hard
time thank you

thank you I I can only tell you this
we're gonna make great deals entre we're
gonna make great deals on military when
we defend another nation that's rich
they have to help us out do we agree
they have to help us out and they're
doing it they're doing it you saw South
Korea they were paying us 500 million
dollars a year
I say you got a good reward they got to
do more anyway now they're up to almost
900 million dollars that was like on two
phone calls I said I said why didn't
they do this before they said nobody
ever asked nobody else you pick up
almost 500 million dollars you
nobody has with defending rich countries
they've got to help us out folks they
got out facade sorry and you know what
they're gonna like us more and maybe
more importantly they're going to
respect us
since the election we have created 5.3
million new jobs including more than a
half a million new manufacturing jobs
remember manufacturing was dead they
said manufacturing was dead previous
administration you'll never have it you
need the magic wand that's what they saw
we obviously we found the magic wand
that by the way those numbers are small
compared to what's happening compared to
all of the companies that are moving in

access to life-saving treatments we did
something that they haven't been able to
do for a long time we pass right to try
right to try that's an incredible thing
right to try you know we have the
greatest doctors and research in the
world and if somebody was terminally ill
they travel to Asia they traveled to
Europe they travel all over the world if
they had the money if they didn't have
the money they'd just go home there was
nothing they could do and I said wait a
minute we have drugs in the pipeline
that are showing tremendous progress if
somebody is terminally ill let's let
them have access to our drugs and it's
much tougher than you would think but we
got it and people you will not
understand nobody understand the
life-saving effects it's incredible
what's going on they are getting better
people are getting better that we're
thinking they were going to die it's
right to try I love it I always wondered
why we didn't do it before
now the people in Texas won't care as
much about this but the United States is
now the number one producer of oil and
natural gas
I didn't think you'd care about
I didn't think Texas would care about
them and listen to this and Texas oil
production is now at the highest level
it's ever been
and only for the great oil professionals
in the room we're getting those
pipelines approved so fast you'll be
able to practically double up on oil
production oil and bills
they're getting approved at record
levels and record time that means more
money more security and more
independence for our country it's very
simple

but here this US President Donald Trump
addressing a rally in El Paso and it is
his first since an acrimonious debate
over the funding of the wall shut down
government and comes this comes as the
negotiations in Washington to head off
another shutdown re have taken place and
as we just heard Donald Trump started
off his speech by Tom Tomac about the
trade war and the trade deficit that has
went down last month he also cautioned a
China stating that the United States is
all set to make great deals on military
and trade with China also spoke about
South Korea which was paying them around
five hundred million dollars
earlier but of course the trade deficit
with even South Korea has been covered
according to him he also talked about
generating close to 5.3 million jobs 60%
of which according to Donald Trump have
been occupied by women he also spoken
about oil and gas coming back and that
he's eliminated the Obama care
individual mandate by giving critically
ill patients access to some life-saving
treatment and finally he is come down to
speaking about the Texas oil production
it's important to note that the
president's choice of keeping the rally
in El Paso is to make his argument
curious on several grounds El Paso's
also be in the place for violent crime
caused due to immigration and let's not
forget that this rally is almost a
foretaste of the 2020 campaign where
he's addressing almost 6,000 supporters

company called the handley page gospel
dining at 30,000 feet has come a long
way in the last 100 years up next we'll
show you how airlines prepare your meals
for flights
a good meal on board can punctuate the
tedium of flying long distances it's
something that almost all passengers
look forward to in flight meals play an
important role in defining one's journey
and that's why airlines want to woo
their customers by providing quality
food on board and these days with people
sharing everything on social media the
pressure on airlines is increased when
it comes to serving food that looks as
good as a taste but meals are not cooked
on board every meal served on an
airplane is prepared ahead of time
chilled and frozen to be warmed in
onboard convection ovens before making
its way to you it needs to be fit for
human consumption at 35,000 feet so a
lot of time and preparation goes into
planning these meals we own wings
decided to enter one of the world's
biggest kitchens for in-flight meals the
Emirates flight catering facility
situated near devised international
apple but before we could step in and
proceed to the facility precautionary
measures were taken
food safety and hygiene are of paramount
importance
there are several stages of processing
the food the raw products are thoroughly
inspected before they make their way to
the kitchen for us from the supply chain
point of view there is a temperature
control there is the hasip control so
there is a hygiene team quality team
they're all on the platform they're
checking at random basis temperature is
taken if any item does not as per the
it's not as per the standard we return
it to the supplier and they need to
replace it within the time that's what
happens so there's first first line of
control that we don't receive it second
line of control before it is
there is a spot check on the expiry
dates and the temp fetches that's how it
is controlled
the kitchen is spread over an area of
56,000 square meters and it's open 24-7
six hundred and forty chefs work in
shifts to keep it running smoothly more
than 200 thousands of such plates are
prepared every day in this facility and
are shipped out to different parts of
the world there are times when there is
good traffic and you have to work extra
hours but there are times when is less
traffic and the work here is quite less
as well well this facility is one of the
largest such facilities across the world
for Emirates the catering is largely
divided into three zones the cold
kitchen the hot kitchen and the pastry
or dessert section and if you think the
menu is decided on a daily basis then
think again a lot of food engineering
goes into preparing the final menu is a
year-long process for example now we're
doing menu development four menus that
will start next April twenty twenty
twenty yes so it's a long process
we start with the grid spreadsheet will
come up with ideas we have little
brainstorming sessions what's going now
what's what's successful in the past you
know and we looked at re-engineering
some of those products we do
presentations physical presentations
again where we do tasting sessions and
we might three arrange a dish a little
bit you know so it looks you know
wholesome and attractive
we photograph that we weigh everything
out with you know create a specification
for it and we do the recipes that goes
off to a costing team but from a food
perspective you know then we look at
okay which routes we're gonna put this
on and then there's food pairing
Airlines also exercise extra care when
it comes to selecting the best of wines
and champagnes for their passengers we
have a route specific wines
Emrys is very particular about the wines
the premium class wines are route
specific like what you get for Europe
you do not get for Indian subcontinent
and they keep changing on frequent basis
as well so we need because you get the
printed Wireless on board and that wine
has to be available so there's a lot of
work to put together so that the right
wine is given to the right customer a

hometown flying in one of the most
popular small planes in the world
the Cessna 172

small airplanes may look tiny and easy
to fly but that's not the case
private pilot's need to be trained well
enough to navigate a small aircraft to
the nation's airspace by themselves
safely by Uncle Matt's castel got his
private pilot's license from Sweden
almost 20 years ago and he loves to fly
the Cessna 172 the world's most popular
small airplane I am in my hometown new
no absolutely freezing but there's
nothing stopping the Swedish spirit of
getting outdoors for a bit of exercising
even in these temperatures even though
it was bitterly cold with the mercury at
minus 25 degrees Celsius he offered me
an evening flight over the city the
pre-flight planning included checking
the weather and making sure we got to go
ahead from the local authorities in the
time slot before hours one of the flying
club instructors have taught a class
using the same Cessna so it was still
warm from the previous flight once we
got the pre-flight planning done it was
time to get airborne and this also
required checking and rechecking a long
list of different crucial instruments
inside the aircraft
first impressions I'm used to seeing the
runway from a much greater height from
inside a passenger plane in a Cessna it
feels like you're almost sitting on the
ground now it is finally time to take
off ahead we're up in the air
this tour of my hometown must be the
best type ever had I'm a photographer by
profession and the golden hour is a
special time for us it's when you get
the best photos in the far northern
hemisphere the golden hour lasts much
longer than an hour making the flight
even more magical the altitude we are
flying at ranged from a thousand to
2,000 feet low enough to see many
details on the ground we're passing the
local steel mill the city's central
heating plant the outlying shopping
areas and our main tourism hotspot the
church town of gum installed a UNESCO
Heritage Site we also flew over our
house that sits in the middle of a
square grid of houses of the largest
district of the town
[Music]
my uncle has been flying for two decades
now and has worked hard to keep his
license valid the strict regulations
mean that a certain level of activity is
required else the license is withdrawn
he has managed this quite well he's a
member of the flight Club and the local
state hires pilots from this club to do
forest fire reconnaissance during the
hot summer months this can give
different pilots up to nine hours a day
during the driest time of the year and
finally it was time to head back

flying in these extreme weather
conditions is challenging as is
maintaining the planes the flying club
keeps the hangar heated throughout the

the last thing to do before we leave is
to fill in the logbook

Arctic Circle right now it's minus 25
degrees Celsius it's absolutely freezing
but there's nothing stopping the Swedish
spirit getting outdoors for a bit of
exercising even in these temperatures
[Music]
I braved the chill for a flight around
my hometown with my uncle who happens to
have a private pilot license for a
Cessna that had to be the highlight of
the entire trip for me
[Music]
on the way back to New Delhi I had a
layover in Stockholm and decided to use
the time to go and see a pretty unique
hotel have you ever seen the cockpit of
a jumbo jet up close what about sleeping
in one the jumbo stay hotel is located
inside a Boeing 747 aircraft the retired
plane was stripped of its 450 seats and
the raw space was converted into 33
rooms all the four engines were also
converted into rooms the more spacious
cockpit suite is located on the upper
deck and is one of the two rooms that
has its own shower and toilet so in the
middle of the suite is just about enough
height but it is such a difference this
is also included in taking the suite
this giant kind of conference room or
lounge area as well as the outside
terrace guests staying in most other
rooms need to use shared facilities
storm it's still open to play around
another unique experience the giant toy
but before it became a hotel this
aircraft had quite a run in the sky it
was produced for Singapore Airlines in
1976 after serving the Asian carrier for
eight years it was sold to Pan Am who
flew it for seven years finally after
almost 30 years with multiple Airlines
all over the world it was finally time
to retire it Swedish entrepreneur Oscar
Dias bought the decommissioned plane
moved it to Orlando and spent two
million dollars to convert it into a
lodging he opened the doors to customers
a decade ago some visitors just come to
visit this cafe located in the front of
the plane to experience the Swedish
tradition of pica a coffee break which
is accompanied by both sweet and savory
treats one of the wings has been
converted into a terrace and thankfully
there are handrails on both sides to
avoid guests sliding off it might be
nice in the summer but with these
temperatures it's more inviting to stay
inside this giant lounge and get your
own private Terrace outside right now in
the winter and cold
[Music]
although the cockpit suite is certainly
the highlight of this hotel this room at
the very end of the plane called the
black box offers the highest level of
comfort and it's their largest room all
the jetliner guests have access to
wireless broadband it's less than two
kilometers away from the Orlando Airport
and there are buses to transfer
passengers to and fro so if you are an
aviation enthusiast and find yourself in
Stockholm I think it's a wonderful
opportunity to spend a night aboard one
of the most iconic planes in history

strategy which the right-wing Hungarian
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has embarked
upon to save the country's future
delivering the State of the Nation
Address Obon unveiled his grand plan to
increase fertility rate in the country
by exempting women with four or more
children from paying income tax for life
but this is just the beginning of the
sobs it seems Hungary's our population
is falling by thirty two thousand four
year and Hungarians have a lower
fertility rate than Europe of an says
that a baby boom and not relying on
immigration were the way to defend the
future of the country
Allosaurus and Bella's neck
neck you can observe ocala net on a
module delicate our bond is particularly
opposed Muslim immigrants in fact the
biggest applause during Obon State of
the Nation Address was for his plans to
increase Hungary's fertility rate for
which he announced that a young
Hungarian couple will be given an
interest-free loan of
animal also announced creating at least
twenty one thousand nurses in the next
three years besides offering housing
subsidies and invest investing an
additional 2.5 billion dollars it seems
in the country's health system but well
not everyone was impressed with the
announcement by Victor bond almost two
thousand people gathered outside the
parliament building protesting against
the policies of the prime minister
and the world population of this year of
course standard a staggering figure of
7.5 billion and the trends is that the
population will continue to grow but
this is in stark contrast to the first
world industrialized countries such as
Japan and other parts of Europe which
have seen their populations shrink in
the recent decades
and Kevin Harvick is now joining us live
for the very latest on this and Kevin so
it will be interesting to see how
Hungary's baby boom really strategy
really works so which Victor Bond claims
has to be Hungary's answer to stop
migration
right and this is a complete 180 from
what Angela Merkel did a few years ago
during the height of the refugee crisis
when about a million people were fleeing
to Europe Angela Merkel welcomed them
with open arms now she would say that
was because that was the morally right
thing to do that these people were
victims of war they were fleeing a very
repressive regime in Syria but also
there was likely some strategic thinking
behind that because Germany just like
Hungary is facing a declining population
and that big huge robust German economy
doesn't have enough workers to fill all
the positions that need to be filled
well Viktor Orban during his State of
the Nation Address said we cannot use
immigrants to fill those jobs and to
grow this country and he called the far
left or the left in Europe gravediggers
he accused them of killing nation's
families in Europe and the Christian Way
of life so we're seeing the Hungarian
Prime Minister take that complete 180
approach but as you just laid out there
that's not fully supportive by all
Hungarians we did see those protests
after that announcement after that
speech yesterday and we've seen protests
in Budapest quite frequently recently
that's because people are starting to
protest heavy fines for opposition
parties as well as a really big
crackdown of the media there there's not
much of a Free Press in Hungary left and
that's something that really is
concerning to lawmakers here in Brussels
right right Kevin well thanks very much
follow that and stay with us because
there's more news coming in from Europe
and now well at least 45,000 span has
descended on to Madrid's main Square to
protest against the Prime Minister Pedro
Sanchez the massive rallies were
organized by right-wing in far-right
parties in Spain against the Socialist
prime minister who they accused of
treachery for negotiating with Catalan
separatists tens of thousands of people
waving Spanish flags took part in the
rally held under the slogan for a united
Spain elections now the protesters are
demanding that Sanchez resigned for
holding talks with the separatists in
the north eastern region of Catalonia
Sanchez's decision to take a more
conciliatory tone with the
pro-independence parties has angered the
country's far-right leaders including
the conservative popular party and the
far-right wops party

SK they say inmediatamente LVL O'Connor

now what exactly now is happening in
Spain I know the Sanchez of course
responded to these massive protests and
he said that well he respects the
demonstrations and he's also accused
conservative opposition parties of
creating divisions within the people
politically he's in a really tough spot
now and that's because there's a number
of issues going on here later this week
he wants to try to get his budget
approved and passed through the
legislative branch he needs the support
of Catalan political parties for that
because he's in a minority government
right now so he does need the backing of
them in order to push that budget
through also tomorrow
twelve Catalan separatists will be going
on to trial they have been they are
facing a number of very tough crimes for
trying to declare independence back in
2017 so for a few years now we've had
the Catalonian independence fight and
the issue really either simmering or at
times boiling over and are up ting and
creating just a huge instability in
Spanish politics so how is the Spanish
Prime Minister going to survive this
well it may be tough and the reason that
you see the center right and the
far-right parties calling for new
elections is because polling shows right
now that if there were to be a snap
election voters would likely favor them
and give them a mandate to form a new
government and push Sanchez out of power
right Kevin thanks very much indeed for
joining us with the very latest there
from all the latest on Spain as well as
of course the other news as well now a
back home newly appointed Congress
general secretary Perico Gandhi Vadra
has begun her road show in Lucknow she
is on a four-day visit to the padishah
brother in Congress president Rahul
Gandhi is accompanying her as well the
road will be followed by her maiden
speech in lovebug this is Priyanka
Daphne's maiden visit to the Pradesh
after formally entering politics this
month before her visit she released an
audio message requesting people to join
her in creating a new culture of
politics in the country the party aims
to target six million voters in the

to a survey done by the Congress party
unemployment and reservations seem to be
the two biggest issues in the state of

political editor Karthik a sham eyes
live with us now from Lucknow for the
very latest on this mega sure by of
course Priyanka Gandhi and Karthik a
well what does it look like in Lucknow
at the moment what kind of reception is
Priyanka Gandhi getting at for this mega
Roadshow
you know well on the lighter side you
know the Shami event is going to be a
jam a about you know the whole city has
come to a standstill because of this
Roadshow with Rahul Priyanka and Joe
creditors and I have done so keep saying
that I would say that yes she has come
she has taken over the office now but a
little baffling that she didn't make the
speech it's a pretty low profile start
by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra maybe I think
doesn't want to give the impression that
she's going to overshadow Rahul Gandhi
because you know she's a better orator
that way and more mesmerizing in terms
of political personality so my takeaway
is that Priyanka was very cautious in
terms of what she says and anyhow a lot
of events have also I would say affected
the schedule like today she is flying
back to Jaipur where mr. Vadra is
getting interrogated by evey but
nonetheless the political impact has
been made within the Congress party by
Ravi and that impact is that well you
know it's a tough thing you know you pee
Congress 6% 2014 only 7% but the worker
has turned out and I think that will
make a difference for the Congress party
that at least worker feels pretty kicked
about the fact that you know Priyanka is
in charge the people are the workers
from the Western you P feel that well
she should have also been given the
charge of big place like royal card and
Western with the finish but III
say that overall she has got the
publicity she has got the TV time
Congress and Priyanka will have to prove
that works real time when it comes to
the organization right Coptic a thanks
very much indeed for joining us with the
latest there and as Karthik is mentioned
of course it is her debut after joining
politics officially but also a debut on
Twitter but she hasn't really tweeted so
far so we will see how that pans out as
well as the millions of people have
taken to the streets of Iran in people's
March to mark the 40th anniversary of
the Iranian Revolution so just students
clerics women and children thronged the
streets of several Iranian cities and

himself on the back for what he calls
tremendous progress in talks with North
Korea his own intelligence chief told
the Congress just last week that they
have no reason to believe that Kim
jong-un will give up his nuclear weapons
the US intelligence believes the nuclear
program is key to the survival of Kim
Jong Un's regime we currently assess
that North Korea will seek to retain its
WMD capabilities and is unlikely to
completely give up its nuclear weapons
and production capabilities because its
leaders ultimately view nuclear weapons
as critical to regime survival our
assessment is bolstered by our
observations of some activity that is
inconsistent with full denuclearization
while we assess that sanctions on
exports have been effective and largely
maintained North Korea seeks to mitigate
the effects of the us-led pressure
campaign through diplomatic engagement
counter pressure against the sanctions
regime and direct sanctions evasion
Vince Trump and Kim's first meeting
serious doubts have been raised over
whether Donald Trump can get Kim jong-un
to walk the talk Trump and Kim's
landmark summit in June yielded a
commitment back him to work towards
eliminating his nuclear arsenal but
satellite video footage taken since the
historic June summit revealed that North
Korea has a secret missile base and that
it continues to produce nuclear
materials at its weapons factories just
yesterday a United Nations report said
that North Korea's nuclear and ballistic
missile programs remain intact
according to that report North Korea is
making sure that if nuclear and military
capabilities are not destroyed by
military strikes and that Pyongyang is
using civilian facilities including its
Airport for ballistic missile assembly
and testing is that North Korea is
making sure that its nuclear and
capabilities cannot be destroyed in
August the United Nations nuclear
watchdog the International Atomic Energy
Agency said that it found no indication
that North Korea had stopped its nuclear
activities when the US Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo then visited North
Korea in October Kim jong-un committed
to dismantling and destroying his
country's catonian and uranium
enrichment facilities Kim said that he
would do this in return for
corresponding measures from the United
States it has repeatedly demanded that
the US must reciprocate with measures
such as sanctions relief but Washington
has said it is not willing to lift
sanctions Washington has also called for
North Korea to take steps such as
providing a detailed account of its
nuclear and missile facilities that
would be inspected and dismantled under
a potential deal let's go straight
across for now to our correspondent Kate
Fisher who's joining us from Washington
DC a kid a lot of those issues need to
be ironed out before the two leaders
meet Donald Trump hopes to extract
pleasures from Kim jong-un he says
without giving too much ground but North
Korea has yet to even declare a list of
its weapons facilities or allow
independent inspectors which has been
the primary demand that's been made by
Washington all this while how divided
are the US government officials on what
the expectations are from a second
summit well I think the biggest division
can be seen by what the president Donald
Trump is saying and what his
intelligence officials are saying Donald
Trump very clear that he believes that
North Korea is no longer a nuclear
threat to the world he believes that
there is now Pisa
now now friendship between the two
countries and he believes that North
Korea is beginning the denuclearization
process however just last week on
Capitol Hill his top intelligence
officials the Director of National
Intelligence and the head of the CIA
Gina Haspel gave evidence to the US
Congress telling them that
they believe that North Korea still
intends to be a nuclear regime it
continues to work on its nuclear program
Jena Haspel the head of the CIA saying
that they do want to create a long-range
missile that would be able to reach the
United States they both said that this
this has not changed since that
Singapore summit with Donald Trump so
there you have the division the
intelligence chief saying that North
Korea really hasn't made much progress
whereas the president saying yes North
Korea has made a lot of progress indeed
and a kid the US envoy to North Korea
will be holding talks this week to
finalize the agenda for that second
summit what are you picking up on what
Trump's list of demands could look like
yeah well the Americans have been very
clear they want to see a full
declaration of all those nuclear sites
in North Korea and then they want the
North Koreans to commit to destroying
them and crucially they want to make
sure that there is international
observation of that destruction they
want it to be done under supervision so
that there is verification that this
destruction has happened so those are
the key demands for the United States

on the broadcast or with the latest

one of the many issues that the leader
touched upon in that State of the Union
address it was a divided Congress to say
the least the address lasted 82 minutes
during which the leaders spoke about a
range of issues including building a
border wall with Mexico which has been a
source of deep partisan divide in the
u.s. he said that the border walls work
and they save lives
Congress has ten days left to pass a
bill that will fund our government
protect our homeland and secure our very
dangerous southern border now is the
time for Congress to show the world that
America is committed to ending illegal
immigration and putting the ruthless
coyotes cartels drug dealers and human

from their communities are getting
trucks and buses to bring them up to our
country in areas where there is little
border protection I have ordered another
three thousand seven hundred and fifty
troops to our southern border to prepare
for this tremendous onslaught from China
to Venezuela to Afghanistan Donald Trump
devoted a large section of that address
to foreign policy seeing a trade deal
was possible with with China
if Beijing agrees to real structural
change there however was no mention of
the shutdown at all on the Trump
administration the u.s. witnessed its
longest ever shutdown which lasted 35
days and affected around 800,000 federal
workers and federal contractors
government employees missed two
paychecks but the president brushed the
entire episode aside on to Pakistan for
now with a Supreme Court earlier in the

they should stay away from engaging in
political activities delivering its
judgment in the 2017 Theory kilobyte
Pakistan said in protest the Supreme
Court also directed the government to
act against those propagating hatred
extremism and terrorism the court said
and I'm quoting we direct the federal

those advocating hate extremism and
terrorism and prosecute the perpetrators
in accordance with the law the apex
court also outlawed religious fatwa that
aim to harm others the verdict also
noted that every citizen and political
party has the right to assemble and
protest provided such assembly and
protest are peaceful but those who
obstruct people's right to use roads or
mhmm should be dealt with in accordance

about sit in case assume although that

to admit review petitions seeking a

untouchability last year the verdict set
off a massive street protest in Kerala

girls between the ages of 10 and 50 from
entering the shrine one of the two women

slugfest between Kerala as CPM or
Communist Party and the opposition
parties

Jessica Tunisia with video journalist
neeraj Patel Wells it's one New Delhi
now talks between the Taliban and senior
Afghan politicians that began in Moscow
s today despite no official from the
current of god government in attendance
now they've been described as fruitful
by both the sides on day two of the
talks Afghanistan's president Ashraf
Ghani is however dismissed the talks and
said that the attending officials have
no negotiating Authority meanwhile
Afghanistan's former President Hamid
Karzai who is part of the delegation
said that the talks of so far gone well
and that he wishes for the Afghan
government to be a part of them at a
later stage talks about the adoption of
a new constitution and interim
government and women's rights were
discussed by the delegations in Russian
capital city of Moscow the talks also
come ten days after peace negotiations
between the u.s. and the Taliban in
Qatar in Doha and in what signs of
progress we understand that the
government in Kabul needs to be part of
these negotiations
we wish that they would would have been
here today but that's an issue that has
to be resolved between the Islamic root
of the Taliban whose representatives are
here to speak about and their can
government meanwhile US Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo spoke with
Afghanistan's president Ashraf Ghani to
reaffirm the US commitment to achieving
lasting peace in Afghanistan the US
Secretary of State understood
special representative for Afghanistan
reconciliation Valmet al-assad's role in
facilitating an inclusive peace process
u.s. president Crump while delivering
the State of the Union address this
morning had also said that the
negotiations to reach a political
settlement in Afghanistan had been
accelerated the secretary of state of
the US Mike Pompeo also emphasized the
importance of an intra of God dialogue
on the role of a ceasefire in ending the
violence in the region remember
President of Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani
has said that no peace deal between the
Taliban and the u.s. could be finalized
without involving his government as the
decision-maker Julia Chapman gets us
more man have been making a number of
demands or during these ongoing talks
not least that the Afghan government
create a new constitution for the
country which is based on Islamic law
that's one of their demands they've also
been asking for sanctions against them
to be lifted and for the u.s. to release
any of its Taliban prisoners in
Afghanistan so those are some of the
demands that they've been making but as
far as concessions we understand that
there are suggestions that the Taliban
could also vow to end cooperation with
al Qaeda and the Islamic state terrorist
groups so that some progress on that
side but whether that concession will
actually be made or whether any concrete
agreement will come of that remains to
be seen but it does appear that there is
some sort of movement on these talks
they do seem to be going reasonably well
between these parties but of course as
you say some of the major players simply
are not here in Moscow the Russian
government is not actually participating
the US government is not participating
and of course most
of all the Afghan government is not
involved the Taliban refuses to
acknowledge their Authority and
President Ashraf Ghani says that he
won't deal with the Taliban because they
don't acknowledge that he is the
rightful leader of Afghanistan and that
his government has the authority so he's
dismissed these talks as nothing more
than a fairy tale and he says no
concrete progress can be made without
the decision-maker and that he says is
himself Britain's Prime Minister Theresa
May will be taking questions from
lawmakers in the parliament today and
this comes about reports of the United
Kingdom's cabinet ministers having held
a secret meeting to deal a frenzy by
eight weeks if delayed grexit will be
postponed to the last week of May
instead of the end of March
according to reports ministers in the
United Kingdom are hoping for a two
month grace period from the European
Union if terrorism is deal to provide
additional time for necessary
legislation passes through the
Parliament Landin and Brussels are
currently arguing over the possibility
of changing the present bread's a deal
thus raising the chances of a dealing in
Britain pulling out of the block there
is a may volt travel to Brussels
tomorrow to meet the European Union's
leader she is expected to present the
prospectus of either accepting the
legally binding changes to the Irish
border arrangements of brexit or face a
disorderly no deal present we have Mandy
Clark or London be achieved joining us
live Mandy talk to us more about this
secret meeting that pretty much
headlines in our newspapers across
Britain and when this news is being
picked up of Theresa May facing
questions from UK's lawmakers yeah
absolutely and we're also hearing that
the opposition party labour is backing a
very similar deal to force that change
in article 50 article 50 is the what
what forces that end date they want to
delay in it as well because it's very
clear that there is a stalemate in the
British Parliament it's all to do with
this Irish backs off that's the singular
biggest issue a lot of the brexit tears
the more hardline essentially Europe
purchase really don't want it at all in
there they see it as a secret way for
the EU to bind them indefinitely to the
union of course the EU says absolutely
not it will not get rid of that backstop
it's the only way to guarantee peace a
lot of people forget that Northern
Ireland was with the scene of great
violence 3,000 people dead over the
periods what it was known as the
troubles nobody wants to go back to that
period nobody wants to put a hard border
they feel that it's more important that
these the backstop protecting that peace
in the region
continues so it seems like both sides
are a stalemate and the only way forward
really is a delay with to avoid crashing
out because that will damage both
economies it seems like a repetition
there just simply has not been a major
breakthrough and their level of
frustration on both sides is really
culpable that they can't get a deal
through one that will appeal to both
sides if Teresa mate goes back to the
Brussels which is planning to do
tomorrow and can't get a deal that will
pass the UK Parliament it's it's useless
so she's really between a rock and a
hard place with both sides saying
they're not gonna budge

you know Chaplin is now joining us live
from Moscow for the very latest on these
peace talks that are underway in Russia
as we speak between members
representatives from Afghanistan Taliban
and of course other member countries as
well and Julia where are we at these
Moscow talks so far we believe that the
Taliban has asked for a new constitution
in Islamic state that is far away from
Western influences that the current
Constitution under Ashraf Ghani has yes
that's right the Taliban have been
making a number of demands or during
these ongoing talks not least that the
Afghan government create a new

himself right Julia had some very
important points being highlighted there
by Julia Chapman reporting from Moscow
saying many of the important
stakeholders not present at this meeting
so the legitimacy of this will be
questioned at some point as well Julia
thanks very much indeed for joining us
with the latest
well after months of frenzied yellow
west protest the French parliament has
now passed a new bill that aims to curb
violent protests in the country the bill
was passed with an overwhelming majority
in the response to a wave of
anti-government yellow west agitations
that have rocked France in the past two
months the new aunty hooligan law bans
protesters from hiding their faces it
also gives police greater powers to
extract potential troublemakers from
demonstrations and grants local
authorities the right to ban individual
protesters early even Iran Purdue
l'affaire Alito Casilla says parity
between
any foster owner so in a public utility
speech meanwhile for the first time
since the start of the anti-government
protests French unions have also joined
the yellow West protesters thousands of
protesters hailing from the French
union's marched with the yellow s
protesters in the Western French city of
Nantes and the capital Paris to protest
the French president Emmanuel MCOs
government protesters carrying banners
and flags chanted anti-government
slogans hundreds marched to denounce the
difficult conditions in the country's
employment sector and income inequality
Highfill studio where devastation
communalism a Okinawa's Okada feedback

capital C course information a ensemble
osmeña
master the total patronum energy
yeah it is all economic DeCoteau hope at
all to speak a my colleague Elena's now
joining us live from Paris for the very
latest on this government law that is
brought in to curtail protesters
Andolini what are the details of this
new law that the French government has
brought and how is it going to in any
way help while the protesters are now
being joined by union union groups as
well
so the more controversial aspects of the
bill are that it creates a list of known
troublemakers who would be banned from
future protests it allows police to set
up a security perimeter around protests
and treat cheetah's and treat it rather
as you would for example a football
stadium on match day everyone going in
which have their identity checked and
those who are on the banned list
wouldn't be allowed to pass it also bans
people from covering their faces during
a demonstration it's been described by
Amnesty International amongst other NGOs
as extremely dangerous for civil
liberties and it's extremely
controversial in at the heart of
president macrons own la république on
marsh party yesterday's votes or more
than 50 pro macron MPs refused to
support the law they abstained and it
was only passed with the basis of
support from the la république a
center-right opposition this isn't the
final vote on this bill it then has to
go to the Senate and then come back to
the Ehsan later so now and the MPs for a
final vote so it's not likely to end up
on Mac Ron's desk for signing before
around the middle of March right alina
so thanks for that so the front well
yellow rests protests continue in France
now and the government of course is now
pushing that law which still has a long
way to go but Alina stay with us now the
other big story of course so for the
first time in the history of the
Catholic Church the Pope has publicly
acknowledged the scandal of priests and
bishops sexually abusing nuns speaking
at the news conference while returning
to Rome from the United Arab Emirates
support not only acknowledged the
problem but vowed to do more to fight
the problem the acknowledgement comes
just two weeks before the Pope hosts an
unprecedented gathering of Bishops to
craft a global response to scandal of
priests who target children and the
superiors who have covered up the crime
as well
and that's also a very tender della
chiesa just a tourniquet a cavity in our
Pony not pony she didn't say she only
popular for today we are three no-name
Nicole's architect if an oppa drama
she's honestly such a dirty yankee
basically
and well it's still with us and he'll
you know well how important is this
announcement by the Pope himself now
there have been so many scandals when it
comes to the Catholic Church but this is
the first admission and the highest
level and could possibly improve things
going forward yes this is the first
omission by the church that priests or
bishops have conducted abuse of nuns
which is a long-running scandal within
the church there are numerous cases in
Latin America in India in Italy it's
thought that the Pope was specifically
referring to a case that happened here
in France where there was an
intervention by the previous Pope
Benedict's against a group called the
Confederation of sisters of st. John
where there was in South France where
there was a serial abuser a priest who
was a serial abuser who passed away some
years ago but who was thought to be
responsible for abusing a number of nuns
so it is the first public admission that
this problem exists and it comes as you
were saying there just two weeks before
the Pope it gathers of bishops and
Cardinals from around the world in Rome
for a conference on what the church
should do to move on from these abuse
scandals obviously a very difficult -
very controversial topic for the Pope to
address and something he rarely talks
about in public but an important an
important admission that this that this
long going ongoing historical problem
and then deed current problem with the
sexual abuse norman's exists right early
and thanks very much indeed for joining
us with the latest on that big story
coming in with Pope Francis there
announcing that action will be taken at
some level to stop the sexual abuse that
has ridden the church for many years now
well in news from India now in a major
boost for women in Kerala the
the Rossum board which managers Sabri
mala and the shine has told the Supreme
Court that women of all age groups will
be allowed to pray at the Lord Aiyappa
temple the five just constitutional
bench of the Supreme Court today heard
over sixty petitions that sought a
rethink of the verdict during the
hearing justice Indu Malhotra the lone
dissenting judge in the shop shabarimala
wording specifically asked the board's
counsel if that was the stand the board
wanted to take the boat's lawyer darkish
Nevada replied that the board has now
decided to respect the judgement and has
also filed an application in this regard
meanwhile Supreme Court has reserved its
order on whether to admit review
petitions seeking review of its sub
ramallah body earlier appearing for the
night service society the senior
advocate Shekar 'nobody argued that
religion is essentially a matter of
faith and the court must in mustn't
interfere unless a practice is barred by
criminal law the petitioners lawyer also
told the court that only the community
can decide the custom and not the courts
arguing its case the kerala government
has called on the top court not to
review the shibaemon event a verdict the
kerala government argued that the
exclusion of women is not essential to
the hindu religion as women are allowed
in other I of our temples the Supreme
Court in its judgement in September had
said with a practice barring women from
the temple is akin to untouchability
last year the verdict set off a massive
street protest in Kerala the annual
pilgrimage seasons saw violent protests
as devotees of Lord Ayyappa the celibate
court tried to stop women and girls
between the ages of 10 and 50 years from
entering the shine one of the two women
who eventually managed to enter the
temple in January was even attacked
allegedly by her mother-in-law the issue
has also triggered a political slugfest
between Kerala CPM and other opposition
parties
and Jessica Tunisia our special
correspondent is now joining us live
from New Delhi for the latest on what
the Supreme Court is has said and is
expected to do and now Jessica take us
to the court proceedings today and that
review petition for now has been
reserved the judgment on it has been
reserved so what do we expect next
well therapy the court will now give out
its judgment whether that review please
will be entertained or not or whether
the course will actually agree to the
view its own judge children and I must
admit that it's a bit severe that the
code reviews its own judgement specially
in cases like these and in the past as
well you see the review is also they
were reviews filed earlier as well but
the court had in fact said that it will
possibly take some more time to look
into this that is why this bench was
called in and it earlier had said that
the supreme Allah the supreme Allah a
judgment that is given out will be in
full force and it has to be enforced by
the state government but what's
important to understand from today's
hearing is 56 review petitions that's a
lot of petitions challenging a court
judgment which had allowed menstruating
women to enter temple now the arguments
were based on the idea of constitutional
morality in article 25 which is where
the freedom to practice religion and
also on article 15 part true which in
fact talks about the issue of
untouchability and the court did expand
you know the scope on the issue of
untouchability here but at the same time
justice joins another man made it clear
that he did rely on that but the counsel
for the petitioner should not be under
any socials you know I had no suspension
that this will not this is exactly what
he sort of wanted to come out with at
the same time apart from that in in
rejecting also submitted to court saying
that the two women had been threatened
to their lives and their mother was also
been threatened early morning you know
with with various sorts of all sorts of
threats that we've been receiving
specially on calls and so people just
barge in so she also made made her [ __ ]
of you know a point where she where she
says that women have equal rights so
given all of this where we the important
takeaway is the travel collation board
as you were talking about now this board
you're the affairs inside the temple and
this boat today does the court that they
respect the judgment they're not seeking
a review that came of the Shocker for
many especially for justice and Omarosa
the only dissenting judge in in this in
this judgment and she was rather taken
by surprise when she said oh this is
what your submissions were and she had
heavily relied on them true so this was
not only surprising for her but also all
of us in here in the case they're true
but this review of course very very
important but still as we've heard women
know and you know a lot of women has
still not being able to enter it's just
called an act of defiance rather than
their right right Jessica thanks very
much indeed for joining us with the

disputed by Democrats including Nancy

voted for a wall but the proper wall
never got built I will get it built this

the visit of Pope Francis to the United
Arab Emirates is a story of many parts
with implications in India too but first
things first
it was a 40 hour long power packed visit
it has made Pope Francis the first
pontiff to set foot in the Arabian
Peninsula what was he doing there he was
trying to improve or so we are told the
understanding and relationship of the
church with other faiths Pope Francis
held the first ever papal Mass in the
UAE today it was attended by 135,000
Catholics the biggest show of Christian
worship in the Gulf region Pope Francis
spoke about several issues of global

has two main objectives he wants to work
with the leaders of the Muslim world to
make West Asia safer for Christians
before the first world war around 20
percent of the world's Christians lived
in this region the number has now fallen
to 4% mainly due to violence and
sectarian tension the choice of UAE is
also significant it is home to more than
1 million Christians many of them are
immigrants from India and the
Philippines this visit made headlines
around the world from the Pope's
messages to his choice of car from the
attendance at his mass to the performers
for the event everything has been
reported in colorful detail the world
over our next report sums up the head of
the highlights for more than 1 million
Christians living in the UAE a wizard by
the Pope is a stuff of dreams
I would hobby volt of the red carpet for
the pontiff upon arrival he was given a
royal welcome souvenir shops has some
special offerings for the occasion
perhaps the most awaited event was the
outdoor Mass this was the first papal
Mass on the Arabian Peninsula more than
100 thousand Catholics attended the mass
that was organized inside a stadium the
Pope waved to his followers from his car
they cheered as he moved through the
crowd
[Applause]
it's an amazing gesture for the year of
Tolerance it's definitely showing how
amazing and open they are I'm very
excited I think everyone is too I think
it's very nice
everyone can be so open and free here it

report beyond the pope's travels to
foreign lands are now looked at with a
magnifying glass unlike some of his
predecessors Pope Francis has spoken
candidly on some major global issues he
doesn't shy away from weighing in on
homosexuality he has spoken about the
dangers of climate change
he has waded into the politics of the
Yemen war he has raised awareness about
fake news even venezuela's President
Maduro has appealed to the Pope to
resolve the political impasse in his
country in short he's not your typical
Pope restricting himself to matters of
religion he's a political man who
unabashedly takes political positions
and influences agenda
when Pope Francis traveled to Dublin in
August last year thousands of people had
come out on the streets of the city
protesters were raising their voice
against the sexual abuse scandal
surrounding the church a former official

is a challenging time for the Catholic
Church the traditional values of
Christianity are being challenged by the
rapid advances of mankind
popular commentary claims that Pope
Francis is trying to introduce more
progressive values at the Catholic
Church but some of his statements have
even forced the politicians to sit up
and take notice back in 2017
he called on world leaders to fight
hunger conflicts and climate change
Qantas on la víctima de la Rey nutrition

who his heavenly God owes her sutiaba
he poniendo SIA muchas it a really
formal a protozoan it would be fair to
say that Pope Francis is a politically
engaged leader in recent days the Pope
has spoken candidly on issues of global
interest
in January he shared his views about the
political crisis in Venezuela and backed
the need for sex education reckoning lo
que siento su su propia tapas and the
Venezuela at the moment people if so
they say okay se pone and a quarter now
say tampoco the silverhawks were totally
true creo que in las escuelas que de

communications did
Pope Francis denounced fake news in his
message he said fake news is a sign of
intolerant and hypersensitive attitudes
and leads only to the spread of
arrogance and hatred that is the end
result of untruth
reforming the Catholic Church is a major
challenge but the Pope through his
statements and writings is indeed
leaving his influence on contemporary
issues Bureau report
worldís 1 Pope Francis has often been
called the Pope of many firsts he
believes that the church should be more
open and welcoming he has a less formal
approach to the papacy that's the office
held by the Pope in the last five years
the pontiff has made several significant
breakthroughs he abolished bonuses paid
to Vatican employs upon the election of
a new pope he scrubbed an annual bonus
paid to the Cardinal serving on the
board of supervisors of the Vatican Bank
he signed a historic agreement between
the Vatican and China for the first time
the Pope recognized seven bishops
appointed by an entity other than the
church in this case the government of
China he is progressive the pontiff has
also travelled far and wide to spread
Christianity doubts still remain over
whether he'll be able to reform the
Vatican but there is little doubt about
the fact that he's trying to redefine
the role of the Pope
so we asked these questions tonight can
the Pope do what political leaders have
not been able to do in the past is the
Pope just a religious head or a highly
visible global celebrity and political
influencer
he heads the Vatican or the Holy See
which is treated as
separate country the world over it has
an embassy in India and diplomatic ties
so should the Pope then be treated as a
head of state or a religious figurehead
it is clear that the Pope's political
views influence people beyond his
Catholic flock taken years example the
church has political presence in this
country as in any other country it has
even been accused of partisanship and
let me share some little-known facts
with you before I go ahead with this
catholic bishops and cardinals all over
the world are appointed by the pope
those in india may be Indian citizens
but they're essentially acting as
ambassadors of the Vatican in India they
do the Vatican's bidding in the past few
years they've run into controversy by
asking their followers to vote against
the ruling NDA should this be seen as
foreign meddling considering they report
to the Vatican does this cross the line
between the church in the state it's
worth mentioning that the church has
considerable soft power in India as well
according to the 2011 census the church
owns or controls around 20,000
educational institutions at second only
to the central government the government
of India when religious institutions
assume political power when they enter
in the domain of power politics they
step on tricky terrain the critics of
Pope Francis see him doing that both in
West Asia and in India and elsewhere in
the world three days after she went on
an indefinite strike West Bengal Chief
Minister Mamata Banerjee has called it
off that doesn't mean that she's giving
up in fact she's escalating it she's
taking the protest to the national
capital next listening these know

all these leaders rallying behind her
the West Bengal Chief Minister is
planning the second part of these
protests she has decided to organize a
three-day long demonstration in New
Delhi starting the 12th of February
while details of the agitation have not
been finalized it is definitely an
opportunity for the opposition to put up
a united front and Mamata Banerjee has a
target well within her sight I require

asked to appear before the CBI at a
neutral location interestingly they've
decided on Shillong
he's been directed to cooperate with the
CBI the agency had also filed a contempt
of court petition against the Kolkata
Police this petition will be heard on
the 20th of this month so no headway has

rupees that were lost in these chit fund

proceedings over the concerns of the
people talking about public money that
has been lost India seems to be inching
closer to getting fugitive businessman
Vijay Mallya extradite extradited UK
Home Minister Sajid Javid has signed the
extradition order for mr. Mallya eight
weeks after the case was sent to him for
a decision the news was first confirmed
to be on by the spokesperson of the UK
Home Ministry the decision has been
hailed in India and is being seen as a
huge diplomatic success for the Indian
government which has been fighting tooth
and nail to expedite the extradition of
the liquor baron Indian Minister Arun
Jaitley took to Twitter saying and I'm
quoting Modi government clears one more
step to get Mallya extradited while
opposition rallies around the shard are
scamsters remember Vijay Mallya is mired
in a series of legal battles following
the collapse of his airline firm in 2013
various Indian banks have said that he
owes money to them a sum of close to 1.4
billion dollars the government of India
revoked his passport and has sought his
extradition to face fraud charges but
Vijay Mallya has denied the allegations
and it seems that he's not going to bow
down without a fight
Vijay Mallya has made it clear that he
will make yet another attempt to delay
his return to India taking to Twitter he
said that he would appeal against this
decision he wrote and I'm quoting after
the decision was handed down on the 10th
of December 2018 by the Westminster
magistrate's court I stated my intention
to appeal I could not initiate the
appeal process before a decision by the
Home Secretary now I will initiate the
appeal process he won't give up without
a fight he says but mr. Mallya has
appealed will only be considered if the
High Court grants him the permission he
has 14 days to
file an appeal and in in authorities a
hopeful of a favorable outcome in the
days ahead sooner rather than later in
fact that Kingfisher owner has gone from
being the king of good times as he
called himself to India's poster boy of

flight and fall of Vijay Mallya whatever
he did he didn't style
[Music]
liquor baron Vijay Mallya launched the
premier and luxury Kingfisher Airlines
in 2005 he said it was a gift for his
son Seth Hart on his 18th birthday it
soon became the largest privately owned
airline in India following its merger
with Air Deccan Kingfisher Airlines also
managed to secure a coveted slot at the
Heathrow Airport in London but the
airline ran into continuous losses and
finally collapsed in 2013 leaving
creditors suppliers and employees in the
lurch by the end of January 2014 the
airline Ford banks 9,000 crores or more
than 1 billion dollars not just the
bank's dues Kingfisher Airlines never
made any profit during the 7 years when
it was flying it also owed 300 crores
and salaries to thousands of employees
but Malia's own good times continued
Mallya co-owned India's first Formula
One team force India and presented its
2008 car the Vijay m o1 to credit crazy
Indians the same year he picked up a
stake in the Royal Challengers Bangalore
cricket team in the Indian Premier
League or the IPL besides he also had
50% stakes in Kolkata based Mohan began
and he spin ball soccer clubs
he built a luxury Kingfisher villa in
Goa famed for his lavish parties they
were attended by the who's who of the
glamour world he collected dozens of
vintage cars worth millions and
published a Kingfisher Calendar of
Indian models
he himself often appeared in photo
shoots
[Music]
decaf his business achievements Mallya
was elected in 2010 to the upper house
of Indian Parliament but the good times
did not last Mallya was mired in a
growing series of legal battles
following the collapse of his Kingfisher
airline in March 2016 Mallya left India
after banks took a legal course to
recover dues from Kingfisher Airlines on
Twitter he have used everyone from media
houses to banks of trying to spread lies
about him in April 2017 Mallya was
arrested in London by the Scotland Yard
and produced before the Westminster
magistrate's court
shortly afterwards he was granted bail
in December 2018 a British Court finally
ordered his extradition it's unfortunate
that the judge has found a prima facie
case that I made misrepresentations to
idbi bank only and persuade them
persuaded them to loan money to
Kingfisher Airlines be that as it may
the judge was perfectly entitled to make
whatever judgment she thought fit I have
my rights you heard the judge
my legal table considers various options
and then I will decide going forward
with the British government formally
signing the order to extradite him India
is now one step closer to bring back one
of its biggest defaulters one thing is
for sure
Malia's journey back to India if and
when that finally happens will be the
final blow for the man once known as the
king of good times Bureau report
Leon well this one
now the latest in the Afghan peace talks
Moscow is mediating a dialogue between
the Taliban and other players it's a
two-day event conspicuous by its absence
is the Afghan government led by
President Ashraf Ghani on the talking
table are several prominent Afghan
politicians and at least 10 members of
the Taliban peace talks though do not
mean an end to war Taliban launched a
pre-dawn attack on an army base in
northern Afghanistan today killing at
least 26 security personnel in Moscow
Taliban chief negotiator Abbas standards
I said that the group does not consider
the current Afghan Constitution
legitimate and that the blueprint was an
obstacle to peace he said that once the
US forces withdraw from Afghanistan the
Taliban will not demand political
monopoly in order to achieve sustainable
peace
he has demanded that the names of
Taliban leaders be removed from the US
blacklist meanwhile former Afghan
President Hamid Karzai welcomed
America's efforts to push for peace he
also expressed hope that Pakistan and
Afghanistan can afford good relations
going forward in this eight-minute
speech that he delivered Hamid Karzai
highlighted the need for peace and unity
he also told the media that he hopes the
Afghan government will participate in
these talks in the future a very good
meeting and officially will be talking
government is not present because the
Taliban does not recognize them as a
legitimate government they call it
America's puppet Moscow meanwhile is
very keen on being the power broker
being the mediator for peace it has to
look at its assets in Central Asia it is
looking to leverage its position and
it's also looking to redeem some of the
humiliation at face many decades ago
when it had to leave the Soviet Union
had to leave Afghanistan the secret was
not easy after universe topaz knowledge
when a nation Gasca with job of the
suggestion he parameters to advisor in
Italy was possible to liberate the chest
of gas kebab history
then you could tell factories in
yourself beyond sir Julia Chapman
joining us live from Moscow Julia the
Taliban attacks continue even as we are
talking about peace how does that work
have the Taliban given any assurance
towards a ceasefire pending a decision
on peace there's certainly been no word
of that yet and as you say the violence
continues on a daily basis which is why
the Afghan government finds it very
difficult and indeed has refused to sit
down with the Taliban on this particular
occasion and so we're seeing this
meeting taking place here in Moscow
between members of the Taliban
representatives of the Taliban as well
as a number of other Afghan politicians
but not notably the actual
administration of the president so there
is no high-level talk on that level
they're being hosted here in Moscow
although the Russian government is not
actually involved in these talks this is
their they are saying an intra Afghan
dialogue and is not being influenced by
other partners or although of course the
the location of Moscow for the place
that these talks are being held is very
significant Russia of course hosted back
in November some talks between the same
groups but Russia was also involved in
them and the other party that's missing
from these talks on this occasion is the
u.s. who has been meeting with the
Taliban separately and Russian Foreign
Minister Sergey Lavrov has accused
Russia of its accused the u.s. of
holding secret talks with the Taliban
and of trying to dominate the agenda and
the peace process on their own in fact I
was gonna come to that
so the Russians say that the US has been
holding secret talks the u.s. says that
Russia is trying to muddle its peace
process this has become another case of
one-upmanship what is to say that the
Taliban is not gonna play one player
against the other well that's a very
good question and that is certainly a
concern and indeed in their absence the
Afghan government is very concerned that
these high-level talks are being held
without them although the u.s. of course
has helped support the Afghan government
and does acknowledge that they are the
legitimate government they are still
going ahead and holding talks separately
with the Taliban and then we've seen the
Taliban come here to Moscow and hold
separate talk so it's very difficult to
know whether they can be trusted in
those
talks in Qatar last month between the
u.s. and the Taliban some sort of draft
agreement was formed but there have been
some serious concerns from the Afghan
government on that matter there are
concerns that the Taliban is demanding
the dismantling of the Afghan army and
that is something that the Afghan
government simply refuses to do because
of course the Taliban says that the u.s.
having helped the Afghan government form
this and this army formed this military
that it should not be in play anymore it
should be dismantled completely and
rebuilt from scratch and that's
something that the Afghan government
simply refuses to do because they are
very concerned about security in the
country and indeed in the region because
as you say there are attacks still going
on on a daily basis in Afghanistan
Julia Chapman thanks very much this is a
two-day process will you keep track of
what happens there in Moscow in the
intra Afghan peace dialogue as they're
calling it the time meanwhile has come
to save the Himalayas the vast
mountainous region is about to be doomed
say experts and this is threatening
millions of lives will countries meet
the Paris agreement and save the mighty
Himalayas and what happens if they don't
take a look

if glaciers are retreating and the rate
at which they are retreating is of huge
concern about 210 scientists and
analysts based in Nepal have worked
together for three years to release this
report on the glaciers they are warning
us about the consequences of our carbon
dioxide emissions
if we don't reduce our carbon footprint
we will lose about a third of Himalayan
glaciers by the end of this century
Paris agreements most ambitious role is
to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees
Celsius but even this could lead to the
disappearance of 36 percent of the ice
caps in the region the world's third
Pole is warming up faster than the
global average many glaciers across the
Tibetan Plateau and on the eastern
stretches of the mountain range have
retreated twenty to forty seven percent
since 2000 since the 70s the region has
lost 15% of its ice if carbon dioxide
emissions go up the temperatures could
rise further leading to more meltdown
a rise of 2 degrees Celsius could mean a
loss of 50% of the glaciers scientists
from the cart Mondelez international
center for integrated mountain
development have said this is the
climate crisis that we haven't heard of
the Hindukush Himalayan region stretches
across 3,500 kilometers
it covers seven South Asian countries
and China the melt from the region
supplies waters to 250 million people
it feeds rivers that support about 1.65
billion people but how does this concern
the common man for one the repercussions
of the Himalayan glaciers melting will
be felt by us all they will be
devastating
second the disappearance of the glaciers
would make the weather pattern erratic
crop cycles will be affected economic
development will be hampered and health
would deteriorate
there will be more natural disasters
lakes could burst previously reliable
water resources will be disrupted
impacting 10 of the world's most
important river systems including the
Ganges and Indus the authors of the
report have said that it's time they
start paying attention to the mountains
in order to adapt to climate change the
region would require up to 4.6 billion
dollars per year by 2030 this could even
rise to as much as seven point eight
billion dollars per year by 2050 but
will world leaders wake up to the crisis

crackdown on Venezuelan oil exports but
there is another entity another player
that remains hidden or not so
discussed when we talk about the
countries that have the most influence
in South America or the US and Russia I
usually come to mind for the u.s.
influence is crucial due to regional
proximity Russia is the region to roots
rich oil and mineral reserves but China
is increasingly becoming extremely
relevant in the geopolitics of South
America it is China's business interests
that have made the region crucial to
Beijing and for that same reason China
is also important for Latin America 500
billion dollars in trade with Latin
American and Caribbean regions two
hundred and fifty billion dollars in
direct investment
these are Xi Jinping's ambitious plans
for South America in addition to direct
investment China lends through its Exim
Bank and China Development Bank China
has lent for access and influence in a
region that's the backyard of United
States last man China helots second
regional meeting in Chile and announced
plans to make more investments under its
belt and/or initiative in loans alone
China has extended 140 billion dollars
to the region over the last decade with
Bri expanding in the region China will
integrate with the region straight now
why is this important for Beijing one is
oil and another is influence in the
United States and most importantly a
market to sell Chinese goods China needs
to find markets for his excess
production capacity
it needs the oil and raw materials to
produce more at cheaper rates a country
like Venezuela Brazil fits the bill
since 2008 financial crisis China
carefully stepped up its investments
even as the u.s. reduced its investments
in South America
it is an outright battle for influence
and China has not blinked right now
China is the top trade partner for
Brazil Peru and Chile and Xi Jinping has
played his cards wisely through loans
and investments South American countries
have been pulled by China into its orbit
it also has a forum called China Sea lac
which excludes only the US and Canada in
the region but China strategy has its
own risks businesses in the region are
notorious of failing and many of these
countries are in a debt trap stoking
demand and gaining access by investment
is a double-edged sport the return on
China's investments has been extremely
erratic Venezuela is a classic case the
country is struggling to pay its
outstanding debt of nearly twenty
billion dollars the country is in an
economic and political crisis and on the
brink of a governmental breakdown
China's strategy to invest in turn
countries into pawns may backfire but
for now Beijing remains bullish China's
strong presence an aggressive push to
expand trade in South America may
boomerang but it's there silently
hedging its bets and tracking
developments in the background even with
the US Russia Spain and European Union
taking sides on issues in various
countries but China has more to lose in
South America and hence it's treading
warily the report beyond what is one the
much-awaited Chinese Lunar New Year is
finally here and this is how the year of
the pig is being celebrated across the
world especially in East Asia it's that
time of the year again to welcome the
year of the pig

well our top story and this should worry
all of us the world could lose at least
a third of the Himalayan glaciers by the
end of the century report by the
International Center for integrated
mountain development has flagged the
need to limit global warming the report
suggests that the region is warming
faster than the global average the
report highlights that even if global
warming is limited to 1.5 degrees
Celsius 36 percent of the glaciers in
the Hindukush Himalayan region will have
disappeared by 2100 it could have
devastating consequences on the lives of
those living in the mountains as well as
downstream remember the Paris climate
agreements target is 1.5 degrees Celsius
the report says that if the current
emissions continue the mountains could
see temperatures rise further by the end
of 2100 Filippis Westar a scientist said
in a statement that this is the climate
crisis you haven't heard off many
glaciers across the region particularly
on the Tibetan Plateau and on the
eastern stretches of the mountain range
have retreated by somewhere between 20
to 40 percent since 2000 since the 1970s
about 15 percent of the ice in the Hindu
Kush region has disappeared as
temperatures have risen now let us take
you to take a look at what the Hindu
Kush Himalayan region is while revision
stretches across 3,500 kilometers it is
home to the world's highest peaks of
Mount Everest and k2 Eurasian harbors
30,000 square miles of glacier ice this
is more than anywhere else outside the
Arctic and Antarctica and it's hence
referred to as a third Pole
it covers eight countries Afghanistan
Bangladesh Bhutan China India Myanmar
Nepal and Pakistan the glaciers supply
water to 250 million people the water
from the glacier flows into rivers and
supports 1.65 billion people so what
would its melting mean for these people
well for one farmers will have to go
higher up the mountains to farm for
those living
it would mean a change in snow and rain
patterns flooding or reverse or more
national disasters it would also lead to
unpredictable water resources for those
living in the mountainous regions the
change in flow of rivers would impact
hydropower production and also cause
more soil erosion the flow of the
Yangtze the Mekong in the Indus and the
Ganga are also expected to be disrupted
Philip us Westar says that the high it
is high time we start paying attention
to the mountains this comprehensive
report contains 650 pages of assessment
about 210 people have worked together
for three years to release this report
well let's move on to other news now in
the US President Donald Trump has been
hailing tremendous progress in his
dealings with North Korea but now a
United Nations report has highlighted
that North Korea's nuclear and ballistic
missile programs remain intact according
to the report North Korea is making sure
that its nuclear and military
capabilities are not destroyed by
military strikes the report comes at a
time when Trump and North Korean leader
Kim Jong hoon are planning to hold their
second summit this month the report
found that Pyongyang is using civilian
facilities for ballistic missile
assembly and testing this also includes
the airport now the region says that
there is the report says that there is
evidence of a consistent trend on the
part of the North Korean government to
disperse its assembly storage and
testing locations not just that the
country has also been defying UN
Security Council resolutions by
increasing illegal ship-to-ship
transfers of petroleum and coal the
report said that they had evidence of
petroleum product transfer of more than
57,000 600 barrels which is worth 5.7
million dollars now North Korea has also
been accused of violating a UN arms
embargo the report says that the country
has been trying to sell military
equipment to West Asia Africa Libya
Sudan as well as the Houthi rebels in
Yemen
meanwhile the US special envoy to North
Korea - vegan will be traveling to
Pyongyang tomorrow to prepare for the
second u.s. North Korea summit the date
of the summit is expected to be
announced later this week
remember Trump and Kim's landmark summit
which took place last June yielded a
commitment by kim jeong-hoon to work
towards eliminating his nuclear arsenal
when US stuff on secretary Mike Pompeo
visited North Korea in October Kim
committed to dismantle and destroy his
country's plutonium and uranium
enrichment facilities Kim said that he
would do this in return for
corresponding measures from the United
States vegan has said that these
corresponding measures will be discussed
in talks this week it is not the first
time however report has flagged North
Korea's real intentions last week the
director of the US National Intelligence
downcourt said that North Korea was not
likely to give up all its nuclear
weapons in August and the UN nuclear
watchdog International Atomic Energy
Agency it also said that it found no
indication that North Korea had stopped
its nuclear program for more than 1,000
people 100,000 people attended the first
papal mass in the Arabian Peninsula
which marked the conclusion of the
historic visit of Pope Francis the first
search by any Pope to the United Arab
Emirates
but the pontiff was also on a diplomatic
and image building mission trying to
restore the role and the credibility of
the Catholic Church in West Asia and
beyond a West Asia bureau chief Daniel
Pagani has the story
both Francis is the first pontiff to set
foot on the Arabian Peninsula an area
broadly ruled by a conservative version
of the Muslim faith in Saudi Arabia
churches and Christian symbols are
forbidden and believers must hide to
celebrate mass a remembrance of what
used to happen during the Roman Empire
when Christianity was considered illegal
both France has stayed in the UAE a
country seen as the least restrictive
for Christians in the Gulf one of the
few places in West Asia where the number
of Christians is rising there are
roughly a million Christians living in
the Emirates primarily immigrants more
than 130,000 believers from more than
100 countries and all branches of
Christianity attended the first papal
Mass in the Arabian Peninsula
[Music]
they were imagine that I will see the
pop in this country you have a tease me

[Music]
the UAE remains a strictly Muslim
country by propagation of faiths other
than the Islam is prohibited Pope
Francis attended an interfaith
conference and brotherhood between
Muslims and Christians he signed a
treaty of human fraternity with a grand
Imam of Egypt's al-zahraa mosque one of
the highest authority in Sunni Islam
Kenema diva Holly earth what will Muslim

directed to my brothers the Muslims in
the east you must continue to embrace
your brothers Christian citizens
everywhere they are partners in our
nation and our siblings whom the holy
quran deems as closes and in the
fellowship towards us the Pope was also
on a diplomatic mission aimed at easing
the situation for Christians in the
region the Pope is also called the
pontiff action means one who builds a
bridge and he could be a bridge builder
being in a country where Christians are
well tolerated but it's not her place we
are all expats we don't belong here and
there we need to be accepted and
recognized as someone belonging to this
country
all these are aspirations of people
Christians suffered at the hands of the
Islamic state terror group in the area
surrounding the Iraqi city of Mosul
terrorists used to mark Christian houses
painting the red letter n on their doors
standing for nurse Ronnie the old Arabic
word for Christians those who could not

the on world is one well back home a day
after the UK government ordered the
extradition of fugitive Indian
businessman Vijay Mallya has made it
clear that he will make yet another
attempt to delay his return to India
taking to Twitter Mallya said that he
would appeal against the decision he
wrote and I quote after the decision was
handed down on December 10 2008 him by
the Westminster magistrates court I
stated my intention to appeal I could
not initiate the appeal process before a
decision by the Home Secretary now I
will initiate the appeal process of code
but Malia's appeal will only be
considered give the High Court grants
him the permission earlier the UK Home
Minister Sajid Javid signed the
extradition order eight weeks after the
case was sent to him for a decision the
noose was first confirmed to be on by
the spokesperson of the UK Home Ministry
the decision has been hailed in India
and is being seen as a huge diplomatic
success for the Indian government which
has been fighting tooth and nail to
expedite the extradition of the liquor
baron the Indian Union Minister Arun
Jaitley took to Twitter and say
Modi government cheers one more step to
get Mallya extradited while opposition
that rallies around start saw the
scamsters on court the government
sources was it old beyond that they are
awaiting the early completion of the
legal process for Malia's extradition
so the Kingfisher owner has of course
gone from being the king of good times
to India's poster boy for loan defaults
here's a look at the rise and fall of
which Amalia whatever he did he didn't
style liquor baron Vijay Mallya launched
the premier and luxury Kingfisher
Airlines in 2005 he said it was a gift
for his son Seth Hart on his 18th
birthday it soon became the largest
privately owned airline in India
following its merger with Air Deccan
Kingfisher Airlines also managed to
secure a coveted slot at the Heathrow
Airport in London
but the airline ran into continuous
losses and finally collapsed in 2013
leaving creditors suppliers and
employees in the lurch by the end of
January 2014 the airline port banks
9,000 crores or more than 1 billion
dollars not just the bank's dues
Kingfisher Airlines never made any
profit during the 7 years when it was
flying it also owed 300 crores and
salaries to thousands of employees
but Malia's own good times continued
Mallya co-owned India's first Formula
One team force India and presented its
2008 car the Vijay m o1 to cricket crazy
Indians the same year he picked up a
stake in the Royal Challengers Bangalore
cricket team in the Indian Premier
League or the IPL besides he also has
50% stakes in Kolkata based Mohan began
and he spangled soccer clubs
he built a luxury Kingfisher villa in
Goa famed for his lavish parties they
were attended by the who's who of the
glamor world he collected dozens of
vintage cars worth millions and
published a Kingfisher Calendar of
indian models he himself often appeared
in photoshoots
[Music]
to cap his business achievements Mallya
was elected in 2010 to the upper house
of Indian Parliament but the good times
did not last Mallya was mired in a
growing series of legal battles
following the collapse of his Kingfisher
airline in March 2016 Mallya left India
after banks took a legal course to
recover dues from Kingfisher Airlines on
Twitter he accused everyone from media
houses to banks of trying to spread lies
about him in April 2017 Mallya was
arrested in London by the Scotland Yard
and produced before the Westminster
magistrate's court
shortly afterwards he was granted bail
in December 2018 a British Court finally
ordered his extradition it's unfortunate
that the judge has found a prima facie
case that I made misrepresentations to
idbi bank only and persuade them
persuaded them to loan money to
Kingfisher Airlines be that as it may
the judge was perfectly entitled to make
whatever judgment she thought fit I have
my rights you heard the judge
my legal table considers various options
and then I will decide going forward
with the British government formally
signing the order to extradite him India
is now one step closer to bring back one
of its biggest defaulters one thing is
for sure
Malia's journey back to India if and
when that finally happens will be the
final blow for the man once known as the
king of good times Bureau report beyond

so that is the latest now that month the
Banshee be drawing turnout there in West
Bengal but let's move on to other news
now and president Donald Trump is
scheduled to give his State of the Union
address on Tuesday Washington time and
while all eyes will be on an important
announcement on the border wall or the
impending threat of another shutdown one
thing to watch out for will be the guest
lineup for up to four this year and for
the address of the president now the
White House has announced a list of 13
Americans who will attend the State of
the Union address as guest the guest
whom the White House invites to the
State of the Union typically served to
help put a face on policies which the
president will promote in the national
televised address the policies include
immigration brought a security economy
military and criminal justice reform but
no one but one interesting guest to
watch out for will be an 11 year-old
Joshua Trump now Joshua Trump has been
getting bullied simply because he shares
the president's last name he is one of
the reported four thousand seven hundred
and eighty-eight Americans living with
this surname in December Joshua
reportedly stopped using his last name
because he was bullied and also started
doing home schooling instead now the
sixth grader from Wellington Delaware is
expected to attend the State of the
Union to represent bullying and
prevention offered a key element of an
initiative by the First Lady Melania
Trump named be best meanwhile Trump is
giving his address many eyes will also
be on the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who
will be seated just behind the breast in
the California Democrat has been
sparring with Trump phobics over the
government shutdown and has refused to
give tongue 5.7 billion for the border
wall but a Tuesday she live horn as Tom
delivers a speech with many teams that
she disagrees with
of course has been a delayed speech we
had a back and forth between him and
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that resulted
in a week long delay because of the
government shutdown so the president
will finally be taking the stage there
but the circumstances of this State of
the Union are very different than they
were last year this is the first time
that the president will be addressing a
divided chamber you now have Democrats
in charge you'll have House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi sitting over the president
shoulder in almost every shot of the
speech and that's the backdrop with
which he'll be speaking and romps
address was a well Risha duel after the
partial government shutdown which lasted
35 days and became the longest in the US
history his remarks will come amid a
widening partisan divide that could
another week lead to another government
shutdown finished a the longest
government shutdown in this country's
history we are facing a February 15th
deadline when we could possibly re-enter
into government shutdown you've got the
President and Democrats who are locked
in this very very heated increasingly
heated an angry discussion over the
president's demand for border wall money
which Democrats say they are not going
to give him give the president
threatening to declare a national
emergency and so you've got a very tense
situation surrounding this speech on
foreign policy front there are several
issues that the world will closely be
watching for including the developments
in Venezuela and Afghanistan we're also
expecting him to talk a little bit more
about his plans when it comes to
Afghanistan and removing troops American
troops from that country I he'll also be
talking about Venezuela we expect him to
talk about the Chinese American

one that they await the early completion

extradition
has signed the extradition orders for
Vijay Mallya well we can certainly
expect that his legal team will appeal
that decision and that means this case
heads to the appeals court this will be
a much shorter court case than the
original extradition hearing that lasted
a little over a year we can expect just
a few months however if he loses that
appeal case he can again take it to the
Supreme Court of Britain now that is a
shorter hearing again that will still
last a month maybe two months after that
decision arrives and if Vijay Mallya
doesn't like that decision then he could
ultimately take it to the European
courts of justice however it is speaking
to legal experts there's an overwhelming
feeling that he's just laying the
inevitable in many ways because this is
all about a prima facie case is there a
case to be answered for the judge in the
extradition here certainly felt that
there was enough evidence presented by
India to prove there is a case to be
answered for lots of legal experts
looking over the case feel the same way
but ultimately it will be up to an
appeals court judge to make the decision
if he decides to appeal

120 fugitives have been brought back to
India since 2015 eight of them were
deported and the rest were extradited
while quite a few of those wanted for
offenses ranging from financial frauds
to murder and terrorism are at large the
deportment of accused or sentenced

British national and was wanted by India

this is because India's top
investigating body the CBI claims that
he was allegedly hired by Agusta

bribing people to secure a VVIP chopper
deal of augustawestland another big name

alleges that Alwar was also involved in
other ad agencies negotiated during the
UPA regime he is believed to have played
a key role in deals regarding duty-free
shops in the Delhi Airport and the
development of arrow city project near
in in fact the CBI also alleges that
salvar Mis utilized over 90 crore rupees
that was obtained from foreign companies
as part of their corporate
responsibility efforts the loire is
believed to have a left in their last
year another man who was flown back from
Dubai along with Alvaro on a special
aircraft was Rajiv Saxena Saxena is a
close aide of gusta Westland and
middleman Christian Michele at Saxena is
accused of using two divided based firms
for routing proceeds of crime in
AgustaWestland case his explanations and
versions will be crucial for Indian
agencies and they will be tallied with
Christian Michell statements it's also
considered a case of Indian fugitive

following the collapse of his Kingfisher

after banks took a legal course to
recover dues from Kingfisher Airlines on

houses to banks of trying to spread lies
about him in April 2017 Mallya was
arrested in London by the Scotland Yard
and produced before the westminster
magistrate's court shortly afterwards he
was granted bail in December 2018 a
British Court finally ordered his
extradition it's unfortunate that the

loan money to Kingfisher Airlines be

home officer ordered his extradition
fugitive Indian businessman Vijay Mallya
has made it clear that he will make yet
another attempt to delay his return now
taking a twitter Mallya said he would
appeal against the decision he wrote and
I quote after the decision was handed
down on December 10th 2018 by the
Westminster magistrates coat I stated my
intention to appeal
I could not initiate the appeal process
before a decision by the Home Secretary
now I will initiate a V appeal process
but Malia's appeal will only be
considered if the High Court grants him
the Commission no earlier British Home
Secretary is such a Javed signed the
extradition order eight weeks after the
case was sent to him for a decision on
whether to order extradition decision
has been hailed in India now Union

clears one more step to get Mallya
extradited awhile opposition rallies
around the charitra scamsters and code
now government sources have also told me
on that day they've ate the early
completion of the legal process for
Malia's extradition
Veon correspondent Mandy Clarke has more
on this story so what now after the
British Home Secretary has signed the
extradition orders for Vijay Mallya well
we can certainly expect that his legal
team will appeal that decision and that
means this case heads to the appeals
court this will be a much shorter court
case than the original extradition
hearing that lasted a little over a year
we can expect just a few months however
if he loses that appeal case he can
again take it to the Supreme Court of
Britain now that is a shorter hearing
again that will still last a month maybe
two months after that decision arrives
and if Vijay Mallya doesn't like that
decision then he could ultimately take
this to the European courts of justice
however it is speaking to legal experts
there's an overwhelming feeling that
he's just laying the inevitable in many
ways because this is all about a prima
facie case is there a case to be
answered for the judge in the
extradition here certainly felt that
there was enough evidence presented by
India to prove there is a case to be
answered for lots of legal experts
looking over the case feel the same way
but ultimately it will be up to an
appeals court judge to make the decision
if he decides to appeal

on top of gravitas the UK's Home Office
has ordered the extradition of fugitive
Indian businessman Vijay Mallya the Home
Office has confirmed to be on that
Mallya now is two weeks to challenge
this extradition and our London bureau
chief Mandy Clarke has been following
this case from the word go she's joining
us live from London Mandy what updates
do we have that what we do know know now
is that Vijay Mallya has around two
weeks 14 days to appeal is very likely
he will do almost definitely this isn't
really a surprise that the Home
Secretary has approved it it was very
much expected there was the Indian saw I
gave a very strong case and the judge
put it through the Home Secretary to
prove so that isn't a surprise we do
expect Mallya to appeal the bigger
surprise would be now if Mallya decides
to accept the extradition decision and
head home so we'll have to see whether
or not he does appeal then it's to the
appeals court now we can expect a much
quicker trial if that happens and if it
still isn't the result that Mallya wants
then it's the Supreme Court and then it
could go all the way to the European
Court of Justice when you see a quicker
trial time is of essence Mandy I'm sure
you appreciate the fact that this is
election season in India and getting
Vijay Mallya back at this point will be
very very significant good optics and
more fall for the ruling dispensation
here so when we say that things are
proceeding faster than expected and this
is this is an advantage for the
government and the prosecution here in
New Delhi how quickly can we see things
turning around it's difficult to know
how quickly an appeals court decision
tends to happen quicker but it's the
judiciary and it's it's slow with a lot
of cases so we the case the the original
court case itself took over a year to
reach a decision but we can expect much
less so within two to three months after
that date is set we can expect a
decision on that and the Supreme Court
will be even less time
and if they decide to go to the European
Courts of Justice now that often might
be off the table if Britain has Brack
sitted they might not be under the Year
being court of justice judiciary so it
might just go to the Supreme Court so
there is a lot still up in the air of
course with the legal system here in
Britain but I
you could expect it in a few months
rather than a year for a decision to be
made extradition of people like Roger
Mallya is politically very very
sensitive in India and as we track this
case and we speak to people from all
sides the criticism that has come for
successive Indian governments is the
fact that they do not follow up the case
cell with as much passion that they they
drag their feet but this government some
would say has shown uh a lot of Drive in
this regard and they've really pushed
this do you believe that this is move
faster and how significant is the fact
that the home office in Britain at this
time when the the government itself is
dealing with as has a lot on its plate
has has gone ahead with this decision do
you think that there is some some
political some back-channel talk
happening as well it certainly there was
a lot of expectation on Britain to make
a quick decision that might be the case
but certainly what the judge said is
that every time she had a question from
the the Indian side they were very quick
to give a reply and so I think where
you're seeing greater kind of
follow-through is really through the
judiciary when the judge asked for extra
files they got it when they wanted a
film of the jail conditions they got it
right away and so it was very easy for
the judge to make a decision in India's
favor because they were working hand in
glove really with the judiciary and
perhaps that hasn't been the case in the
past but certainly we do know India had
made representations to Britain making
it clear how important this case was
them so the Home Secretary would have
known that there would be an expectation
for him to make a decision fairly
quickly
final question Mandy you've been
tracking this case you've been speaking
to legal experts how do the odds stack
against Vijay Mallya in this case well
it's always dangerous to go in the world
of speculation but many of the legal
minds do believe that he will ultimately
be sent back that this is just
a slow process whether he goes to an
appeal they don't see his case strong
enough to to warrant that he stays in
the UK so in many ways it's just
delaying the inevitable when I spoke to
a lot of legal experts of course you're
never too sure what a judge will decide
but I think the overall view is there is
a case to be heard in India and that he
needs to go back to face it Randy Clark
thanks very much is always a very
balanced assessment of things Vijay
Mallya's extradition requests cleared by
the UK Home Office but he can still
appeal things moving faster than
expected and this is going to make good
headlines for the government in New
Delhi at least that's where the story
stands for the moment and this is the
biggest headline in India in West Bengal

in the home ministry also sought a
report from the governor of the state
beyond his access details of this report
the governor has stated that officers of
the Central Bureau of Investigation the
CBI were illegally confined by the
Kolkata police last night
the crisis has reached the doorsteps of
the court india's top court came down
heavily on the CBI's plea seeking an
investigation against the West Bengal
police commissioner Rajeev Kumar the CBI
has accused the top cop of tampering
with evidence
in several billion-dollar scans the apex
court though has asked for proof
in fact the Supreme Court will hear the
CBI's plea in this case tomorrow but
what led to such a sticky situation in
the state who are the key players and
what have they done here's a look at all
the drama that played out over the
weekend
Saturday 2nd of February India's premier
investigating agency makes a stinging
allegation against the West Bengal
police chief the Central Bureau of
Investigation labeled West Bengal
commercial of police absconding the
agency accused Rajeev Kumar of hiding
evidence in the probe of two scams the
Saradha scam a major financial fraud
that had mobbed up about one thousand
and two hundred crore rupees through
chit funds and the financial fraud in
the Rose Valley scam which is estimated
at all fifteen thousand crore rupees
millions of depositors were invested
their life savings in hopes of getting
higher returns were duped by the company
Kumar was hitting a probe in the scans
but CBI believes that he hit some
crucial evidence
a group of CBI officers landed in
Kolkata on Sunday to pursue the
investigation they reached Kumar's
residence only to be bundled up by
police officials and detained Kolkata
Police also cordon off the cgo complex
the state headquarters of the CBI as
politics unfolded on the streets the
Chief Minister rushed to the residence
of the police commissioner she accused
Indian Prime Minister of staging a coup
in the state Mamata Banerjee claimed
that the party at another party was
rattled by her efforts hissed it's to
gather an alliance of opposition parties
ahead of general elections in the
country in a truly dramatic style the
West Bengal Chief Minister then decided
to organize a sit-in protest she began
an indefinite honour in Uptown locality
in Kolkata
the metro channel in estimate became
ground zero where Mamata began her 25b
long agitation against a special
economic zone in Kingwood
and if history is anything to go by she
is not going to bow down just yet we're
a report beyond world is one far from
Banda in fact Mamata Banerjee looks like
she'll make the most of this controversy
in election season it's an opportunity
in fact for the West Bengal Chief
Minister clashed with Prime Minister
Modi's something that she was spoiling
for she finally has got it just a couple
of days ago remember Mamata Banerjee
organised a mega rally in Kolkata
prominent leaders of some twenty
opposition parties attended this event
and with this drama that's still going
on ms banerjee has fortified her place
as the leader of this opposition
coalition it seemed still early days but
that's what she's aiming at some say the
Trinamool Congress led state government
remember has made several attempts in
the recent past to stop the BJP from
campaigning in the state of West Bengal
authorities do not grant permission to
BJP chief Amit Shah to hold mega rallies
across the state and with the latest
developments Mamata Banerjee has managed
to gather more momentum opposition
parties in India rallying behind her
several political leaders including
Congress president Rahul Gandhi the aam
aadmi party's arvind kejriwal andhra
pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu
and RJD national president Lalu Prasad
have all come out in support of
montebello G Congress Party chief Rahul
Gandhi even called her up an extended
support saying that the entire
opposition is together on the issue her
seemingly tough stance against the
centre has also projected her as a
possible contender for the leader of
this anti-bjp alliance if others agree
and if there is an alliance in place by
the time we head to elections but
politics aside what is the merit of West
and West Bengal and ant pradesh are the
only two indian states where a CBI has
to seek permission before carrying out a
raid or an investigation this is with
the exception of an investigation
ordered by the courts though as it
happens the Kolkata High Court has
indeed ordered the CBI to investigate
the Sharda scam the investigative agency
is well within its legal rights to
question
police commissioner in a scam that hit
20 lakh people in the state of West
Bengal there's a twist though the
Calcutta High Court had issued a stay
order in the questioning of Rajeev Kumar
the police chief of West Bengal till the
13th of February that means that
technically the CBI went against the
High Court order they went early a
three-judge bench comprising the Chief
Justice of India and two other judges
will be looking into the legal validity
of the case for the moment Mamata
Banerjee seems to be making the most of
this drama the Palestinian coastal and
clave of Gaza is said to be even more
isolated the tiny strip of land is
surrounded by fences both on land and
sea and now the Prime Minister of Israel
Benjamin Netanyahu himself faces an
election in less than a month from now

handling of the escalation in November
2018 when a botched Israeli undercover
operation inside Gaza prompted Hamas to

danila Pagani in Jordan reporting for
vien world is one messages news thanks
to a high profile visitor as well Pope
Francis became the first pope to set
foot on the Arabian Peninsula the
birthplace of Islam the Pope will meet
leading Muslim clerics during his
48-hour visit he will also hold an open
air mass which is expected to be
attended by nearly 1 lakh 35,000
Catholics this visit is politically
significant last week remember the Pope
had urged all the warring parties in
Yemen to seek peace the UAE and Saudi
Arabia are deeply involved in the nearly
4 year long war in Yemen
Pope Francis is looking to turn a page
in relations between Christianity and
Islam
he's on a visit to a region which is
predominantly populated by Muslims
Pope Francis is the first pontiff to do
so the pontiff was welcomed by Abu
Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin
Zayed and the ruler of Dubai Sheikh
Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum the Pope
calls this visit an opportunity to write
a new page in the history of relations
between Islam and Christianity that's
significant for the nearly 2 million
Catholics residing in the region sooraj
on Tuesday the Pope will hold an outdoor
mass for nearly 1 lakh 35,000 Catholics
the first of its kind in the Arabian
Peninsula
[Music]
the pontiff will also participate in a
conference on inter-religious dialogue
at Abu Dhabi the dialogue is sponsored
by the UAE based muslim council of
elders and it intends to counter
religious fanaticism in the region ahead
of the current trip Pope Francis had
slammed the humanitarian crisis in Yemen
and urged the warring parties to seek
peace sorry
Vitelli ESO le bon giorno congratulate
Sione shave hola Chrissy oh man Italian

Mata the long low conflict oh the UAE
and Saudi Arabia are involved in the
four-year long war in Yemen against
Houthi rebels
[Music]
both Francis's perceived to be different
from its predecessors he's regarded as
an outspoken critic who's unafraid to
express his views on politics economy
war and militarization in fact there are
books written on his political activism
he has commented on a variety of issues
ranging from Yemen to Venezuela and
capitalism to climate change sample his
recent comments on the ongoing political
crisis in Venezuela they say misurkin en
lo que siento the moment people easily
say ok saponin awkward they now say
tampoco the supernal were totally una
solución hosted a Pacifica get lucky
mess with them
the current papal visit also has
political undertones the Pope's visit
has raised hopes among Christians living
in the Arabian Peninsula
currently there are stringent
restrictions on building churches in the
region the Vatican has often said that
the presence of the church in the UAE
should get stronger so that may be on
the cards and the Pope may either in
public or private raise the touchy issue
of the crisis in Yemen rights groups
have urged the pontiff to raise the
issue of the UAE in tolerance of dissent
as well as the state of human rights in
the country
the Pope is also expected to call for
more freedom to practice Christianity in
the region such a call coming in the
heartland of Islam is significant
especially when churches are banned in
Saudi Arabia
Pope Francis once Minister in the slums
of be honest eres but in his six years
of papacy he's already become the first
pope to address the US Congress there
the pontiff was unafraid to bring up
politically polarizing issues of
immigration and climate change and the
visit to West Asia to strengthen inter
religious ties could be another feather
in the Pope's cap Bureau report
we on worldís one the political crisis
in Venezuela is threatening to take a
turn for the worst there's no answer
with a simple question yet who is the
president of the country many
governments across the world have
recognized the opposition leader guide
though over the last 24 hours
but president Maduro is holding on to
power despite massive protests the war
of words between Maduro and u.s.
president donald trump has entered into
a dangerous zone
Maduro warns the US that interference in
Venezuela will leave Trump's presidency
stained with blood strong words at a
volatile time que la puerta beer tal

rejected an ultimatum given by the
European Union to hold early elections
the European Union had even had given

if Huerta Trump has not ruled out

has renewed fears of civil war you use

what's the no doesn't wear say that but
certainly it's something that's on the
UH it's an option would you personally
negotiate with Nicolas Maduro to
convince him to exit well he has
requested a meeting and I've turned it
down because we're very far along in the
process you have a young and energetic
gentleman but you have other people
within that same group that have been
very very if you talk about democracy
it's really democracy in action the
protests are intensifying on the ground
and like last week's protests which were
largely against president Maduro now
protects us from both the camps have
taken to the streets and that has raised
tensions okay like they know it Downey
Oh Leah no no pea can pie a la mode
Rondo cake at a ballpark a cannibal say
leave it okay I'm okay
no cannabis in Colonia Anonymous is very
very bad but we need the help
international help Russia and Turkey
have continued to rally behind Maduro
russia urge the international community
to help men as well as solve this
problem Moscow has warned against any
meddling in Venezuela's what it calls
internal affairs president Erdogan of
Turkey went one step further he slammed
the countries which have recognized the
opposition leader turkey says that such
countries are fueling the turmoil in
Venezuela China which has invested
heavily in this country is playing a
safe game for the moment a political
crisis would be harmful for the business
interests of Beijing but a peaceful
transfer of power will not hurt it guy
though has asked China to abandon Maduro
China has not reacted to these calls
just yet when as well as neighbors have
called for a meeting to recognize the
opposition leader the bottom line is
this protests are intensifying with
every
passing day several countries are
rallying behind the opposition leader
but president Maduro continues to have
the backing of countries like China
because China is not sided with the
opposition yet Russia and Turkey more
openly while the US has not ruled out
military intervention more importantly
Venezuela's military remains steadfast
in support for its president mr. Maduro
Venezuela's poor citizens want political
and economic stability global powers
want access to Venezuela's rich oil
reserves some of them want normalcy
because they have lent heavily to
Caracas they need returns on their
investment and amidst the many many
battles in Venezuela the battle for
power between Maduro and godot
has reached an impasse as protests
intensify with both sides determined to
give events a decisive turn there's a
risk of a conference this confrontation
only escalating further it's a story we
continue to track

opposed to President Ashraf Ghani are
also all set to meet in Russia this week
as the United States is already holding

we've been reporting now the former

said that he will be attending they've
gone peace talks which is scheduled to
be held in Moscow on the 5th and 6th of

Karzai as saying that the Moscow talks
are important for the peace process in
the country the Moscow meeting will be
attended by leaders of some of the top
political parties in Afghanistan and the
representatives of Taliban now they've
gone Ministry of Foreign Affairs however
has told beyond that the government will
not be attending the talks the Taliban
refuses to recognize ghani's government
calling it a puppet to the US and assure
Ghani has repeatedly called on the
Taliban to begin talks with his
government the Moscow dialogue comes
after officials from over 40 countries
attended an international contact group
meeting in London where the top US and
Afghan officials announced their support
for the Afghan peace process and Lucy
Taylor my colleague is joining us live
now from Moscow for the very latest on
this new format of talks and well not so
new but also in addition to what the US
is doing in Lucena how do you see the
Moscow dialogue running parallel to the
u.s. one and are they at any point going
to engage with the Afghan government
under Ashraf Ghani because both the
Americans and the Russians have kept out
Ashraf Ghani from this conversation and
engaged other political parties and
stakeholders in Afghanistan yes well
russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov
has spoken about that a little earlier
today you said that talks between our
dialogue between the Afghan government
and the Taliban were unavoidable so it
seems that Russia the Russian government
believes that that will happen at some
point however not tomorrow not in the
talks that begin here in Moscow tomorrow
those talks do involve a number of
different parties from from Kabul and
Beyond including Hamid Karzai and his
delegation as you say and in total 38
delegates from Kabul including
presidential
fools and a number of opposition leaders
tribal elders and people like that as
well as ten members of the delegation
from the Taliban so many different
people discussing this but it won't
involve Afghan government officials
Moscow as you say has tried to stay out
slightly of the arrangements of this the
Russian government position is that
these talks are being hosted here in
Moscow but that are actually being
organized by a separate organization the
Council of Afghan society which
represents the Diaspora the Afghan
diaspora from countries around the
region so the Russian government's
staying out of it but has suggested that
it believes that in the future it will
be inevitable for those two parties to
speak to each other as you say these
talks are running parallel and
separately to the us-led peace talks so
a number of different fronts that these
discussions are taking place at the

it is an interim budget but it's a
budget that comes just a couple of
months before the big general elections
of India what are the big takeaways from
budget 2019 we've listed out six for you
let's begin with the biggest headline
that caused the maximum noise inside the
Parliament and outside as well and that
is the income tax exemption limit big
bonanza for a solid if class hiked to
five lakh rupees and that's double from
the previous number of 2.5 lakh rupees
so big boost for salaried class not just
that there's also for the unorganized
sector those who walk in the unorganized
seconds is a pension scheme for them
mega pension scheme over three thousand
rupees per annum that'll be per month
that'll be given to the workers in the
unorganized sector there's also gratuity
announcement that was made there was
tripled from 10 lakhs or 30 lakhs for
the salaried sector meanwhile defense
spending was increased to an all-time
high across the three lakh crore rupee
mark the government putting the money
where's a mouth is and increasing the
defense budget by the largest quantum in
recent times were also six thousand
rupees is said to be deposited into
farmers's accounts on a yearly basis and
this is the direct cash transfer option
the diamond has gone forward to address
the farmer distress and the rural
distress because keep in mind that is
the headlining problem that cost the
ruling party BJP elections in States
apart from that is the gradually I told
you the part so it's a double bonanza
for the salaried class double bonanza
for are the powers work that is apart
from the 6000 rupees cash transfers we
also have the government being very
clear that it wants urban infrastructure
in its villages huge outlay huge vision
more importantly being presented these
are the six big takeaways of budget 2019
let's now listen in to the man who
presented this budget the acting finance

expert joining us live here in our
studios and mr. Chandler Mohan Basu
their former finance secretary being
with zaiah
thank you very general for Canada to
stay with us over here which is you've
heard everything that needs me there has
been spoken about this budget the
government and those associated with the
the ruing dispensation making it very
clear that this is not populism this is
what that government should have done a
long time ago and we have taken an
opportunity out to do this and some of
the issues they've addressed are real
boiling hot issues that faces the Indian
economy in that sense would you then say
that those who criticize this budget as
a populist budget as one you know being
as a sellout for the elections that's
coming up or maybe a little maybe being
a little bit too harsh well you know I
wear two hats when I consider that
question I'm one hat you know as an
external adviser
all the data all the analysis the Indian
economy they need to begin drawing down
subsidies they need to begin moving in a
different direction and expanding the
taxpayer base right nobody on the
outside the looks the economy says that
these don't have to be that these you
know that these must be priorities they
simply must be priorities but an
election is coming up and all these
expenditure programs you see in the
budget none of them are going to break
the bank dramatically slight increase in
the fiscal deficit but it is something
that a country of this size that economy
the size can handle so ahead of a budget
I think we have to kind of expect so you
got to wear two hats on this you know
the the external adviser who says kind
of going in the wrong direction still
should be expanding the tax base rather
than additional cuts but election time
totally
so no serious complaints on my side no
serious complaint sir we also have a mr.
Andrew keeping Lu honorary president
China Hong Kong economic and trade in
International Association joining us
live from Hong Kong
mr. Leung you know so we have Richard
Russell vo tells us that you know it's
not necessarily a populist budget not
really the most worrisome when it comes
up with and measures taken but you know
the government is saying that this is a
budget which is doing things which
previous government should have done
beat in terms of addressing farmer
distress or and rows of addressing the
distress of the middle class of the
country so in that sense those who are
praising this budget say that it's not
necessarily populist as it's been called
by the critics well of course the the
promise is to share the economic growth
with a larger sector of the community
but the big big question is that whether
all this cash panels and all these la
guess is are going to translate into
increased productivity because increase
productivity depends on in no small
measure to greater access to education
it's a question of whether the majority
of the Indian population have access to
enough access to education and to higher
education so it's the push of the
productivity of the country secondly
productivity also depends in the case of
India on good infrastructure on physical
infrastructure I mean it takes and weeks
and if not months to transport goods
from one side of the country to another
and to enable the farmers to carry the
goods to the cities so I think that the
infrastructure is still lacking and of
course that there is a great deal of
money now being put into building more
highways and railways and so on so forth
but because of the politics the local
politics
all this is taking ages to happen so I
think that the question is yes the
government is fulfilling his promise to
share the economic fruits of economic
growth but the question is what impact
it would have on the long-term
productivity of a big country like India
Seleucus raised a very important point
isn't it even as we're talking about
different metrics that will show how
well India is progressing productivity
is as a metric that India needs to keep
in mind yeah but you know when you see
the budget of any government this last
budget goes to the election with the eye
on the election is just one aspect one
has to see in totality the budgets of
the last four or five years I think to
get a good idea of where the government
is what the government's position is
where it wants to create the country I
think it has taken a lot of other
decisions which will give medium-term
benefit to the economy whether it is GST
or whether the ease of doing business or
whether it is even the monetization
there tell bringing more and more
businesses into the formal economy and
black money being routed out all those
decisions have been taken which will
give benefit in the medium term but this
is an election year budget to four
months before the election any elected
government or which any government which
aspires to get reelected has to respond
to the aspirations of the people in the
short term but I hope that this is
shorten is only for this budget because
you know ultimately the growth can come
only through if you have a private
sector led growth water private sector
is the one which can provide jobs which
can propel the economy to a higher
Crozier it has to be an export-led
growth so those are things which need to
be taken and there lot of barriers for
private sector today and those barriers
have increased in the last one or two
three years especially with tax
treatment as long as there is a people
feel that making money is not a good
thing if there is a feeling that people
money making money is a crime then which
private sector to make money so you have
to remove that type of careers repaired
those type of incentives for the private
sector to grow make more money in a
legitimate way create more jobs then
encourage the corporate sector which in
the first budget mr. Jaitley had said
the tax rate would come down to 25
percent or whatever because if you give
have leave more savings in the hands of
the private sector in corporate sector
corporate sector is the one which is
going to make investments and those
investments can lead to growth
so these are these little other issues
which provide the growth momentum to the
economy which obviously are missing in
this budget one can't blame the
government for doing that it is
responding to an election which is
coming in next 3-4 months but in
totality you have to see over the last
four or five years the budgets it has
presented and hopefully when there is a
stable government for next five years
those basic issues which concern the
growth of the economy they will be
addressed in a more forthright manner
country amen
fingers crossed then that happens and
the annual budget is a financial
decision by the governor's actually the
fact that this budget was presented
months ahead of the general elections is
not lost on anyone clearly this year's
budget seems was clearly a populist
budget because there are facts to prove
that finance first refused going around
some big stops today like the mega
pension scheme for the unorganized
sector three thousand rupees monthly
pension for workers the unorganized
sector above the ages of 60 that a move
that would impact forty two crore
Indians next up is a direct income
scheme for small and marginalized
formers the governor announced direct
cash transfer of six thousand rupees
every year for small farmers who own not
more than two hectares of land now that
move would impact 12 crore idiots
then comes a relief for the salaried
middle class the income tax lab has been
revised all those where their annual
income of less than five lakh rupees
will have to pay zero tax that would
impact roughly three crore Indians now
this budget has impacted put together
fifty-seven crore Indians the country
has roughly ninety one crore Indians as
with disturbed voters and 57 is a big
number that sixty percent is almost of
the total voter base that has been
brought under the umbrella of this
year's
shop so it begs the question is this a
financial decision meant to deliver a
political outcome
that question a financial decision that
is intended to have a political outcome
because that's what we keep on repeating
it's another way of saying the same
thing that they have taken financial
decisions so those who agree with this
budget will talk about the economics
behind it it's not like there is no
economic rationale behind some of the
moves that are made but in that sense
then would you say this is it's very
smart budget quote-unquote smart with
rockets PAH if I may
budget with that comes Siemens before
the elections which will satisfy the
electorate but at the same time follow
good economics well there are worse
decisions the government could have
taken you know as we talked about before
giving direct cash transfers rather than
farm loan waivers you know in the moral
hazard that was discussed before so
there are worse decisions they could
have take to appeal to voters it
definitely was a budget for voters you
know I think Secretary had it right
which is you look at these things over
multiple multiple years
not when Modi first came in that first
year in office a number of big economic
reforms tied to the budget not coal oil
and gas things like that in an expansion
of social programs that you know they
are subsidies like cooking gas cylinders
and things but they have a great
inherent social good you know using
cooking gas rather than burning dung in
the house and things like that but now
here at the end you know you do see more
blatant like straight cash giveaways but
there are worse forms of cash giveaways
than they did so there is a bit of an
arc here in what you've seen in the five
year you know big reforms early social
programs in the middle and now at the
end you know let's see if we can get a
few other things to get us across the
finish line I was thinking about all the
other interim budgets that was presented
in India with a few months to go for the
election just one sinner presented one
budget you had yes well just once thing
presented it beg your pardon Yashwant
Sinha presented a budget predominately
also presented a budget the Department
of make is that in the scheme of these
election budgets this is always termed
as the election budget in India do you
think that this particular election
budget will ever ask you mr. Vassa they
did a better job than other election
budgets would you say so well as
election budgets go I think it has
covered it has been very well crafted it
has tried to address the largest sort of
water base whether it is the farming
sector
that is the unorganized sector where
there are the wage earners there there's
the defense forces which is large a
number of people retirees from the
defense and all that so it is very well
crafted in in a political sense and so
it is a good budget in that sense but I
think one I would certainly grant it to
the government that given the election
but you compare it with the previous
budgets interim budgets you know this
budget was tightly different because it
is coming in the 1st of February yeah
and also there's last year elections
have not been announced as yet if the
election code of conduct has not been
kicked in as yet some of the other
budgets that you're mentioning about the
Sri Sri just one thing or mr. Gershwin
so now or mister dr. Manmohan Singh and
all that they also did interim budgets
but those interim budgets came in the
midst of the code of conduct when
election dates have been announced so
here it is a budget which is coming on
1st of February elections will be
announced maybe sometime in March so
there is no code of conduct problem for
the government and if it is trying to
use the budget as a means for owing the
electorate I think it is quite
legitimate and the win the recall think
too much harm
yeah and wooing the electorate is a
legitimate thing for in a democracy the
way you have democracies ago voters want
to be doing ability of not taking too
many liberties yeah and making but as
long as I said as long as it is sort of
a one-time election type of thing it
doesn't become a way of life for
government there it is only going to
collect taxes and give away taxes there
would be the worst thing but if it is a
one-time thing but if you when you
stabilize when the next government come
you start focusing on issues which will
generate growth provide more growth
momentum that is the way to go one can't
quarrel in the short term I suppose all
right Prime Minister Narendra Modi
lauded budget 2019 as farmer and
middle-class friendly let's quickly
listen in to the Prime Minister's
reaction right after the budget was
presented in the Parliament is whether
it man

Soccer Academy or sad shot this Kaiba
Cosmo gutted anyway do Tom why now the
interim budget presented by the standing
Finance Minister Piyush Goyal has not
impressed the opposition clearly in a
fierce takedown of the proposed annual
income support of 6000 rupees for small
farmers Congress party president Rahul
Gandhi described 17 rupees a day as an
insult to the farmers
taking to Twitter mr. Gandhi said and I
quote dear no more five years of your
incompetence and arrogance has destroyed
the lives of our farmers giving them 17
rupees a day is an insult to everything
they stand and work for unquote the
Congress party along with other
opposition parties have also accused the
government of presenting a full-fledged
budget instead of an interim one my one
line comment on the budget is that it
was not a vote on account but an account
for votes the interim finance minister
tested our patience by the longest
interim budget speech in recent memory
it was not an interim budget it was a
full-fledged budget accompanied by an
election campaign speech by doing so the
government has trampled on time-honored
conventions a government confidence of
returning to power would have respected
the conventions it is crystal clear that
the government has no hope of returning
to power and has therefore acted
desperately and recklessly and in
violation of the Constitution actually
its expiry budget budget of this
furnishing actual this budget what will
be not implement it why this exemption
because before election what we see
actually the new government they decide
the budget they pass the new budget now
only one month is the time for this
present government they have their debt
of expiring expel expired it is already
expiry date will be over within one
month they have hardly one bumps in that
time so one month it is not possible to
implement
that's not a surprise to mr. Luna who's
been joining us there patiently all
through this broadcast mr. loom I wanted
to ask you you know you have the
opposition parties in India tearing into
this budget bottle but that is but
obvious because it is election time and
it wouldn't help to praise the budget of
the ruling dispensation but but having
said that you know you have this
accusation that this was not meant to be
a full budget this was not a budget
meant for big scheme announcements and
etc etc so in the science that the
obviously saying it's mollified intent
by the government before winning the
elections to come out with a budget that
really sets that we are planned for
India for the next ten years assuming
that they are going to come back to
power well I think that all agreed that
this is a vote buying a budget that's
not an election budget but on the other
hand it depends on where the money is
going wherever the money is going to
push prove activity it seems that the
money is just pushing just putting money
in people's pockets and where is the the
kind of productivity enhancement kind of
mechanisms for example education and
also change in the economy mode was
manufacturing that's where the the
engine of generating jobs are so but
it's easier said than done and you want
more manufacturing jobs you've got to
provide the kind of soft support
facilities you've got to improve the
infrastructure to make it more easier to
do business operations and carry the
goods around through the country so I
think that we're seeing an absence of
that opposes an interim budget but at
least in an interim budget the
government may make an you know should a
point to the direction where the country
will be going particularly if they're
running for for for to remain in power
for the next you know how many years so
I think that there should be an at least
a pointer to the direction where this
country is going how the foundation are
going to be laid how this foundations
are to be supported by even an interim
I think that this is lacking at the
moment which is so I want to continue
the discussion of this all interim
budget versus in a full budget you you
heard out to the chairman of nithya
Amitabh contains a budget is a budget is
a budget which is sort of like that old
Roger roses and roses a rose is what is
being used to to scrap budgets but we
all know it's not a or not everybody
does the same budget especially the
interim budget is nothing like the like
the full budget but this time around if
last year the convention of presenting
the budget to the 1st of February chose
a practice changed after eight nine
decades now another convention has been
broken and that is that you can with
elections on the anvils still present a
full budget during an interim budget
yeah well yeah and I think that it's not
necessarily Modi is not the first person
to break convention ahead of Elections
I mean five years ago you remember in
the budget session the interim budget
itself before the last election may not
have been as groundbreaking is this but
in the budget session they decided to
divide a state in half that's kind of
big news too I was only five years ago
mistaking that you don't want 2014
interim vice president he also announced
a huge farm loan waiver in that budget
if I remember correctly which was worth
about again 60,000 crota base if I'm not
mistaken for that point in time so we've
been seeing the Congress government
budgets do the same thing and in terms
of surprise in that sense but in the
sense despite that this is still a
surprise because you have the pension
scheme you have the farmer scheme you
have the hiking income tax and then you
have talking about huge infrastructure
outlays you so in that sense talk about
taking creative liberties with the
interim budget this government seems to
have taken all of it yeah well like I
said I mean it this is different it is
it is quantitatively different than
interim budgets before but I'm just
saying like taking big
politically driven steps right before
elections is not new last time instead
of you know something dramatic in the
budget akin to what we saw in this one
it was dividing a state in half you look
back at other times there's been other
things they did in the months leading up
to an election there so you know is this
different in terms of itinerant budget
yes is it different in terms of throwing
a few big things
before an election it had been done
under other means by previous
governments so again you know not
terribly surprising that we saw it that
vehicle maybe a little bit different the
concept about throwing a bit more before
the election that's been done in
democracies around the road forever of
course

fifty thousand rupees to five lakh
rupees it means that those who are
earning up to five lakh rupees a year
will not have to pay any income tax

the salaries class has been hiked to
fifty thousand rupees so it is a
substantial relief for those in the
lower-income groups in a major relief
for farmers the Indian government
announced a direct income support for
the agriculture sector where the scheme
will give six thousand rupees to farmers
with small land holdings of up to two
hectares it will cost the Exchequer
seventy five thousand rupees some more

Sircar cube and now joining us here in
our studios is mr. Richard Russell
us-india policy studies expert and we
also have many others joining us we have
shall be Llywelyn joining us live from
London and what a quickly take mr.
Richard one come to all the others
joining us here it's a special broadcast
Richard I'm gonna ask you one simple
thing to start with on a scale of one to
five or one to ten you can pick how much
would you rate this budget well I'd look
at it more from the foreign investor
foreign companies perspective where I
come from from that perspective in that
perspective from that perspective alone
you know I probably rated about a three
there wasn't that much in there that
really kind of either burned companies
nor I think makes for net companies
excited so it didn't hurt didn't harm I
think by and large foreign portfolio
portfolio investors they care about the
fiscal situation but overall you know
everybody's gonna be fine and okay so
not gonna impact foreign investment
flows or foreign trade flows I don't
think in any big way
alright let's then look inward we have
myself Chandra Mohan Vasudev former
finance secretary joining us as well how
would you rate this in terms of the
budget you know you've seen many a
budget it's an interim budget that's
chosen just go away from conventions as
many would call it but what is your
rating of this budget well you know
there are two aspects to it one of
course is it's an election year budget
so it is very high on the eye on the
election rhetoric so a lot of populist
type of announcements and schemes so if
you were to score it on on a political
sort of a scorecard then obviously you
get a very high score card but the
problem I think in our system is that of
course in democracy politics has to
drive economics but there has to be
little balance
you know the economics also must
sometimes drive politics you think that
hasn't happened with us in theory but
not in this one frankly but overall I
think in the previous budgets there was
Lord of economics which is driving
politics so maybe government took a lot
of hard decisions in the first two three
four years and for which it had paid lot
of political price for those tough to
assistance whether it was GST or whether
D monetization or bankruptcy code and
various other things that they did so it
was hit hard in a political sense so
this was a time for it to be a little
more populist I think one can't grudge
government if it is doing that in this
last year because it has taken tough
decisions due in the last three four
years so but on on the other hand I
think even in the short run for the
economy this type of a consumption boost
it is going to put so much money in the
hands of the farming community in rural
areas and middle-class players with tax
exemption up to five lakhs and all that
so that should increase consumption that
should be good news for the businesses
because they will be spending lot on
consumer goods and things of that type
so short-run economic gains are also
there but unfortunately the long-term
gains which will come only from
investment they will probably have a
pause for some time so the investment
net growth will suffer for some time but
consumption that growth probably to get
a boost an important point that you make
which gentleman was developed other one
was they follow finance secretary
joining us here we'll also being joined
by mr. Luciana Barroso will also be done
by Sharmila Whelan live from London
Sharmila if you can hear me right you
know there's lots of talk about the way
these schemes have been announced and
whether India is fiscally prudent
because fiscal deficit is going to 3.4
percentage and more importantly growth
is the growth coming with the generation
of jobs or not but this budget seems to
sidestep many of those questions to
deliver something that many can be happy
about still there's a good budget a
Indian public finances remain in good
shape I mean it was a given that we're
going to get fiscal slippage in the
current fiscal year but the fiscal slip
it has been contained in the you know
the budget deficit is for the current
fiscal years for us to come in at three
points for against an initial forecast
of three point three small slippage and
it's still down on three point five the
previous fiscal year you look at the
budget 2019 fiscal year
of course that's going to be popular
spending it's an election year
the Modi government didn't do
particularly well in the state elections
last year so of course if I there's
going to be spending to try and win over
voters but spending is not exploding
quite the contrary
if you look at total government spending
this year it's rising right despite all
the measures that have been announced
it's rising at a much slower pace than
it did in the current fiscal year again
you look at revenue projections revenue
projections are very sensible in fiscal
2018 revenues rose by 20 percent this in
the coming fiscal year then the budget
the revenues are forecast to rise by 14
percent the government is are all for
the fact that normal GDP growth is going
to slow
mostly because no entirely because
inflation is going to stay low and
contained so to me okay there's a lot of
spending measures but the numbers add up
and therefore the target of 3.4%
is highly achievable Richard Russell if
I take that across to you would you
concur with that the fact that there is
some bullish predictions for the Indian
economy and this budget could yet help
us achieve that elusive eight percentage
growth well you know that elusive
because of course the numbers came out
saying that in the last quarter actually
India grew by potentially over 8 percent
but overall numbers which has been
revised now the 7.2 percentage that's
how much India is expected to grow for
the year 2017 2018 19 and this is for
the next year and that's a concern that
you know I think the world has which is
you know you talk about 3/4 3.4 percent
which is based on a certain percent of
economic growth I mean the fiscal
deficit yeah but and but but based on
you know our is the economy gonna be
able to grow as the tax base can be able
to grow commensurate with that and the
numbers you know 8.2 percent you don't
see a lot of companies coming back and
saying that they really feel that the
economy is growing quite that fast so if
they're basing the number on growth
rates that may be they may not be able
to meet that's going to be a tricky
situation and this is an interim they
will there will be another budget that
will be released after the election
there so
BJP comes back Congress comes in
something else happens they're not gonna
roll these things back if anything
they'll announce new programs so the
story's not quite done yet in terms of
what the next fiscal looks like one was
live if I can ask you to comment on that
you know you're looking at a uncertainty
in terms of the government formation but
many would concur and say that there is
no uncertainty we all know what sort of
happened when it comes to next elections
is you know there's but there's
uncertainty being built up because of
what happened to the state elections
recently and in that context is budget
and what rich was talking about if a new
government comes in then these things
get rolled back yeah all of this puts in
a very precarious position and this is a
rather ambitious interim budget being
the point well you know the the type of
these populist type of decisions whether
it is direct income transfer to the
farmers or the 3,000 rupees pension for
the unorganized sector worker or the
five lakh tax exemption limit for the
middle class
these don't be rolled back by any
government aware there is this
government of the next government so
these are there to stay now of course
the fiscal implication of that those
numbers have yet to be sort of seen more
clearly because of course the finance
minister said that the fiscal impact
will be contained but then the fine
print of these numbers has to be seen
one can't have such large payouts from
the Exchequer without having a fiscal
implication but that much also is true
that you know the tax direct tax
revenues have shown a lot of buoyancy
yeah so because of the new tax payers
which have come into the system
GST also as it stabilizes it should
increase more revenue earnings for the
governments and central government and
the state government so maybe there is a
little fiscal space for government to do
all these things but I think they where
the budget is going to be a little
harmful in the medium term is that the
investment rate which has already come
down to 30 to 33 percent of GDP which
used to be 40 so we won't have
investment led growth in the short term
of course consumption that growth is a
good thing but putting all your sort of
savings through taxes and all into
consumption items like these
it's going to put a big sort of very
valid point you make I don't know medium
probe India is known for its consumption
story India being a consumption led
economy but which in the long term will
give indeed economy and Indian
households a lot to think about
we will revisit that thought but for now
I'm going to shift focus to the
headlining problem of this budget which
was the distress of the farmers which is
seen the ruling party lose an election
after election across three North Indian
states let's first listen to what Prime
Minister Modi had to say on the way the
budget has dealt with farmer distress
and then we'll continue talking its
budget me bara
care or say Dada is an OCO tinker or say
Dada Muslim Burke a tax payer for aware
of NGO or these Charlie's car or Swami
cocoa seed Lala mill not my so obviously
good economic sense means I'm bring this
question to all of you shall Miller
Whelan and we have Richard Russo and
which of the muscles which other Mohan
Lal so they have over here is that good
economic sense says that farm loans
don't really solve the agriculture
distress problem because first of all
the loans don't reach to all farmers the
farm loan waivers so far I've been given
out by so many states 1.9 lakh crore
rupees to be precise since April 20
since April it reaches about 30
percentage of the farming population so
far my own limits are out of out of the
question on that's why this government
it is interim budget it's a interesting
move to give the six thousand rupee cash
transfer now I want you to tell us you
know what did you what do you think
about a move like that because that is
something that the government had to do
they had to address the rural distress
as part of this budget and that is the
reason why you have a scheme like this
with a huge outlet but do you think this
is the Silver Bullet that can solve
farmers distress if anybody in India
figured out what the Silver Bullet is
you wouldn't have state elections
flipping every single time you wouldn't
have so much training
government can do in a budget
considering you have a situation that is
a that is a powder keg of a situation
your farm will distress across the
country in every state well I look back
and frankly I think the Modi government
you know you remember this is still the
party of veg by and I think you look at
veg PI's reelection in 2004 they they
went to the nation and talked about
urban development you know the cities
the beautiful cities and all these tech
jobs and everything and it didn't sell
with voters so I do think the Modi
government has learned a lot by seeing
the veg by regime bad so I performed all
throughout his tenure and a lot of those
reforms trigger growth that was only
witnessed after UPA came in so Modi most
of the big reforms he did were in the
first or second year of office and then
this idea about reelection campaign
focus on rural instead of the urban so I
do see that a lot of lessons learned for
the last BJP government will it end up
differently you know we'll see in a
couple of months all right before I get
back to Manila will end you know mr.
Chandler moment was Dave and many others
have tataat knows about the kind of
balance that a good budget needs to
achieve especially for a country like
India do you think this interim budget a
rather ambitious one of that managed to
pull off this tightrope walk of being
balanced abate in terms of fiscal
prudence at the same time giving enough
for the economy I think you're asking
two different two separate questions
within that the you know is it fiscally
prudent yes the numbers stack up you
know the government has been in its
forecasts have been in a sensible about
their projections of what growth is
going to be I would on the back about
what are the tax revenue collections
going to be you know the fact that GST
has been rolled out now so you're not
getting a huge you know like in the
current year forty five percent rise in
GST they're looking at a more muted
increase in GSE so they've been sensible
and as it say is it fiscally prudent in
terms of the numbers I mean yes is it
achievable yes good but the second
question is could it have been a more
balanced budget yeah sure of course we'd
like to have seen a more balanced budget
right
you know the main thrust of the budget
on the tax side is relief for the
personal sector for the household sector
we would rather have seen more relief
and tax cuts for the corporate sector as
the former finance minister said in the
corporate sector especially the private
investment side is still weak it's
picking up but it could do with a boost
from the government side in terms of
lower taxes but I think this government
in right now this year doesn't have a
choice but to in a dress for my distress
show some lockers to the to the
household and rural economy and I think
you know we've got 3d monetization GST
it's been you've been destructive and
it's you know it's not a bad thing as
long as this does not become the norm
for that I also want to ask you do you
think this entire six thousand rupee per
annum idea is a good idea when it comes
to dealing with family distress way
better than probably a farm loan waiver
I think even which one is better I think
you got to see which one's gonna be
actually effective I think the chance of
a more effective yes because it's a
direct payment it's the main thing it's
a direct payment and I think the problem
with a farm loan waiver is it creates a
moral hazard problem right why with the
direct transfer first of all there's no
middleman it goes to the farmer and it
is his decision what he's going to do
with it the debt does not go down so
it's his decision whether I paid on debt
or use it on concern to spend and buy a
house or buy you know whatever can
discretionary spending and I think
you're putting your choice back in the
farmers and and not creating a moral
hazard problem by just forgiving debt
and you know the father
and borrows again alright gentlemen live
if it asked you to come in on that
you've been listening patiently to watch
a meal I will and was saying you know if
you can comment on and tell us you know
because there is many ways of fixing
flour distress there is a minimum
support price is one way of fixing farm
distress there is a farm loan waiver and
there is the cash transfer option and
and that is what this new yogena that
the governor has come out with her so
you know in your eyes you've seen many a
thing being done by governments and
budgets how would you rate this one you
farmer distress today is for real there
is no question of that but you know
there is a long term and a short term
sort of problem and it's long term short
term solution to it why is this distress
today the fundamental I think problem is
that today we have got almost 60 percent
of the population which is dependent on
agriculture and agriculture is now
producing contributing hardly 15 to 16
percent of the GDP
so you have got the situation of 60
percent of the population
dependent on a sector which is
contributing only 15 to 16 percent of
the GDP but it does contribute a huge
electorate and we have an election so so
this type of situation is not
sustainable so in the long run of course
there have to be means which government
has various programs in place to win
away more and more people from
dependence on Agriculture non-farm
activities whether it is horticulture
this whether it is poultry or whether it
is fisheries or other non farm
activities and also a little bit of
Education skill development providing
other top type of jobs agro-processing
so these are sort of happening there it
will take effect in the medium term but
what do you do in the short term because
this dress is for real
because no amount of income support no
amount of loan waivers no amount of
interest vention can't solve the
distress because 60% people are
dependent on 15% of GDP so in the short
term you have to give those these type
of things but basically farming which is
dependent which has so many people
dependent on it is not viable especially
for the small holding land
holding so if the farming is not viable
then this one way to showed up that
viability is give the to give them
direct income support of six thousand
eight thousand whatever so my narrative
sure of the viability by then the full
budget is presented there are more
concrete ways in which you can increase
the contribution of agriculture to the
GDP of the country or to medium term
both yes I think the month in the past
has put in place medium-term measure
which are bearing fruit all right of
course the numbers have come down it
used to be 75 percent now it is 60 and
some numbers also say it is even less
than 60 percent dependence on
agriculture or if you see the most
developed countries or other developed
economies there the dependence of
agriculture is hardly four percent
population six percent population even
though it may be contributing a larger
share to the GDP so here we've got a
very big sort of imbalance and this is
not sustainable in the medium term all
right

updates would of course get you the
latest as as the interim budget is of
course presented in the lower house of
the Parliament but for the time being
let's shift our attention to some other
stories from across world and let's
start with what Donald Trump has said
where he's claimed that the trade talks
with China in fact going pretty well but
the agreement will not be finalized
until he meets with the Chinese
president in the coming weeks the
president Donald Trump has said that he
will meet with the Chinese President Xi
Jinping soon to try to see the
comprehensive trade deal as the top a US
trade negotiator has reported
substantial progress in the high-level
talks the Trump is also added that he
was in fact extremely optimistic about
the two largest economies reaching a
deal having a very hard time they here
now we're gonna be seeing them a little
bit later we're trying to work out a new
trade deal with China
I think it'll happen something will
happen but it's a very big deal it'll be
if it does happen it'll be by far the
largest trade deal ever made and we
essentially didn't have a trade deal
with China we lost 500 billion dollars
with China for many years a year and
they went from three hundred to five
hundred five hundred and five billion
dollars a year was lost in our dealing
with China and I have a very good
relationship with President Xi and I
think we'll sit down at the end at the
end of the negotiation by our
representatives and do something with
respect to making a deal with China and
I think it has a very good chance of
all-round no formal meeting between
President Trump and Xi Jingping has been
announced so far but according to
sources Chinese trade negotiators if in
fact proposed a meeting between the
Chinese and the US president in China
next month the United States and China
have also opened the pivotal round of
today long high-level trade talks the
talks are in fact aimed at digging out
from their month-long trade war and amid
the deep differences over the Chinese
practices on intellectual property and
technology transfer now at the head of a
30 percent delegation from Beijing the
Chinese Vice Premier Li
has in fact met with the US Trade
Representative Robert lot wiser but the
talks began two days after the United
States charged the Chinese
telecommunications company who are way
and its chief financial officer Mangin
Zhu that the US Treasury secretary
Stephen Manchin has expressed optimism
saying that significant progress can in
fact be achieved during this week's
high-level trade negotiations in
Washington but the two sides have just a
month remaining in the 90-day truce a
declaration in December should the talks
fail the u.s. import duties on two
hundred billion dollars of Chinese
imports are due to more than double on
the 2nd of March now this of course is
going to be a very crucial day to watch
out for can the two leaders reach a
trade deal before that something that
economists could in fact say help knock
the wind out of the global economy sales
if the two leaders do not manage to
reach a deal

seems close to an agreement with the

next steps in the Afghanistan peace
talks remain unclear primarily over what
Afghanistan's political future could
look like and an unnerved Pakistan an
unnerved Afghanistan President Ashraf
Ghani has written a letter to American
President Donald Trump president Carney
has offered reduced costs for keeping US
troops in his country the letter comes
just a few days after the most serious
negotiations between American diplomats
and Taliban representatives in Qatar
Ashraf Ghani themes is worried about the
consequences of an abrupt American
withdrawal from an intractable war that
has lasted nearly two decades our chef
Connie is concerned about a hasty US
pull out by an increasingly impatient
donald trump fearing that it may unravel
the fragile Afghanistan state and lead
to a taliban Renishaw in power letter
also come in just a few days after the
most serious negotiations between
American diplomats and Taliban
representatives ended on what both sides
considered an upbeat note in Qatar a
shakuni's letter to trump ar-15 slogans
from both sides to discuss details of
where the costs could be reduced it also
envisioned how the troop levels could be
brought down from the current 14,000 to
a more efficient level if the troops are
reduced to around 3,000 it could help
Washington save almost two billion
dollars meanwhile the US point person in
that dialogues are make ELISA took to
Twitter saying and I'm quoting we made
significant progress on two vital issues
counterterrorism and troop withdrawal
that does not mean we are done we are
not even finished with these issues yet
and there is still work to be done on
other vital issues like intra of God I
log and a complete cease cease fire he
also went on to say that at 40 year that
the 40 year long war cannot be brought
to an end with just a meeting spanning
six days here's where things stand as of
now US officials say the Taliban must
engage in direct talks with Afghanistan
leaders about the country's political
future before a withdrawal deal with the
seeds can be concluded but time is
running out thanks to Donald Trump's
impatience the Taliban are yet to signal
that they are willing to talk to the
Afghanistan government and even if the
Taliban showed that intent the Afghan
side is divided in ways that seem
difficult to reconcile and joining us on
the broadcast this evening is micro
coulomb and seniors who see it for South
Asia let's begin by asking you for your
reaction to water Ashraf Ghani has a
proposed in that letter addressed to US
President Donald Trump there are many in
the Afghan political circles who look at
Kearney as an obstacle to peace if he
resisted to the US withdrawal and
pushing that deal because he worries it
could hurt his bid for a second year a
second five years old this peace process
that has sidelined Kabul continues to
play out in the US and the Taliban
signed some sort of deal without
Afghanistan I would certainly make Ghani
look bad and that conceivably could
undercut his prospects for re-election
however I do think that Ghani has good
reason for being concerned and I don't
think we should only attribute this this
this concern on his part to or to
politics I mean it is very true that you
know if Kabul is sidelined from this
this dialogue between the u.s. and the
Taliban it could cause a lot of
stability risk to Afghanistan I mean if
the US and Taliban agree on some sort of
deal in which the Taliban says that it
will agree to a ceasefire and it says
that the little agreed to talks with
Kabul you know the u.s. would then have
its troop withdrawal plan in place that
could start withdrawing troops it would
not be able to enforce any type of
commitment from the Taliban to to
actually stop fighting and to start and
to start talking to the Afghan officials
and that could plunge Afghanistan into
tremendous amount of instability much
more than what it has now so I think
both factors are at play
I mean Ghani is certainly concerned
about political implications but also
the very real fears that Afghanistan
could be in really big trouble
if there is this deal that does not
include
the Afghan government and is this a
proposal that would work well for the
United States according to you well I
mean from the perspective of the Trump
administration particularly Trump
himself you know the the US government
is wants to get a deal on a once one
fast so that it can get out
Trump clearly wants to get out of
Afghanistan and he wants to have a deal
any type of deal to give him the cover
to initiate a troop withdrawal from
Afghanistan so in that sense you know if
this framework agreement that the u.s.
now has with the Taliban becomes a
full-fledged deal then that would be
good for the United States unless the
deal were to fall apart and let's face
it you know if there's a deal between
the u.s. and the Taliban and the US
starts withdrawing troops and then the
Taliban decides not to hold up its end
of the bargain and it decides to start
fighting and it doesn't talk to Kabul
that would be a pretty major defeat
strategic defeat for the United States
it would make the United States look bad
so I think at this point sort of too
early to tell how beneficial this type
of deal would be for the United States
we'd have to see if it actually holds
and if the Taliban holds up its end of
the bargain
and as you mentioning of course Ashraf
Ghani does have a good enough reason to
fear given that Afghanistan has in a way
been not involved in the peace talks so
far yeah I mean this is true I mean it's
absurd to think that a country that's
been at war for the fur for so many
years could be left out of a peace
process to end that war I mean it
boggles the mind it simply can't happen
that's why there needs to be some way to
get the Afghan government into this
conversation between the u.s. and the
Taliban which of course has also
included the Saudis and the Pakistanis
and others involved in these in these
discussions but the Taliban has been
very consistent for many years that it
regards the Afghan government
particularly the current Afghan
government is illegitimate and that's
why I worry that even if it claims it
will agreed to talk to Kabul eventually
I really don't know if it would I think
it would just take advantage of an
opportunity particularly if you have a
US troop withdrawal take advantage of a
major battle see
advantage to taste a fight more
intensely to try to overthrow the Afghan
government are we gonna lead to go
forward the moment Michael Cooper man
thanks very much indeed for getting us
meanwhile Russia is also all set to host
Afghan and Taliban politicians opposed
to President Ashraf Ghani reports
quoting US officials have called it a
move by Moscow to promote its role as a
father broker and an attempt to quote
unquote muddled the us-backed peace
process the proposal to hold talks is
also being seen as Russia taking forward
its attempts to bring both the warring
parties within Afghanistan to the table
for talks the Taliban had been long
refused to speak to the Afghani
government calling them puppets of the
United States
now this attempt at mediation by Russia
is a continuation of that effort known
as the Moscow format which had held its
last round of talks in November Russia
had to overcome resistance on both sides
for bringing the two sides to talks
while the Taliban had in the past
condemned the Afghanistan President as
illegitimate they have gone government
accused Russia of boosting the Taliban's
legitimacy on the world stage the last
conference in the Moscow format was
attended by 12 countries including
Pakistan China in the US and five former
Soviet republics India had made its
presence felt through a non official
delegation comprising two well-known
former diplomat TCA dragwon and amar
Sinha in the opening ceremony the
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov
had said that their efforts are aimed at
creating favorable conditions for the
start of direct talks between the Afghan
government and the Taliban observers
believe that this may be Russia's bid to
regain influence in a country from where
its forces had to withdraw three decades
ago the Taliban will likely come back to
Moscow along with politicians who are
opposed to the government no sign of the
actual Afghanistan government coming to
Moscow on Tuesday but I think Moscow is
hoping that if it can get its dialogue
together get those two sides talking
even if it's with the opposition
politicians then that might move towards
a talking with the actual Afghanistan
government itself the u.s. as you say
sees this as a disruptive force that
this is Moscow confusing things slightly
by having a second
stalks going along while the US ones are
still going and they see this as just a
confusion but of course Russia and the
US are poles apart at the moment in
terms of their relationship with each
other so Russia's going to continue
anyway it's a move which has potentially
huge strategic implications diplomatic
sources in Pakistan telling be on world
is one that Saudi Arabia schoo a Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman is expected
to visit Pakistan in the third week of
February during his visit between the
15-7 17th of February Pakistan is likely
to sign several mo use worth fifteen
billion dollars the biggest ever
investment in Pakistan the Saudi prince
will be accompanied by a 102 member
delegation including some ministers the
crown prince had met with Pakistan Prime
Minister on calm during the global
investors conference in Saudi Arabia
last October Khan had traveled to Riyadh
for seeking aid from the Saudi
leadership in order to help his country
come out of the financial mess and
escape the balance of payments crisis
the Saudi government had been agreed to
give Pakistan three billion dollars in
foreign currency support and a further
loan of three billion dollars in
deferred payments for oil imports
reports say that the Saudis are now
planning to invest in an oil refinery
power generation project petrochemicals
and mining as well in Pakistan but it's
not known if the Saudi desire to build a
refinery near the guava port being
developed with China's health would be
welcomed at all in Beijing the head from
Saudi Arabia China and the UAE is likely
to help Pakistan reduce the size of a
bailout package that it is seeking from
the International Monetary Fund
meanwhile there are few reports that
suggest that the Saudi conference may be
planning a visit to India in February
the wizard may come as a boost for the
Indian government as the Saudi
investment in the country is a
relatively low the sweeping crackdown on
corruption in Saudi Arabia has come to
an end the purge would have which had
been ordered by the Saudi Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman in November 2017 so
well over 381 people which included
several high-profile princes stopped by
business tycoons and ministers of the
Saudi Arabia administration were rounded
up and held captive at the five-star
with Skelton hotel
in a statement the Saudi royal court in
on Wednesday claimed that over one
hundred and six billion dollars had been
recovered for the state coffers but
interestingly the corruption crackdown
has ended as suddenly as it began Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman had claimed
that the corruption purge was necessary
as it was shock therapy which the Saudi
economy needed to diversify itself
beyond oil exports however as the
corruption purged had predominantly
targeted those who were perceived as a
rival power centers among the Saudi
elite bin Salman corruption purge was
seen as a power play and an exercise to
consolidate his own position Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman cousin such
as billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed
bin Talal National Guard Minister
transmit their and former Riyadh
governor Prince Turki bin Abdullah had
been rounded up as part of that purge
according to reports the likes of
friends of Alva Dean Talal who were also
tortured and only released after paying
up a hefty settlement amount of over 1
billion dollars however the killing of
journalist jamal keshavjee inside the
Saudi consulate in Istanbul has severely
dented the image of the Saudi Crown
Prince earlier remember there were also
strong reactions coming in against that
crackdown after the crowd crackdown in

let's get straight to some news that is
just coming before the show began
rejecting a report which claimed that
India's unemployment rate is at a 45
your high the indeed government in the
form of NEET the Isles vice chairman has
said that the veracity of the data is
still not wrong either I want to state
it very categorically that this data
this report that is being cited is not
yet finalized is a draft report and the
data that is being cited is not yet to
be in some is not yet been finalized or
approved by the government so therefore
using this data I think is not the right
thing to do and the reason for that is
very simple the reason for that is that
this this data is still being looked at
because we have to we have to publish
the quarter-on-quarter report because
that is the right thing to do the
clarification has been issued after the
opposition parties of India attacked the
government over a survey by the National
Sample Survey office or the NSS owes
periodic labour force survey the report
has led to the outbreak of a huge
controversy just a day before the
government is set to present the interim
budget the report has not been released
officially despite being vetted by the
National Statistical Commission in the
month of December last year reports say
that two non independent members had
quit the data creating body because of
its not being released by the
authorities according to the report the
survey conducted between July 2017 and
June 2018 showed that the unemployment
rate is at six point one percentage
which is the highest since they are
1972-73 a survey has become a political
issue after the acting chairman and
another member of the body that reviewed
the jobs data resigned saying that there
was a delay in its release Congress
party president Rahul Gandhi took a job
at the Narendra Modi government on
Twitter calling the rather
relation and national disaster nithya
yoga said that the government did not
release the data and that it is still
being processed and in some more late
evening breaking news that has just come
in India's Central Statistical
organisation has given out a new set of
revised growth estimates for India's GDP
keep in mind the early estimate pegged
GDP growth at are disappointing six
point seven percentage but now just a
day before the budget presentation comes
this announcement GDP growth for the
current financial year 2017-18 has been
hiked up to 7.2 percentage which is
about the seven percentage mark and
sounds far better keep in mind but
interestingly the CS or the Central
Statistical organisation is also at the
same time slashed down the growth rates
for the primary sectors of the economy
like agriculture forestry fishing and
mining by nearly 2 percentage to 5
percentage from 6.8 percentage in the
previous estimate the growth rate for
the secondary sectors that include
manufacturing electricity gas water
supplies and other utilities too has
been brought down by a big margin to
just 6 the limits from the previous 7.8
percentage while the services sector or
the tertiary sectors growth has been
pegged lower again at eight point one s
and one percentage from the previous
eight point four percentage

so India is bracing for a budget just a
couple of months ahead of the big
general elections a budget before the
election is invariably colored by the
politics around it
governments do tend to resort to
populist measures to appease the
electorate it's even considered par for
the course but in the year 2019 India is
the fastest growing large economy in the
world according to many economists and
experts but it's an economy that is
faced with many risks and uncertainties
those same economists also warned that
India needs to be more disciplined in
terms of its fiscal deficit despite all
the praise heaped around the world the
Indian economy is in need of a booster
shot that can create jobs and increase
the purchasing power of the near
billion-and-a-half population there are
opportunities aplenty to do that and in
that context budget 2019 gains huge
significance despite it being a
so-called intent budget from the farmer
to the middle class from the
industrialists to the startups there are
expectations across the board let's take
a look at a few of them the rural
economy to start with leads are kick
start at this stage of India's growth
story and if in their hopes to achieve
eight percentage growth then budget 2019
will need schemes to boost the rural
economy so all eyes will be on that at
the same time that we a close watch on
what kind of allocations for schemes to
address farmer distress are being
announced after all its of autumn times
that the present gamma AB solutely needs
to please if it wants to retain power
the anger of the middle class - has been
certainly rising and to assuage that a
higher income tax exemption limit is
something that's keenly awaited as
always apart from a rise in tax
exemption limit for home loans this
trammel are specific projects and plans
with an outline of the kind of job
creation that they will entail will be
the primary focus while
spent on the universal basic income
scheme front is also something that's
expected copied India meanwhile we'll be
looking at the investment outlay for
creating fresh infrastructure with new
roads railway lines or any other
projects because that means big
government business for them in
particular real estate companies who are
suffering some of their worst times will
be hoping for some kind of relief in
budget 2019 well medium and small
businesses will have their fingers
crossed for any kind of a reduction in
GST rates do expect that for 2018-19
the government will come very close to
sticking to its 3.3% fiscal deficit and
we expect for next year there will be
another effort to consolidate the
deficit modestly now remember the
February budget is less important
because really what the government's
asking for is Parliament to approve
expenditures for the next four months
you have a full budget in July and
that's when all these assumptions will
be revisited but our sense is the
government's still going to you know try
and reduce the deficit the question is
if there is new spending on an
agricultural package that is being
spoken about how will that be financed
will that be financed out of existing
welfare programs will let be financed
out of new revenue measures I think it's
important that if there is new spending
the government lay out how that will be
financed so that we don't have any new
unfunded liabilities going into the next
government start Reggie at 10 you
comment can announce all kinds of
schemes in in the speech I mean it can
lay down how it would what it would do
for the farmers or the poor or say that
they would introduce new schemes so that
really doesn't affect the second part of
the budget which is the actual hard
numbers which on the expenditure side
and the tax side so I expect definitely
the government would have a bold
framework in the speech but my my guess
would be at this point that as far as
the budget numbers are
son though there would be more like
token expenditures and tax adjustments
there would not be a massive increase
what could be called populist
in in the usual sense of the world
arguing that you know India should
gradually consolidate so certainly we
want India to persist on that path see
the deficits decline and also the debt
levels to decline it almost seven
percent is seven percent deficit if you
look at the general government if we add
the states and almost seventy percent
debt these are relatively high levels
for an emerging economy and we want to
have the space that when there's a
negative shock you know the FISC can
help and so I think we would want to see
a continuation of that of that
consolidation path and especially also
that constellation needs to happen at
the overall public sector so some of one
of the issues we've seen we have seen
that the budget central budget has has
been declining the budget deficit but in
the other hand we also seen some extra
budgetary activities picking up so it's
it's important to take a global view and
and to create this fiscal space that we
need you know to be ready if there's a
negative shot now after the crackdown in
India Johnson and Johnson's baby powder
is now set to be off the shelves in Sri
Lanka the island nation has now halted
imports until the company proves its
product is free from the cancer-causing
asbestos - Sri Lankan government
officials and the products local
distributor have confirmed this
development to Reuters news agency while
the existing stockpiles or the products
can still be sold there will be no new
imports of the talc until the fresh test
results come from Johnson & Johnson
India because that's where Sri Lanka
imports the product from a popular
healthcare product across sri lanka and
in fact much of Asia reports of the baby
powder containing asbestos broke on the
14th of December last year by Reuters
which reported that the US drugs and
consumer products group knew that it's
baby powder had cans causing asbestos
for decades but the
think about it that led to a series of
crackdowns by Diamond authorities in
many countries including India the
report was based on thousands of pages
of company memos internal reports and
other confidential documents Johnson and
Johnson
lashed out of the Reuters story calling
it quote unquote one-sided false and
inflammatory a spokeswoman for Johnson &
Johnson India declined to comment on the
halt of shipments to Sri Lanka - but
said that the company is fully
cooperating with the Indian government
and are awaiting results from their
testing meanwhile it's a war of the tech
titans the cold war between Apple and
Facebook is now heating up it all
started after Facebook was discovered to
be snooping on iPhone users in an
unethical way it was reported that
Facebook bypassed Apple's App Store's
approval process and promoted teenagers
to ethically install a data collecting
app to mine users data Facebook in
return paid the teenagers and other
users aged between 13 to 35 up to $20 a
month for full access to their devices
and their data it allowed Facebook to
track users as location app usage
spending habits and other activities the
program is a clear violation of their
agreement with Apple and this didn't go
down too well with Apple which responded
aggressively and cut off Facebook's
access to all testing tools that the
social networking giant uses to ensure
that its apps are ready for use on Apple
devices but the war between the tech
bear moths doesn't end there after
Facebook now Google is receiving flack
for obtaining user details in an
unethical way according to a new media
report Google has been running screen
wise meter which is a private app for
monitoring the iPhones usage in the
backdrop of the entire controversy
Google has removed the app from the iOS
or the Apple's operating system and
apologized for it even according to
Google it was a mistake but a
spokesperson also insisted that there
been up front with users who can opt out
of
at any time and that it is totally
voluntary while tech giants like
Facebook and Google may have disabled
their versions of spying apps it leaves
us wondering how safe is our data online
all over again
now Facebook has had a terrible year a
year of scandals right from Cambridge
analytic our two other privacy scandals
but it turns out that despite all the
bad press Facebook has had a terrific
year when it comes to business Facebook
has done very well both in terms of the
number of active users on the platform
and in terms of revenue first let's take
a look at the number of users an
indicator that seems to suggest that
users are turning a blind eye to privacy
concerns there were more than 1.5 to
billion people using Facebook every day
in December 2018 and 9 percentage
increase your on your monthly active
users were also up nine percentage
year-on-year with two point three two
billion as of 31st December 2018 this
growth is across all geographic areas
keep in mind the user growth was
particularly strong in India Indonesia
and the Philippines the last two
quarters had seen the number of users
shrink in Europe and Plateau in North
America this quarter's growth is not the
best that face because at but it does
Marco returned to the company's usual
upward trend after signs that it might
be beginning to falter now let's take a
look at the profits Facebook's annual
revenues are up 30 percentage positive
results for revenue and user growth sent
Facebook's stock soaring up eight
percentage in after-hours trading on

Myanmar now you think healthy dishes
can't be prepared fast but you could be
wrong in a record attempt 300 healthy
dishes were prepared in under five
minutes
our correspondent Sadat MP reports on
the no oil no boil record attempt in the
southern Indian city of Chennai taken
all clad in white gloves own apron on
chef's hat on hundreds of chefs sought
the ingredients and get them ready
they seem to be on a mission but what's
this all about
I know boil in oil concept they have
prepared nearly 300 dishes and preparing
the dishes without oil was really a big
challenge whether it will be by thinking
whether it will have your taste or how
the 300 dishes could be prepared but
they came up with the many dishes like
even like Italy's Brioni and sandwiches
which utilize only the natural items
it's an attempt to set a world record
300 students preparing 300 unique dishes
using fruits vegetables and grains
none of them used oil all this done it
was an all natural feast down to every
detail unprocessed ingredients were used
all used natural sugar like palm sugar
or brown sugar water sugar alternative
for the no for the healthy lifestyle so
that is the main concept and even the
grains if you see we're not we didn't
use the regular cereals and there's
grains we all used to have never very
traditional grains like mill Latino Joe
are bars all these other you know
traditional cereals and pulses so which
is very healthy in a matter of minutes
the colorful dishes were ready served in
showcased on Erica leaf plates topped
with plantain leaves in a world-record
attempt in Chennai three hundred

Chinese New Year celebrations while
moving on to other news now in the
United States and China have opened a
pivotal round of two day-long high-level
trade talks the talks are aimed at
digging out from their months long trade
war amid deep differences over China's
practices on influential property and
Technology Transfer intellectual
property and technology transfer at the
head of the 30 person delegation from
Beijing Chinese Vice Premier met with
the US Trade Representative as well the
talks began two days after the United
States charged with Chinese
telecommunications company Wahby and its
chief financial officer Meng Wang Shu US
Treasury secretary Stephen moon eachin
expressed optimism saying that
significant progress can be achieved
during this week's high-level trade
negotiations in Washington the two sides
have just a month remaining in the 90
day truce declared in December should
the talks fail u.s. import duties on two
hundred billion dollars in Chinese
imports are due to to more than double
on mass second something economists say
would help knock the wind out of the
global economy's sales
and well we're joined by Patrick for
correspondent from Beijing and Patrick
what were the reactions in the trade
discussions from the Chinese side at the
briefing earlier today what reporters as
you can imagine are very keen to get
updates on the trade talks but when
asked for details and what the
government's expectations were for
coming out of them spokesperson for the
Ministry of Commerce gaffing simply said
they had no information at this time now
he was also asked about this issue of IP
protection which we know is a key
concern for the Americans in these
discussions
he said that China had done a remarkable
amount of the last year to strengthen
legislation in that regard and also said
that a judicial framework had been set
up to crack down on illegal activity
related to IP protection now he also
spoke about a significant development
that's taken place here in the last
couple of days the National People's
Congress standing committee has just
finalized new legislative proposals to
streamline foreign investments they're
essentially aimed at leveling the
playing field for foreign companies so
that they're treated in the same way
that Chinese companies are here and they
also have provisions in them for IP
protection analysts say it's significant
not just a because of the timing but
also because the speed at which these
proposals have been pushed through and
perhaps it's likely that negotiators in
Washington will be pointing towards
these efforts in their discussions right
and so what's the feeling in China about
whether there will actually be any
progress made in the round of talks we
know the US has said that the talks are
positive there is a lot of skepticism at
what these talks can achieve exactly
given both sides simply don't see eye to
eye on certain issues but media here is
reporting that there is a lot of
optimism as well that at least some
progress will be made the Global Times
had an article saying the fact that
lyoha traveled to Washington so close to
the Spring Festival holidays was a
positive sign and showed that China
was sincere about trying to achieve some
sort of breakthrough at the same time
the same article said that there were
dark clouds hanging over these talks and
pointed in particular towards the u.s.
indictments against a Huawei and in a
separate article in the Global Times it
also talked about economic figures that
were recently released too by the
Ministry of Commerce saying that
outbound investment from China to North
America notably Canada as well as the US
have fallen by as much as 70 percent in
the last year and it suggested that the
US would suffer if this trade war
continues and that app banned
investments from China would continue to
grow but perhaps the business will be
taken elsewhere all right Patrick thanks
very much indeed for joining us well in

for home loans now specific projects and

also something that is expected
corporate India will be looking at the

Warw8WQodds,Russia to host talks as peace negotiations gather Steam,"Russia will host the Taliban and Afghan politicians opposed to President Ashraf Ghani on Tuesday, Russian and Taliban sources ...",2019-01-31T14:13:25Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Warw8WQodds/hqdefault.jpg,"and will further development in this
story in Russia is set to host the
Taliban and Afghan politicians opposed
to President Ashraf Ghani it seems
reports quoting the US officials have
called it removed by Moscow to promote
its role as a power broker and an
attempt to quote unquote
muddle the us-backed peace process the
proposal to hold talks is also being
seen as Russia taking forward its
attempts to bring both two warring sides
within Afghanistan to the table for
talks the Taliban had for long refused
to talk to the Ghani government calling
them puppets of the United States licit
em to mediate by Russia is in
continuation of the effort known as the
Moscow format which had held its last
round of talks in November Russia had to
overcome resistance on both sides for
bringing the the two sides to talks
while the Taliban had in the past
condemned they've gone president as
illegitimate they've gone government
accused Russia of boosting the Taliban's
legitimacy on the world stage the last
conference in Moscow format was attended
by 12 countries including Pakistan China
India US and five former Soviet
republics India has made its presence
felt through a non official delegation
comprising two well-known former
diplomats dca Rahman and amar Sinha in
the opening ceremony the Russian Foreign
Minister had said that their efforts are
aimed at creating favorable conditions
for the start of direct talks between
the Afghan government and Taliban
observers believe that this may be
Russia's bid to regain influence in the
country from where its forces have
withdrawn three decades ago and Don
Ashby is now joining us live from Moscow
for the very latest on this development
in Afghanistan and Dan Ashby well many
developments in the last couple of days
as far as they have gone peace processes
concerned and now Russia opening up
another channel of communication with
the with the Taliban and dose cough in
Afghan government which are not
favorable to Ashraf Ghani how is this
going to play out at a time when the
u.s. is also having a dialogue with the
Taliban well I think the way the Russia
sees it is that simply the u.s. talks
are destined to fail and that the US has
had
in years to try to sort this out and it
doesn't appear as if the talks are going
anywhere so Russia is intent on holding
its own talks as you say on Tuesday the
Taliban will likely come back to Moscow
along with politicians who are opposed
to the government no sign of the actual
Afghanistan government coming to Moscow
on Tuesday but I think Moscow is hoping
that if it can get its dialogue together
get those two sides talking even if it's
with the opposition politicians then
that might move towards a talking with
the actual Afghanistan government itself
the u.s. as you say sees this as a
disruptive force that this is Moscow
confusing things slightly by having a
second peace talks going along while the
US ones are still going and they see
this is just a confusion but of course
Russia and the US are poles apart at the
moment in terms of their relationship
with each other so Russia's going to
continue anyway yeah so what what does
this really do to the process that
already been building up now we also
have ashraf ghani of course talking to
the US pleading in a sense to them to
not do a complete withdrawal of troops
that that it could lead to a dangerous
situation
in in in afghanistan he feels with with
once again the taliban ization of
afghanistan in a way yes exactly it's
hard to see how this is going to make
peace more likely having two peace talks
running at the same time because of
course what it could do is give the
likes of the Taliban more leverage
because they could go to one set of
peace talks and demands one thing and
then try get better terms from the
Russian side so certainly it's going to
complicate the issue I guess it depends
on whether you believe that Moscow are
the ones who can actually achieve the
peace in the long run but as you say the
us-led talks say that they're making
some progress now they have outlined
this framework where they say that will
eventually lead to the withdrawal of US
troops there are some big sticking
points about the ceasefire whether a
ceasefire should be agreed before the
troops leave or afterwards and I think
those sticking points is what Moscow
suspects are huge sticking points
problems that will actually bring down
the peace talks themselves but that's
not the way America sees it they think
they're making progress and they see
this whole other moscow set of talks as
a huge distraction that's only gonna
ruin things
well Dan Ashby thanks very much indeed

gave for withdrawing last year from a

officials took issue with Trump's
assertion that the Islamic state group
has been defeated and that North Korea
can be convinced to forego its nuclear
weapons the underscored again that they
believe Russia meddled deeply on Trump's
behalf in the 2016 presidential election
which Trump has so far denied the
hearing took place weeks after Trump
announced an immediate pullout of US
troops from Syria citing victory over
Islamic state as a justification the
move that alarmed the u.s. defense

so I was seeing all kinds of weather

across the globe and the Met department
a well worldwide meteorologists actually
have blamed the phenomenon called polar
vortex for the bitter cold that has
descended on much of central in eastern
United States this week forcing
residents to huddle in doors closing
schools and businesses and canceling
flights as honest as the term polar
vortex sounds now meteorologists say
that the phenomenon is not new there is
some debate however among scientists
about whether polar vortex is have
become more frequent and if so what
effect climate change might have on them
a polar vortex refers to an upper level
jet stream that typically circulates a
wind pattern essentially around both the
North and South Poles keeping the
coldest air there this winter in the US
it happens to be well the extreme
example of some of the cold arctic air
making it down to the US so basically
breaking its vortex and moving towards
the u.s. the potentially
record-shattering low temperatures
descending or a large swath of the
country may touch of a political debate
over global warming scientists say
studies offer evidence that the
stratosphere over the Arctic is changing
and so disruptions to the polar vortex
are increasing scientists say higher
temperatures in the Arctic have led to
historically low levels of ice that in
turn has led to changes in the jet
stream causing the polar vortex to
buckle even as India and China remain
engaged resolve bilateral issues the
u.s. believes ties between the two sides
will remain tense this year the
conclusion has been made in the latest
worldwide threat assessment report of

divisions we take you on a short trip
the residents of the small town of barla
are used to getting the best and the
worst of two worlds literally as it is
located at the border of Belgium and the
Netherlands this line separates the two
countries running through a town of
12,000 people they have two local
governments to mayors two postal
services and two
school systems for businesses the dual
legislation is a big asset as they are
free to choose between Dutch and Belgian
utilities for example Dutch barley nasaw
is the place to go for food and
belgian-born ahead code for cigarettes
and gas the good thing is that everybody
can go shop things where they want they
can to go to school what I look for the
best for their children they can who
chopped in Holland we can shop or they
go good
the petrol in Belgium that's cheaper the
cigarettes are cheaper in Belgium so
people are moving over and they they
take where it is best yeah
problem is that you have sometimes have
to do things double and for instance
with when your house is half Belgium
house Holland you have to pay taxes in
two countries and things like that until
the Netherlands followed Belgium into
the euro zone in 2002 local said to even
carry two different currencies you have
to always keep in mind that your door
that's a border and you have people
working for the Dutch company or for the
Belgian company so it depends on in
which company they work that means that
they also have different holidays for
example there's a Belgium national
holiday then the guys who work in the
Dutch company that will be here and we
have an advantage because there is
always somebody in the company also on
those kind of days so we have for the
service it's a good job that they that
there is always somebody available to
help our clients the xxx Enclave
patchwork that is barley traces its
history from medieval landlords
exchanging territory but deciding to
keep the most cultivated profitable
parts in 1843 the main border between
Belgium and the Netherlands
was established but the situation around
Varla was so complicated that the border
was left open until the 1970s when it
became a hotspot for smugglers as
neither Belgian nor Dutch national
legislation provided for situations
where house could straddle national
borders the local authorities were
forced to establish a front door rule
meaning that the property based its
address on which way its front door was
facing in 1995 by fixing our and clay
borders we have had a very special
occasion I was living in old lady let's
say 86 years and the commissioners find
out that she was not living in Belgium
but she was living in the Netherlands so
they told the lady you have to change
your passport because you are living in
the Netherlands no she said I will never
do that because I'm Delta so there was a
big problem and then the mayor has gone
to the lady to find out what the problem
exactly was and he saw the situation and
the solution was so simple there was a
door party with one sided or one side
two window and by turning around those
this frame 180 degrees was fixed because
then the goal was on Belgium again the
lady was happy again so despite
conflicts in the past the locals are

1PDavsdGl0o,Gravitas: Theresa May to re-negotiate Brexit deal with EU,UK prime minister Theresa May is seeking to re-open the negotiation of Brexit deal with the European union. Watch the video to ...,2019-01-29T17:27:04Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1PDavsdGl0o/hqdefault.jpg,"now the latest from brexit it's a
crucial day for British prime minister
Theresa May the House of Commons will
vote on maize breads at Plan B the
lawmakers will also vote on a series of
alternatives the solutions have
suggested Teresa may has informed her
cabinet that she will ask the EU to
reopen the withdrawal agreement not just
that she's determined to seek legally
binding changes to the Irish backstop
Teresa Me's comments have come even as
the European Union rejected the idea of
renegotiating brexit they do not want to
revise this deal deal that sets us on
course for a bright future that's what I
believe this house wants it's what this
government wants it's what I want and it
is what the British people want and
today we have the chance to show the
European Union what it will take to get
a deal through this House of Commons so
there are three amendments that will be
debated today the first one seeks legal
changes to the issue of the Irish
backstop seen a conservative leader
ground Brady has proposed to vote for an
alternative to the backstop but there is
there are no final details on his
proposal just yet Theresa May has backed
this amendment she believes a favorable
vote on the amendment will help her in
the talks to the European Union a
majority of the conservative probe
brexit areas are opposed to a no deal
scenario and I think there's much less
appetite to have a new deal scenario so
I think that it's in everybody's
interest that we come to an agreement
that allows the United Kingdom to leave
the European Union but with minimal
disruption on both sides I've always
been in favor of getting a deal but no
deals nothing to be frightened of other
members of the party are more frightened
of nadeo and if we can have some unity I
think that is a good thing and would be
in the national interest seen a
conservative lawmakers Jacob Riis mogh
and former foreign secretary Boris
Johnson have demanded that Teresa may
should reopen the issue of the Irish
backstop the Prime Minister is expected
to talk to EU leaders after the House of
Commons vote today there is another
amendment that the Labour Party is
looking
looking at with interests Labour Party
is likely to back the so-called Cooper
amendment it aims to extend the article
50 negotiating period this will mean
that the breakfast deadline can be
extended by nine months if the
Parliament does not have be on an exit
plan by the 13th of February a positive
result on Cooper agree a cooper
amendment would help the Labour Party to
wrest control from Teresa me as well as
eliminate the chances of a catastrophic
No Deal brexit but the Conservatives
have issued a width against this
amendment there is another crucial
amendment before the House of Commons
drafted by a conservative and a Labour
senior leader this amendment seeks to
prevent drags it all together so where
do things stand for Theresa May if the
Parliament does not reach an agreement
on a brexit deal
till the 13th of February Theresa May is
likely to reopen discussions on brexit
after 18 months of painful negotiations
Theresa May and the European Union had
agreed on a plan for the Irish backstop
but now they're back to square one it
seems the United Kingdom is still in a
Bridget flux there is no consensus on
crucial issues and the no deal scenario
is not ruled out till now the
possibility of a no deal breaks it in
fact has caused concerns for people as
well as businesses the shadow of a no
deal brexit sandy Irish backstop looms
large on Prime Minister may even as she
seeks sort of and approvals for her plan
be for more on this we have beyond
correspondent Natalie Powell with us
from London Natalie how are things
shaping does does the debate hold any
clues to which way this is going is is
it is it inching closer to a no deal
breaks it scenario well of course that's
one of the things we're likely to find
out about following the day long of
debates that we're experiencing at the
moment with MPs in Parliament they are
debating some seven amendments that have
been tabled and then chosen by the
Speaker of the House of Commons
amendments to of course the original
brexit deal that Theresa May failed to
pass through the House of Commons now
the UK government has backed one of the
amendments which is all about reopening
negotiations surrounding the Irish
border backstop issue which we know has
been a real sticking point throughout
this brexit negotiation period and
certainly MPs are not very happy with
the backstop solution that has been
proposed what this amendment is doing
though is proposing alternative
arrangements what they will look like
however will need to be debated by MPs
and possibly then the UK prime minister
will be able to go back to Brussels try
to reopen that EU withdrawal agreement
which all EU member states have signed
off on so that's clearly not going to be
a very popular move but to try to get
some clarity on that some more
assurances on that so that MPs in the UK
Parliament would potentially vote
through another deal but as you've said
the date of leaving the EU is drawing
ever closer that's the 29th of March of
course the default position is a no deal
and what we're seeing from some of these
amendments are ways to try to avoid that
No Deal from taking place but a lot of
negotiations are expected and certainly
as that date creeps ever closer if there
is no solution or no brexit deal decided
and signed off on by UK Parliament then
certainly the UK could well be facing a
no deal exit from the European Union
so we've seen endless debates we've seen
a barrage of news flashes coming out of
the House of Commons but it seems that
all they're doing is a lot of talking
and a lot of politics what about the
people of Britain are it tired is it has
a brexit fatigue set in even before
greg's it begins I think the brexit
fatigue possibly set in some time back
of course we've been hearing about that
here in the UK for the past two years
with the negotiations taking place of
course the UK prime minister herself
says that she believes that the people
of Britain simply want a deal to be done
and of course there are warnings about
what a node
you'll scenario would look like that it
could be damaging to the UK in a number
of ways but equally it could also be
fairly damaging to EU Member States as
well so there is a lot of uncertainty in
the UK at the moment about what it is
that is going to happen of course this
is a very divided country over the
subject of brexit the vote itself the
referendum results itself almost split
down the middle 52% voting to leave
48% voting to remain of course so this
was always going to be a very difficult
situation to try to tread those two
paths given that the results were so
close really and I think what we are
seeing is a lot of people are quite
nervous about what the future may hold
but also wondering what is actually
going to happen with this stalemate that
appears to be taking place in the
British Parliament right badly Paul
thanks very much for joining us the vote
slated for later today of course will be
tracking the story coming out of London

a rushing wall of mud enough to fill a
football stadium more than six times
turned this lush green Community into a
disaster Zone
in the place where the dam collapsed
there was a dining hall a parking lot
and the mining company offices so all of
them are probably under this much
after a massive Dam collapsed at a mine
site a torrent of mining waste was
released turning this Lush land into
rivers of mud stretching miles dozens of
helicopters are circling the area the
thick mud is too treacherous for ground
Rescuers
hundreds still remain missing and with
every passing second hope is fading
I still have some lingering hope but I
can't imagine what he will be like when
I see him next will he be alive or dead
if our final hope is dashed he will have
left behind his pregnant wife his baby
will be born on the 20th or the 21st
next month what should we do it's a
desperate situation
rescue operations are now on in full
swing food water clothes and other
supplies are being stalked and
distributed
to tackle the unprecedented disaster
help is pouring in from across the world
an Israeli search and rescue team has
landed to assist local Crews more than
130 Personnel were flown in for the
operation
firefighters are now going back to the
side to rescue animals which were left
behind after the dam collapse
those who did Escape This Disaster
consider themselves lucky but they have
lost their homes and all their
possessions
I fell to my knees and started crying I
started to cry thanking God for saving
me my children my mother and my nephew

Patrick Fork is joining us live now from
Hong Kong for the very latest on this
and now Patrick well the nervousness
about Chinese technology has long
existed in the US but is this a fear of
cyber warfare or a fear of economic
dominance of this of the telecom space
in Beijing in fact but I think to answer
your question I think it's very clear
that it's a little bit of both and to
answer exactly why you have to
understand the capacity of 5g and the
importance of it and controlling 5g
networks really means having control of
an entire ecosystem it's been described
by one analyst at least as being almost
as important as electricity and the
fears are in the u.s. that if China
dominates a 5g networks than it will
have control of an entire ecosystem and
it's our nervous system and as we know
that is going to be critical in an age
where it will have control of all data
transfer and transfer of information and
we know already that Donald Trump er has
made it clear that he sees it as being a
little bit of both and the two are very
closely tied together so on one hand he
wants to balance trade and dominates for
the u.s. at least leads the world
economically but this is also in his
view about putting a check on China's
military power and this isn't lost on
China either only about a week ago we
learned from reports that China for the
first time has it's it's land power it's
an army effectively is no longer more
than half the size of its overall
security forces and that it's that it's
that it's cyber security plays a much
more prominent part of its national
defenses than ever before and the
question is whether or not what the US
is doing is right and fair right and
Patrick then that of course brings us to
the second question and the u.s. is
known to push other nations as well and
are they going to a follow suit and risk
well inflamed in China which could
hamper their own access to the growing
Chinese market and deprive them of
Cheaper huawei products as well
well it's very difficult to see it will
say how China is going to react exactly
but certainly China appears to think
that it is being unfairly treated at the
moment and as we know from the reports
no smoking gun has been found so far the
u.s. as we as you mentioned has long had
concerns that Huawei is being used to
spy on its citizens through backdoor
technology on on its chips but that has
never been proven beyond any shadow of
doubt and the only suggestion that there
has been any linked so far between
Huawei and the government is this Huawei
executive that was rested in Poland and
even Huawei distances itself from the
executive and let him go very shortly
after his arrest in Poland so yes indeed
many countries particularly in Europe
they have been put in a difficult
position of having to choose between the
two

outcomes on India analysts believe that

also what he felt about prex it and the
way forward for the UK listening I would
like to talk to you about Lord Arthur is
is about your stint in politics now you
are the one was in politics you elected
the Member of Parliament at the age of
29 and then you made the transition into
inter writing now you know Britain a few
years back look like a very sorted
settled as sort of a first world country
but the news that's coming in from
Britain is a little unsettling I'm
talking about brexit now you were a
member of the Conservative Party are you
still a member you're still member so
what is your take on what's happening
well I voted to remain I would have
liked to have stayed in but the country
is divided and as you know 48 percent
voted to remain 52 percent voted to
leave so the country is still divided
almost right down the middle and the
polls are suggesting it's now the other
way around it kind of makes it worse but
I don't want a second referendum we're
going to be debating next Tuesday
whether there should be another
referendum and my view on that is no I
lost and we should be good losers
democracy has been served lifted 248
fine we should not go on we should get
on with it
because if we if the other side won my
side the remains side one that we've won
all what do you have another referendum
in two years time to decide who's the
real winner but a mandate given by the
electoral process is not for infinity
now two years back Britain voted for
breaking away from European Union now
the mood appears to be a little
different because once once you have
decided to break away from the European
Union where's the wave or are you
convinced with what the reason is doing
well I think she's desperately
desperately trying yeah
they're trying to do the impossible
you've got 48 percent people there 52
percent which come how make them all
agree on one thing the truth is there
are 650 members of parliament and 650 up
Indians so to try and bring them all
together 400 will added them said that
they did not add leave it threesome he
said oh I think it's very easy to get
400 to say they don't agree and it's
getting to hundreds or what I mean
you've been an active politician and you
would like to see didn't come out of the
condom that is that it is in but what is
the way forward we have to get a bill
through the House of Commons that agrees
with a policy on Europe whether we can
do that I don't know and if we can't on
March the 29th we have no deal and we
sort of go out on our own which a lot of
people don't want as I say next Tuesday
is the vote on No Deal it'll be very
interesting to see what happens
you think No Deal is a real possibility
or is it a bluff party reasoning I would
be doing the same if I was Prime
Minister I would be saying you can't
risk this it's too much it's too the
truth is it's a serious because the
Labour Party is now saying that look no
deal breaks it is not going to happen it
is a bluff mighty reason me to try and
put us in a corner and there has to be
more negotiations that that haven't they
have to put up a motion it has to be
passed by the House of Commons they have
to get a majority I don't know if they
can all right now the other thing they
won't talk to you about is is Donald
Trump yes what you talked about maybe 16
you guys voted on brexit and 2016 was
the year that Donald Trump came about oh
you know he has embarked on a policy of
isolation I mean which is pretty much
similar to what Britain has also
embarked on the dead brexit do you think
he's doing the right thing I think it'd
be very sad if the relationship between
the United States and Britain didn't
stay on an even keel we've long been
thought of ourselves of having a special
relationship with America we no longer
have that
that's gone that's history and we have
to think about going in another

why Saudi Arabia's latest actions could
well ruffle the feathers in the global
community satellite images suggest that
Riyadh has constructed its first known
ballistic missile Factory the claims
have been made by weapons experts and
image analysts if operational the
suspected factory in Alberta southwest
of Riyadh would allow Saudi Arabia to
manufacture its own ballistic missiles
while the kingdom does not possess
nuclear weapons as of now a missile
making facility would be a critical
component of any eventual Saudi nuclear
weapons program a functional ballistic
missile production facility would allow
Saudi Arabia to Biggins matching some of
the domestic missile making capabilities
that Iran has developed over the earth
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman
who had claimed in an interview that
Saudi Arabia would develop a nuclear
bomb if Iran does the kingdom does take
a more aggressive approach to military
power under its new Crown Prince Saudi
Arabia has been pursuing a nuclear power
plant deal with the u.s. that would
potentially include allowing it to
produce nuclear fuel the kingdom's
insistence and domestic fuel production
has raised worries among US officials
that the kingdom wants the atomic power
project not only for civil use but also
for covert weapon making purposes and we
have the honorarium political analyst
joining us live from Istanbul in Turkey
Oh No thank you so much for taking time
are we this year on your story on we on
world as one can Saudi Arabia we trusted
of the stage because this is the kind of
development that happened with North
Korea just a short while ago well we
could definitely discuss whether Saudi
Arabia can be trusted with such weaponry
but we definitely can't discuss the
crown prince to be trusted with such
weaponry and I think that's why since
this news broke although it's a very
preliminary stage that everybody is kind
of having this hands-off attitude like
nobody has anything to do with this if
the story turns out to be true because
nobody wants to associate themselves no
country would want to associate
themselves with the crown prince having
such power on the other hand we all know
that solder BIA is incapable of
manufacturing developing such weaponry
without a major power that has this
technology already whether it be the US
whether it be Russia China Pakistan or
other nations around the globe right now
the question also is what will the u.s.
do because if there's anybody that's
supporting any of this it is the u.s.
because if that deal is in the works as
we speak well I mean the fact of the
matter is all the arrows would and
should be pointing to us to cert in
search of who's helping Saudi Arabia do
such development so it would be very
interesting to see if the US doesn't do
any any countermeasures against this of
their development
then we'll definitely know that US has
something to do with what's going what
supposedly is going down in KSA in
developing ballistic missiles right

Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir
terrorists love the granite to
that the hub camp in South Kashmir's
Palama district which exploded outside

there has been no loss of life or injury
due to the attack that's the information
that we have the area meanwhile has been
cordoned off we have each on one ER
correspond and now joining us on the
phone line with the latest - on well
here this one a third attack in the
south Kashmir earlier we saw two attacks
in it's not this week in which one
police constable has sustained minor
injuries
he has shifted to the hospital but again
trying to show the presence before the
2016 videos of the game and they were
already huge redeployment across the
fishmeal Valley to actually avoid any
such attacks by the militants because
they had already given up said that they
will try to carry out the attack on the
public game so the security has value
there are checkpoints we mean but in
these three great attacks they are
trying to show their presence probably a
group of a Shimomura's militants who are
trying to call these attacks for the
security forces have told us that they
are ready to face any challenge thrown
by the militants in Krishna Valley
mission one is joining us with the
latest on a third granel attack in the
Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir in 12
hours keep in mind we are on the eve of
India's 70th Republic Day celebrations
but in a major boost to India's security
forces a district called the Baramulla
district in Kashmir Valley has been
declared terrorist free this has been
achieved after 29 years of Pakistan
sponsored violence in the state take a
look at this detailed report
the Indian government's war against
terror in the state of Jammu and Kashmir
is a huge success Baramulla has become
the first district to be declared
terrorist free in the state on Wednesday
the killing of three surviving
terrorists led to this achievement
speaking to we on world as one police
officials have said that there are no
local terrorists surviving in the
district around 50 terrorists were
neutralized in the last two years
another significant aspect is that many
over ground workers or OG w's who could
have become terrorists have been
utilized by detention and counseling
during the same period experts believe
that while this situation marks a major
success it could also be shortly the
army has claimed to have eliminated 230
terrorists in Jammu Kashmir last year
with the Kashmir Valley where Baramulla
lies seeing the highest number of
casualties in a worrying sign 240
terrorists are still active in the
Kashmir Valley
for the first time in 29 years Baramulla
district has become the first District
with his militancy free
this was screamed whitey - Mukesh means
police after an encounter with local
three Lashkar militants who were killed
during an operation in binner village
often Baramulla district now police says
there are no more local militants who
are there in the militancy ranks and
this was achieved by making sure that
there are no local male youth who pick
up weapons and they have tanked the
local population for the relentless
support in making sure that Baramulla
becomes militancy free district for the
first time in the valley with gamblers

good evening welcome to fine print I'm
Molly campy doll that shortly but first
news just coming in the United States
government has expressed concern over
India's revised ecommerce regulations
the US has told officials in New Delhi
that the new policy will hinder Indian
investment plans of Amazon and Walmart
the tussle marks the latest in a string
of concerns that have been raised by the
United States over Indian government
policies which impact American forms
it also comes at a time when the two
countries are trying to iron out other
trade irritants India's ecommerce
investment rules will kick in from the
1st of February the regulations banned
companies from selling products via
firms in which they have an equity
interest and also barring them from
making deals with sellers to sell
exclusively on their platforms the
policy has dealt a major blow to Walmart
which last year remember invested 16
billion dollars to buy 77 percent of
India's Flipkart it will also force
Amazon to change its business structure
in the country and raise operational
costs
we keep tracking further reactions
coming in on that front but moving on
for now monitoring Chinese movements in
the Indian Ocean is a priority for the
Indian Navy and to counter China's
muscle-flexing in the region and to
beefed up surveillance India has now set
up a third naval airbase in the Andaman
and Nicobar Islands the Indian Navy is
stepping up surveillance of Chinese
ships and submarines entering the Indian
Ocean through the nearby Malacca Straits
China is building commercial ports
stretching from Sri Lanka to Pakistan
that in their fears could become naval
outposts India navy chief Admiral Sunil
anba will commissioned the new base
called ionesco hasa it is situated about
300 kilometers north of Port Blair the
facilities will have a thousand meter
runway for helicopters and dawnia

China has also detained the Chinese
Australian writer yang Kang Jun who went
missing after arriving at Chinese
Airport last week China claims the
writer has been detained because he
posed a threat to national security
Chinese authorities said that officials
from Australia have not yet been able to
meet yank attention what their intention
is for citizens huh Australia meanwhile
has said that the country is concerned
over the detention of its citizen take a
listen into that reaction that came in
normally we would expect to have been
given that kind of notice of that mr.
Young's detention within three days it
took four days for that to be provided
to Australia obviously that is
disappointing and we'll be raising that
to with Chinese government officials in
terms of mr. Young's welfare it's not
immediately apparent that that's had any
impact on it but obviously that's the
kind of information that we're trying to
access yang Kang Jun is a spy novelist
and online commentator he was a Chinese
diplomat before he became an Australian
citizen
Yang's friends have said that the 50
year old 52 year old blogger had been
living in New York as a visiting scholar
at Columbia University yang had returned
to China last week with his wife and 14
year old stepdaughter tensions have
mounted between China and Western
nations since the arrest of Wowi
executives in Canada last month
this episode was followed by the
detention of two Canadians working in
China and while the breaks the deal
conundrum continues Abbas area in London

the offer ends either on March 29th or

for a global economy because lot of
being said about the slowdown impending
Sudan in the world economy what do you
think about that so our outlook is that
in 2019 but it's going to be a modest
slowdown so it's not going to be a very
dramatic change we're certainly not
staring as a recession right now and so
while there is reason to be concerned I
don't think it's like we're hitting the
panic button at this point about India

lot of shops could be there lot of you

half percent to 2019 which makes it one
of the fastest growing large economies

raise expenditures by a lot I think will
be would not be good for the Indian

well the big story were tracking at the
saw something that would concern all
Paris France's national health agency
has discovered traces of dangerous
chemicals in disposable diapers for
babies across various brands but US
consumer products group Procter & Gamble
has however denied the findings claiming
that their products have always been
safe several tests conducted by the
health agency found substances that are
potentially dangerous to human health
including the controversial weed killer
like of sait but what is like glyphosate
well marketed under the name roundup in
the US it is widely used but has been a
frequent target of health and
environmental campaigners after World
Health Organization study clarified
classified it as probably carcinogenic
carsey genic now the French government
has asked the manufacturers and
retailers to ensure that substances are
removed from the diapers
oh she take away Mahathir Abajo
or Audrey nan says the breaking up at
his immediate poorest entities although
they are Oscar Olivera piscatorial for

poorest on today's on phone so we're not
them I don't see possible no precocial

the risk I don't really know to tell no
excuse no it's only recent celebrity no
you see a few seconds there an early
Koosh Leland jet this chariot holder
could be seen each other each post

environment in finance ministers of
France have issued a joint statement
calling on the manufacturers and
retailers to take measures within the
next 15 days to eliminate the harmful
substances from the baby diapers and
Alina is now joining us alive from Paris
for the very latest on this Alina well
this really affects major brands like
Procter & Gamble what more are you
hearing straw on this from both the
manufacturers as well as the government
yes it affects 23 major brands which
were tested and the study that was
carried out now the government is saying
that these chemicals need to be removed
and that the products containing them
need to be off shelves within two weeks
as you were saying they're even in very
small doses on the level of
nanoparticles these substances which
include dioxins of the type more usually
found in cigarette smoke or in diesel
fumes could be dangerous to baby's
health sir and apparently they're
getting into the nappies via some of the
manufacturing processes including the
gluing together in the bleaching which
is using Kem
that are even in trace amounts dangerous
so the government as you heard there is
saying there isn't an immediate danger
to the health of babies but these
products will be removed from shelves
within the next couple of weeks to try
and calm the concerns of parents right
Alina thanks very much indeed for
joining us with the latest there on that
the government asking these to be
removed in the next 15 days Alina thanks
for that
in other news now India has been
steadily growing concerned over the
presence of the Chinese Navy in its
neighborhood and to heighten
surveillance in the Indian Ocean the
Indian Navy will open a third airbase on
the Andaman and Nicobar Islands the
Indian Navy will set up surveillance of
Chinese ships and submarines entering
the Indian Ocean through the nearby
Malacca Straits China is building
commercial ports stretching from Sri
Lanka to Pakistan that India affairs
could become naval outposts the Indian
Navy chief Admiral Sunil Lamba you will
Commission the new base called ionesco
hasa about 300 kilometers north of port
play the facility will have a thousand
need a runway for helicopters and dawnia
surveillance aircrafts both India and
China have been locked in a contest for
influence with New Delhi trying to push
back against Beijing's expansive
diplomacy in the region
and well as tensions between China and
Taiwan mount the island is pushing to
counter China's increasingly muscular
rhetoric and military exercises Taiwan's
Navy has displayed its latest long-range
surveillance drone as well and despite
Taiwan being ruled separately since its
split in 1949 after Civil War Beijing
considers it a part of its territory and
has been pushing for its reunification
China has even asserted that it does not
rule out the use of force in case Taipei
declares independence formally or there
is an external interference the tensions
between the two sides touched a new high
at the start of the new year when
Chinese President Xi Jinping described
Islands unification with the mainland as
inevitable Taiwan's president psy
in--when has hit back saying her people
would never relinquish their democratic
freedoms and instead urged him earth
china to embrace democracy the self-rule
island has its own currency flag in
government but it is not recognized as
an independent state by the UN the
islands military has hosted multiple to
us since geez speech emphasizing what it
says is a readiness to counter any
invasion and the Navy showed off its new
long-range surveillance drone the ROO
yuan which officials said can fly for 12
hours and and was now helping to monitor
movements in the disputed strait between
Taiwan and China Taiwan's American f-16
and Ageing Frenchman Mirage fighters
jets are also being increasingly called
upon to respond to military movements
from China who of analysts warn the
fleet is getting worn down and lacks
crucial spare parts
and well after Bacchus unlocked in years
flights to Afghanistan the chairman of
the Indian air carrier spice shed Ajay
Singh has expressed hope that the matter
will be resolved soon remember the
Indian government has already
communicated with the Pakistani Foreign
Ministry about its de specialists
listenin to what RJ Singh said recently
the problem has you know come to notice
that spices and cargo flights have been
stopped by Pakistan over a flag over
Afghanistan so what is your reaction
here these are these are temporary
issues you know overflying is something
which is sovereign right but never
denied to each other and we are
confident that Pakistan does soon form
it Indian flights into Afghanistan and
well in a blatant violation of civil
aviation norms Pakistan has been halting
Indian flights to Afghanistan are
talking about the recent incidents
Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority
denied passage to SpiceJet cargo flights
to Afghanistan thrice in the last week
of December and then on January 11th and
14th given the repeated instances of
violation India has also sent a notable
to Pakistan launching a strong protest
the move comes even as New Delhi has
been trying to connect landlocked
Afghanistan with India and the rest of
the world notably Pakistan has been
blocked in the land route for trade
between India and Afghanistan and India
Afghanistan air corridor launched in
2017 connects Afghanistan with Delhi and
Mumbai and the Chabahar port being built
in Iran with India's help also provides
Afghanistan's Goods gateway to the world
and India plays a significant role as a
development partner with its assistance
exceeding 3 billion New Delhi is
Afghanistan's largest donor in the
region so myth is now joining us live
from Davos for the very latest and what
addressing the SpiceJet
see you had to say and submit well
they're adjusting of course hoping for
the best for SpiceJet and other airlines
as well but this will be a tough task
for airlines
if this doesn't the airspace is not
opened up in the next
of days as expected by India well it can
be a problem but in the short term
because in the long term they could be
solution in sight and they could be
solution which can could be fine
found out was Pfizer chairman I spoke to
him and he told me that it's possible
that the solution will be found very
soon though spice it has recently
started the cargo flights it's the only
flight it's the only private carrier
that flies to Afghanistan and not only
it flies passengers but cargo also so
they are hopeful that the problem will
be solved soon and some solution will be
will be brought out very soon on this
matter because it's fermented offer air
space and all these global countries
they take air space very clearly it
could be a quid pro quo if India also
start doing things the Pakistan flights
flying over to China there could be
problem so these things are taken very
seriously by all nations across the
globe because these matters are not very
small matters these are very very
serious matters right over the countries
are allowed by one country to the other
country only four times sometimes it
happens that flights are stopped over or
using the airspace but generally it
doesn't happen that's why I just was
hopeful it will be solved very soon
right cement and of course from it also
is in Davos and speaking to all the top
business leaders and our leaders Daniels
has caught up with the International

economy being robust but needs fiscal
consolidation to move forward and also
roughly touching on the trade voice
that's been an overwhelming concern at
Davos how things going about in Davos as
of today well it's a third day and
definitely the concerns the big concerns
are being talked about the one big
concern is global trade war and here
people every kind participant is
concerned because uncertainty about the
policies is something which all
businessmen the fear about and here also
they are discussing these uncertain
times because of trump taking decisions
which hurt China first and then China
reciprocate that hurts global economies
India we spoke to Indian CEOs and they
are quite hopeful that this could have
such some some positive think only for
India well as far as our global trade
wars are concerned well that is
something which anything can happen any
day well China and and us they were
supposed to come at this platform Donald
Trump present us was supposed to meet
Chinese president but it did not come
here and Chinese Vice President is here
so the solution inside could have come
out out out of Davos
but Trump did not arrive and clearly
there is no solution in sight or there
is no as big solution in sight as was
extracted from this forum held Davos all
right Simon thanks very much indeed for

took four days for that to be provided
to Australia obviously that is
disappointing and we'll be raising that
to with Chinese government officials in
terms of mr. Young's welfare it's not
immediately apparent that that's had any
impact on it but obviously that's the
kind of information that we are trying

are now building an understanding of

they can gain from this relationship we
can watch the full episode tonight at

tempo of engagement between the two the
two sides you know not just in terms of

defense activities for an example it was
traditional for us to do four or five
defence activities with each other
player B that talks or exercises or
those sorts of things in 2014 that went
up to 11 activities in 2018 this year
just passed we have 38 individual
defense activities between our two
countries
what that's done is it's helped us see
each other better that we are building
an understanding of what the other
country is capable of and what we can
gain from the relationship we're also as
a result I think understanding each
other better one of the great mysteries
I think of history is why is it that two
countries like Australia and India that

not really come together much closer
than we have but I'm absolutely
delighted to see us rapidly moving down
that path now watch the full episode of

here's more
London's Brick Lane is famous for its
curry houses but one stands out because
of its unique offering a vegan menu
it was the brainwave of the teenage
restaurant manager Abdul Mohammed whose
father owns the city spice restaurant
Upton says they created 14 vegan dishes
paired with vegan wines the result was a
hundred and seventy percent increase in
sales
the teenager settled his first year
university bill by cashing in on this
rising trend of veganism you financially
have done incredibly well with the it's
letter one hundred and seventy percent
increase in our restaurant sales and I
suppose I paid for my first year
university fees in terms of the profit
from the vegan dishes just from the
vegan dishes alone
we will eat a diet that's entirely
plant-based avoiding the eggs and milk
of traditional vegetarianism the
philosophy extends to clothes and
cosmetics to many beauty products
include honey bees wax and carotene
which is a protein found in animal cells
in London's Hackney James Fisher opened
with a vegan hair salon to create an
eco-friendly sustainable and
cruelty-free option in hair care
products like Oh way and Evo used at web
are vegan and they only serve vegan
refreshments to their clients I mean the
vegan community in London and the world
is growing very fast so it's a very
popular idea and yeah it's very well
received I choose to have my hair done
out with because I really appreciate
company ethos of using organic products
and sustainable products and
environmentally friendly friendly
products I try to align the way I spent
my money with my personal values and
this is something that's quite important
to me founded five years ago British

more than 225,000 people worldwide to
follow a plant-based diet during the
month of January well we're not the only
ones saying that 2019 is the year at the

last year but going on the number of
people pledging to take our pledge and
events like this that happening every
day throughout January I think veganism
is here to stay and like I say it's no
longer counterculture movement it's a
movement they're central to mainstream
the demand for plant-based foods is
increasing with the global meat
substitute market expected to reach
seven-and-a-half billion dollars by 2025
that's a jump of 83 percent from 2017
according to a study by allied market

House of Commons Prime Minister Theresa
May presenting her brexit plan B let me
set out the six key issues which have
been at the centre of the talks to date
the first two relate to the process for
moving forwards first there is
widespread concern about the possibility
of the UK leaving without a deal and
there are those on both sides of the
house who want the government to rule
this out but we need to be honest with
the British people about what that means
the right way to rule out No Deal is for
this house to approve a deal with the
European
that is that is what this government is
seeking to achieve the only other
guaranteed way to avoid an OTO brexit is
to revoke article 50 which would mean
staying in the EU there are others who
think that what we need is more time so
they say we should extend article 52
give longer for Parliament to debate how
we should leave and what a deal should
look like this is not ruling out no deal
but simply deferring the point of
decision and the EU are very unlikely
simply to agree to our extent article 50
without a plan for how we are going to
approve a deal so when people say rule
out no deal the consequences of what
they are actually saying are that if we
in Parliament can't approve a deal
we should revoke article 50 mr. Speaker
I believe this would go against the
referendum result
and I do not believe that is a course of
action that we should take or which this
house should support second all the
opposition parties that have engaged so
far and some backbenchers have expressed
their support for a second referendum I
set out many times my deep concerns
about returning to the British people
for a second referendum our duty is to
implement the decision of the first one
I fear a second referendum would set a
difficult precedent that could have
significant implications for how we
handle referendums in this country not
least not least strengthening the hand
of those campaigning to break up our
United
[Applause]
it would require an extension of article
50 it would require an extension of
article 50 we would very likely have to
return a new set of any P's to the
European Parliament in May and I also
believe that though it's not yet being
enough recognition of the way that a
second referendum could damage social
cohesion by undermining faith
[Applause]
mr. Mr Speaker we do not know what the
right honourable gentleman the leader of
the Opposition thinks about this because
he is not engaged but I know there are
members who have already indicated that
they wish to test the support of the
house for this part I do not believe
there is a majority for a second
referendum and if I am right then just
as the government is having to think
again about its approach going forwards
then so to do those members who believe
this is the answer the remaining issues
dispraised in the discussions relates to
the substance of the deal and on these
points I believe we can make progress
members of this house predominantly but
not only on the government benches in
the DUP
continue to express their concern on the
issue of the Northern Ireland's backstop
all of us agree that as we leave the
European Union we must fully respect the
Belfast agreement and not allow the
creation of a hard border between
Northern Ireland and Ireland nor indeed
a bordered on the Irish Sea and I want
to be absolutely clear in the light of
media stories this morning this
government will not reopen the Belfast
agreement I have never even considered
doing so and neither would I with regard
to the backstop despite the changes we
have previously agreed they remain two
core issues the fear that we could be
trapped in it permanently and concerns
over its potential impact on our union
if Northern Ireland is treated
differently from the rest of the UK so I
will be talking further this week to
colleagues including in the DUP to
consider how we might meet our
obligations to the people of Northern
Ireland and Ireland in a way that can
command the greatest possible support in
the house and I will then take the
conclusions of those discussions back to
the EU from other parts of this house
concerns have also been raised over the
political declaration in particular
these have focused on a wish for further
precision around the future relationship
the political declaration will provide
the basis for developing our detailed
negotiating mandate for the future and
this new phase of negotiations will be
different in a number of ways it will
cover a far broader range of issues in
greater depth and so will require us to
build a negotiating team that draws on
the widest expertise available
from trade negotiators to security
experts and specialists in data and
financial services and as we develop our
mandate across each of these areas I
want to provide reassurance to the house
given the breadth of the negotiations we
will seek input from a wide range of
voices from outside government that must
include ensuring Parliament has a proper
say and fuller involvement in these
decisions
it is government's responsibility to
negotiate but is also my responsibility
to listen to the Jitterbug concerns of
colleagues both those who voted leave
and who voted remain in shaping our
negotiating mandate for our future
partnership with EU so the government
will consult this house on its
negotiating mandate to ensure that
members have the chance to make their
views known and that we harness the
knowledge of all select committees
across the full range of expertise
needed for this next phase of
negotiations from security to trade this
will strengthen the also strengthen the
government's hand in the negotiations
giving the EU confidence about our
position and avoiding leaving the bulk
of parliamentary debate to a point when
were under huge time pressure to ratify
now I know that today Parliament has not
felt it has enough visibility of the
government's position as it has been
developed and negotiated it is sort
documents through humble addresses but
that mechanism cannot take into account
the fact that some information when made
public could weaken the UK's negotiating
hand so as the negotiations progress we
will also look to deliver confidential
committee sessions that can ensure
Parliament has the most up-to-date
information whilst not undermining the
negotiations and we will regularly
update the house in particular before
the six monthly review points with the
EU foreseen in the agreement while it
will always be for Her Majesty's
government to negotiate for the whole of
the UK we are also committed to giving
the devolved administration's an
enhanced role in the next phase
respecting their competence and vital
interests in these negotiations I hope
to meet both First Minister's in the
course of this week and will use the
opportunity to discuss this further with
them and we will also look for further
ways to engage elected representatives
from Northern Ireland and regional
representatives in England and finally
we will reach out beyond this house and
engage more deeply with businesses civil
society and trade unions v honourable
members from across the house honourable
members from across the house have
raised strong views but our exit from
the EU should not lead to a reduction in
our social and environmental standards
and in particular workers rights so I
will ensure that we provide Parliament
with a guarantee that not only we will
be not erode protection for workers
rights and the environment but we will
ensure this country leads the way to
that end my right honourable friend the
business secretary indicated the
government's support for the proposed
amendment to the meaningful vote put
down by the Honourable member for
Bassitt law including that Parliament
should be able to consider any changes
made by the EU in these areas in future
my right honourable friend and others
will work with members across the house
businesses and trade unions to develop
proposals that give effect to this
amendment including looking at
legislation where necessary six and
crucially a number of members have made
powerful representations about the
anxieties facing EU citizens in the UK
and UK citizens in the EU who are
waiting to have their status confirmed
we have already committed to ensuring
that EU citizens in the UK will be able
to stay and to continue to access
in-country benefits and services on
broadly the same terms as now in both a
deal and a No Deal scenario indeed the
next phase of testing of the scheme for
EU nationals to confirm their status has
launched today and having listened to
concerns from members and organizations
like the three million group I can
confirm today that when we roll out the
scheme in fall on the 30th of March the
government will waive the application
fee so that
so there is no financial barrier for any
EU nationals who wish to stay and anyone
who has or will apply during the pilot
phase will have their fee reimbursed and
more details about how this will work
will be made available in due course
some some EU member states have
similarly guaranteed the rights of
British nationals in a No Deal scenario
and we will step up our efforts to
ensure that they all do so mr. speaker
let me briefly set out the process for
the days ahead in addition to this
statement today I will lay a written
ministerial statement as required under
Section thirteen four and five of the EU
withdrawal Act and table emotion in
neutral terms on this statement as
required by section 36 this motion will
be amendable and will be debated and
voted on in this house on the 29th of
January and I will provide a further
update to the house during that debate
to be clear this is not a rerun of the
vote to ratify the agreement we have
reached with the European Union but the
fulfillment of the process following the
houses decision to reject that motion
the process of engagement is ongoing in
the next few days my ministerial
colleagues and I will continue to meet
with members on all sides of the house
and with representatives of the trade
unions business groups civil society and
others as we try to find the broadest
possible consensus on a way forward
whilst I will disappoint those
colleagues that hope to secure a second
referendum I do not believe that there
is a majority in this house for such a
path
and whilst I want to deliver a deal with
the EU I cannot support the only other
way in which to take No Deal off the
table which is to revoke article 50 so
my focus continues to be on what is
needed to secure the support of this
house in favor of a brexit deal with the
EU am I sense so far is that the the 3p
changes are needed first will be more
flexible open and inclusive in the
future in how we engage Parliament in
our approach to negotiating our future
partnership with the European Union
second we will invent the strongest
possible protections on workers rights
in the environment and third we will
work to identify how we can ensure that
our commitment to no hard border in
Northern Ireland and Ireland can be
delivered in a way that commands the
support of this house and the European
Union in doing so we will honor the
mandate of the British people and leave
the European Union in a way which
benefits every part of our United
Kingdom and every citizen of our country
and I commend this statement to the
house
[Applause]
Thank You mr. speaker
I thank the Prime Minister for an
advanced copy of her statement and I
joined with her in condemning the car
bomb attack we've seen in London during
the weekend and commend the emergency
services and the local community for
their response mr. speaker the huge
achievement of the Good Friday Agreement
in reducing violence in Northern Ireland
must never be taken for granted it was
the historic step forward but we cannot
take it for granted the government still
appears not to have come to terms with
the scale of the defeat in the House of
Commons last week the Prime Minister
seems to be going through the motions of
accepting the results but in reality is
in deep denial the logic of that
decisive defeat is that the Prime
Minister must change her red lines
because her current deal is
undeliverable so can she be clear and
explicit with the house which of her red
lines is she prepared to move on the
Prime Minister's invitation to talks
have been exposed as a PR sham every
opposition party politician every
opposition party politician came out of
those meetings with the same response
contrary to what the Prime Minister's
just said there was no flexibility there
were no negotiations nothing has changed
[Applause]
although the Prime Minister was heard
and when there was noise I called for it
to stop and the same mr. fly to the lead
of the opposition no one in this chamber
will shout the right honourable
gentleman down and even bother trying
you're wasting your breath Jeremy Corbyn
Thank You mr. speaker but I do welcome
the commitment of that the fee for EU
citizens to apply for several status
will be waived mr. speaker the Prime
Minister was fond of saying that this is
the best possible deal on the table it
is the only possible deal on the table
but our EU negotiating partners are
clear and I quote unanimously the
European Council have always said that
if the UK chooses to shift its red lines
in the future to go beyond a simple
free-trade agreement then the EU will be
immediately ready to give a favourable
response the House voted to hold the
referendum it also voted to trigger
article 50 there is a clear majority of
this house to support a deal in
principle and to respect the referendum
results but it requires the Prime
Minister to face reality and accept her
deal has been comprehensively defeated
instead we now understand the Prime
Minister is going back to Europe to seek
concessions on the backstop can I ask
the Prime Minister this what is the
difference between legal assurances and
concessions what makes her think that
what she tried to degree negotiate in
December will succeed in January mr.
speaker this really does feel a bit like
Groundhog Day
so the first thing she must do is
recognize the clear majority in this
house against leaving without a deal and
rule out No Deal
and stop the colossal waste of public
money planning for an outcome questions
to must be asked of the Chancellor he
reassured businesses that no deal would
be ruled out by the Commons yet he is
sanctioning 4.2 billion to be spent on
an option he believes will be ruled out
the foreign secretary said last week it
was very unrealistic to believe the
House of Commons would not find a way to
block No Deal mr. speaker can I ask the
prime minister to meet first with a
Chancellor and a foreign secretary and
see if they can convince her to do what
is in her power to rule out No Deal and
if she will not do that now will she
confirm to the house and if an amendment
passes that rules out No Deal
she will implement that instruction the
Prime Minister agreed the backstop
because of her pledge the people of
Northern Ireland to avoid a hard border
but no deal would mean a hard border in
Ireland and break the Prime Minister's
commitment is she seriously willing to
accept a hard border but today heralds
the start of a democratic process where
this house will debate amendments that
will determine how we navigate brexit of
course the government tried to block us
ever getting to this stage they wanted
us to have no democratic scrutiny
whatsoever labour set out and I believe
there may be majority in the house for
such a proposal for a new comprehensive
customs union with the EU that would
include us say a strong single market
deal that delivers frictionless trade
and ensure no
race to the bottom on workers rights or
indeed any other of the important
regulations of retentions we have we
will as we've said consistently from
beginning back amendments that seek to
rule out the disaster of No Deal and as
we've said will not rule out the option
of a public vote so mr. speaker
no more phony talks Parliament will
debate and decide and this time this
time Mr Speaker I hope and expect the
government to listen to this house Thank
You honourable gentleman he says no more
phony talk right so that's Theresa Meers
brexit plan B no second referendum know
taking the No Deal breaks it out off off
the table and another round of
negotiations and consensus building the
opposition as expected has slammed this
as a PR stunt the debate goes on they'll
of course track the story for you and
now for the latest from the war in Syria

huge explosions the loudest they've
heard in months the rivalry between Iran
and Israel isn't new right now it's at
its peak and could trigger a massive
escalation in West Asia our bureau chief
Daniella Pagani sent us this report
Israeli jet fighters entered Syrian
airspace and bombed Iranian premises and
Syrian defense batteries in the capital
city of Damascus the main target was an
airport located in the southeastern part
of the city the Israeli military said it
also hit an Iranian intelligence site a
military training camp and munitions
storage warehouses trouble flared up
during the weekend after Israel said it
had intercepted a Syrian missile fight
against the Israel occupied Golan
Heights a popular Israeli ski locality
on Mount Hermon remained closed for the
day an amateur video made by a skier
cops the deception on camera Russia's
defence control system said that the
attack had killed four Syrian soldiers
and injured six and that Syrian defense
batteries managed to shoot down at least
30 missiles Moscow had provided Syria
with s-300 surface-to-air missile
batteries in October last year after the
Syrian army shot down a Russian
surveillance aircraft while attacking
nearby Israeli jet fighters the
escalation came at a time when Israeli

Israel knows that it is in the position
of claiming those kind of attacks
because there is no one who is actually
stepping in of no one who is actually
militarily counter attacking Israel
because of what they're doing inside
Syria this means also that Iran is

or vo well this one general elections in
India are just a couple of months away
over 900 million people are expected to
cast their vote and the instrument that
will register their choice finds itself
at the center of a controversy yet again
yes we are talking about electronic
voting machines or EVMS a us-based
self-proclaimed cyber expert has claimed
that the 2014 general election was
rigged by the party a Janata Party
he says the EVMS were tampered with this
expert is called science oosa he says he
was part of the team which designed
electronic voting machines he has
expressed willingness to demonstrate how
these machines can be hacked he has even
organized a quote unquote hackathon to
show how the machines can be manipulated
the event is currently underway in
London it had an unexpected or shall we
say expected guest former Telecom
Minister of India and senior Congress
leader Kapil Sibal
while the organizers of the event have
denied any political link the Indian
poll panel has taken sumoto cognizance
the Election Commission has rejected the
theory it is called the EVM Stamper
proof it released a statement saying and
I'm quoting ECI has been very of
becoming a party to this motivated
slugfest and stands by empirical facts
about the foolproof nature of our EVMs
there are rigorous standard operating
procedures observed under the
supervision of a committee of technical
experts the Supervisory body is also
examining what legal action can be taken
in the matter mineral idioms have been
the favourite villain of India's
political parties since 2009 ten years
back senior BJP leader LK Advani had
said that EVMs were not foolproof
current BJP spokesperson gvl narsimha
Rao wrote an entire book on the subject
in 2010 in which mr. Advani noted that
many countries like Germany had banned
the use of electronic voting machines
but after the BJP came to power in 2014
at the centre opposition parties took up
the baton for the past five years on and
off these opposition parties have been
saying that electronic voting machines
are being tampered with the most recent
example was when the aam aadmi party and
the Congress party said that EVMS had
been tampered with in
recent election 3% of these machines in
Madhya Pradesh experienced glitches
during the election in November 2018
there was a string of suspicious
incidents in Madhya Pradesh Chhattisgarh
and Rajasthan involving EVMS five days
before the counting of votes in these
elections Congress president Rahul
Gandhi interestingly tweeted and I'm
quoting here Congress party workers it's
time to be vigilant in MP EVMS behaved
strangely after polling in Modi's in
they are the EVMS have mysterious powers
stay alert but you know what happened
five days later the Congress party won
in all these states and it was quick to
forget these allegations after they won
a hundred and fourteen seats in the 230
strong assembly in mud the pradesh in
particular while no one has so far been
able to demonstrate that this voting
apparatus can be manipulated at such a
large scale to influence elections in
India in most cases it ends up with
being an ammunition for the party that
loses the election and that seems to be
the case here as well

between NASA and the Chinese national
space administration follows China's
successful mission to land a spacecraft

NASA is working towards this plan to

and well it's a spectacle in the sky a
super blood a wolf moon appeared during
the first total lunar eclipse of the
year here's how thousands witnessed the
super moon across the world people of
Jerusalem witness the partial lunar
eclipse
there you have it on your screens there
and the moon gazes were delighted by the
super Blood Wolf Moon in Brazil as well
despite cloudy skies its dampened the
effect but the super Blood Moon did not
disappoint the moon gazes and Chile as
as the dark clouds are cleared just in
time for the celestial snow there show
that
more than 1500 people gathered at an
observation in Los Angeles in the u.s.
to watch the clips also and it's called
the Blood Moon because instead of going
completely dark during the eclipse the
moon has taken on a coppery red color
due to the sunlight traveling through
the Earth's dusty atmosphere it is also
called a super moon because it is a full
moon and it's especially close to the
earth according to the annual North
American periodical now and used to the
Wolves used to howl of hunger outside
villages in the month of January which
is why it's also called the wolf moon
and like solar eclipses no eye
protection is required to watch the
lunar eclipse the next chance of
Americans to see this would be in 2022
and here's an explainer on the
phenomenon of the total lunar eclipse a
lunar eclipse can only take place during
a full moon when the Sun Earth and Moon
are all aligned on natural satellite can
be temporarily deprived of sunlight if
it passes through the Earth's shadow the
moon becomes dark and red as the Earth's
atmosphere filters and refracts the
sun's rays and eclipse comprises several
phases entry of the moon into the
penumbra the partial outer shadow barely
visible to the naked eye entry of the
moon through the Umbra a full dark
shadow which is easier to see totality
when the moon is entirely in the Earth's
shadow end of totality when the Eclipse
becomes partial again exit from the
shadow and finally exit from the
penumbra a partial eclipse occurs when
just part of the moon is shaded a total
eclipse only occurs when the moon is
entirely covered by the Earth's shadow
and is very rare

at the same time it makes it prone to

is lightweight and comfortable to hold
also the 6.2 inch full HD Plus display

questions of 2019 Havel the United
States and China resolved the trade
dispute well they are warm day now the
United States President Donald Trump has
said the things in fact going very well
with China and yet he maintains reports
about sanctions being lifted were false
and now a news agency Reuters reports
citing three credible sources that the
United States wants to police China's
trade reforms and what is this mean well
last years the United States imposed
sanctions in the world's second largest
economy China pledged to open up its
economy the China in fact promised
reform and the United States was pleased
to talk and now it has learned that the
United States is actually pushing for
regular reviews of China's progress on
pledged trade reforms as a condition for
a trade deal and if China violates the
agreement and more tariffs are in the
pipeline these are tough negotiations
but then the United States and China are
in the midst of a war a trade war so
what does it mean for investors and also
for the world economy at large now in
simple terms investors will have caused
a shy away from businesses and assets
that have taken a beating because of the
trade war and less money would of course
mean a slowing economy and fewer jobs
and even job losses now the negotiations
between the United States and China
continue for the time being and the u.s.
proposal has actually not gone down well
with the Chinese although it has not
derailed the negotiations at least and
so to not clear as to how often the
United States wants to assess the
Chinese progress
the Chinese source in who spoke to the
Reuters agency said that it looks like a
bit of a humiliation for China and the
two sides have to find a face saver
for the Chinese now experts have also
indicated that an enforcement and a
verification process is unusual for
trade deals the disputes over trade are
usually dealt with through courts and
the World Trade Organization or through
arbitration panels but then Donald
Trump's team has even criticized the
World Trade Organization for failing to
hold China accountable
for not fulfilling its promise of market
reforms that the United States wants
more of its companies to enter into the
Chinese market and the US president is
using methods that have never been seen
before
the question poses well the Chinese
agree to the American policing their
economy and market reforms as well is

end to this bitter trade Warner China's

plan the timing of these updates is
suspect as this was the time Trump was
campaigning to become the President of
the United States of America
Trump is denied having any business ties
with Russia but if Cohen's testimony is
to be believed that the president could
be lined Cohen had told Congress that
talks over the plan had taken place
between September 2015 and January 2016
but complaint documents say they lasted
until June which is well into the
president's term Cohen said that the
plan had been halted earlier in an
attempt to minimize links between the
Moscow project and Trump during the
election campaign the report also says
that Cohen has told investigators that
Trump personally instructed him to lie
about the date of the negotiations
meanwhile US president Trump has made a
surprise announcement Trump said that he
would visit the families of four US
personnel killed in Isis suicide bombing
in northern Syria that's the
ladies breaking news update Trampas
tweeted again and I quote again we'll be
leaving for dour to be with the families

qc9PEummEN4,Trump to hold second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un,High-level talks aimed at finalizing a second summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are ...,2019-01-19T07:12:33Z,WION,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qc9PEummEN4/hqdefault.jpg,"our top story this our tracks the United
States and North Korea US President
Donald Trump will hold a second summit
with North Korean leader Kim jong-un in
late February however US will maintain
economic sanctions on Pyongyang the
location of the meeting between Kim and
Trump has not been revealed yet the
announcement was made by White House
after Trump met Pyongyang's top nuclear
negotiator kim yong-chul
look we've continued to make progress
we're continuing to have conversations
the United States is going to continue
to keep pressure and sanctions on North
Korea until we see fully and verified
denuclearization we've had very good
steps in good faith from the North
Koreans in releasing the hostages and
other moves and so we're gonna continue
those conversations and the president
looks forward to the next his next meet
the summit was announced despite the
fact that there has been no indication
of any narrowing of differences over
u.s. demands that North Korea abandon
its nuclear weapons program last year
the first summit produced a vague
commitment by Kim Jong moon to work
towards the denuclearization of the
Korean Peninsula but he has yet to take
what Washington sees as concrete steps
in that direction meanwhile South Korea
has welcomed a planned second summit
between u.s. and North Korea saying that
it expects the summit to serve as a
turning point towards permanent peace on
the Korean Peninsula
Kim you ich komme a spokesman at South
Korea's presidential office said that
South Korea will spare no efforts for a
successful outcome of the planned second
summit between Trump and Kim by closely
cooperating with the US and holding more
talks with North Korea
[Music]
and to bring us more details and add
perspective to this new story I'm joined
in by our correspondent Bruce Harrison
who joins me live from Seoul Bruce a
very warm welcome now the Singapore some
in between Kim and Trump was historic
yet vague what can we expect to emerge
out of a second summit and what are the
potential locations under consideration
at the moment well that is the big
question the first summit has yielded
little results on maybe the only thing
that came out of it
a vague promised to remove nuclear
weapons from the Korean Peninsula but as
I said little progress has been on may a
made on that front and we haven't heard
from from the US or North Korea
specifics about what they would plan to
discuss at this second summit between
Trump and Kim jong-un but there has been
growing speculation especially among the
analyst community that the u.s. may be
slowly drifting away from its initial
position and that is that North Korea
give up everything on the front end it
gives up a list of its nuclear weapons
arsenal as well as all related
facilities
what could North Korea offer at this
point that would allow the u.s. to make
such a concession perhaps some of its
intercontinental ballistic missiles it's
hard to say Kim jong-un has made it very
clear that he thinks he's already taken
great steps he destroyed a nuclear
testing grounds he sidelined some
missile testing and now he expects the
u.s. to act and reciprocation so that
stalemate is still there really
everyone's watching to see what could
happen next as far as this summit
there's been a lot of speculation in the
press that Vietnam could be that
location reports that Kim jong-un will
take a state visit there after the Lunar
New Year holiday ending February 8th
whether or not that is rolled into a
summit with President Trump it's
unconfirmed all right Bruce but you know
taking forward what you said are those
steps concrete enough as what Washington
would like to say I'd like to mention
this report by two US analysts that
stated that North Korea is
systematically hiding the sites of
missile development the heightened
developed strategy has helped North
Korea accelerate its nuclear program
under Kim Jong Un's rule how can
Washington ensure young
to take more solid measures in terms of
complete denuclearization even if that
includes intrusive inspection of these
sites oh just as you said yeah it can't
be sure unless there is an open door for
international inspectors to come into
the country to see what their remaining
nuclear arsenal and related facilities
look like it's hard for Washington
trusts North Korea because these talks
have broken down many times before but
back to those reports you mentioned we
the first came out I believe last year
about a number of weapon sites that
hadn't been disclosed but there is no
promise from the kim government to
disclose those and both if Seoul and
Washington at that time said this is not
going to hinder the process will where
were well-aware North Korea has these
weapons still well but our intelligence
authorities knew where they were so it's
not an impending threat and in the most
recent report that Kim jong-un was
visiting these sites once again the man
never promised not to do that it was not
part of the negotiations in Singapore I
think both sides still want to press
forward well knowing that there are a
lot of weapons in North Korea ultimately
we'll have to see what happens in
February if they do in fact me six weeks
is a long time neither side wants to
come away with a vague statement again
that can't be claimed as a success by
anybody right neither side can come up
with a weak statement and also it's
important to point out how 2018 began
with war threats coming in from
Washington for Pyongyang or Pyongyang
and Washington at the same time you know
2019 looks more hopeful but is a
complete denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula actually an option for Kim
Jong would unlikely based on what we've
seen from the young North Korean leaders
so far despite the promises he's made at
summits with President Trump and South
Korean president moon jae-in were no
closer to actually giving up those
weapons and you see you hear more and
more reports from different South Korean
analysts and and editorials and
newspapers here that there may be
a time where you have to admit that
living with a nuclear-armed North Korea
is perhaps the only option a peaceful
existence coexistence here on the
peninsula and those are just the
opinions of some by and large the
international community as well as the
leader leadership of South Korea
ostensibly wants to get rid of those
nuclear weapons the South Korean leader
here as well ultimately would like to
create a path for unification to bring
the Koreas together but until the US and
North Korea can hash out their
differences and continue negotiations on
the nuclear weapons we won't see any of
that right on a last note Bruce I'd like
you to focus a bit on the Chinese roll
out here at the time of an ongoing trade
war can US and China set aside their
differences to disarm North Korea yes in
China's African nuclear mission to
remove uranium from Nigeria could
provide a model for disarming North
Korea don't you think so we've seen
similar templates for that in the past
but North Korea simply isn't willing to
budge
they still ultimately see the United
States is a grave threat to their
sovereignty to the government that
exists in Pyongyang Kim jong-un as far
as we know is very fearful of being
removed from power and until he has very
very firm guarantees of his safety his
regime safety and the sovereignty of his
nation there's no way he's going to
simply hand over the the fizzle material
he needs to build nuclear weapons and
the nuclear weapons he's already
obtained all right so tread cautiously
out there is the message that a u.s. and
North Korea hold for each other at the
moment thank you so much Bruce for
joining us here live on we are

the United States where it's been a
major fallout of the shutdown in America
for the first time the world's largest
economy is going to remain unprecedented
at a meeting of the World Economic Forum
and the United States is clearly not
going to be present at Davos the summit
is in Switzerland is taking place at a

industrial elite sit down for talks next
week in the Alpine resort but the
biggest talking shop of all America
would be absent at the high table the
White House has announced that the US
delegation won't be travelling to Davos
she said this was this was because of
the 27 day long government shutdown over
funding for a border wall White House
press secretary Sarah Sanders said and I
quote out of consideration for the
800,000 great American workers not
receiving pay and to ensure his team can
assist as needed President Trump has
cancelled his delegations trip to the
World Economic Forum in Davos
Switzerland a resident Trump had already
cancelled his own trip to the summit
dashing hopes of a meeting with Chinese
President Xi Jinping and possible end to
the trade war US Treasury Secretary
Stephen Minuten Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross a
United States Trade Representative
robert liza and deputy chiefs of staff
for policy coordination chris little
were among those scheduled to visit
switzerland for the annual conference in
trump's absence now that stance canceled
as well reports say overseas trips for
senior officials could be difficult to
organize at a time when government
workers have been furloughed
and to bring us more details and add
perspective to this ongoing story and
joined in by our correspondent of Harry
Houghton who joins me live from
Washington DC for more on this let's
quickly go across to Harry Harry away
warm welcome you know now that President
Donald Trump has finally flicked flexed
his executive muscle by canceling Nancy
Pelosi Afghanistan trip is the shutdown
becoming a tussle of one-upmanship
between the u.s. president and the
Democrats yeah I mean it appears that
way look the the talks between Democrats
and the White House and President Trump
have have been you know on-off for the
past four weeks of this government
shutdown but they they haven't really
led anywhere you know and I think I
think on the basis of the evidence of
the past 24-48 hours the two sides you
know the relationship between them is
becoming more and more sour rather than
more conducive to finding a way to open
this government so you know I think we
could be here for several more days if
not several more weeks now there's no
clear exit strategy here normally when
these government shutdowns happen well
first of all they only happen for a few
days but we always have some idea about
how they might end you know there's
always a compromise in sight and it just
takes a bit of time for both parties to
get there on this issue you know the
Democrats have refused to give any money
towards Donald Trump's border wall
Donald Trump says he's not going to
reopen the government without the money
he wants to pay for his war so there
doesn't seem to be any middle ground
there so you know really difficult to
see how this is going to end as the
impact of this shutdown is spreading
further and further absolutely as you
rightly mentioned there seems to be no
exit strategy out here interestingly
ours after denying Pelosi the use of the
military plane
president Trump canceled the US
delegations planned visit to Davos could
this move actually have serious
ramifications considering a World
Economic Forum was crucial at a time of
an ongoing trade war or rising fuel
prices yeah absolutely it could have big
ramifications for those trade talks with
China there are some trade talks with
China scheduled for later this month
January the 30th and January 30
here in Washington DC this decision to
cancel the trip to Davos puts huge
pressure now on those talks in
Washington of course we're in the middle
of this 90-day trade truce period where
the US has said it won't impose any more
tariffs on China but if we get to the
end of this 90-day period and the and
the US and China can't come up with some
sort of new trade deal there's a whole
raft of new tariffs due to come into
place you know the world markets are
pretty nervous about that prospect so
you know every possible meeting that the
US and China can have at the moment is
crucial to finding a way out of this
trade war that the two sides find
themselves in just one other point is
well about this shutdown it's affecting
staff levels at the US trade office
they're currently operating at about a
third of their usual staffing levels so
you know that's having an impact on the
amount of staff who can who can work and
advise these senior officials on trade
deals so you know the longer this
shutdown goes on it's not just affecting
domestic policies now it really is
spreading over into international US
policies and their relationships with
other countries around the world very
rightly mentioned Harry that this is
spreading over to international policies
also United States as we just saw that
the u.s. delegations planned visit to
Davos has been canceled it's the
shutdown's impact gradually snowballing
because it seems to be affecting
critical departments like the homeland
security and u.s. Secret Service to not
to forget the global economical impact
as well yeah absolutely and like one
other crucial Department and it's
impacting is within the transport
Department's security workers who work
at Airport screen passengers before they
get on flights look at people's bags you
know that we are seeing record sick
levels within those departments at the
moment US airports are able to cope and
they insist that there is no security
threat to America's airspace but we're
seeing some unions of those employees
warning that look there's a real risk
here that if this shutdown continues and
staffing levels continue to to reduce
because people you know simply can't
afford to pay their bills they're forced
to to find other job
so they can pay their rent and you know
and and and pay for their food and
things like that
there could be a real security threat to
America's airspace and we could see some
backlog of air travel within the United
States now that would have a serious
economic impact and that would put
tremendous pressure on both the White
House and on Congress to find some sort
of way to restore those funds so that
those staff can get paid in to end this
government shutdown maybe that is
exactly what Donald Trump is looking for
to actually pressurize the government
into moving towards some sort of a deal
but that also brings me to the State of
the Union address by the president will
Nancy Pelosi be able to deal a trump
State of the Union address tell us more
about this address and has any former
president delivered it during a shudder
well like the State of the Union address
is a big annual speech given by the
presidents the president is invited to
go over to Congress and lay out their
plans for the year ahead to talk about
what they feel are their big big
successes from the previous year but you
know there's a lot of pomp and ceremony
around these things but they did give us
some clues as to what sort of things the
administration might focus on over the
next 12 months Nancy Pelosi has
essentially pulled the rug on there from
Donald Trump she does have the power to
essentially cancel that speech and
that's what she stood now reports
suggest that the White House was caught
off guard by her decision to cancel that
speech the White House was
uncharacteristically quiet in the
aftermath of that announcement but
they've now hit back with this decision
as we've learnt to cancel Nancy Pelosi's
trip or canceled transport for Nancy
Pelosi's planned trip to Brussels and
Afghanistan so look this tit for tat
between Democrats and Republicans seems
to be to be going on and I think when
you look at the state of relations
between those two sides the fact that
they're trading blows with each other
you know that suggests to the rest of
America and the rest of the world that
they're not really in a position at the
moment to sit down around a table and
find a way out of this shutdown this
record length shutdown that we find
ourselves in the middle of absolutely
this certainly calls for them
to actually come to the negotiating
table and get out of this when I thank
you so much for joining us and giving us

Britain faces joining us now is viens
correspondent Olli Bharat from London
good evening ollie
Theresa May has survived the leadership
challenge but there seems to be no
movement on a brexit deal what does the
British prime minister plan to do next
she is holding talks with MPs from
opposition parties and in her own party
to try and see if there is a compromise
brexit solution that can be reached
which could then be put to the European
Union to see Britain exit the block as
planned on the 29th of March of this
year that is a very tall order indeed
though not least because time is running
out but also because it's hard to see
how exactly she'll reach a compromise
with parliamentarians we have be we have
seen multiple demonstrations of how
divided the UK's House of Commons is on
the brexit issue so very difficult to
see how she'll be able to reach
some kind of solution in consultation
with opposition MPs is the European
Union willing to negotiate with the
threesome a government once again and
what kind of a breads it will be
acceptable to all parties if such a deal
exists Brussels has always said that it
is not open to new negotiations on the
deal that's already been reached that
that may be able to be fudged down the
line if tourism a goes back to Brussels
and asks for a couple of specific
changes here and there to her deal but
her deal of course has already been
overwhelmingly rejected by British MPs
so that may not get her very far what
the European Union has also been clear
about though is that if the UK's red
lines change in terms of the red lines
it's set down in the previous
negotiations then the European Union
would be willing to look again at some
kind of alternative arrangement so there
are ways that these negotiations can be
moved forward and can be reopened in
terms of whether there is a brexit
solution that is able to be agreed by
the European Union and by
parliamentarians here in the UK that is
another question entirely the the House
of Commons here is incredibly divided on
this issue divided on the best way
forward divided on how negotiations
should be handled with Brussels so that
is the difficult bit so what about the
demand for a second referendum is there
a realistic chance for a people's vote
now there's a chance of a second EU
referendum at the moment though both of
the leaders of the main parties here in
the UK the Conservatives prime minister
to resume and the Labour Party led by
Jeremy Corbyn neither of those two
leaders want to see a second referendum
so something will have to shift
significantly for that to be on the
cards that said Parliament is starting
to flex its muscles a little trying to
use legislation moving through the House
of Commons and to change bits of it to
try and move the government in the
direction it wants to travel on brexit
so that is one potential and
here which is that Parliament moves the
government towards a second brexit
referendum but there's not necessarily a
majority in the House of Commons for a
second referendum either so it remains a
possibility but things would have to
shift significantly for us to see that
as the most likely outcome so how should
we read the results of this
no-confidence motion last night is the
threat to tourism is prime ministership
truly over now
I think the assessment of that vote of
no-confidence which to reason they
managed to win is that for now
conservative MPs are more fearful and
dislike the idea more of Jeremy Corbyn
the opposition Labour leader potentially
getting into Downing Street than they
dislike their own leader to resume now
many Conservative MPs found her brexit
deal deeply unpalatable and voted
against it in their dozens but for now
they would rather Theresa May was a
conservative Prime Minister than they
opened the door potentially to Jeremy
Corbyn getting into Downing Street so
that's where we are now that doesn't
mean that that calculation can't also
move at some point in the future and
certainly if it were to move if the
Labour Party were to smell blood here
then they will certainly bring another
no confidence motion in the government
at a time at which they think it's they
have better chances of winning it as the
looks of my election in India draws
closer political bobs are turning
personal and ugly and the center of the
latest controversy is a Congress leader
from Karnataka Mika Hari Prasad's
comment on ailing BJP chief Amit Shah
seems to have backfired shy is currently
undergoing medical treatment for swine
flu the information was tweeted from his
official account remember Karnataka has
been at the center of a political
showdown for the last one week the
turmoil began after some Congress
legislators went incommunicado the
Congress party said the BJP was trying
to poach them finally the missing MLA is
returned they vowed to not leave the
party full but just as this controversy
was drying down Congress leader BK Howie
Prasad landed his party in a soup he
rigged up the illness of BJP president
Amit Shah and said that mr. Shah had
contracted swine flu because he tried to
deist
the irresponsible comment by the leader
forced the Congress party to go into
damage control mode state units of the
party wished mr. Shah a speedy recovery
on their social media handles in India
politicians health is rarely discussed
in public former Congress chief Sonia
Gandhi's illness was kept under wraps
the only details that were made public
were about her undergoing a medical
procedure outside India reporting on
former prime minister atal bihari
vajpayee unless created a serious
political storm in the early 2000s by
some leaders like former defense
minister Manohar Parrikar and External
Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj have been
candid about it there is largely a
culture of silence around the health of
leaders in India unlike the West where
the health of public figures is part of
the political discourse Hillary Clinton
remember had to release a statement
saying that she was in good health after
she fainted at a 9/11 memorial service
in 2016 American president Donald Trump
also released a letter on his health a
few months after taking office the
credibility of the letter was widely

be run by proxies and leaders must show

we're news from the UK now and the
British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn
has scold he resumes cross-party talks
as a stunt and has asked me to take to
take an Odile brexit off the table
Theresa May has invited opposition
leaders to join talks on how to break
the brexit deadlock but Jeremy Corbyn
has refused to hold discussions unless
she rules out the prospect of Britain
leaving the European Union without
negotiating a deal but the starting
point for any talks about brexit must be
that the threat of a disastrous no deal
outcome is ruled out take it off the
table and we can talk about the future
of the plans that we will put forward
and the future relationship with Europe
but take no deal off the table now
please Prime Minister speaking at the
event in well hustings a German Corbin
has once again called for a fresh for
general election after Mays close shave
through the no confidence vote in
Parliament last night the opposition
leader further said that he will keep
tabling the no confidence vote in the
parliament if the Prime Minister doesn't
take her job seriously we believe that
the best outcome for this crisis for the
country as a whole remains calling a
general election to break the deadlock
and find a solution that works for the
whole country
and that is why I tabled a motion of
no-confidence last night and I thank all
those colleagues that supported the
motion of no-confidence last night and
we will come back on it again if
necessary because we're determined to
deal with the issues facing this country
and also give the people a choice of who
their MPs should be and who their
government should be whether they have
one that stands up for them or one that
shows the degree of incompetence that
this government has shown so if Teresa
may fail to secure a deal the UK could
face a disorderly no deal Breck said a
delay to brexit or even another
referendum on membership the clock is
ticking now for the UK would less than
two months remaining to go for the 29
march deadline by when UK has to
withdraw from the European Union
this is UK's deepest political crisis in
almost half a century UK has been part
of the European Union since 1973 when
Mandy Clarke is now joining us live from
London for the very latest on this and
Mandy well Jeremy Corbyn has already
said that he is not open to holding any
talks Oteri's for me unless he she
clarifies about a No Deal brexit whether
that's off the table or not but the
clock certainly is ticking for Britain
here
yeah and trees made what she has to do
is make sure that she does get all the
parties to tell them what they want in
the deal because she really can't go
back to Europe and say I think this will
pass through Parliament she has to have
confidence that whatever the
Conservatives want whatever the Labour's
wants the DUP all those have taken into
consideration she says if we could get
this through
then European Union's negotiate it she
has to come up with a deal that she
knows the capacitor Parliament the
European Union will not be interested in
meeting with her if she doesn't have the
concept concession of the house if the
house Parliament don't agree with her
they don't want to go back to another
boat that will be rejected again so
really she does need Jeremy Corbyn to
come to the table and that means she'll
probably have to pull that No Deal
option

Teresa may have suffered the most
humiliating parliamentary defeat in
modern history last night her brexit
plan was defeated by a margin of more
than 200 votes but before the British
prime minister could recover from that
and now the day of turmoil lies ahead of
her she is due to face a no-confidence
vote in a few hours from now
let's tell you more about the brexit
vote first
last night the British Parliament after
a heated debate that lasted five days
but Teresa Mays Gregg's a deal to vote
the main government lost it
by a crushing margin 432 MPs voted
against mais regs a deal only 202 MPs
were in favour of it this phenomenal
defeat was worse than the worst
estimates what could be called an insult
to injury a large chunk of Teresa means
own party MPs voted against her deal
soon after the result the opposition
called for a vote of no-confidence
against the government I therefore mr.
speaker inform you I have now tabled a
motion of no confidence
and I'm pleased I'm pleased that motion
will be debated tomorrow so this house
can give its verdict on the sheer
incompetence of this government that
motion of no confidence in the
government you know the clock is ticking
for the United Kingdom if Theresa May
survives this no confidence vote she has
three days to present her brexit plan B
Britain is scheduled to leave the
European Union on the 29th of March this
year if there is no deal by then that is
the 29th of March it will trigger a
complete and abrupt breakup of the UK
with the European Union it's a no deal
brexit there this situation could create
chaos at British ports and borders there
could be a shortage of certain food
items and medicines if there is no deal
it could kick up a recession in the
Great Britain moving forward Prime
Minister Theresa May has promised to
hold a dialogue with senior lawmakers
from all sides but she is also told
Parliament that MPs must keep their
expectations realistic the opposition
led by Labour Party leaders is calling
for fresh elections ahead of the no
confidence vote Labour leader Jeremy
Corbyn grilled the Prime Minister on a
track record and brings it essentially
calling the Conservatives incompetent
this government has failed our country
it cannot govern cannot command the
support of most people facing the most
important issue at the moment which is
brexit they failed again and lost a vote
last night isn't it the case mr. speaker
that with every other previous Prime
Minister faced with a scalar
defeat last night they would have
resigned and the country would be able
to choose the government that they want
ahead of the vote Prime Minister Theresa
May defended her government with
confidence but clouds of uncertainty
still remain over Westminster no one
seems to have an idea or which way
dregg's that is going I believe that if
we fail to deliver on what the British
people instructed us to do in the vote
of the referendum but the views of the
British people of this house of
parliament and of politicians will be at
an all-time low because they will have
lost they will have lost faith in
politicians across the whole beyond
correspondent Jack Patrick joins us from
Brussels
good evening Jack in less than 24 hours
the second big vote for Theresa May how
are the odds tagged for her well
actually the odds are stacked him in her
favor that vote will happen probably in
about three or four hours from now and
it looks like her Conservative Party
members are not going to revolt against
her they want to continue in a
Conservative government and not launch
fresh elections that the Labour
opposition could potentially win and her
the the party the DUP party of Northern
Ireland that props up her government
because they only won a small majority
majority minority would have a damaged
minority government government otherwise
they have said that they will vote in
favor of the government they want to
remain in power as well because it's
unlikely they're going to have the ear
of any other party if they do take
government so really this is now being
seen as a sort of process we all expect
to resume to win this vote of
no-confidence Jeremy Corbyn did have to
call it after she got such a hammering
in the vote against her brexit deal
yesterday but now we'll have to see what
Theresa Mae's plan is once she does as
we expect win that vote what will she
come back to the table with how will she
want to proceed the European Union
indeed the entire world is watching
these developments how does the EU
assess what's happening in London
well they've all said now that it's down
to the United Kingdom to come back and
say exactly what it wants they've said
that the deal that was on the table is
the only deal possible to avoid a
disorderly brexit on March the 29th and
many of them have now been saying that
it's really down to the UK to come back
to the table to clarify exactly what it
wants in these future negotiations we
have heard for instance from the German
Chancellor Angela Merkel she says she
believes there could be a little bit
more time for renegotiation that he used
chief brexit negotiates and he gave a
little bit of wiggle room saying that
there could be some sort of fresh look
at what the future relationship between
the UK and the European Union could look
like but only if the United Kingdom were
to reassess its own red lines so there's
a lot of interest in what's going to
happen at the moment but really they're
saying that the ball is in the UK court
absolutely we have to see how this plays
out thanks very much for joining us
Jack this is of course a developing
story the vote will be later tonight
this was a miserable loss for Teresa May
what happened yesterday but at the same
time the brexit vote was a historic one
the Great Britain that once pitched
itself as the shining example of
democracy is deeply divided Teresa may
could survive this no confidence vote in
Parliament but she's powerless as Prime
Minister the lack of clarity on greg's
it is now embarrassing Britain
history has been scripted several times
in the British House of Commons and on
Tuesday another vote found its place in
the history books the eyes to the right
202 the nose to the left
432 but that was a moment the British
prime minister would like to forget
so the noes have it the noes have it the
cries of celebrations from the MPs who
are forced to resumes deals describes
the shattering defeat the British prime
minister faced a whopping four hundred
and thirty two MPs rejected the brexit
deal only two hundred and two MPs backed
it this is the biggest parliamentary
defeat for a British government in 95
years
point of order the Prime Minister thank
you mr. speaker mr. speaker the house
has spoken and the government will
listen it is clear that the house does
not support this deal but tonight's vote
tells us nothing about what it does
support the reactions were mixed
while some celebrated the rejection of
the brexit deal others were dismayed by
the political bickering
and the brexit impasse is testing the
patience of British citizens European
leaders to are concerned
French president Emmanuel macron who was
trying to simmer the anger of yellow
vest protesters in Normandy paused his
great debate to respond

British people - Darwin turned
GP the overseer does guest on armed
thus British winter house team up come
some also chose battalions and a saga at
i tought we globe noses yet and their
politicians is saudi premier minister on
Teresa mais options are running out and
it doesn't seem like the deeply divided
British Parliament will play ball so
even though Teresa may is still in
control of the government
she has definitely lost it when it comes
to brexit Bureau report
we on worldís once the impossible bridge
that has given hope to those who are
demanding a second referendum the clamor
is growing for a people's vote to
determine the fate of brexit
while the idea is gaining momentum a
second referendum could prove to be
another nightmare for the British
authorities before the historic brexit
vote in the British Parliament
activists raising a demand for people's
vote on the Greg's a deal pulled off an
eye-catching stunt a model dressed up as
Theresa May was seen on top of HMS
Briggs it that was heading towards an
iceberg the activists who pulled this
off claim that a people's vote of the
only life ring out of the brexit mess
Sarita may is sailing the HMS brexit
straight at an iceberg it's clear that
brexit is a sinking ship and she has a
life ring there which is a people's vote
a public vote to go back see what the
public want to do and then get on and do
it Theresa Meers lost in the British
Parliament has given fresh energy to
those who campaign to remain in the
European Union supporters of a second
referendum celebrated outside the
British Parliament after the prime
minister suffered a humiliating defeat
this is a resounding victory we're very
glad that they because here was fated
down and personally I would have
preferred the parliaments have taken
back control and if rivera 30 or 50 I'm
very happy this is a first step we need
to have a people's face it needs to be a
choice for the balance between remain
remain in the EU and Teresa Mays deal
the political impasse over brexit is
making several British citizens angry
the demand for a second referendum has
found the backing of several lawmakers
the most prominent of them all is
Scotland's First Minister Nicola
Sturgeon first of all I believe there is
a time to stop the article 50 clock to
take away any risk of the you keep
crashing out of the EU without a deal on
the 29th of March and secondly
legislation should be brought forward to
take this issue back to the electorate
Parliament has had two and a half years
and the government and Parliament has
failed to deliver a coherent workable
brakes a deal it's time to put this back
to the people in another referendum but
amid the chaos there are some genuine
concerns over the idea for people's vote
there's a feeling that such a move could
lead to public anger that may very well
spread onto the streets of Great Britain
so far the Prime Minister has been
adamantly opposed to another referendum
but as Britain's drags at nightmare
continues refusing to pay heed to this
demand may prove to be a costly mistake
Bureau report beyond world is one a
giant mess that is perhaps the best way
to describe the political bickering over
brexit former Prime Minister of Britain
David Cameron the man who called the
break that referendum was perhaps
confident of securing another win he was
hoping for a positive result of the
Scottish referendum he lost the vote by
a razor-thin margin in hindsight he
should have just bargained politically
and not taken such a complex issue to
the people a similar story is playing
out in Macedonia last week the
Parliament passed a constitutional
amendment to change the country's name
to the Republic of Macedonia the
Republic of North Macedonia and let me
give you a brief background before I
move forward this issue dates back to
1991 the present-day Macedonia and
northern Greece were earlier part of a
Roman province called Macedonia a
separate state of Macedonia was formed
in 1991 Greece objected to its name
there were diplomatic spats Greece
blocked Macedonia
entry into NATO and the European Union
in June last year these two countries
secured an agreement there was a
referendum but the deal is stuck in the
Greek parliament now what does this tell
you as the brexit drama unfolds
governments across the world are
learning an important lesson referendums
reduce complex issues and problems -
binary choices yes or no they allow
populist to get a platform to launch
into fear-mongering and water has
perhaps get a chance to punish a
government for something else altogether
India is preparing for the general
election and let's bring you the very
latest from India's political pulse on
India's political pulse the political
drama in the South Indian state of
Karnataka seems to be slowly fizzling
out - of the Congress lawmakers in
Karnataka missing since the weekend have
returned to the state both denied that
they had struck a deal with the party
agent at the party with reports of
poaching attempts are still doing the
rounds a senior leader of the Congress
party in the state claimed that he was
aware of what transpired in Mumbai and
how much money they were offered even
Chief Minister HT kumara Swamy said that
all the dissent dissident emily's were
constantly in touch with him but he says
he's confident that his government will
not be shaken
my number is actually sufficient number
is there with me
whoa operate with the Congress has even
called for a legislature meet on Friday
and claims that all its lawmakers will
turn up the party has claimed that the
BJP was attempting to destabilize the
alliance government and capture power
through what it calls Operation Lotus
remember this was the term coined in
2008 operation Lotus when the BJP
engineered defections of opposition
legislators to ensure that its
government headed by mr. Europe I remain
stable but the BJP has levelled the
counter allegation now the party claims
that Kumaraswamy is Jennifer Dal secular
is trying to poach its lawmakers it has
even ferried all hundred and four of its
lawmakers to a luxury resort in Gurgaon
near New Delhi the official reason was
that the party was preparing these
leaders for the coming national election
so as this coalition in one South Indian
state was feeling the heat the outlines
of another possible coalition were
taking shape in another state Telangana
Rashtra samithy chief k chandrashekar
rao reached out to on the pradesh advise

well in other news now and after
suffering a humiliating United Kingdom
Prime Minister tourism may face a heated
defeat as Parliament debates a
no-confidence motion against her now an
embattled mean who is facing hostilities
from both the opposition and her own
party defended her breaks a deal which
had been rejected by the Parliament May
said that a No Deal would mean
disrespecting people's mandate on the
brexit deal listening but he cannot
ignore the fact that in the 2016
referendum that in 2016 referendum the
people of this country voted to leave
the European Union and I believe that it
is a duty not just of government but of
Parliament to ensure that we deliver on
that we will be we will be speaking to
parliamentarians in my own party the DUP
across the house about finding a way
that secures the support of the house
for the way forward but I say to the
Honorable gentlemen once again a vote
was taken in 2016 and I believe it is
incumbent on this Parliament to deliver
on that vote the leader of the
Opposition Joby Corwin head out at me
saying that she should provide an
alternative to a No Deal instead of
being in denial mode this government has
failed our country it cannot govern
cannot command the support of most
people facing the most important issue
at the moment which is brexit they
failed again and lost a vote last night
isn't it the case mr. speaker that with
every other previous Prime Minister
faced with a scale of defeat last night
they would have resigned and the country
would be able to choose the government
that they want
well the House of Commons warded 400 to
30 30 to 432 to 202 against the divorce
deal with less than two months to go for
the March 29 deadline which is for
Britain to withdraw from the European
Union the United Kingdom is now facing
its deepest political crisis in almost
half a century the country is now has to
figure out how or even whether it should
exit the European Union in the first
place Britain has been part of the
European Union since 1973
the house has spoken and the government
will listen it is clear that the house
does not support this deal but tonight's
vote tells us nothing about what it does
support nothing about how nothing about
how or even if it intends to honor the
decision the British people took in a
referendum Parliament decided to hold
and people particularly EU citizens
who've made their home here and UK
citizens living in the EU deserve
clarity on these questions as soon
and well it is the worst parliamentary
defeat for a sitting government in 95
years
Mia's choices are limited due to the due
to the fact that she is facing her
conservative party that does not have a
majority in parliament and also because
she has been facing opposition from
within her own party possible scenarios
for the UK include an attempted but
probably don't renegotiation with the
European Union
other options include extending the
article 50 process the no-confidence
motion might trigger a general election
and if there is some male loses the war
it might result in the collapse of the
Conservative government it may bring in
a new prime minister meanwhile the
remain protesters are also demanding a
second brexit referendum and while the
brexit crisis has also brought brought
United Kingdom back to square one now
British shores are feeling the only that
only a second referendum of the river or
reversal of the brexit could Salvage
them from the continuing uncertainty
that Britain is facing I think yeah
second referendum definitely I think
that's the way to do it people should
decide in 2016 we didn't know about all
those problems and now we are aware of
this so we should make another final
decision as to stay or leave I attending
a general election would be a very good
idea for us at the moment but I also
don't think that we can continue
as we currently are with with no real
alternatives and so probably the best
thing to do is throw everything away and
start again so say I hope that the
reason I'm a carries on in her position
I think she's the person to sort it out
it's all very well criticizing her but I
think um who would do better
I don't think Jeremy Corbyn would do for
certain and Manny Clarke a bureau chief
is joining us now from London for the
very latest on that heated exchange in
Parliament once again Mandy well another
day but the same story and now I mean
people on the streets are basically
saying we're fed up of this uncertainity
come up with a solution whatever it is
yes certainly the public does want a
solution but the public is still spit
lit on both sides so you hear those
remainders who want that second
referendum now the reason the thinking
is that they believe that convinced
enough people to change their mind and a
new referendum would mean that people
would vote to remain in the European
Union now that doesn't really jive with
the polls the latest polls show that if
you could vote again people would
probably vote the same way so that might
not be the solution that the remainders
are hoping for and the brexit ears on
the other hand us don't care if there is
a No Deal situation that's the one where
it's gonna really damage Britain's
economy if they can't find a deal before
that deadline they just want to leave
the European Union so both want a
certainty but they just want very
different outcomes right and in fact
Mandy today in Parliament Jeremy Corbyn
said that any other leader in Terry some
exposition would has stepped down so far
the fact that her own party members have
also backed you know what happened
yesterday the motion moved by the Labour
Party the fact is that she doesn't have
support of her own concern conservative
lawmakers is reason enough for her to
step down let somebody else make the
decisions now well that's certainly
jeremy corbyn's point of view and it's
true in normal circumstances any other
prime minister with stepped home but
this is not normal circumstances he we
are gonna see that no confidence vote is
her party truly didn't back her then she
would lose that new confidence though
but it seems that her party certainly
backs her as a leader as at the minute
to get brexit through but they didn't
back her deal and that's why they voted
her down when it comes to this no
confidence vote which is happening later
today Labour's is certainly going to
vote no confidence but the Conservative
Party by and large are gonna back her
and so will the DUP so in all likelihood
she will win that vote there won't
likely be any more fresh elections but
the path forward for brexit is still
very unclear because she needs a deal
rather than the No Deal scenario which
is the one that everyone's worried about
right so Mandy via quickly then she will
win the no confidence ward but she
hasn't won the fact that this brexit
deal is okay with either side of either
side the opposition or the government so
in that scenario what is the possibility
for her going forward because she has
not been able to bring together any
consensus on this and the European Union
has clearly come up with certain red
lines that Britain cannot really cross
when it comes to the brexit deal and
that's her biggest problems she
certainly knows what the Parliament
doesn't want they didn't want her deal
they hated the backstop they made that
abundantly clear last night but they
haven't explained what deal they would
agree and she'll need cross-party
support she'll need labor to say a what
what deal would suit them she needs her
own conservative party to say what deal
would suit them so she can go to the
European Union and say this if I could
get guarantee X Y & Z in a deal then I
can get it passed through Parliament
right now the difficulty she faces she
could renegotiate another deal but could
still be passed through Parliament if it
isn't clear and if she doesn't have that
cross-party support of exactly what they
want in that deal so she's a very
difficult road to have to try and get
another deal the only other two options
is delay brexit which she is loathe to
do she said over 70 times in Parliament
that she will not delay it or it's the
No Deal scenario where they crash out of
the EU without a deal and that will
damage Britain's economy enormous Lee
absolutely Mandy thanks very much indeed
for joining us for the latest updates
there now of course a whole host of
leaders have also reacted to the
historic defeat beginning with the man
who started it all well David Cameron
the former UK Prime Minister held the
referendum that began the brexit process
he resigned soon after the UK voted to
leave the European Union and today samay
inherited the brexit a burden now
Cameron says he is hopeful that Taysom a
will survive the no confidence port
tonight
she wins over tonight I'm sure she will
as I said I hope then that Parliament
can come together and find an
alternative partnership agreement with
the European Union that's the right way
forward that's what her deal was about
last night and she has my support as she
does this she's calling the referendum I
did regret calling the referendum it was
a promise I made two years before the
last General the 2015 general election
it was included in the manifesto it was
legislated for in Parliament I think six
out of seven members of parliament of
all parties voted for that referendum
obviously I regret that we lost that
referendum I deeply regret that I was
leaving the campaign to stay in the
European Union and obviously I regret
the difficulties and the problems that
we've been having trying to implement
the result of that referendum but I
don't think it's going to be helped by
me giving a running commentary I support
the Prime Minister I support her aim to
have a partnership deal with Europe
that's what needs to be put in place
that's what part of it needs to try and
deliver now she has my support as she
tries to do that and the Scottish First
Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that
Theresa May should suspend the brexit
process the Scottish leader said that
Theresa May must hold a second
referendum and the president of the
European Council Donald Tusk tweeted and
I quote if a deal is impossible and no
one wants No Deal then who will finally
have the courage to say that the only
positive solution is on court so that of
course is Donald Tusk there speaking
about what he thinks should be the
positive solution here and well the
chief brexit negotiator of the European
Union - echoed the stand and Michael
banya said that the block is determined
to reach a deal but tourism a must make
her intentions clear
now it's time for the UK to tell us the
next steps and on our side we will
remain united and determined to reach
the French president Amanda macaw said
that Britain would be the first loser if
it left the European Union without a
deal macaws said that he expects Britain
to eventually ask for more time to
renegotiate the deal he would have come
on fairy shows premiere option even
though the New Deal is a Perico the

Ian ubertino slipped we have north side
c4 Hanlon about Parvati niet soft us
possibility should premier minister for
no fortunate and well let's also take a
quick look at how the British media has
reacted to the war some papers have made
blistering attacks on the Prime Minister
like calling the Prime Minister dodo
while others have been kind of now the
front page
the Sun carries a carton of the British
prime minister is a man being portrayed
as a todo it comes with the headline
that reads bricks extinct and the Daily
Mirror a headline was restrained
saying no deal no hope no clue no
confidence it also reports how Joey
Corbin is now eyeing 10 Downing Street
with a no-confidence motion
so that you have the Daily Mirror
they're saying no deal no hope no clue
and no confidence and well the Daily
Mail likened tourism is fight for the
brakes deal to fight for her life and my
colleague Mandy clock has won
it has really divided you know it's
divided the newspapers and newspapers
here are split left and right it's
divided the country and the newspapers
really run along those lines we're
seeing that reaction of the Sun which is
a tabloid paper with an T brexit they
have called her deal dead as a dodo
no no if you can see that there but
they've made Theresa May in the shape of
a dodo bird that's obviously that's how
they deal
then there's the Daily Mail which is
very Pro brexit they and they had
supported Theresa May steel they they
are carrying the story but they it's
fighting for her life they really see
this as the the end times for Theresa
May she has to pull out a miracle if she
wants to continue her political career
and save her exit then in the more kind
of grown-up broadsheets we're seeing the
Delhi Daily Telegraph which is an a
conservative art paper that supports it
they are really but they are very
progressive and they're they call it a
complete humiliation and finally The
Times which is probably the most
balanced they have the jubilant crowds
after the the vote so it's it's a mixed
spread how the papers are reacting but
really it's the only story that's
happening today in the UK I'm pretty
whistling at the blistering attacks
there aren't a semi so what next for the
United Kingdom and what will be the next
move for tourism me well that's our next
report
all eyes are now on today's
no-confidence motion if Mae survives the
no-confidence motion then she will
present Parliament with a modified
brexit plan on Monday however there is
no guarantee that Parliament will accept
any new deal from me if a new version of
the deal too is rejected then Britain
will be up for a No Deal brexit
now if Mae loses the no-confidence
motion then she will have to quit and
pay way to the formation of an
alternative government in case there is
no clear alternative government then the
speaker would have to see whether any
side can win a no-confidence watch
within 14 days if a side manages to
prove its majority then it will perhaps
continue with brexit with some changes
to the deal if no government is able to
prove its majority within 14 days then
Britain will head to general elections

and Prime Minister Theresa May who has
suffered a humiliating defeat as a proxy
deal was overwhelmingly rejected by the

voted four hundred and thirty two versus
two hundred and two against the devil
Steele with less than two months to go
for 29 March which is the deadline for
Britain to withdraw from the EU the
United Kingdom is now facing its deepest
political crisis in almost half a
century the country now has to figure
out how or even whether it should exit
the European Union in the first case
Britain has been apart of the EU since
1973 May's crushing loss marks the
collapse of a two-year strategy of
trying to forge an amicable divorce by
trying to stay as close to the eel as
possible after their exit the House has
spoken and the government will listen it
is clear that the House does not support

nothing about what it does support
nothing about how
nothing about how or even if it intends

citizens who've made their home here and
UK citizens living in the EU deserve
clarity on these questions as soon in
fact it is the worst parliamentary
defeat for a sitting government in 95

deal Theresa May will now try to secure
her position as Britain's Prime Minister
the government faces a no-confidence
water in 24 hours the no-confidence
motion will be debated throughout the
day in the water will take place at 7:00
in the evening local time Wednesday the
results of tonight's vote is the
greatest defeat for a government since
the 1920s in this house this is a
catastrophic defeat for this government
after two years of failed negotiations
the House of Commons has delivered its
verdict on her brexit deal and that
verdict is absolutely decisive moving
ahead Mia's choices are limited due to
the fact that her Conservative Party
does not have a majority in parliament
possible scenarios for the UK include an
attempted but probably do a
renegotiation with the EU by May other
options include extending the article 50
process the no-confidence motion might
trigger a general election and if
Theresa May loses the vote it might
result in the collapse of the
Conservative government and may bring in
a new prime minister meanwhile the
remain protesters are also demanding a
second EU referendum a to add more
perspective to this news story I'm
joined in by our London bureau chief
Mandy Clarke Mandy a very good afternoon
to you how do you view this entire
scenario at the moment you know there's
lots that actually Theresa May has to
actually secure her position because we
all know that today the no-confidence
motion will be parcel what are the
challenges do you actually see ahead for
charissa me well there's one person I
wouldn't want to be is Teresa may she
has so much to battle forward of course
she has this no confidence motion over
all the belief is that she will likely
win it because the Conservatives that
still do have the majority don't want to
see her go she's already faced no
confidence both by her own party
remember in December they said they'll
back her the DUP that is that Northern
Irish party said they'll back the
government so in all likelihood not much
is going to come out to likely win this
no confidence vote but after she if she
if she does win it she still has go back
to Brussels trying to renegotiate a deal
that will please the house and the
biggest issue is that the house of
parliament certainly made it clear what
they don't want but they haven't made it
clear what they will accept and that is
the most difficult thing she will face
because she has to be very clear with
the EU exactly what will pass in the
government they don't really want to go
back to negotiating the table hammer out
a deal and for it to fail again so
really there it's gonna require kind of
cross priority talk the fair out what
weight board Monday the European Council
chief Donald Tusk has said that the
brexit deal at the moment seems highly
impossible do you think the government
could actually be a second time lucky
and what do you see
for Plan B that is the million-dollar
question what is Plan B she made it very
clear there was no other plan B but now
she's gonna have to somehow pull out a
plan B there's a remainders on one side
who desperately just want no grasses
that that there is no solution no deals
can be bad for everyone they want no
brexit of course the brexit ears on the
other side they do believe that a No
Deal is not the end of the world they
just want out of the EU so that's what
the two opposing sides
she needs a third way that will
encourage business and stability for the
country because a new deal brexit will
likely really hurt the country
economically and just looking at the
front pages of the newspaper today it's
really
split on on the wakeboard yeah I have a
son Mandy that also brings me to this
question that it's been a historic
Commons defeat how has the UK media
actually reacted I wanted to come to
that and it's interesting that you just
mentioned it yes well it has really
divided you know it's divided the
newspapers and newspapers here are split
left and right it's divided the country
and the newspapers really run along
those lines we're seeing that reaction
of the Sun which is a tabloid paper with
an T brexit they have called her deal
dead as a dodo no know if you can see
that there but they've made Theresa May
in the shape of a dodo bird that's
obviously thanks to that's how they deal
then there's the Daily Mail which is
very Pro brexit they and they had
supported Theresa Mays deal they they
are carrying the story but there's
planning for her life they really see
this as the the end times for Teresa may
she has to pull out a miracle if she
wants to continue her political career
and save brexit then in the more kind of
grown-up broadsheets we're seeing the
daily Daily Telegraph which is and I'm
conservative art paper that supports it
they are really but they are very
progressive and they're they call it a
complete humiliation and finally The
Times which is probably the most
balanced they have the jubilant crowds
after the the vote so it's it's a mixed
spread how the papers are reacting but
really it's the only story that's
happening today in the UK it certainly
was a mixed fried as you rightly
mentioned and you can clearly see how
divisive the opinions not only in the
media are but with people also do you
think that a second referendum is a
possibility I think it's a possibility
but is it gonna do what the people want
so the people who are really calling for
what they're calling the people's vote
those are remainders they believe
they've made enough argument they've
proved enough that brexit is not good
enough and they believe a second
referendum will lead for a decision to
remain
and the European Union but the polls
tell a different story
it shows that people's opinion really
hasn't changed the much the people who
voted brexit have almost more entrenched
in their views that brexit is the weight
board the people that voted remain are
the same way so even if it goes to a
second referendum there's no guarantee
that it will change the results that's a
interesting point but you made but even
if a second referendum was to go forward
if there's no guarantee that you know
people would actually be changing the
opinion thank you so much for bringing
the current perspective in the UK for
now

for the Prime Minister of the United
Kingdom to resume the British Parliament
is set to vote on her break the deal in
a few hours from now the debate over
resumes deal is under way in the
parliament the debate is expected to
last for at least six more hours before
the deal is put to vote the deal faces
opposition not only from resumes
political rivals but even from within
her own party differing voices are
emerging from within the government with
some members of the Conservative Party
backing their leaders deal while others
are opposed to the idea still heading to

defeated will the Prime Minister
resigned
I certainly hope not no she's the right
prime minister and I hope the deal gets
through that's the most important thing
today
are you worried we're heading for no
deal yes I am against no deal I am for
the Prime Minister and I'm for the
withdrawal agreement today and as the
Daily Mail editorial said today we need
to put our country first I think the
Prime Minister will make her case this
evening to all my colleagues with force
and eloquence and I think there's no
question of the Prime Minister resigning
the parliamentary party voted that they
had confidence in her last year I
believe the Prime Minister is doing the
right thing
I believe she should continue to lead
the party in the car I would be very
engaged withdrawal agreement because it
keeps us potentially in a customs union
without an end date divides up the
United Kingdom between Northern Ireland
and Great Britain and pays 39 billion
for nothing in return
people voted to leave they didn't pay
for Deal they voted to leave and this
deal doesn't actually make us leave
cleanly early the opposition had warned
Theresa May of a general election if her
Dean is rejected by the legislature in a
heated debate leader of the opposition
and Labour Party lawmaker Jeremy Corbyn
accused Theresa May of making efforts
worth nothing to work with lawmakers
Corbin also said that the brexit
deadlock was leading the country towards
a snap election
now it all began way back in May 2015
when British voters elected a major
Conservative government David Cameron
was to be sworn in as Prime Minister
said in his victory speech that there
will be an in or out referendum on
European Union membership less than a
year later in February 2016 Cameron
announced that he has negotiated a deal
with the leaders of the European Union a
deal which will give written a
quote-unquote special status it
confirmed that he will campaign for
Britain to remain in the 28-nation bloc
along with that the referendum date was
set for the month of June on the 23rd of
June 2016 the United Kingdom voted on
the bread soup referendum Britain voted
52 percentage to 48 percentage to leave
the European Union the very next day
David Cameron said that he will resign
in the light of the results because
Britain needs a quote unquote fresh
leadership to take the country in a new
direction
three weeks later following a
Conservative Party leadership contest
Home Secretary Theresa May took charge
as Prime Minister she inherited the
burden of drags it along with the
responsibility to leave the country and
it's the only thing that matters when it
comes to her retaining power and now we
have the Mandy Clarke or London bureau
chief joining us live and the author
beyond correspondent Kevin O's Beck
joining us live from Brussels sir thank
you both of you for taking time out I'm
going to quickly begin with Mandy Mandy
talk to us we are in the middle of the
debate six hours later there will be a
vote yeah absolutely
Theresa May is still plugging her deal
she really wants to come through but for
all intents and purposes this looks like
this deal will not go through Parliament
she simply does not have support a
number of MPs around 100 Conservative
MPs have said they will not back it
we know that the DUP the Northern Irish
political party that she needs to
backward yields again through said they
are not supporting
so unless they all change their mind at
the last minute it looks like her deal
is likely not to get passed through
Parliament then she has to come back
with a solution that isn't no deal
because that's certainly not where the
parliamentarians want to go but we will
have to see if if people change their
mind and suddenly decide that her deal
is the right deal oh well what deal is
the right deal that's a big question
isn't it 99 you stay with us well that's
quickly now take us across to Kevin who
joins us live from Brussels sir Kevin
the European Union is pretty much told
to résumé that we cannot do anything
more how are they viewing these
developments in London at this point in
time well everyone here is just waiting
to see what the results of that vote are
going to be tonight is Theresa may going
to lose by just a few votes or will this
be a pretty resounding a pretty tough a
pretty huge loss for her because I think
that's going to then depend what her
plan B is going to be now assuming that
everyone is right here that she's going
to lose tonight the EU just got to sit
back and wait to see what the Prime
Minister's next move is going to be UK
media is reporting that she is a jet on
standby she could possibly be coming to
Brussels tomorrow if she loses by just a
few votes you could potentially come
back to Brussels and say hey can you
give me a few more reassurances when it
comes to that Irish back stop but what
if it's a huge defeat for her tonight
and we see a move of no confidence from
the Labour opposition party could we
possibly then be seeing a prime minister
Jeremy Corbyn in the future and what is
that going to happen or what's going to
happen and if he then comes to Brussels
and tries to completely renegotiate that
deal so the bottom line right now is
there are a lot of unknowns a lot of
unknowns relevance Mandy how close are
we to fresh elections in the UK Jeremy
Corbyn wants it but considering the
difficulty that this deal is facing to
go through and the chances of it not
going through as high do you see a
realistic possibility of a new elections
in Britain well there's always the
possibility of course her own
Conservative Party brand a new
confidence boat and she won it
Jeremy Corbyn is a bit of a distraction
because he is Pro brexit he voted he's
always said that he would support a
brexit deal now can he get a better deal
than she can negotiate that is a big
question but for there is a contingent
in Britain that are hoping to look for
someone who'd be a remainder and just
stop brexit there and then we we don't
have that in Jeremy Corbyn he will
continue along the brexit Trek as he's
always said that he's open to a second
referendum again that is a distraction
because a lot of the voting intentions
that were shown in the polls show that
the people in Britain really haven't
changed their opinion that people who
voted to leave still support their leave
position that people are voted remain
still support the remaining session so
if referendum likely not going to send
any further down the track so in a new
election it would be difficult to see
how there could be a new election and
then for him to renegotiate a deal all
before March 29th that's nice I'm frame
right so read the decision by Corbin
with the EU the possibility it seems
that much more difficult Kevin you did
say that Theresa May has a jet on
standby and she could be in Brussels
tomorrow
in case the vote doesn't go through the
UK Parliament what would be what do you
think is tourism is a request to the EU
when she sent back by the Parliament
what we know that the reason so many MPs
oppose this brexit divorce deals because
of that Irish backstop component of it
that's the insurance policy that the EU
has engineered into the divorce deal and
has made sure that it's in that divorce
deal and a lot of the Conservative MPs
back in London are so upset over that
because they worried that could then
they would use the term trap them under
EU laws and regulations at least in
Northern Ireland to make sure that that
border between the Republic of Ireland
and Northern Ireland will say open some
of those conservative MPs have told the
Prime Minister that they want their they
want a time limit to be on that so by a
certain date like December 31st of 2021
that
backs up would have to essentially no
longer be into effect
well Brussels has said has said all
along that is not at all
how we view this that is not at all what
we are going to do with this backstop
and we will not allow that we have to
ensure that that border always stays
open to make sure peace is maintained on
the island of Ireland so what really
could Theresa may come and get come and
get from the EU that she hasn't gotten
already it doesn't look like there
really is all that much doesn't look
like there really is all that much of
the white coming in from Kevin oz Becca
joins live from Brussels thank you Kevin
for being does and of course our London
bureau chief Amanda Clarke joining us
live from London Thank You Mandy for
being with us
shifting focus away from that keep in
mind the vote comes five weeks after it
was postponed because the government had
been likely to lose so what are the
possible scenarios
starting with the least likely outcome a
miracle that could take place overnight
and scores of lawmakers might suddenly
find themselves rallying behind
primaries amazed plan the vote goes
through and the process moves on
smoothly everybody's happy well almost
if no makers reject the bill then the
default position would be a No Deal
Bretton the law is already in place
which means that the United Kingdom will
leave the European Union on the 29th of
March 2019 if lawmakers voted against
the deal a UK government could propose
to negotiate a new brexit deal and there
could be a complete renegotiation that
would take all that much more time if
that happens in the UK would have to
make a request to Lee European Union for
an extension from the March deadline
Theresa May could also opt for an early
general election if the benzidine is
rejected in order to get a political
mandate for her deal he does not have
the power to call an election but she
could ask lawmakers to vote for an early
election this course of action could
involve a request to the European Union
to extend the date of brexit and the
proposed deal is rejected the Labour
Party could call for a formal vote of
no confidence in the government resume
could herself call for a trust vote to
try to reinforce her Authority and
lastly the UK government could choose to
have another referendum and that would
require an extension of the date of
leaving the European Union as well there
would have to be a new piece of
legislation to make a referendum happen
and to determine the rules such as who
would be allowed to vote and it's at

now it's week four of the US government
shutdown and the stalemate continues
Trump has rejected a call from his own
Republican Party to temporarily reopen
government agencies I want to get it
solved then I want to just delay it I
want to get it so the only 1/4 of
federal operations have been shut down
for the last 25 days Trump is adamant on
the funding for the border war with
Mexico but the situation on the ground
is grim farmers have been hurt badly as
loans and Farm Aid have been delayed
more and more airport security screeners
are not turning up for work while
transportation security workers are
working without pay the industry that's
bearing the brunt of the shutdown the
most is aviation workers say the
shutdown has affected air travel and
safety they've sued the government last
week over frozen pay every day we are
missing workers who are discouraged to
come to work because they aren't campy
so that creates an effect where we have
to do triple the work in order to get
the job done the only comment I have is
mr. president please end this shutdown
aviation set safety matters just as much
as border security our people are
hurting and we need to get back to work
understaffed security checkpoints have
meant delays for air travelers airports
of shock terminals screening facilities
and security liens
the result is this the average waiting
time at Atlanta Airport used to be half
an hour now it's three hours the
shutdown is costing the economy to one
estimate says that the loss is pegged at
around a hundred million dollars per day
now guess who's feeling the heat of the
US shut down now while it's not other
than the White House which is at the
center of the shutdown debate in the
u.s. stuff crunch has worsened so much
that President Donald Trump was forced
to order burgers pizzas and french fries
for his guests take a look at this what
do you do when Mom and Dad are not
around to cook and you have unexpected
guests
well you order that's exactly what US
President Donald Trump did when guests
came calling at the White House and
guess what he paid for a too many many
french fries all of our favorite foods I
want to see what's here while we live
because I don't think it's gonna be much
reason we did this is because of the
shutdown we want to make sure that
everything is right so we sent out we
got this and we have some wonderful
people working at the White House they
helped us out with this
normally the White House chefs would
have served a much fancier platter in
the State Dining Room but this time the
silverware was full of great American
soul food thanks to the staff brunch at
the White House due to a powerful US
government shutdown in fact had it not
been for the great American fast food
joints Trump was all set to get the
first lady to cook up a storm in the
White House kitchen so I had a choice
do we have no food for you because we
have a shutdown or do we give you some
little quick salads that the first lady
will make along with along with the
second lady they'll make some salads and
I said you guys aren't into salads or do
I oh go out Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott
do I go out and send out for about 1,000
hamburgers so we actually did we bought
a thousand Burger King all America
companies Burger King Wendy's and
McDonald's we have Big Macs we have

to see what the results of that vote are
going to be tonight is Theresa may going
to lose by just a few votes or will this
be a pretty resounding a pretty tough a
pretty huge loss for her because I think
that's going to then depend what her
plan B is going to be now assuming that
everyone is right here that she's going
to lose tonight the EU just got to sit
back and wait to see what the Prime
Minister's next move is going to be UK
media is reporting that she is a jet on
standby she could possibly be coming to
Brussels tomorrow if she loses by just a
few votes you could potentially come
back to Brussels and say hey can you
give me a few more reassurances when it
comes to that Irish back stop but what
if it's a huge defeat for her tonight
and we see a move of no confidence from
the Labour opposition party could we
possibly then be seeing a prime minister
Jeremy Corbyn in the future and what is
that going to happen or what's going to
happen and if he then comes to Brussels
and tries to completely renegotiate that
deal so the bottom line right now is
there are a lot of unknowns a lot of
unknowns relevance Mandy how close are
we to fresh elections in the UK Jeremy
Corbyn wants it but considering the
difficulty that this deal is facing to
go through and the chances of it not
going through as high do you see a
realistic possibility of a new elections
in Britain well there's always the
possibility of course her own
Conservative Party brand a new
confidence boat and she won it
Jeremy Corbyn is a bit of a distraction
because he is Pro brexit he voted he's
always said that he would support a
brexit deal now can he get a better deal
than she can negotiate that is a big
question but for there is a contingent
in Britain that are hoping to look for
someone who'd be a remainder and just
stop brexit there and then we we don't
have that in Jeremy Corbyn he will
continue along the brexit Trek as he's
always said that he's open to a second
referendum again that is a distraction
because a lot of the voting intentions
that were shown in the polls show that
the people in Britain really haven't
changed their opinion that people who
voted to leave still support their leave
position that people are voted remain
still support the remaining session so
if referendum likely not going to send
any further down the track so in a new
election it would be difficult to see
how there could be a new election and
then for him to renegotiate a deal all
before March 29th that's nice I'm frame
right so read the decision by Corbin
with the EU the possibility it seems
that much more difficult Kevin you did
say that Theresa May has a jet on
standby and she could be in Brussels
tomorrow
in case the vote doesn't go through the
UK Parliament what would be what do you
think is tourism is a request to the EU
when she sent back by the Parliament
what we know that the reason so many MPs
oppose this brexit divorce deals because
of that Irish backstop component of it
that's the insurance policy that the EU
has engineered into the divorce deal and
has made sure that it's in that divorce
deal and a lot of the Conservative MPs
back in London are so upset over that
because they worried that could then
they would use the term trap them under
EU laws and regulations at least in
Northern Ireland to make sure that that
border between the Republic of Ireland
and Northern Ireland will say open some
of those conservative MPs have told the
Prime Minister that they want their they
want a time limit to be on that so by a
certain date like December 31st of 2021
that
backs up would have to essentially no
longer be into effect
well Brussels has said has said all
along that is not at all
how we view this that is not at all what
we are going to do with this backstop
and we will not allow that we have to
ensure that that border always stays
open to make sure peace is maintained on
the island of Ireland so what really
could Theresa may come and get come and
get from the EU that she hasn't gotten
already it doesn't look like there
really is all that much doesn't look
like there really is all that much of
the white coming in from Kevin oz Becca
joins live from Brussels thank you Kevin
for being does and of course our London
bureau chief Amanda Clarke joining us
live from London Thank You Mandy for
being with us
shifting focus away from that keep in
mind the vote comes five weeks after it
was postponed because the government had
been likely to lose so what are the
possible scenarios
starting with the least likely outcome a
miracle that could take place overnight
and scores of lawmakers might suddenly
find themselves rallying behind
primaries amazed plan the vote goes
through and the process moves on
smoothly everybody's happy well almost
if no makers reject the bill then the
default position would be a No Deal
Bretton the law is already in place
which means that the United Kingdom will
leave the European Union on the 29th of
March 2019 if lawmakers voted against
the deal a UK government could propose
to negotiate a new brexit deal and there
could be a complete renegotiation that
would take all that much more time if
that happens in the UK would have to
make a request to Lee European Union for
an extension from the March deadline
Theresa May could also opt for an early
general election if the benzidine is
rejected in order to get a political
mandate for her deal he does not have
the power to call an election but she
could ask lawmakers to vote for an early
election this course of action could
involve a request to the European Union
to extend the date of brexit and the
proposed deal is rejected the Labour
Party could call for a formal vote of
no confidence in the government resume
could herself call for a trust vote to
try to reinforce her Authority and
lastly the UK government could choose to
have another referendum and that would
require an extension of the date of
leaving the European Union as well there
would have to be a new piece of
legislation to make a referendum happen
and to determine the rules such as who
would be allowed to vote and etcetera

all right moving on it is d-day for UK
prime minister to resume the British
Parliament is set to vote on her drexy
deal in a few hours from now now the
debate over Teresa Mays deal is underway
in the parliament the debate is expected
to last for at least six more hours
before the deal is put to vote now the
deal faces opposition not only from
Teresa mais political rivals but even
from within her own party differing
voices are emerging from within the
government with some members of the
Conservative Party backing their leaders
deal but others are opposed to the idea
still heading to defeat suddenly
have-nots never if it is defeated with
the Prime Minister resign
I certainly hope not no she's the right
Prime Minister and I hope the deal gets
through that's the most important thing
today
are you worried we're heading for no
deal yes I am against no deal I am for
the Prime Minister and I'm for the
withdrawal agreement today and as the
Daily Mail editorial said today we need
to put our country first I think the
Prime Minister will make her case this
evening to all my colleagues with force
and eloquence and I think there's no
question of the point mr. resigning the
parliamentary party voted that they had
confidence in her last year I believe
the Prime Minister is doing the right
thing
I believe she should continue to lead
the party in the country I would be very
engaged withdrawal agreement because it
keeps us potentially in a customs union
without an end date divides up the
United Kingdom between Northern Ireland
and Great Britain and pays 39 billion
for nothing in return people voted to
leave they didn't vote for a deal they
voted to leave and this deal doesn't
actually make us leave cleanly on Monday
Theresa May made a last-ditch effort to
get lawmakers on her side she urged
lawmakers to back her deal saying that
rejection of brexit agreement would
amount to subversion of democracy and if
rather than leaving with no deal this
house blocked
brexit that would be of subversion of
our democracy
saying to the people we were elected to
serve that we were unwilling to do what
they had instructed so I say to members
on all sides of this house whatever you
may have previously concluded over these
next 24 hours give this deal a second
look
[Applause]
now supermarkets in the UK have started
to stockpile built and expand warehouses
amid uncertainties over the country's
departure from the European Union
British lawmakers will vote on families
to Theresa May is a brexit deal today
that there had been concerns that if the
deal is rejected there would be the
possibility of a no deal brexit it would
mean at least transport and trade
between the UK and the EU could be
severely affected businesses have been
worrying about the impact of the
uncertainties as a large proportion of
their goods depend on imports
supermarket chains such as Marks &
Spencer and Tesco have announced that
they had negotiated with some EU
suppliers on increasing imports
especially of goods that are easy to
stop but they want that more than half
the goods on the shelves are vegetables
and fruits which are perishable and
therefore cannot be stockpiled
the supermarket chains also warn
customers to be prepared for the
shortage of certain Goods if a No Deal
brexit happens but I'm moving on in a
move that the further escalate tensions
between US and Canada it Chinese got a
sentence a Canadian man to death for
smuggling drugs now after the death
sentence was awarded Canada has wanted
citizens about the risk of arbitrary
enforcement of local laws in China the
Chinese Court retried Robert Lloyd with
appeal against his original 15-year
prison sentence and decided on his
execution the court said that Lords
conspired with others in an attempt to
smuggle 222 kilograms of banned drugs
from China to Australia in
late 2014 he was arrested in December
that year the Canadian has argued in
court that he was a tourist visiting
China and was framed by criminals
meanwhile the move has angered Canada
with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
accusing China of arbitrarily using the
death penalty the court's ruling and
pseudos reaction could aggravate already
saw relations between China and Canada
following the arrest of wow they CFO
Meng Wong foo in Canada and China's
subsequent detentions of two Canadians
the government we actually strengthened
the policy that requires the Canadian
government to always intercede on behalf
of Canadian facing the death penalty
anywhere in the world we will continue
to do that as we have in this case but I
will say it is of extreme concern to us
as a government as it should be to all
our international friends and allies
that China has chosen to begin to
arbitrarily apply death penalty in cases
facing it as in this case of facing a
Canadian well Robin Lord schellenberg
was detained in 2015 and was convicted
last year for attempting to smuggle more
than 200 kilograms of methamphetamine
into Australian for that he received a
sentence of 15 years in jail and a fine
of $22,000 now he appealed against that
verdict and over the course of that
appeal prosecutors say that new evidence
emerged new evidence involving a witness
by the name of su Qing who we are told
was a Schellenberg's translatin and
details of that new evidence are
slightly unclear but the suggestion is
that schellenberg may have been involved
in a wider drug trafficking ring reports
say that there were 70 observers present
at the retrial on Monday observes
involving including rather many foreign
journalists
and we are told that the whole trial
happened very quickly in the sentencing
it took just about 20 minutes were also
told that su Ching didn't look
schellenberg in the eye at all of the
course of the proceedings and wasn't
able to recall a lot of the details of
this new evidence and had to refer to a
written statement now according to the
Chinese the new evidence justifies the
harsh sentencing under Chinese law any
appeal cannot increase any punishments
but because of new the new evidence it
is allowed to do so
but according to Schellenberg's lawyer
there was never enough evidence to
convict him in the first place since
this new evidence should never have been
admitted either another news chants of

for more negotiation well we've heard
from EU leader after EU leader that they
are not open to renegotiating the
divorce deal and this deal that they are
going to be voting on tomorrow is the
best deal that the EU could ever agree
on they've said over and over again that
there will be no deal without that
backstop but if all is said and done and
if MPs vote down this divorce deal if
there is a vote of no-confidence and
labour ends up controlling the
government and we have a prime minister
Jeremy Corbett and if he demands there
be a renegotiation would Brussels listen
maybe possibly be
because also on this side of the channel
there is not much appetite for a No Deal
present that is viewed as the worst case
scenario so push came to shove would
they eventually be opening to
renegotiating this divorce deal maybe
but the rhetoric again from Brussels is
we are not opening to renegotiating this
and right now the UK has the best deal
possible interesting times Karen thanks

the new Congress government in the state

so uncertain British lawmakers are
expected to vote on Prime Minister
Theresa Mays drags the deal tomorrow
that is Tuesday will her deal with the
European Union find takers that's a
million-dollar question the Prime
Minister will address the Parliament she
fears that the planned exit from the
European Union could be derailed
denisa me a little while ago delivered a
speech in the city of stoke-on-trent
come up with an alternative brexit deal
that is negotiable and that actually no
nobody has come up with an alternative
brexit deal that is negotiable and that
delivers on the result of the referendum
and that's what we must remember we this
is not just about negotiating a deal is
about negotiating a deal that delivers
on the result of the referendum taking
back control of money laws and borders
but also ensures that we do it in a way
that maintains jobs maintain security
protects jobs and security and protects
our union she said that it is likely
that lawmakers would block rigs at all
together she fears the chances of
bread's of being blocked are higher than
Britain leaving European Union without a
deal I'm working to ensure that we get
members of parliament voting for the
deal tomorrow I believe it is important
that we deliver on this result that we
don't see a situation where there's a
risk that Parliament tries to frustrate
brexit I think over the last few days
we've seen that risk increasing I want
to ensure that we deliver on the
referendum that we leave the European
Union and I want to do it on the basis
of a good deal that protects people's
jobs protects our security and protects
our union how will that affect Britain's
economy will it survive this legislative
shock and what happens to the
credibility of British politicians if
they fail to honor the brig's that
referendum then of course we're tracking
all of this for the moment let's take
you straight to Kevyn Orr's a back we
are correspondent joining us from
Brussels Kevin good evening and thank
you for joining us here what options
does the British prime minister Theresa
May have if she loses the vote tomorrow
which he most likely will
well that's a great question what is her
plan B going to be is she going to try
to extend article 50 and push brexit
down the road or she going to ask
Brussels if she can renegotiate this
divorce deal if she does then it's going
to be very interesting to hear what the
response will be from Brussels also
today the European Commission sent out
this letter signed by Commission
President Donald Tusk or the European
Council President Donald us I would say
and Commission President jean-claude
Juncker this letter was designed to help
give the UK more assurances and try to
convince MPs to back that divorce deal
that they are going to be voting on
tomorrow evening now in this letter the
EU says once again that when it comes to
that backstop the issue that so many MPs
really have a lot of disdain for and
while a lot of them aren't voting for
the divorce deal that you use trusses in
this letter that that is to be used as
an absolute last resort and if that
backstop ever does have to be enacted it
would just be a temporary solution it
would go away as soon as a trade deal
would be negotiated and signed and
completed is that going to convince more
MPs that are against the deal to back
this deal unlikely because not in this
letter are a lot of what those are is
what those MPs wanted and that would be
affirm and date for that backstop as
well as the ability for the UK to
unilaterally get out of that backstop
none of that is in here I've given the
opposition in the UK wants fresh
elections the Labour Party claims that
they can get a better deal is there room
for more negotiation well we've heard
from EU leader after EU leader that they
are not open to renegotiating the
divorce deal and this deal that they are
going to be voting on tomorrow is the
best deal that the EU could ever agree
on they've said over and over again that
there will be no deal without that
backstop but if all is said and done and
if MPs vote down this divorce deal if
there is a vote of no-confidence and
labour ends up controlling the
government and we have a prime minister
Jeremy Corbett and if he demands there
be a renegotiation would Brussels listen
maybe possibly be
because also on this side of the channel
there is not much appetite for a No Deal
present that is viewed as the worst case
scenario so push came to shove would
they eventually be opening to
renegotiating this divorce deal maybe
but the rhetoric again from Brussels
says we are not opening to renegotiating
this and right now the UK has the best
deal possible interesting times Karen

that song tweeted and I quote starting
the long overdue pullout from Syria
while hitting the little remaining Isis
territorial Caliphate hard and from many
directions will attack from existing
nearby base if it reforms will devastate
turkey economically if they hit Kurds
likewise do not warn the Kurds provoke
Turkey unquote the Kurds make up the
majority of the US air light fighters
operating in Syria and the war against
Syrian President Bashar al-assad's
government the turkey on the other hand
used some Kurdish troops in region as a
terrorist organization Turkey is the
United States only ally in the region
had partnered with the US and the fight
against Islamic terror group that a
Turkish president is one lashed out at
the US National Security Advisor John
Bolton last week it was said that the
Bolton has made a big mistake in
thinking that the US withdrawal was
contingent upon turkeys pledge not to
attack the Kurdish fighters and I'm
joined by Daniel a Pagani a bureau chief
from West Asia in a Montana Lee tells me
that this withdrawal what's the what's
the sense of time you're getting in
terms of vigil of the American troops
from Syria and will it really impact the
Kurdish fortune because they were at the
forefront of fighting Isis and actually
successfully resisted them in many areas
I will start by answering to your last
question so will it impact the Kurds yes
it will impact the Kurds it won't impact
their military operations since the
United States forces that will keep
carrying on airstrikes from neighboring
Iraq Iraq has a huge presence of US
troops and US Air Force therefore jet
fighters will take off from there and
bombed the Islamic state positions which
are still remaining in the desert areas
close to Syria it impacts the Kurdish
people and the Kurdish fighters said
politically of course it exposes them to
a possible offensive from Ankara Ankara
remembers consider these Kurdish forces
as terrorists that they consider them
linked to Kurdish party which has been
fighting an insurgency against the
Turkish forces so the Americans pulling
out which is going to happen in the
coming months means that there will be
an empty space where they were most
likely taken by most likely will be
taken by the Syrian government forces to
whom Kurds have requested help but isn't
that ironical Daniel II that someone's
freedom fighters is someone's terrorist
and records have Kurds find themselves
in a position where one country things
that they support terrorism whereas the
Kurds themselves were at the forefront
of fighting Isis
I need to ask you to worry reframe the
question I couldn't hear you I'm sorry
Daniel my question was that doesn't it
make the position of the Kurdish
leadership or the autonomous areas where
Kurds are difficult whereby an important
country like Turkey finds them as
terrorists so in long run how does it
impact them because ultimately they are
the neighbors Turkey not United States
of America
I think there's a I think there's a bit
of an audio problem Thank You Daniel for
joining me my colleague Daniel a Pagani
from Amman he was telling us about how
this will impact the Kurdish leadership
because after all the Kurds were the
forefront of the fighting Isis but now
Turkey has different interests and
turkey feel that a strengthened God
leadership means that the areas where
Kurds live in Turkey will also get
affected and create a demand for a new
nationality whereas they are they
attract minorities now in some parts of
Turkey

reiterate her recent pleas that resume
is expected to happen half politics will

signs of a shift in opinion that resume
had hoped for when she had postponed the
vote before Christmas the Conservative
MPs have said that a loss is inevitable

table of vote of no-confidence
if the resumes breaks a deal loses its
vote the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has
said that his party would actually vote
against the deal and will start moves to
trigger a general election if it is
voted down the adding to the downing
streets headache are a set of cross

backbench motions to in fact take
precedence over government business if

decision that any MP of this generation
would be asked to make
so this is what she has said and I
caught hear my message Department this
weekend is pretty simple it is time to
forget the games and do what is right
for our country that resume has also
said that if the MPS do not back her
breaks a deal then the United Kingdom
would in fact be the risk of leaving the
European Union with No Deal or even
worse with no brexit at all all right
now wait the brexit deal lost almost
inevitable the British media reports
claimed that the European Union is
preparing for a delay in brexit reports
indicate that Brussels thinks that it is
highly unlikely that Britain will be
able to meet its 29th of March brexit
deadline and hence it is now looking to
push the deadline to at least until July
the European Union is also expecting a
request from London to extend article 50
in the upcoming weeks the European Union
will call for a special leaders summit
the push brexit day once requested is
received by United Kingdom
if the resume survives the brexit deal
defeat and then wants to revise and
ratify the deal then the European
Union will probably give a technical
extension until July the officials have
said that in case the general election
or a second referendum is triggered then
the European Union will give the United
Kingdom a linear extension for brexit
